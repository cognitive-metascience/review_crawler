However, the contribution of triplet microtubules to mammalian centriole formation and stability is unknown. Little is known of the mechanism of triplet microtubule formation, but experiments in unicellular eukaryotes indicate that delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, two less-studied tubulin family members, are required. Here, we report that centrioles in delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin null mutant human cells lack triplet microtubules and fail to undergo centriole maturation. These aberrant centrioles are formed <italic>de novo</italic> each cell cycle, but are unstable and do not persist to the next cell cycle, leading to a futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration. Disintegration can be suppressed by paclitaxel treatment. Delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin physically interact, indicating that these tubulins act together to maintain triplet microtubules and that these are necessary for inheritance of centrioles from one cell cycle to the next.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29061.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most structures inside a cell have a short lifespan and are continually replaced. Centrioles – specialized structures that help cells divide, and send and receive signals – are among the few exceptions and can persist through many cell generations. Centrioles are cylindrical structures that are made up of protein tubes called microtubules. Specifically, nine groups of three microtubules, known as triplet microtubules, are linked together to make the walls of the cylinder. The triplets of microtubules are only found in centrioles, and until now it was not known what role this specific formation plays.</p><p>Now, Wang et al. studied two lesser known members of the protein family that build the microtubules, called delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin. When either of these proteins was removed from human cells grown in the laboratory, the centrioles only had single microtubules rather than the usual triplets. The centrioles still formed at the correct time, but disappeared soon after the cell had divided.</p><p>When the cells were then treated with a drug that stabilizes the microtubules, the centrioles no longer disappeared once the cell had divided. This suggests that the triplet microtubule formation is needed to stabilize and maintain the centrioles through the cell divisions. Moreover, the results were similar for delta- and epsilon-tubulin, and it appears that the proteins work together to help stabilize the triplet microtubules.</p><p>Defects in centrioles are associated with many diseases, including some types of cancer and many genetic conditions that can lead to heart or kidney disease, obesity, diabetes and many others. Deeper knowledge of centriole structure and its role may help us to better understand these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>tubulin</kwd><kwd>delta-tubulin</kwd><kwd>epsilon-tubulin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 F32 GM117678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jennifer T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name><name><surname>Loncarek</surname><given-names>Jadranka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM052022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deletion of delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin in human cells results in loss of centriolar triplet microtubules and defects in centriole structure and inheritance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major microtubule organizing center of mammalian cells, the centrosome, is composed of a pair of centrioles with associated appendages and pericentriolar material. The centrioles have a nine-fold symmetry and are formed, in part, of long-lived microtubules, which persist through multiple cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kochanski and Borisy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balestra et al., 2015</xref>). In most organisms, including humans, the centriolar microtubules have a triplet structure, found only in centrioles. This structure consists of a complete A-tubule and associated partial B-tubule attached to the A-tubule wall, and a partial C-tubule attached to the B-tubule wall.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms involved in making triplet microtubules are not well-understood, even in the well-characterized somatic centriole cycle of mammalian cells. In these cells centrioles duplicate once per cycle, such that daughter cells receive exactly one pair of centrioles. Centriole duplication is initiated at the G1-S transition when the kinase PLK4 localizes to a single focus on the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, the cartwheel, formed by SASS6 oligomerization, assembles to template the 9-fold symmetry of the newly-formed procentriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guichard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilbert et al., 2016</xref>). Microtubules are added to the cartwheel underneath a cap of CP110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>). By G2-M, the triplet microtubules are completely formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vorobjev and Chentsov YuS, 1982</xref>). Subsequently, the A- and B-tubules elongate to the full ~500 nm length of the centriole, forming a distal compartment with doublet microtubules and marked by POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>). In mitosis, the cartwheel is lost, and the newly-formed centriole becomes disengaged from its mother and acquires pericentriolar material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vorobjev and Chentsov YuS, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsou and Stearns, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsou et al., 2009</xref>). In G2-M of the following cell cycle, the centriole acquires appendages, marking its maturation into a centriole that can nucleate a cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guarguaglini et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Members of the tubulin superfamily are critical for centriole formation and function. All eukaryotes have alpha-, beta- and gamma-tubulin, but the tubulin superfamily also includes three less-studied members, delta-tubulin, epsilon-tubulin, and zeta-tubulin. These tubulins are found in a subset of eukaryotes, and are evolutionarily co-conserved, making up the ZED tubulin module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turk et al., 2015</xref>). In the unicellular eukaryotes Chlamydomonas, Tetrahymena, Paramecium and Trypanosoma, mutations in delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin result in centrioles that lack triplet microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dupuis-Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dutcher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gadelha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodenough and StClair, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ross et al., 2013</xref>). Humans and other placental mammals have delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, but lack zeta-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Findeisen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turk et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that human cells lacking delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin also lack triplets, that this results in unstable centrioles and initiation of a futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration, and identify an interaction between delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To determine the roles of delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin in the mammalian centriole cycle, null mutations in <italic>TUBD1</italic> and <italic>TUBE1</italic> were made using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in hTERT RPE-1 human cells. Recent work has established that loss of centrioles in mammalian cells results in a p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). We found that homozygous null mutations of delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin could only be isolated in <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, thus all subsequent experiments use RPE-1 <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells as the control.</p><p>Three <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and two <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell lines were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sequencing of the alleles in these lines demonstrated that they were all consistent with independent cutting by Cas9 and processing by non-homologous end-joining of the two alleles in a diploid cell. The <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> lines are all compound heterozygotes bearing small deletions of less than 20 base pairs proximal to the cut site on one chromosome and insertion of one base pair on the other, resulting in frameshift and premature stop mutations. The two <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> lines are also compound heterozygotes bearing large deletions surrounding the cut site, that in each case remove an entire exon and surrounding DNA, including the ATG start site. In all cases, the next ATG is not in-frame. We conclude that these alleles are likely to be null, or strong loss-of-function mutations.</p><p>We next assessed the phenotype of <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells stably expressing GFP-centrin as a marker of centrioles. Many cells in an asynchronous population had multiple, unpaired centrin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The measured diameters of other centriole sections from both <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant cells were also consistent with singlet microtubule structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Centrioles in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were of similar outer diameter: 172.5 nm ±13 nm in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (n = 17), 174.6 nm ±8 nm in <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (n = 13).

The reduced outer diameter of these aberrant centrioles is consistent with the presence of only singlet microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vorobjev and Chentsov YuS, 1982</xref>). We also noted that there is a slightly reduced central lumen diameter in mutant centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It is less clear why the mutant centrioles would have a reduced lumenal diameter, but we note that this result is consistent with the observation that normal procentrioles with singlet microtubules, prior to the elaboration of triplets, also have a reduced lumenal diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vorobjev and Chentsov YuS, 1982</xref>). These results demonstrate that cells lacking either delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin form defective centrioles that lack normal triplet microtubules. This is similar to the defects reported for delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin mutants in unicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dupuis-Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dutcher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gadelha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodenough and StClair, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ross et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The length profiles of centrioles in both tubulin mutants revealed important aspects of the defect associated with lack of normal microtubule triplet structure. In interphase, the length of centrioles from <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (222 nm ±37 nm; n = 18) and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (339 nm ±131 nm; n = 15) was similar to that of control procentrioles (207 nm ±20 nm; n = 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). All were shorter than control mother centrioles (485.6 nm ±43 nm; n = 14). We next analyzed the ultrastructure of centrioles in a <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> prometaphase cell using correlative light-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These centrioles (n = 3) exhibited a remarkable morphological phenotype, consisting of two electron-dense segments, one of ~50 nm and the other of ~200 nm, connected by singlet microtubules spanning a gap of ~250 nm. The combined length (~500 nm) of these structures approximates that of typical mature mammalian centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that the aberrant centrioles formed in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells elongate in G2-M, but that only the A-tubule is present. The shorter density might correspond to the CP110 cap, and the longer density to the centriole end containing the cartwheel. Procentrioles in control cells reached a full length of 403 nm ±22 nm in G2-M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), an increase of approximately 200 nm from their interphase state. We tested whether <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant centrioles exhibited this same 200 nm increase in the separation between CP110 and SASS6 foci by mitotic entry. We found that in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and control interphase cells, the centroids of CP110 and SASS6 foci were separated by a mean distance of 0.3 μm, whereas in mitotic cells the foci were separated by a mean distance of 0.5 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Thus, despite their structural defects, centrioles in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells undergo the normal cell cycle-dependent elongation.</p><p>The elongation of centrioles in G2/M creates a distal compartment that is a feature of centrioles in some, but not all, organisms. In mammalian cells this compartment is defined by the centrin-binding protein POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>). The lack of electron-dense structure between the two centriole segments joined by singlet microtubules in mitotic <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant cells might be due to a failure to recruit distal compartment components. Consistent with this, we found that POC5 was present in centrioles from mitotic control cells and absent from those in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that the doublet microtubules of the extended centriole distal end are required for defining this compartment.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that the primary centriolar defect in cells lacking delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin is the absence of triplet microtubules. To determine the consequences of this defect on the centriole cycle, we determined the distribution of centrioles in asynchronously dividing cells, as determined by staining for centrin and CP110. Control cells had a centriole number distribution typical of <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, with approximately 50% of cells having two centrioles, corresponding to cells in G1 phase, 40% having three to four centrioles, corresponding to cells in S through M phases, and 10% having more than four centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, approximately 50% of cells had five or more centriole foci, whereas 50% of cells had no detectable centriole foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Similar centriole distributions were found in several independently derived <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell lines, and this phenotype could be rescued by expression of delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>We reasoned that a possible explanation for the centriole distribution in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells is that the centriole structures we observed by EM are produced <italic>de novo</italic> in each cell cycle, and that these aberrant centrioles are unstable and do not persist into the next cell cycle. This hypothesis predicts that the aberrant centrioles in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells would (1) not be paired, since <italic>de novo</italic> centrioles only form in the absence of an existing centriole, (2) lack markers of maturation such as distal appendages, since they would not persist to the point of acquiring such proteins, (3) fail to recruit substantial pericentriolar material, since the centriole-centrosome conversion occurs at entry to the next cell cycle, and (4) would be formed in S phase, and be lost at some point prior to the subsequent S phase.</p><p>In agreement with this hypothesis, the centrioles in mutant cells, as visualized by centrin and CP110 were never observed to be closely apposed, as is typical of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Rather, in interphase they appeared to be distributed within the central region of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The centrioles in asynchronous <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells all lacked Cep164, a component of the centriolar distal appendage and marker of mature centrioles that have progressed through at least one cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas approximately 40% of all centrioles were positive for Cep164 in asynchronous control cells, consistent with the cycle of distal appendage acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</xref>). Lastly, most of the centrioles in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells lacked detectable gamma-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and those that stained positive had less than centrioles in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, we noted that SASS6, the cartwheel protein that is present in nascent and recently-formed centrioles, but is lost from centrioles at the mitosis-interphase transition in human cells, was present in most of the centrioles in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, consistent with these centrioles originating in the observed cell cycle, but not having successfully persisted into the subsequent cell cycle.</p><p>To investigate the fate of newly-formed centrioles in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, we next tested the cell cycle-dependence of the formation and loss of aberrant centrioles in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As in previous experiments, about 50% of <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells in an asynchronous population had centrin and CP110-positive centriole foci. Cell cycle stages were analyzed as follows: G0/G1, synchronized by serum withdrawal; S phase, identified from asynchronous culture by PCNA labeling; G2, synchronized by the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306; and M, identified from asynchronous culture by presence of condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells in G0/G1 mostly lacked centriole structures, whereas cells in S-phase, G2 and mitosis had them. These results indicate that in <italic>TUBD1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, aberrant centrioles are formed in S-phase, persist into mitosis, and are absent in G1. We note that this loss of centriole structure is likely due to a specific event that occurs at the mitosis-interphase transition, rather than simply time since formation, since cells were arrested in G2 for 24 hr, which is substantially longer than the normal progression through mitosis to G1, nevertheless the centriole structures persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>The timing of centriole loss in the mitosis-interphase transition was more finely determined in both fixed time-point and live imaging experiments. Control or <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were synchronized by mitotic shakeoff, and the presence of centriole foci was assessed over time as cells entered G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In control cells, the number of centrioles followed the pattern expected from the centriole duplication cycle. In <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, the majority of mitotic cells had centrioles. By 1 hr after shakeoff, the fraction of interphase cells without centrioles had increased to 50%, and this fraction continued to increase at 2 hr and 3 hr after shakeoff. By 12 hr after shakeoff, 56 ± 12% of cells had entered S-phase, and centriole structures began to appear, consistent with <italic>de novo</italic> centriole formation. We also imaged control and mutant cells expressing GFP-centrin to visualize centrioles in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Centrioles in control cells segregated normally in mitosis, and the mitotic interval was 46 min ±6 min (n = 11). In contrast, centrioles in <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells did not persist into the next interphase, and the mitotic interval was longer, at 106 min ±43 min (n = 10). The prolonged time in mitosis is similar to that observed for acentriolar human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin are not required to initiate centriole formation in human cells, but the aberrant centrioles that form in their absence are unstable and disintegrate during progression from M phase to the subsequent G1 phase. We note that this phenotype is specific to loss of <italic>TUBD1</italic> and <italic>TUBE1</italic>, rather than a property of <italic>de novo</italic> centrioles in general. <italic>De novo</italic> centrioles formed after washout of the centriole duplication inhibitor centrinone persisted through mitosis and the subsequent G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">La Terra et al., 2005</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29061-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29061.010</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Mitosis in a control RPE-1 <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell.</title><p>Movie of live RPE-1 <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> GFP-centrin cells.

It follows that if these microtubules could be stabilized, the centrioles might persist into the next cell cycle, despite their structural defects. To test this, G2-M stage <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were treated with the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel and the presence of centrioles assessed after forcing progression into interphase. Paclitaxel treatment did not prevent centriole elongation, as measured by the separation between CP110 and SASS6 foci, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (0.49 µm ± 0.2 µm; n = 105; not significantly different from <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mitotic cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> by unpaired two-tailed t-test). After 3 hr of paclitaxel treatment, cells were treated with the CDK inhibitor RO-3306, which resulted in exit from mitosis as evidenced by flattening of cells and formation of micronuclei. The effect of paclitaxel was evident as bundling of microtubules compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Centrioles in these cells were still present 3 hr after RO-3306 treatment, whereas control RO-3306-treated cells that were not treated with paclitaxel lacked centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). It has been suggested recruitment of pericentriolar material is important to stabilize centrioles, and that centrioles that fail to recruit PCM can be stabilized by induced retention of the SASS6-containing cartwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). However, the <italic>TUBE1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> centrioles stabilized by paclitaxel treatment still failed to recruit high levels of gamma-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and lost their SASS6 cartwheel (97% ± 2% cells completely lack SASS6 foci, three independent experiments with 100 cells each; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as expected for centrioles that have transited mitosis.

This suggests that the proteins work together to accomplish their function. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin to interact by co-immunoprecipitation from human HEK293T cells co-expressing tagged versions of the proteins. Epsilon-tubulin could be immunoprecipitated with delta-tubulin, and not with GFP from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results indicate that epsilon-tubulin and delta-tubulin can interact, and we speculate that they may dimerize to form higher-order structures, as do alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin. Interestingly, comparisons of the predicted surfaces of delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin that correspond to the interaction surfaces of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin revealed both similarities and differences that might influence their potential for interaction with themselves or other tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inclán and Nogales, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Triplet microtubules are absent in delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin mutant cells in all organisms that have been examined, and our results suggest that delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin are required either to form the triplet microtubules, or to stabilize them against depolymerization. The former seems unlikely, since the presence of triplet centriolar microtubules is not strictly correlated with the presence of delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin in evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the organisms that lack delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacks triplet microtubules, but both Drosophila and the plant <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> have triplet microtubules in their sperm cells. Since loss of these tubulins must have occurred independently in the dipteran insect and plant lineages, the most parsimonious interpretation is that triplet microtubule formation itself does not require delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin, rather than that these two lineages independently evolved mechanisms of triplet formation in their absence. Thus, we consider it more likely that delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin are required for stabilization of the centriolar triplets in most organisms. We do not yet know the molecular basis of this differential requirement for delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulins with respect to microtubule triplet stability. However, we note that those few centriole-bearing organisms that lack delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin have simpler centriole structures that lack typical distal appendages, and also often lack a distal compartment that is typical of more complex centrioles.</p><p>Why do centrioles disintegrate in delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin mutant cells? We have shown that in these cells, aberrant centrioles with elongated singlet microtubules become unstable as cells progress through mitosis, and that disintegration can be suppressed by treatment with the microtubule stabilizing drug paclitaxel. We do not yet know the basis for the cell-cycle dependence of this effect, but here consider three possible, non-exclusive, explanations for why centrioles from the mutants might be more sensitive to disintegration. First, it is possible that doublet and triplet microtubules are inherently more stable than singlet microtubules, and that this inherent stability is responsible for the fact that centriolar microtubules are non-dynamic. To our knowledge, this has not been directly tested, in the absence of other proteins that might also affect dynamics. We note that ciliary axonemes, made of doublet microtubules, can be dynamic, although in Chlamydomonas, where this has been best characterized, disassembly of the axoneme is slow, and is under complex regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lefebvre et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marshall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Second, it is possible that doublet and triplet microtubules provide unique interaction surfaces to recruit stabilizing proteins. Consistent with this possibility, non-tubulin densities have been identified in cryoEM structures of centrioles and ciliary axonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ichikawa et al., 2017</xref>). We found that POC5, a component of the distal end compartment, is not recruited to singlet microtubule centrioles; perhaps POC5 binds to and stabilizes the doublet microtubules in the distal compartment of centrioles. A final possibility is that centrioles lacking the normal triplet structure would likely also lack the A-C linker, which bridges the A- and C-tubules of adjoining triplets. Perhaps the A-C linker stabilizes centriolar microtubules by direct interaction with them, in addition to providing higher-order organization to the structure. No components of the A-C linker have been identified, but the <italic>poc1</italic> mutant in Tetrahymena causes partial loss of this linker and defects in triplet microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meehl et al., 2016</xref>). Each of these models has in common that the triplet microtubules of the centrioles are more stable, either intrinsically and/or by recruitment of stabilizing proteins, than typical singlet microtubules; further work will be required to determine the nature of this stability, and why it is particularly critical at the mitosis-interphase transition.</p><p>Here we have shown that delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin likely work together in a critical aspect of centriole structure and function, and that cells lacking either tubulin undergo a futile cycle of <italic>de novo</italic> centriole formation and disintegration. Our results show that in human cells, delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin act to stabilize centriole structures necessary for inheritance of centrioles from one cell cycle to the next, perhaps by stabilizing the main structural feature of centrioles, the triplet microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>hTERT RPE-1 <italic>TP53<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were a gift from Meng-Fu Bryan Tsou (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) and were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Corning) supplemented with 10% Cosmic Calf Serum (CCS; HyClone).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Erich A Nigg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript Wang et al., examine centriole behaviour in human cultured cells that lack either delta- or epsilon-tubulin. It has been shown previously in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> that the loss of epsilon-tubulin leads to a failure to properly form the centriole MT triplets. However, the present study goes significantly beyond previous reports. First, it was important to extend studies from unicellular organisms to (null mutants in) human cells, and, second, the authors provide valuable additional information, notably on the interaction between the two tubulin isoforms and the cell analysis of the structural consequences of their absence. More generally, it shows that critical and conserved role of these conserved tubular isoforms.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers had similar comments. Although they were supportive of publication, they were disappointed in the quality of the supporting data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>. Considering that the 'absence of triplet microtubules' in <italic>TUBD1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and TUBE1<sup>-/-</sup> cells is a key point in this paper, the cross-sections shown in the picture galleries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) are really not all that clear, with singlet microtubules hard to see – at least in the dataset presented. Perhaps it would help to show a cross-section of a control centriole alongside? We assume that the authors have such pictures and this might help to illustrate what a microtubule triplet looks like when normal centrioles are examined in the exact same experimental conditions.</p><p>2) Similarly, the description of the centrioles in these mutant cells should be more rigorously quantified. The authors quote the outer diameter of the centrioles in the text, but this should be presented in a graphical form, and the size of the inner lumen should also be quantified: this looks smaller, and, if so, this presumably cannot be explained simply by the lack of the triplet MTs. Also, quantitative comparisons should be made to centrioles in the control cells, not to previously published data (especially as the control cells they use here lack p53). So, when you claim that centrioles are shorter and narrower, this should be quantified compared to the controls.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29061.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers had similar comments.

Our findings are summarized below:</p><p>1) Centrioles from <italic>TP53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> control cells do not exhibit any obvious structural differences from previous reports of mammalian centrioles.</p><p>2) The key difference between control and mutant centrioles is that mutant centrioles exhibit a smaller outer diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This reduced outer diameter is consistent with previous observations of centrioles with reduced centriolar microtubule number (Vorobjev and Chentsov, 1982), based on our measurements of their published images.</p><p>3) As the reviewers astutely noted, the mutant centrioles also exhibit a reduced lumenal diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We found, and now report quantitatively, that procentrioles in control cells have a range of lumenal diameters and that, although the distributions overlap, these are, on average, wider than mutant centrioles. This is interesting, and suggests that the centriolar microtubule structure is somehow involved in either determining or maintaining the normal lumen structure. Interestingly, the images in Vorobjev and Chentsov are also consistent with this result. We now note this in the Results and Discussion section, but further work would be needed to make more insightful conclusions.</p><p>4) Mutant centrioles are not significantly different from the length of procentrioles in control interphase cells, and both are shorter than mature mother centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In mitosis, centrioles from <italic>TUBE1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells elongate to approximately the length of control centrioles, which is described in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>We have edited the text to clarify these points (Results and Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
