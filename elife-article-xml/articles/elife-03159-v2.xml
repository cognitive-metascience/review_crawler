(CB1R)-activation remain incompletely understood. We report atypical coupling of neuronal CB1Rs, after activation by endo- or exocannabinoids such as the marijuana component ∆<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol, to heterotrimeric G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> proteins that triggers rapid and reversible non-muscle myosin II (NM II) dependent contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, through a Rho-GTPase and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). This induces rapid neuronal remodeling, such as retraction of neurites and axonal growth cones, elevated neuronal rigidity, and reshaping of somatodendritic morphology. Chronic pharmacological inhibition of NM II prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of dendritic development in vitro and leads, similarly to blockade of endocannabinoid action, to excessive growth of corticofugal axons into the sub-ventricular zone in vivo. Our results suggest that CB1R can rapidly transform the neuronal cytoskeleton through actomyosin contractility, resulting in cellular remodeling events ultimately able to affect the brain architecture and wiring.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03159.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03159.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03159.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brains are full of cells called neurons, which are connected to each other in complex networks that send messages around the brain. The way the neurons connect to each other, known as brain wiring, differs widely between individuals. Moreover, our brain wiring changes in response to our environment and experiences throughout our lives, from developing embryo to old age.</p><p>One way this happens is through the action of chemicals called cannabinoids. Produced naturally in the body, cannabinoids are also found in the popular recreational drug cannabis that is increasingly being used in medicine to treat chronic pain and other conditions. However, cannabis misuse can have negative side effects on the brain leading to memory loss and mental illness, especially in young people.</p><p>Cannabinoids can be detected by a group of proteins called cannabinoid receptors, but it is not clear how this leads to changes in brain wiring. Roland et al. now show that detection of cannabinoids by a type-1 cannabinoid receptor triggers a series of events that change how neurons grow and connect with each other.</p><p>Detection of the cannabinoid by the receptor leads to the activation of an enzyme called ROCK. This, in turn, activates a motor protein called non-muscle myosin II that inhibits the growth of neurons. Roland et al. suggest that this prevents the neurons from reaching their neighbors and forming new connections. Investigating how this works in individuals with medical conditions that alter brain function could help inform us how cannabis could be used more safely.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03159.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03159.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>cannabis</kwd><kwd>RhoA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-MNPS-004-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenkei</surname><given-names>Zsolt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheuring</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Lenkei</surname><given-names>Zsolt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cannabinoids inhibit neuronal expansion and growth through the rapid contraction of actomyosin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is emerging as an important regulator of brain wiring during development with a variety of functions, ranging from lineage segregation of stem cells to refinement of synaptic functions in complex neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harkany et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitalis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). In both the embryonic and adult brains, eCB action is predominantly mediated by CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs), which is one of the most highly expressed neuronal G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), known to couple to G<sub>i/o</sub> heterotrimeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howlett, 2005</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms by which CB1R shapes developing neurons remain mostly unknown. The exact role of eCBs in shaping the neuronal architecture is also under debate, since several reports indicate neurite retraction, while others found the induction of neurite outgrowth following CB1R activation (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaffuri et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, currently it is difficult to reconcile the locally repulsive effects of eCBs, reported at axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argaw et al., 2011</xref>), and their role of mediating efficient directional axonal growth and shaping well-fasciculated axonal tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitalis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>During neuronal development, an elaborate balance of positive and negative regulators is necessary to establish precise neuronal structure. This structure is stabilized by the cytoskeleton, which, similar to non-neuronal cells, is composed of two major polymers, the highly plastic filamentous-actin (F-actin) and the more stable microtubule (MT) networks. Actin filaments are often cross-linked to a molecular motor protein, the non-muscle myosin II (NM II), whose contractile properties further endow the actomyosin network with highly dynamic control of cell behavior and architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The cytoskeleton is mainly regulated by Rho-like GTPases that control a wide variety of effector mechanisms such as actin polymerization and branching, actomyosin contractility, focal adhesions, microtubule dynamics, and membrane transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaibuchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall and Lalli, 2010</xref>). Downstream protein kinases such as the Rho-associated, coiled coil-containing kinase (ROCK) are the key activator proteins of these convergent-signaling pathways. Interestingly, ROCK is associated with particular CB1R-induced phenotypes. In CB1R-over-expressing B103 cells, the endocannabinoid anandamide induces cell rounding via ROCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishii and Chun, 2002</xref>), and CB1R activation results in RhoA- and ROCK-dependent repulsion of growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>), but neither the coupling mechanism of CB1R to ROCK nor the cytoskeletal targets downstream of CB1R-activated ROCK are identified yet. Since Rho-activated effectors operate over a large range of spatial and temporal scales, understanding of eCB-mediated structural plasticity requires the identification of the precise spatial and temporal dynamics of CB1R-mediated cytoskeletal modifications.</p><p>In this study, by using highly resolved live imaging approaches, we report that CB1R-activation rapidly and reversibly contracts the neuronal actomyosin cytoskeleton through an unusual coupling to G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> proteins that produce Rho- and ROCK-mediated NM II activation. In addition, we show that chronic CB1R-mediated activation of actomyosin contractility may mediate lasting changes in neuronal and cerebral morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CB1R-activation results in rapid retraction of actin-rich growth cones</title><p>In order to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of cannabinoid-induced cytoskeletal modifications, we have established a sensitive, specific, and highly accessible experimental assay system to study neuronal remodeling downstream of CB1R activation. We have visualized highly dynamic neuronal growth cones in cultured hippocampal neurons, where the activation of endogenous CB1Rs results in repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>), by labeling endogenous F-actin with fluorescent LifeAct.

In addition to growth cones, axonal F-actin was also present in filopodia and in isolated patches on the shaft of the distal axonal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, bath application of 100 nM WIN 55,212-2 (WIN), a synthetic cannabinoid agonist, led to a rapid retraction of the F-actin-rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with mean retraction amplitude of 62.2 µm ± 5.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Retraction was already detectable at 2 min after agonist exposure and typically reached a plateau between 10 and 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

The retraction was saturable and concentration-dependent with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) value of around 20 nM for WIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When treatment with 25 nM WIN was followed by ligand-free wash-out, growth cone progression resumed normally showing the reversibility of cannabinoid-induced growth cone retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Finally, this retraction was not a result of CB1R over-expression since treatment with 100 nM WIN or 1 µM 2-AG induced significant retraction with similar kinetics in neurons transfected only with LifeAct-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>).

We expressed, in addition to LifeAct-mCherry, a GFP-tagged version of End-binding protein 3 (EB3-eGFP), which binds to endogenous microtubule (MT) plus ends without changing MT growth parameters and thus allows the visualization of MT structure and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, MTs in the entire neuron were labeled in green, with many bright comet-like fluorescent dashes in all the neuronal compartments, moving randomly in the cell body and directionally in axons and distal dendrites, representing dynamic MT plus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>). During 100 nM WIN-induced retraction the dynamics of the two main cytoskeletal polymers, F-actin and MTs, was remarkably different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A significant portion of F-actin redistributed in the first 2–4 min after stimulation from its original location in growth cones into a more homogenous cable-like pattern on the distal axonal shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, MTs bent during the same time frame forming periodic local loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,A’,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) before finally consolidating into a homogenously labeled retraction bulb. The F-actin cables (bundles of F-actin filaments, which are not separately resolved here by diffraction-limited microscopy), often co-localized with regions displaying periodic bends in MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B'</xref>), suggesting that an F-actin-related force pulls strongly enough to bend MTs.

The two main activators of NM II are myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and ROCK, the latter being already known to participate in CB1R-induced cytoskeletal modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishii and Chun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>). This raises the possibility that ROCK- and/or MLCK-induced NM II contractility is responsible for the force-generation reported above. In order to directly investigate the implication of NM II, we pre-incubated neurons, for 20 min before WIN stimulation, with the highly selective NM II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin (25 µM) that blocks NM II in an actin-detached state without perturbing F-actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovacs et al., 2004</xref>). Blebbistatin pre-treatment induced substantial morphological changes of the growth cone, which continued to move forward in a rather disorganized fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>), typically transforming the growth cone lamellipodia into several dynamically advancing filopodia, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosner et al., 2007</xref>). Remarkably, blebbistatin completely abolished WIN-mediated retraction of these dynamically advancing F-actin-rich structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>), suggesting that the main force-generating factor downstream of CB1R activation is actomyosin contractility. This inhibitory effect of blebbistatin was concentration dependent with half-maximal value of inhibition (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 116 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Immunocytochemical analysis of WIN-treated F-actin-rich growth cones at 2 min after the addition of WIN strikingly showed rapid and strong up-regulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation in the distal axon, adjacent to the F-actin-rich growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), at the right place for the subsequent NMII-dependent contraction, both in neurons transfected only with LifeAct-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>) and with Flag-CB1R-eCFP and LifeAct-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03159-media4.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03159.015</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Effect of NM II inhibition on CB1R-induced growth cone retraction.</title><p>Dynamic, F-actin-rich growth cone of a cultured hippocampal neuron co-expressing Flag-CB1R-eGFP and LifeAct-mCherry at DIV6 pre-treated with 25 µM blebbistatin at 20 min before treatment with 100 nM WIN at 40 min.

First, we showed that NMII-dependent growth cone contraction is not a result of CB1R over-expression, since treatment with blebbistatin (25 µM) or the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) significantly inhibited endogenous CB1R-induced retraction of growth cones, previously presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, in neurons transfected only with LifeAct-mCherry and EB3-eGFP. Then we used neurons expressing Flag-CB1R-eCFP, LifeAct-mCherry, and EB3-eGFP, our high-throughput experimental read-out, to characterize in detail the molecular mechanism of CB1R-induced actomyosin contractility. The amplitude of WIN-mediated retraction was significantly reduced by pre-treatment with the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase (1 µg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), but not by the MLCK-specific inhibitor ML-7 (30 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Treatment with the inactive (R)-(+)-blebbistatin (25 µM) stereoisomer was ineffective (data not shown). The implication of neuronal NM II was further confirmed by siRNA knock-down of endogenous NM IIA and NM IIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2010</xref>), which resulted in significant reduction of WIN-mediated contractility as compared to control (anti-luciferase) siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated which heterotrimeric G-protein family couples CB1Rs to Rho activation. Notably, treatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/µl), a specific inhibitor of G<sub>i/o</sub> heterotrimeric proteins, which are generally considered as the main signaling pathway of CB1Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howlett, 2005</xref>), did not decrease significantly cannabinoid-induced growth cone retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), similarly to a previously reported finding for ROCK-mediated induced cell rounding after anandamide treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishii and Chun, 2002</xref>). Another family of heterotrimeric G-proteins, G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub>, may mediate rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and cell rounding in neuronal cell lines in response to certain GPCR agonists such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katoh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kranenburg et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we inactivated endogenous G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub> proteins in our hippocampal neuronal cultures by using two pools of 4 different siRNAs directed against rat G<sub>12</sub>- or G<sub>13</sub>-alpha proteins, respectively. Used separately, neither pool decreased WIN-induced growth cone retraction as compared to control (anti-luciferase) siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, when we combined together 2 siRNAs of each pool, each resulting mixed pools efficiently inhibited WIN-mediated contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results show that the presence of either G<sub>12</sub> or G<sub>13</sub> is necessary and sufficient for CB1R-induced actomyosin contraction.</p><p>Finally, to verify that CB1R-induced retraction is not an artifact of altered adhesion properties of growth cones in vitro, we co-transfected Flag-CB1R-eCFP, EB3-eGFP, and LifeAct-mCherry into embryonic rat brains using in utero electroporation at embryonic day 16 (E16). In organotypic slices prepared from the offspring between postnatal day 4 and 6 (P4–P6), numerous corticofugal F-actin-rich growth cones from layer II–III pyramidal neurons could be visualized by video microscopy at 48 hr after slice preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Application of 1 µM WIN resulted in significant retraction of growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>) through activation of CB1R since this effect could be prevented by pre-treatment with 5 µM AM281 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This retraction displayed slower kinetics ex vivo than in vitro (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) probably due to limited diffusion of the highly hydrophobic WIN into the slice and/or into differences in adhesive and mechanistic properties within the organotypic brain slice. Previously, we have shown that at around P5, cortical projection neurons still express CB1R, albeit at lower levels than at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vitalis et al., 2008</xref>), thus we have replicated these experiments by expressing only the cytoskeletal markers EB3-eGFP and LifeAct-mCherry. WIN-mediated activation of endogenous CB1Rs typically led to arrest or retraction of numerous growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>). The relatively mild averaged effect is probably due to the variable level of endogenous CB1R expression in these neurons. Importantly, pre-treatment with blebbistatin (25 µM) efficiently blocked this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03159.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Activation of exogenous or endogenous CB1Rs modifies growth cone dynamics ex vivo.</title><p>Progression of dynamic, F-actin-rich corticofugal growth cones from organotypic slices cultured for 24 to 48 hr, prepared from P4-6 rat brains, previously electroporated in utero at E16 to express EB3-eGFP, LifeAct-mCherry, with or without Flag-CB1R-eCFP, was followed by time-lapse imaging.

In embryos treated between E15 and E17 with active (S)-(−)-blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,D´,G</xref>), but not with the inactive (R)-(+) stereoisomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,C´,G</xref>), Tuj1-expressing axons showed important targeting errors, by invading the sub-ventricular zone, from which CB1R-expressing corticofugal axons are usually excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The mouse neuroblastoma-derived Neuro2A cell line, a widely used model of neuronal physiology, presents simpler morphology than primary hippocampal neurons, enabling high-resolution quantitative measure of cellular structure and biomechanical characteristics.

Marked cell rounding, F-actin reorganization, and the presence of retraction fibers suggested that an analogous intracellular mechanism might be implicated in the above-reported cannabinoid-induced reorganization of the Neuro2A cells. We have performed two experiments to investigate this possibility.</p><p>First, in order to directly measure putative contraction of the neuronal actomyosin cortex, we measured the cell cortex rigidity of isolated CB1R-expressing Neuro2A cells before and after cannabinoid treatment, by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Averaged AFM measurements in force mode with a 1-µm spherical bead attached to the cantilever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) indicated that the stiffness (Young's modulus) of unstimulated individual cells was approximately 300 Pa, close to values reported in acutely isolated hippocampal glial cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). For this series of experiments, cells were grown on uncoated plastic, a highly adhesive substrate, in order to minimize the displacement of Neuro2A cells during the measurement. WIN stimulation led to an overall rapid and transient increase of cell stiffness at different locations on the same cell, with the exception of the trailing edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C4</xref>). As the contribution of the underlying coverslip was significant in neurites (compare ordinate scale of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C1</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C2–4</xref>), in the following experiments we have centered our force measurements on the cell bodies, corresponding to the positions 2 and 3 on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.

Prior to remodeling, the shape of the cells suggested a large degree of reinforcement probably owing both to the intracellular actomyosin cortex directly beneath the plasma membrane, and to the attachment of the cell to its substrate. After CB1R agonist application, the cell changed shape drastically, acquiring a more spherical morphology. Moreover, we observed localized blebbing behavior of the cell membrane, starting at the early stages (∼2 min) of the contraction and ceasing after 6–8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media7" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03159-media7.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03159.022</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>CB1R activation induces neurite retraction, cell rounding, and temporary blebbing in Neuro 2A cells.</title><p>3D reconstruction of a Neuro2A cell expressing Flag-CB1R-eGFP and DsRed2.

Similarly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CB1R leads to more complex somatodendritic morphology in septal cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keimpema et al., 2013</xref>). These data suggest that, in addition to axons, where CB1Rs are naturally targeted through transcytotic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leterrier et al., 2006</xref>), the transitory presence of CB1Rs on the somatodendritic membrane may allow efficient coupling to growth inhibitory signaling pathways. It was reported that increased NM II activity, through constitutively active MLCK or RhoA, decreases both the length and number of neurites and, consequently, delays or abolishes the development of neuronal polarity in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollins et al., 2009</xref>). We thus studied whether a long-term effect of the above described rapid, CB1R-activation dependent and NM II-mediated contraction of the neuronal cytoskeleton could explain the negative regulatory effects of CB1R activation at a longer time scale (∼24 hr).</p><p>First, we verified the presence of the rapid structural effects of CB1R activation in the somatodendritic region. Neurons expressing CB1R-eCFP, LifeAct-mCherry, and EB3-eGFP at DIV9 responded to 100 nM WIN with rapid morphological reorganization of the somatodendritic compartment, characterized by retraction of distal dendritic regions and broadening of the proximal portion of dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,A'</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). While the overall dynamics of EB3-eGFP comets was not apparently modified, the MTs in individual dendrites often displayed a characteristic bent morphology, parallel to the appearance of straight cable-like F-actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,A'</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>) suggesting the presence of a rapid CB1R-activation-dependent actomyosin contraction.

CB1R acts through heterotrimeric G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub> proteins, Rho GTPase, and ROCK to induce the contractile interaction of NM II with F-actin. This contraction triggers the retraction of the actin-rich growth cone of the most distal 60–70 µm of the axon in cultured hippocampal neurons and in cortical neurons in organotypic slices. Pharmacological inhibition of either CB1Rs or NM II during brain development leads to excessive growth of corticofugal axons in vivo, suggesting that CB1R-induced actomyosin contractility is necessary for the correct pathfinding by mediating their repulsion from the sub-ventricular zone. This contractile behavior is not limited to the growth cone since CB1R-induced actomyosin contraction leads to neurite retraction, cell rounding, and a significant elevation in cell rigidity in the Neuro2A cells. Similarly, in the somatodendritic region of cultured hippocampal neurons, distal regions of dendrites retract while proximal parts broaden. Finally, ROCK and NM II mediate the inhibitory effect of chronic CB1R activation on dendrite development, by increasing the natural contractile tone of neurons.</p><p>Owing to its position downstream of convergent signaling pathways, the NM II protein plays a pivotal role in the control of tissue architecture through its participation in processes that require cell reshaping and movement, such as cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). In neurons, NM II is also involved in diverse aspects of cell movement, such as neuronal migration and the structural organization and efficient extension of the growth cone, which requires an intricate balance between dynein, microtubules, actin, and different myosin II isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vallee et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, previous in vitro results have shown that NM II is important for turning in response to boundaries of substrate-bound laminin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turney and Bridgman, 2005</xref>) and that pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of NM II leads to disorganization of the growth cone, allowing rapid axon extension over inhibitory substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hur et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we report a comparable in vivo effect, by showing that blebbistatin treatment leads to elevated axonal invasion of the embryonic sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). This territory, which is populated by proliferating neuronal progenitors, is typically avoided by corticofugal axons during their progression towards sub-cortical target zones. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time the existence of NM II-mediated axonal repulsion in vivo, suggesting that mobilization of NM II participates in the correct guidance of corticofugal axonal projections. Since pharmacological CB1R blockade has similar effects to NM II inhibition (i.e., excessive axonal growth), a likely scenario suggests that the endocannabinoid 2-AG, whose synthesizing enzyme DAGLα is specifically expressed at high levels by proliferating progenitor cells of the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goncalves et al., 2008</xref>), acts through CB1Rs to repulse invading corticofugal axons through NM II-mediated growth cone retraction.</p><p>CB1Rs also rapidly modify the morphology of Neuro2A cells and cultured hippocampal neurons through enhanced actomyosin contractility, leading to large-scale reorganization of neuronal compartments that contain F-actin. Notably, CB1Rs not only alter the internal organization of the growth cone, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argaw et al., 2011</xref>), but cause the retraction of the distal axon over several tens of microns, both in cultured hippocampal neurons and in cortical neurons in organotypic slices. This NM II-dependent contraction leads to the characteristic periodic bending of microtubules. This particular phenotype was similarly observed during strong NM II-mediated retraction in DRG neurons after the activation of the LPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouquet et al., 2007</xref>) or after treatment with Sema 3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wylie and Chantler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallo, 2006</xref>;). In addition, nitric oxide, widely recognized to induce axonal retractions during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cramer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ernst et al., 2000</xref>), was reported to induce similar rapid axonal retraction accompanied by periodic bends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In addition, RhoA, ROCK, and NM II are known constitutive inhibitors of neurite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollins et al., 2009</xref>). By activating the CB1R/G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub>/Rho GTPase/ROCK/NM II axis characterized in our study, endo- or exogenous cannabinoids are likely to mobilize a widely employed myosin-activating machinery that is involved in growth cone navigation and in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal morphology. Interestingly, similar G<sub>12/</sub>G<sub>13</sub>-dependent signaling mechanism is mobilized downstream of at least two developmentally implied neuronal GPCRs, the LPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katoh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kranenburg et al., 1999</xref>) and GPR55, a putative ‘atypical’ cannabinoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ryberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharir and Abood, 2010</xref>), through activation by lysophosphatidylinositols but not through genuine cannabinoid ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obara et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, coupling of a bona fide neurotransmitter and drug receptor, such as CB1R, to this major developmental pathway may open interesting research and therapeutic perspectives.</p><p>NM II is also involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion; in turn, the adhesive properties of the substrate also control NM II activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). However, CB1R-mediated morphological effects reported in the present study may not result from reduced neuronal adhesion, considering the time-scale of the rapid neuronal retraction. Instead, retracting the Neuro2A cells and growth cones of hippocampal neurons both in vitro and ex vivo leave behind thin membranous fibers, which contain F-Actin and are still attached to the adhesive substrate. The formation and morphology of these fibers are similar to those of retraction fibers reported in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cramer and Mitchison, 1995</xref>) also generated by rapid contraction of the cellular actomyosin cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Théry and Bornens, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The ensemble of these results combined with the bulk of the available experimental data (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaffuri et al., 2012</xref>) suggests that endocannabinoids acting through CB1Rs exert a general negative effect on cell spreading and neurite growth. Basal cell-autonomous or paracrine activation of CB1Rs would yield relatively weak tonic inhibition of growth in the majority of developmental settings in all neuronal sub-regions where F-actin is present. Local growth-promoting effectors at the growth cone, such as the self-amplifying autocrine promoter BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>) or netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argaw et al., 2011</xref>), may locally surmount this weak negative tone. The resulting ‘channeling’ effect of widespread CB1R-mediated weak inhibition would help the neuron to focus its resources to a limited amount of growth locations, leading to more efficient polarized growth. Such weak inhibition may serve also to coordinated guidance of axonal fascicles in the brain where moderate production of eCBs by nearby axons would be used as a repulsion cue that helps axons to grow straightly towards their target. However, when growth cones reach a region highly enriched with eCBs, such as the sub-ventricular zone, enhanced eCB signaling could result in growth cone arrest, repulsion, or collapse, efficiently steering out CB1R-expressing axons from these areas. Finally, CB1R-induced actomyosin contractility may also contribute to establish functionally adequate somatodendritic morphology, acting as a negative regulator of dendritic growth.</p><p>In our study, we were able to characterize in detail CB1R-induced actomyosin contraction, which is rather subtle and transitory downstream of endogenous GPCRs, by using high-resolution time-lapse imaging, atomic force microscopy, and moderate over-expression of CB1Rs. Consequently, the amplitudes of reported cytoskeleton changes are likely dramatic compared to CB1R-induced remodeling in typical physiological settings. Nevertheless, the results concerning endogenous CB1Rs, obtained in cultured neurons, in organotypic slices, and in vivo suggest physiological relevance for our findings.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify NM II-mediated actomyosin contraction as a mechanism conveying a wide-ranging inhibitory role for cannabinoids in neuronal expansion and growth, downstream of CB1R coupled to G<sub>12</sub>/G<sub>13</sub> proteins and the Rho-associated kinase ROCK. Such modulation of the neural actomyosin cytoskeleton has not yet been reported downstream of neurotransmitter GPCRs, therefore our results open previously unexpected perspectives in the study and comprehension of brain function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>CB1R agonists WIN55,212-2, CP-55940, HU-210, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and CB1R-specific antagonist/inverse agonists AM281 and AM251 were acquired from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).

The authors use a series of pharmacological or gene-silencing manipulations in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo to show that activation of CB1Rs leads to leads to changes in the neuronal cytoskeleton in retraction events that require myosin ii, rock and Galpha12/13. They nicely show through in vivo experiments that manipulation of CB1Rs and myosin ii retraction pathway they characterized in vitro may be required for extension of growth cones to their appropriate location within the developing cortex. Moreover, they elegantly use AFM to corroborate that changes in their pathway lead to predictable alterations in tension of the actin rich cortex in the Neuro2A cell system.</p><p>However, some aspects of the study are limiting the overall significance of the results. Endocannabinoids and their receptors (e.g. CB1R) have been already demonstrated to be involved in growth cone repulsion and directional guidance. The authors investigate further the mechanistic cytoskeletal process involving CB1R activation and growth cone retraction. By combining over-expression of CB1R in dissociated hippocampal neurons and pharmacological experiments, the authors claim that CB1R-actvivation results in rapid retraction of actin-rich growth cone domains through MLCK/ROCK-mediated NM II activation. Overall, the impact of the results would be significantly improved if they addressed the following points:</p><p>1) While the myosin II and rock inhibitor experiments are quite convincing functionally, a full physiological picture of how CB1Rs regulate myosin ii motor activity would require a careful examination of myosin II light chain phosphorylation. Do CB1Rs activate myosin light chain phosphorylation, as one would predict from the involvement of rock or Galpha12/13? Moreover, would Rho GTPase inhibitors also have the expected affect of retraction?</p><p>2) One of the major concerns is that the authors test the role of CB1R in growth cone motility by performing pharmacological experiments in hippocampal or cortical neurons by overexpressing CBR1. The authors claim that the results found in these overexpressing neurons are comparable to the effects found when activating endogenous (non-transfected) CBR1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). But this is by far not the case and thus is clearly questioning whether what they see is a relevant phenomenon that occurs under normal conditions. The retraction induced by WIN in non-CBR1 overexpressing neurons in vitro and in vivo its minimal and did not last in time in the presence of the agonist. Then, the rest of the experiments are describing what occurs in these CBR1-overexpressing neurons in vitro when cytoskeletal elements are being blocked. But, to this reviewer, it is questionable how relevant are the results found in these experiments to the endogenous role of CBR1 in vivo. Along the same line, the experiments of in utero electroporating CB1 in cortical neurons are not convincing as the WIN-induced retraction in growth cones expressing only EB3 and LifeAct is very mild and not comparable with the one found in CB1R axons, that incidentally becomes only evident 96 minutes after WIN addition.</p><p>3) Another major concern is the experiments and conclusions made by the authors when blocking NMII or CB1R in vivo by infusion of Blebbistatin or AM251 in the brain of rat embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The authors state “CB1R-expressing corticofugal axons showed important targeting errors, by invading the subventricular zone, from which CB1R-expressing axons are usually excluded”. Where do they see these errors? First, it is normal to find Tuj1 cut axonal elements in the SVZ in wild type conditions. Second, how do they know that these Tuj1 axons are corticofugal? How do they know that these Tuj1 axons express CB1R? From the data provided in this figure there is no evidence of targeting errors of corticofugal axons by blocking CBR1.</p><p>4) The authors use Neuro2A cells to investigate the role of CBR1 in other neuronal sub-compartments such as the cell soma. To this reviewer, this is not a clear step forward. Why do the authors choose to perform these experiments in a cell line instead of using the hippocampal neurons that they have been using so far? And more importantly, what is the relevance of their findings in this regard to the role of CB1R in neuronal development in vivo?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03159.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) While the myosin II and rock inhibitor experiments are quite convincing functionally, a full physiological picture of how CB1Rs regulate myosin ii motor activity would require a careful examination of myosin II light chain phosphorylation</italic>. <italic>Do CB1Rs activate myosin light chain phosphorylation, as one would predict from the involvement of rock or Galpha12/13?

We have completed now a new series of experiments to directly show the rapid phosphorylation of myosin II light chain in the distal growth cone, both in neurons overexpressing CB1Rs or expressing endogenous CB1Rs. Strikingly, we detect rapid and strong upregulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation just behind the F-actin rich growth cone, at the right place for the subsequent rapid NMII-dependent contraction. We now show also that the Rho GTPase inhibitor C3 transferase has the expected inhibitory effect on WIN-induced retraction. These new results are now included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) One of the major concerns is that the authors test the role of CB1R in growth cone motility by performing pharmacological experiments in hippocampal or cortical neurons by overexpressing CBR1.

In order to show the relevance of our <italic>in vitro</italic> results to the endogenous role of CB1Rs, we have now repeated several key experiments with cultured hippocampal neurons overexpressing only the cytoskeleton markers LifeAct-mCherry and EB3-eGFP, but not Flag-CB1R-eCFP, to label dynamic growth cones. We show that in these neurons, the endogenous endocannabinoid 2-AG also induces significant retraction and that the WIN-induced growth cone retraction of neurons, the major <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental read-out of our study, is also dependent of ROCK and NMII. These new results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Along the same line, the experiments of in utero electroporating CB1 in cortical neurons are not convincing as the WIN-induced retraction in growth cones expressing only EB3 and LifeAct is very mild and not comparable with the one found in CB1R axons, that incidentally becomes only evident 96 minutes after WIN addition</italic>.</p><p>We also recognize in the paper that the effect of WIN is retarded in organotypic slices and we attribute this to retarded tissue diffusion of the highly hydrophobic ligand. The relatively mild averaged effect on axons expressing only EB3 and LifeAct is probably due to the variable level of endogenous CB1R expression in these neurons. We have now added this explanation to the text. This experiment aimed only to show the presence of the NMII-dependent effect of cannabinoids on growth cone progression in a more physiological context. Combined with the long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we hope that we can confidently say that actomysin contraction downstream of CB1Rs is important in the development of axonal projections.</p><p><italic>3) Another major concern is the experiments and conclusions made by the authors when blocking NMII or CB1R in vivo by infusion of Blebbistatin or AM251 in the brain of rat embryos (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>).

First, it is normal to find Tuj1 cut axonal elements in the SVZ in wild type conditions</italic>.</p><p>The referees are right: in wild type conditions Tuj1 positive axons also are present in the SVZ but the majority of Tuj1 positive axons are running through in the adjacent intermediate zone (IZ). Our results suggest that both CB1R activation and NMII contractility is important to efficiently segregate corticofugal axons between the IZ and the SVZ; in fact, their pharmacological inhibition induces an increase in the number of Tuj1-positive axons in the SVZ.</p><p><italic>Second</italic>, <italic>how do they know that these Tuj1 axons are corticofugal?</italic></p><p>In order to directly show the presence of corticofugal axons in the SVZ, we have performed a new <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation experiment to label cortical neurons with GFP. We now show on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> the presence of GFP expressing Tuj1-positive axonal elements in the SVZ, suggesting the corticofugal origin of the axons analyzed in our experiment.</p><p><italic>How do they know that these Tuj1 axons express CB1R? From the data provided in this figure there is no evidence of targeting errors of corticofugal axons by blocking CBR1</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Now we directly show an example of co-localization of Tuj1 and CB1R in axons invading the SVZ on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The authors use Neuro2A cells to investigate the role of CBR1 in other neuronal sub-compartments such as the cell soma. To this reviewer, this is not a clear step forward. Why do the authors choose to perform these experiments in a cell line instead of using the hippocampal neurons that they have been using so far? And more importantly</italic>, <italic>what is the relevance of their findings in this regard to the role of CB1R in neuronal development in vivo?</italic></p><p>We chose this platform to show that cannabinoid-induced actomysin contraction is not restricted to the highly-plastic growth cone, but can be detected in other cell domains that contain F-actin. Such a prominent region is the sub-membrane actomyosin cortex that was already well-characterized in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Théry and Bornens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham, 1995</xref>). In order to reproducibly obtain quantitative AFM data on the rigidity of the cell body and to be able to show convincingly on 3D reconstruction the rapid and temporary blebbing of the plasma membrane, reported in cells rounding up for mitosis by using actomysoin contraction, we chose to use N2A neuroblastoma cells for their simpler morphology. In addition, this model also allowed showing the short-term effects of CB1R-induced actomyosin contraction in outgrowth/retraction of non-differentiated neurites, which is an often used experimental read-out to measure cannabinoid-induced structural effects (Table 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaffuri et al. 2012</xref>). Now we have modified the text to better explain the justification of this model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
