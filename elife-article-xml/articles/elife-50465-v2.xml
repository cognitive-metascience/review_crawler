The vast majority of these insights came from the study of a single laboratory-adapted strain collected in Bristol, England known as N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chalfie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Consortium TCES, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grishok et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hodgkin and Brenner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). Recent sampling efforts have led to the identification of numerous wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and enabled the study of genetic diversity and ecology of the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BarriÃ¨re and FÃ©lix, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">FÃ©lix and Duveau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferrari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hahnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richaud et al., 2018</xref>). The earliest studies of <italic>C.ï»¿ elegans</italic> genetic variation showed that patterns of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) diversity were shared among most wild strains, with the exception of a Hawaiian strain, CB4856, which has distinct and high levels of variation relative to other strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cutter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>). Subsequent analyses revealed that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has reduced levels of diversity relative to the obligate outcrossing <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species and the facultative selfer <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). The most comprehensive analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic diversity to date used data from thousands of genome fragments across a globally distributed collection of 97 genetically distinct strains to show that recent selective sweeps have largely homogenized the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). The authors hypothesized that these selective sweeps might contain alleles that facilitate human-assisted dispersal and/or increase fitness in human-associated habitats. Consistent with the previous analyses, two Hawaiian strains, CB4856 and DL238, did not share patterns of reduced genetic diversity caused by the selective sweeps that affected the rest of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> population â a trend that has held true as the number of Hawaiian strains has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hahnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that the Hawaiian <italic>C. elegan</italic>s population might be more representative of ancestral genetic diversity that existed prior to the selective pressures associated with recent human influence.</p><p>To better characterize the genetic diversity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> species on the Hawaiian Islands, we performed deep sampling across five Hawaiian islands: Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and the Big Island. Because incomplete data on locations and environmental parameters are common issues for some field studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>), we developed a standardized collection procedure with the Fulcrum mobile data collection application. This streamlined procedure enabled us to rapidly record GPS coordinates and environmental niche parameters at each collection site, and accurately link these data with the nematodes we isolated. The Hawaiian Islands are an ideal location to study characteristics of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> niche because the Islands contain many steep, wide-ranging gradients of temperature, humidity, elevation, and landscape usage. In total, we collected samples from 2263 sites across the islands and isolated 2531 nematodes, including 309 individuals from the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. Among these isolates, we identified 100 new <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, 95 of which proliferated in the lab and were whole-genome sequenced. Analysis of genomic variation revealed that these strains represent 26 distinct genome-wide haplotypes not sampled previously. We refer to these genome-wide haplotypes as isotypes. We grouped these 26 Hawaiian isotypes with the 17 previously isolated Hawaiian isotypes and compared their genetic variation to 233 non-Hawaiian isotypes from around the globe. Consistent with previous observations, we found that the Hawaiian isotypes had approximately three times more diversity than the non-Hawaiian isotypes. However, we were surprised to find that, in a subset of Hawaiian isotypes, some genomic regions appear to be shared with non-Hawaiian isotypes from around the globe. These results provide the first evidence of gene flow between these populations and suggest that future sampling efforts in the Hawaiian Islands and the surrounding Pacific region will help elucidate the evolutionary processes that have shaped the genetic diversity in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hawaiian nematode diversity</title><p>In August 2017, we collected a total of 2263 samples across five Hawaiian islands and ascertained the presence of nematodes in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). We isolated one or more nematodes from 1120 of 2263 (49%) samples, and an additional 431 of 2263 (19%) samples had circumstantial evidence of nematodes (tracks were observed but no nematodes could be isolated). Altogether, we isolated 2531 nematodes from 1120 samples and genotyped them by analysis of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS2) region between the 5.8S and 28S rDNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BarriÃ¨re and FÃ©lix, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>). We refer to isolates where the ITS2 region was amplified by PCR as âPCR-positiveâ, isolates with no amplification as âPCR-negativeâ, and isolates from which we could not extract high-quality genomic DNA for PCR as âNot genotypedâ (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). The PCR-positive category comprises <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> isolates that we identified to the species level and isolates from genera other than <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> that we identified to the genus level. Using this categorization strategy, we found that 427 of 2531 isolates (17%) were PCR-positive and belonged to 13 distinct taxa. Among all isolates, we identified five <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species at different frequencies across the 2263 samples: <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (4.2%), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (1.7%), <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (0.57%), <italic>C. kamaaina</italic> (0.088%), and a new species <italic>C. oiwi</italic> (0.53%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). We formally describe a new species (Appendix 1), which we named <italic>Caenorhabditis oiwi</italic> for the Hawaiian word meaning ânativeâ in reference to its endemic status on the Hawaiian Islands. This species was found to be distinct based on molecular barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>) and on biological species inference from crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">FÃ©lix et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>C. briggsae</italic> was the most common <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species we isolated, which is consistent with nematode collection efforts by other groups that suggest <italic>C. briggsae</italic> is a ubiquitous species in many regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">FÃ©lix et al., 2013</xref>). We found that two <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. oiwi</italic>, were enriched on certain islands. <italic>C. elegans</italic> was enriched on the Big Island relative to Kauai and Maui (Fisherâs Exact Test, p&lt;0.01), and <italic>C. oiwi</italic> was enriched on Oahu relative to Kauai, Maui, and the Big Island (Fisherâs Exact Test, p&lt;0.00001).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Geographic distribution of sampling sites across five Hawaiian islands.</title><p>In total we sampled 2263 unique sites.

Of the six major classes of substrate, we found nematodes most often on leaf litter (55%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When we accounted for collections with nematode-like tracks on the collection plate, we estimated that greater than 80% of leaf litter substrates contained nematodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The isolation success rate for the other classes of substrate ranged from 14% to 49% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In comparison to overall nematode isolation rates, <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes were isolated more frequently from flower substrates (40 of 202 collections) than any other substrate category (Fisherâs Exact Test, p&lt;0.026) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also found that <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes were enriched on fruit (33 of 327 collections) relative to leaf litter substrates (76 of 1493 collections) (Fisherâs Exact Test, p&lt;0.011) but not other substrate classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, we saw no observable association between large population size (approximate number of nematodes on collection plate) and substrate class for <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (Spearmanâs <italic>rho</italic>Â =Â â0.0198, p=0.566 flower vs. leaf litter), <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (Spearmanâs <italic>rho</italic>Â =Â â0.258, p=0.732 flower vs. leaf litter), nor <italic>C. oiwi</italic> (Spearmanâs <italic>rho</italic>Â =Â 0.258, p=0.209 flower vs. fruit), which suggests that other factors might drive the observed flower enrichment or that we are limited by the small sample size.

Notably, the average substrate temperatures for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (19.4Â°C), <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (26.0Â°C), and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (23.7Â°C) positive collections are close to the optimal growth temperatures for these species in the laboratory setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poullet et al., 2015</xref>).

Since this analysis, an additional 15 isolates have been collected from the islands and show similarly high levels of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hahnel et al., 2018</xref>). To better characterize the genetic diversity in Hawaii, we acquired whole-genome sequence data from 95 <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates that we collected in this study. By analyzing the variant composition of these 95 isolates, we identified 26 distinct genome-wide haplotypes that we refer to as isotypes (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Within these 26 isotypes, we identified approximately 1.54 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that passed our filtering strategy (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods; hard-filter VCF; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which is 27.6% greater than the total number of SNVs identified in all of the 233 non-Hawaiian isotypes included in this study. We found that distinct isotypes are frequently isolated within close proximity to one another in Hawaii. We identified up to seven unique isotypes colocalized within a single gridsect (less than 30 m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We also found that colocalization occurred at the substrate level; among the 38 substrates from which we isolated <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 12 contained two or more isotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The variant data from all 43 Hawaiian isotypes (26 new with 17 previously described Hawaiian isotypes) allowed us to perform detailed analyses of Hawaiian genetic diversity. Consistent with what is known about <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>), we observed a high degree of genome-wide relatedness among the majority of non-Hawaiian isotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, isotypes sampled from Hawaii are divergent from isolates sampled outside of Hawaii with the exception of five non-Hawaiian isotypes. Among these exceptions, ECA36 and QX1211 were collected from urban gardens in New Zealand and San Francisco, CA, respectively, and grouped with some of the most divergent isotypes from Hawaii. The other exceptions were the isotypes JU2879, MY23, and MY16, which were isolated across the Pacific region, (<italic>i.e</italic>., Mexico City, Mexico; ConcepciÃ³n, Chile; Nantou County, Taiwan) as well as near the city of MÃ¼nster, GermanyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>). This result suggests that high genetic diversity is not specific to the Hawaiian Islands but might also be common throughout the Pacific region. Within the sampled Hawaiian isotypes, genome-wide relatedness revealed a high degree of divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This trend is further supported by elevated levels of genome-wide average nucleotide diversity (Ï) in the Hawaiian sample relative to the non-Hawaiian sample, which we found to be three-fold higher (Hawaii ÏÂ =Â 0.00109; non-Hawaiian ÏÂ =Â 0.000368; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The genomic distribution of diversity followed a similar pattern across chromosomes for both samples, wherein chromosome centers and tips exhibited lower diversity on average than chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This pattern is likely explained by lower recombination rates, higher gene densities, and elevated levels of background selection on chromosome centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Consortium TCES, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cutter and Payseur, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rockman et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we observed discrete peaks of diversity in specific genomic regions (<italic>e.g.</italic>, chr IV center), which suggests that balancing selection might maintain diversity at these loci in both samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by corresponding spikes in Tajimaâs <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tajima, 1989</xref>). Alternatively, higher values of Tajimaâs <italic>D</italic> might indicate a population contraction, but the discrete nature of these peaks makes this possibility less likely. A third possible explanation is that uncharacterized structural variation (<italic>e.g.</italic>, duplication and divergence) exists in these regions. Nevertheless, the variant sites within these discrete peaks in Ï and Tajimaâs <italic>D</italic> are unlikely the result of sequencing errors because they are identified across multiple isotypes (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Our previous analysis showed that 70â90% of isotypes contain reduced levels of diversity across several megabases (Mb) on chromosomes I, IV, V, and X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). This reduced diversity was hypothesized to be caused by selective sweeps that occurred within the last few hundred years, potentially through drastic alterations of global environments by humans. The two Hawaiian isotypes, CB4856 and DL238, did not share this pattern of reduced diversity, suggesting that they avoided the selective pressure. Consistent with this previous analysis, we did not observe signatures of selection in the sampled Hawaiian isotypes on chromosomes I, IV, V, and X, as measured by Tajimaâs <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which suggests that the Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian samples have distinct evolutionary histories. This distinction is also captured in genome-wide Hudsonâs <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>, where the differentiation between the two samples is highest in regions of the genome impacted by the selective sweeps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhatia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hudson et al., 1992</xref>).

By contrast, isotypes assigned to three of the four Hawaiian populations showed little admixture with other populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). We refer to the four Hawaiian populations as Volcano, Hawaiian Divergent, Hawaiian Invaded, and Hawaiian Low for the following reasons. All eight isotypes in the Volcano population were isolated on the Big Island of Hawaii from the town of Volcano at high elevation in wet rainforests primarily composed of ferns, âÅhiâa lehua, and koa trees. The Hawaiian Divergent population is named for the two highly divergent isotypes, XZ1516 and ECA701, which were isolated from Kauai, the oldest Hawaiian island sampled. However, we emphasize that the population assignment of these two highly divergent isotypes might not be correct given that they each contain many strain-specific variants that were filtered from the admixture analysis. The Hawaiian Invaded population is named because many of the isotypes assigned to this population exhibited admixture with non-Hawaiian populations, which is suggestive of an invasion of non-Hawaiian alleles into Hawaii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

This result suggested that these populations either share ancestry or recent gene flow occurred between them. To distinguish between these possibilities, we explicitly tested for the presence of gene flow among all populations using TreeMix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>), which estimates the historical relationships among populations accounting for both population splits and migration events. We found evidence of gene flow between the Hawaiian Invaded population and the non-Hawaiian population C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The topological position of the fourth highest-weight migration event identified by TreeMix (<italic>i.e.</italic>, CâHawaiian Invaded) suggested that the evidence of gene flow is not caused by incomplete assortment of ancestral alleles (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the migration arrows connect the âCâ and Hawaiian Invaded linages at the branch tips) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

The G population comprises 15 isotypes typically isolated from Portugal and its two archipelagic autonomous regions, the Azores and Madeira.

By contrast, greater than 50% of chromosome IV contained the swept haplotype in all of the isotypes from the C population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The Hawaiian Low population generally contained smaller portions of the globally swept haplotypes than the Hawaii Invaded population with the exception of the QX1791 isotype, which is likely because of its admixture with non-Hawaiian populations âCâ and âKâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâB</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Taken together, our data showed that the Hawaiian isotypes from the Volcano and Hawaiian Divergent populations have avoided the selective sweeps that are found in isotypes across most regions of the globe, and individuals within the Hawaiian Invaded subpopulation have likely been outcrossed with these swept haplotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We sought to deeply sample the natural genetic variation within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> species to better understand the evolutionary history and driving forces of genome evolution in this powerful model system. Because the Hawaiian Islands have been shown to harbor highly divergent strains relative to most regions of the world, we choose to sample extensively on these islands. We developed a streamlined collection procedure that facilitated our collection of over 2000 samples across five Hawaiian islands. From these collections, we isolated over 2500 nematodes and used molecular data to partition 427 of these isolates into 13 distinct taxa, mostly from the Rhabditidae family. In total, we identified and cryogenically preserved 95 new <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates that represent 26 genetically distinct isotypes. These isotypes represent the largest single <italic>C. elegans</italic> collection effort on any island system and contain 27% more SNVs than all 233 non-Hawaiian isotypes combined. Our findings confirm previous results where high diversity is found on the Hawaiian Islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>), and document the first evidence of gene flow between Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian populations. Additionally, the wealth of genetic variation within these new Hawaiian isotypes can be used as a source of novel variants that might impact phenotypes of interest. It is important to note that future genome-wide association mappings using these highly diverged isotypes, which contain population-specific SNVs, might detect spurious associations that cannot be mitigated easily by corrections of population stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou and Stephens, 2012</xref>). Like other diverse population samples, further sampling and a larger number of individuals will helpÂ facilitate these types of mappings in the future.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The origins of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>The origin of many species can be traced to the location where genetic diversity is highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li and Stephan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peter et al., 2018</xref>). The high genetic diversity we sampled from Hawaii suggests that the Hawaiian Islands could be the origin of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The extant Hawaii Islands range in age from the still-forming Big Island to the 5.1 million year old Kauai, but the now submerged Emperor Seamounts represent approximately 70 million years of stable land masses over the Pacific Hotspot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neall and Trewick, 2008</xref>). These older landmasses predate the split between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its closest know relative <italic>C. inopinata,</italic> which is estimated to be 10.5 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanzaki et al., 2018</xref>). However, divergent isolates are also found throughout the Pacific region and sampling efforts historically are biased towards Europe. Notably, <italic>C. inopinata</italic>, was isolated in South Japan, suggesting that these species could have originated from a common ancestor located outside of Hawaii but within the Pacific region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanzaki et al., 2018</xref>). If <italic>C. elegans</italic> did originate from the Pacific region or the Hawaiian Islands, it is possible that the high diversity sampled from these locations could have been maintained after the transition from a genetically divergent outcrossing species to a selfing species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). Outcrossing <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species generally harbor much higher levels of genetic diversity as compared to selfing <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Graustein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jovelin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cutter et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the high diversity among the Hawaiian isotypes, all of which are selfing hermaphroditic strains, implies that the origin of selfing might have occurred earlier in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> evolutionary history than previously hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cutter et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The higher genetic diversity sampled from the Hawaii Islands could have at least two possible explanations other than residual ancestral diversity present since the transition to selfing. First, the higher genetic diversity in the Hawaiian Islands might be driven by population demography on the Islands. It is possible that Hawaii harbors larger, more temporally stable effective population sizes than other regions of the world that have been sampled. Under a neutral model, populations with a larger effective population size are expected to have a greater number of neutral polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kimura, 1991</xref>). These larger, more stable effective population sizes are plausible in Hawaii given the abundant supply of available habitats (<italic>e.g.</italic> rotting fruits and vegetation) and stable temperatures throughout the year. The Hawaiian climate is particularly less variable than many temperate regions where <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations are known to exhibit seasonal population expansions and contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">FrÃ©zal and FÃ©lix, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richaud et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, population bottlenecks associated with long-range dispersal to new habitats might also contribute to reduced diversity in many parts of the globe. Second, high genetic diversity might not have been restricted to Hawaii but present throughout the globe until recently. If true, then recent selective sweeps associated with human activity might have purged diversity from most regions except the Hawaiian Islands. This explanation is less plausible because genetically diverse isotypes are rarely found outside of the Pacific region, despite massive sampling efforts (especially in Europe). Ultimately, the pattern of genetic variation in Hawaiian populations is likely influenced by a combination of demographic history (<italic>e.g.</italic>, reproductive mode, changes in population size, short- and long-range migration events, and admixture) as well as evolutionary processes such as natural selection, recombination, and mutation. To further untangle the evolutionary history and origin of this species, additional samples from natural areas around the globe and in particular the Pacific region will be required.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Out of Hawaii or invasion of Hawaii?</title><p>Our sampling efforts within the Hawaiian Islands allowed us to explore how gene flow into and out of the Hawaiian Islands contributes to the patterns of genetic diversity we observe within the current global sample of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In particular, we asked whether haplotype sharing among Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian isotypes could be explained by emigration of nematodes from Hawaii (out of Hawaii) or immigration of nematodes to Hawaii (invasion of Hawaii).</p><p>Our data support the immigration of alleles into the Hawaiian Invaded population from the less-diverse, non-Hawaiian C population. Moreover, most isotypes from the Hawaiian Invaded and non-Hawaiian populations share portions of swept haplotypes. Although, isotypes within the Hawaiian Invaded population contain smaller portions of the swept haplotypes than those sampled outside of Hawaii. This pattern of haplotype sharing could be explained by an âinvasion of Hawaiiâ scenario, wherein swept haplotypes have invaded Hawaii. The genetic diversity of the Hawaiian populations might be threatened if the invading alleles confer strong fitness advantages as is expected for swept haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). However, if an invasion of Hawaii is currently underway, we have little evidence to support the selection of the swept haplotypes in Hawaii. First, the Hawaiian Invaded population only contains small fractions of the swept haplotypes on chromosomes I, V, X, and even smaller fractions on chromosome IV. Second, it would take a large number of generations to create these small swept haplotypes because of the low outcrossing rates and high incidence of outbreeding depression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dolgin et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the swept haplotypes introgressed into the Hawaiian Invaded population do not confer the same fitness advantages in the high elevation, cool temperature Hawaiian niche as they do in other parts of the world.</p><p>We also discovered evidence suggesting that alleles have emigrated from Hawaii to other regions of the globe. TreeMix analyses suggests that gene flow occurred from a population related to the Hawaiian Invaded and Hawaiian Low populations into the non-Hawaiian G population. Although we cannot be certain if this source population was located within Hawaii, its relation to the two Hawaiian populations suggests that it was. This âOut of Hawaiiâ scenario might have occurred through long-range dispersal of genotypes similar to those found in the Hawaiian Invaded and Hawaiian Low populations to other regions of the globe. Recent migration out of Hawaii could have been aided by the transition of the Hawaiian economy towards large-scale production and export of sugarcane and tropical fruits, which began in the late nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartholomew et al., 2012</xref>). If correct, then this situation is similar to what is thought to have occurred within <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> where the fruit trade might have facilitated recent migrations from native regions to oceanic islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">David and Capy, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hales et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that gene flow into and out of the Hawaiian Islands contributes greatly to the patterns of genetic diversity we observe in <italic>C. elegans</italic> today.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The ancestral niche of <italic>C. elegans</italic> might be similar to the Hawaiian niche</title><p>We used publicly available weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Climatic Data Center to measure the variation in seasonal temperatures for locations close to the sites where isotypes were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the Hawaiian sampling locations experienced less seasonal variability in temperature than any of the non-Hawaiian locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that the ancestral niche of <italic>C. elegans</italic> might be similar to the thermally stable Hawaiian habitats where genetic diversity is highest. However, factors other than seasonal temperature variation might also characterize the ancestral niche of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The Hawaiian Divergent population was enriched at higher elevations, which have been less impacted by human activities in Hawaii since the time of Polynesian colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alison Kay, 1994</xref>). By contrast, the Hawaiian Invaded and the Hawaiian Low populations are found at lower elevations, each of which show evidence of the swept haplotypes. Although it remains unclear what factors restrict the flow of swept haplotypes to the Hawaiian Divergent and Volcano populations, selective pressures connected to reduced human influence might contribute to the lack of genetic exchange. This possibility would be consistent with the hypothesis that the global sweeps, present in the Hawaiian Invaded and Hawaiian Low populations, originated through positive selection acting on loci that confer fitness advantages in human-associated habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, the presence of swept haplotypes in the Hawaiian Invaded and Hawaiian Low populations may simply reflect that they are found at lower elevations closer to the coasts where they might be more likely to mate with immigrating nematodes. Nevertheless, we suspect that the ancestral niche of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is most likely to be similar to the thermally stable, high elevation Hawaiian habitats where human impacts are less prevalent.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Unravelling the evolutionary history of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>More accurate models of <italic>C. elegans</italic> niche preferences will facilitate our ability to unravel the evolutionary history of this species by directing researchers to areas most likely to harbor <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations.

Sampling hikes with large elevation changes were prioritized to ensure that we sampled across a broad range of environmental parameters. On these hikes, we opportunistically sampled substrates known to harbor <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including fruits, flowers, stems, leaf litter, fungus, compost, wood, live arthropods, and molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferrari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">FrÃ©zal and FÃ©lix, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schulenburg and FÃ©lix, 2017</xref>). We chose to group these substrates into six major categories: leaf litter, fruit, flower, fungus, invertebrate, and vegetation. The vegetation category contains all substrates that do not fall into any of the other five categories. We chose to distinguish the leaf litter, fruit, and flower substrates from the vegetation category because we suspect these substrates provide distinct microhabitats and each substrate was sampled extensively. In 20 locations, we performed extensive local sampling in an approximately 30 square meter area that we refer to as a 'gridsect'. The gridsect comprised a center sampling point with additional sampling sites at one, two, and three meters away from the center in six directions with each direction 60Â° apart from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Field sampling and environmental data collection</title><p>To characterize the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> abiotic niche, we collected and organized data for several environmental parameters at each sampling site using a customizable geographic data-collection application called Fulcrum. We named our customized Fulcrum application 'Nematode field sampling' and used the following workflow to enter the environmental data into the application while in the field. First, we used a mobile device camera to scan a unique collection barcode from a pre-labelled plastic collection bag. This barcode is referred to as a collection label or âC-labelâ in the application and is used to associate a particular sample with its environmental and nematode isolation data. Next, we entered the substrate type, landscape, and sky view data into the application using drop down menus and photographed the sample in place using a mobile device camera. The GPS coordinates for the sample are automatically recorded in the photo metadata. We then measured the surface temperature of the sample using an infrared thermometer Lasergrip 1080 (Etekcity, Anaheim, CA), its moisture content using a handheld pin-type wood moisture meter MD912 (Dr. Meter, Los Angeles, CA), and the ambient temperature and humidity near the sample using a combined thermometer and hygrometer device GM1362 (GoerTek, Weifang, China). These measurements were entered into the appropriate fields in the application (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Finally, we transferred the sample into a collection bag and stored it in a cool location before we attempted to isolate nematodes. Seventy samples in our raw data had missing GPS coordinates or GPS coordinates that were distant from actual sampling locations after visual inspection using satellite imagery. The positions for these samples were corrected using the average position of the two samples collected before and after the errant data point or by manually assigning estimated positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Nematode isolation</title><p>Following each collection, the substrate sample was transferred from the barcoded collection bag to an identically barcoded 10 cm NGMA plate seeded with OP50 bacteria.

The remaining 274 samples were shipped overnight from Hawaii to Northwestern University in collection bags, and the nematodes were isolated approximately 172 hr after sample collection (meanÂ =Â 172.5 hr, std. dev.Â =Â 17.9 hr).

Each Nextflow pipeline used in this study is briefly described below (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). All pipelines follow the â<italic>pipeline name-nf</italic>â naming convention and full descriptions can be found on the Andersen lab dry-guide website: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://andersenlab.org/dry-guide/pipeline-overview/">http://andersenlab.org/dry-guide/pipeline-overview/</ext-link>).</p><p>Raw sequencing reads were trimmed using <italic>trimmomatic-nf</italic>, which uses trimmomatic (v0.36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) to remove low-quality bases and adapter sequences. Following trimming, we used the <italic>concordance-nf</italic> pipeline to characterize <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains isolated in this study and previously described strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hahnel et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>concordance-nf</italic> pipeline calls SNVs using the BCFtools (v.1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li, 2011</xref>) variant calling software. The variants are filtered by: Depth (FORMAT/DP)â¥3; Mapping Quality (INFO/MQ)&gt;40; Variant quality (QUAL)Â &gt;30; (Allelic Depth (FORMAT/AD)/Num of high quality bases (FORMAT/DP)) ratioÂ &gt;0.5. We determined the pairwise similarity of all strains by calculating the fraction of shared SNVs. Finally, we classified two or more strains as the same isotype if they sharedÂ &gt;99.9% SNVs. If a strain did not meet this criterion, we considered it as a unique isotype. Newly assigned isotypes were added to CeNDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>After isotypes are assigned, we used <italic>alignment-nf</italic> with BWA (v0.7.17-r1188) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) to align trimmed sequence data for distinct isotypes to the N2 reference genome (WS245) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Next, we called SNVs using <italic>wi-nf</italic>, which uses the BCFtools (v.1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li, 2011</xref>). The <italic>wi-nf</italic> pipeline generates two population-wide VCFs that we refer to as the soft-filtered and hard-filtered VCFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). After variant calling, a soft-filtered VCF was generated for each sample by appending the following soft-filters to variant sites: Depth (FORMAT/DP)&gt;10; Mapping Quality (INFO/MQ)&gt;40; Variant quality (QUAL)Â &gt;10; (Allelic Depth (FORMAT/AD)/Number of high quality bases (FORMAT/DP)) ratioÂ &gt;0.5. These soft-filters were appended to the FT field of the VCF using <italic>VCF-kit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook and Andersen, 2017</xref>). Next, sample VCFs were merged using the merge utility of BCFtools (v.1.9). Once the population VCF was generated, variant sites with greater than 90% missing genotypes (high_missing) or greater than 10% heterozygosity (high_heterozygosity) were flagged. We refer to this VCF as the âsoft-filtered VCFâ. To construct the âhard-filtered VCFâ, we removed all variants that did not pass the filters described above. Both the soft- and hard-filtered isotype-level VCFs are available to download on the CeNDR website (version 20180527) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We further pruned the hard-filtered VCF to contain sites with no missing genotype calls using BCFtools (v.1.9)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li, 2011</xref>). The predicted variant effects were appended to the VCF using SnpEff (v 4.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>). We further annotated this VCF with exons, G-quartets, transcription factor binding sites, histone binding sites, miRNA binding sites, splice sites, ancestral alleles (XZ1516 set as ancestor), the genetic map position, and repetitive elements using vcfanno (v 0.2.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>). All annotations were obtained from WS266. We removed regions that were annotated as repetitive. We named this VCF the âPopGen VCFâ (Supplementary data 3 on GitHub <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AndersenLab/HawaiiMS/blob/master/data/elife_files/Supplemental_Data_3.vcf.gz">https://github.com/AndersenLab/HawaiiMS/blob/master/data/elife_files/Supplemental_Data_3.vcf.gz</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p>We characterized the relatedness of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> isotypes using RAxML-ng with the GTR DNA substitution model and maximum likelihood estimation to find the parameter values that maximize the phylogenetic likelihood function, and thus provide the best explanation for the observed data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kozlov et al., 2019</xref>).

To construct the unrooted tree that included 276 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we used the GTR evolutionary model available in RAxML-ng (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lanave et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">TavarÃ©, 1986</xref>). This tree was visualized using the ggtree (v1.10.5) R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). To construct the neighbor-net phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>) we further pruned the âPopGen VCFâ by removing sites in linkage disequilibrium using PLINK (v1.9) with the <monospace>--indep-pairwise 50 1 0.8</monospace> command. We also removed variants only present in one isotype.

All statistics were calculated along sliding windows with a 10 kb window size and a 1 kb step size with the âPopGen VCFâ (Supplementary data 3 on GitHub <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AndersenLab/HawaiiMS/blob/master/data/elife_files/Supplemental_Data_3.vcf.gz">https://github.com/AndersenLab/HawaiiMS/blob/master/data/elife_files/Supplemental_Data_3.vcf.gz</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Importantly, our statistics are calculated among isotypes not among isolates. The standard method for calculating these statistics is among isolates. We choose to calculate these values among isotypes to avoid oversampling of highly related individuals that are often isolated from the same substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Admixture analysis</title><p>We performed admixture analysis using ADMIXTURE (v1.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>).

We also removed variants only present in one isotype. We ran ADMIXTURE ten independent times for K sizes ranging from 2 to 20 for all 276 isotypes. Visualization of admixture results was performed using the pophelper (v2.2.5) R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Francis, 2017</xref>). We chose KÂ =Â 11 for future analyses because the cross-validation (CV) error approached minimization at this K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, KÂ =Â 11 subset the Hawaiian isotypes into four distinct populations, which exactly matched the subsets obtained from running ADMIXTURE on just the 43 Hawaiian isotypes at KÂ =Â 4 (KÂ =Â 4 minimized CV for ADMIXTURE with Hawaiian isotypes only, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

IBD segments were then used to infer haplotype structure among isotypes as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). After haplotypes were identified, we defined the most common haplotype found on chromosomes I, IV, V, and X as the swept haplotype. We then retained the swept haplotypes within isotypes that passed the following per chromosome filters: total lengthÂ &gt;1 Mb; total length/maximum population-wide swept haplotype lengthÂ &gt;0.03. We classified chromosomes within isotypes as swept if the sum of the retained swept haplotypes for a chromosome wasÂ &gt;3% of the maximum population wide swept haplotype length for that chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Environmental parameter analysis</title><p>We calculated the pairwise distances among all <italic>C. elegans</italic>-positive collections on Hawaii and detected five distinct geographic clusters, each of which contain collections that are within 20 meters of one another. The largest of these clusters comprised 18 collections in the Kalopa State Recreation Area on the Big Island of Hawaii. This cluster contained 11 collections from gridsect-3 and seven additional collections within 20 meters from the edge of the gridsect. The other four geographic clusters contain four or fewer collections each. We used the average values of environmental parameters from geographically clustered collections to avoid biasing our results by local oversampling. We applied this strategy to the comparison of environmental parameters between the Hawaiian admixture populations and used the Kruskal-Wallis test to detect differences (Î±Â =Â 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Climate data analysis</title><p>Climate data were downloaded from the Integrated Surface Data (ISD) FTP server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/">ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/</ext-link>) managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

Here, we justify the species status of <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. based on molecular barcodes and biological species inference from mating experiments. The type isolate for <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. is strain ECA821. We also made an isogenized version of ECA821 by ten generations of sib mating (named ECA1100). The species reproduces sexually with males and females. The ITS2 sequence from ECA1100 <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. (Genbank Accession: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN056420">MN056420</ext-link>) differs from that of all previously described <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species for which such information is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">FÃ©lix et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferrari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Slos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>). Note that these ribosomal DNA sequences might vary slightly within the species. Based on molecular data, <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. falls into the <italic>Elegans</italic> supergroup of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>) with the closest known species being <italic>C.Â kamaaina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">FÃ©lix et al., 2014</xref>). Reciprocal mating experiments of <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. ECA821 with the <italic>C.Â kamaaina</italic> type isolate QG122 did not yield any viable progeny. <italic>C.Â kamaaina</italic> was previously described as a sister species to the <italic>Japonica</italic> group but was recently placed as the most basally diverging species in the <italic>Elegans</italic> group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>). The discovery of <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. might help with resolving the shifting topology in this part of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> phylogenetic tree.</p><p>The type isolate ECA821 was collected in August of 2017 from the Island of Oahu, Hawaii (21.33611Â°N, -157.7999Â°W) where it was isolated from a cluster of freshly fallen flowers. ECA821 is deposited as a cryo-preserved living stock at the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center. Isolate ECA821 is deposited in the NYU Rhabditid Collection and was used to study the morphology of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In agreement with the similarity of their rRNA sequences, <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. and <italic>C.Â kamaaina</italic> are at present morphologically indistinguishable. Both species show the common features of the <italic>Elegans</italic> group of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudhaus and Kiontke, 2007</xref>). Their lips are separate; the stoma is long and bears three flaps of moderate size at the metastegostom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-B</xref>). The male tail shows the typical heart-shaped, anteriorly closed fan (bursa) with a serrated edge and a shallow terminal notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A, E</xref>). The nine pairs of rays are arranged as is typical for the <italic>Elegans</italic> group with two pairs of rays positioned precloacally and the tips of ray pairs v1 are attached to the dorsal side of the fan. The anterior dorsal ray (ad) is in position five and the posterior dorsal ray (pd) in position seven. The tips of the sixth pair of rays (v5) are embedded in the cuticle. Rays v4 are much thinner and always shorter than ad, a character that distinguishes <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic> sp. n. and <italic>C.Â kamaaina</italic> from most species of the <italic>Elegans</italic> group (but not all; <italic>C.Â doughertyi</italic>, <italic>C.Â tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C.Â nigoni</italic> also have a narrower and shorter ray v4). Several species of the <italic>Japonica</italic> group show modified rays v4. In <italic>C.Â japonica</italic>, <italic>C.Â nouraguensis</italic>, <italic>C.Â panamensis</italic> and <italic>C.Â waitukubuli</italic>, rays v4 are much shorter than the ad rays. In <italic>C.Â becei</italic> and <italic>C.Â macrosperma</italic>, rays v4 are only slightly shorter than the ad rays, but not as skinny as in <italic>C.Â kamaaina</italic> and <italic>C.Â oiwi</italic>. The spicules are slender and their tip is pointed. The gubernaculum shows the usual forked distal tip and lateral ears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C, D</xref>), but both are more prominent than in most other species of the <italic>Elegans</italic> group. Here, only <italic>C.Â inopinata</italic> and <italic>C.Â brenneri</italic> have equally solid lateral ears and distal forked tip. The morphology of the females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B, F</xref>) is in agreement with that of the stem species pattern of the <italic>Elegans</italic> group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudhaus and Kiontke, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50465.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Coop</surname><given-names>Graham</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Cutter</surname><given-names>Asher</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Toronto</institution></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The authors report a large collection of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes from Hawaii combined with worldwide samples.

The authors isolate five <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species from about 150 samples: <italic>C. briggsae, C. elegans, C. tropicalis, C. oiwi</italic> (a new species described here) and <italic>C. kamaaina. C. elegans</italic> is found at cooler temperatures and higher altitude than the others. The authors sequence the genomes of all <italic>C. elegans</italic> (their isolates and prior ones from Hawaii) and analyze the single-nucleotide variant diversity. The molecular diversity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is three-fold higher in the Hawaii set than in the present set coming from the rest of the world. The within-Hawaiian population structure is altitudinal. Admixture analysis suggests that there is some gene flow between low-altitude Hawaiian populations and the rest of the world. The authors discuss Hawaii as a center of diversity and potential origin of the species.</p><p>The results are important and considerably extend the known diversity of this model organism, as well as shedding light on its evolutionary history. I see no major flaw.</p><p>A few suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) It may be that the Pacific region at large shows a high diversity and there is nothing special about Hawaii.</p><p>The present sampling is on the Hawaiian islands. Prior sampling is mostly in North America and Europe, and little in the Pacific region, which introduces a bias. This should be made clearer, for example in the second paragraph on subsection âHawaiian <italic>C. elegans</italic> are divergent from the global populationâ and in the Discussion. The Discussion is centered on the center of origin of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the supposed ancestral niche. Although the Pacific region is mentioned, it would be good to more systematically indicate that one cannot distinguish at the moment whether this diversity is particular to the Hawaiian islands. That <italic>C. inopinata</italic> was found in South Japan could be mentioned.</p><p>Second paragraph of subsection âHawaiian <italic>C. elegans</italic> are divergent from the global populationâ: note that CeNDR shows more strains with the corresponding &quot;Hawaiian-like&quot; isotypes (BRC20231 from Taiwan (?), JU1171 from Chile, thus from the Pacific region). In line with this, it could be noted in the penultimate paragraph of the Results section that the admixed isotype was QG556 (and QG558), from California, also on the Pacific rim.</p><p>2) Could it be that the relatively high diversity is due to a lack of selective sweeps reducing the diversity (due to the high linkage disequilibrium) in the Hawaii set because of geographic isolation? Diversity may have been higher elsewhere before and lost perhaps due to human activity and movement.</p><p>3) Gene flow between &quot;Hawaii/Pacific&quot; and the rest of the world.</p><p>I do not understand why there is emphasis on the gene flow with the C group and little is made (i) of the gene flow to the G group that is shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 2 and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1; and (ii) of the admixture with the âHI Lowâ of some non-Hawaiian strains (including the G group). It seems that both âHI Lowâ and âHI Invadedâ are partially admixed.</p><p>4) The category of âfruits, nuts or vegetationâ, opposed to âflowerâ is odd. First, nuts are fruits. Second, flower is vegetation. Please at least change the name and perhaps reconsider the categories.</p><p>5) I could not find the correspondence between the samples, the strains, the species, the isotypes. The supplementary table with the sampling detail lacks the strain and species names in each sample.</p><p>6) The Discussion is currently centered on the center of origin of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, some other points could be discussed, for example the use of these data and strains as resource, e.g. for GWAS, the sampling design, the other species, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Crombie et al. present the collection of and population genomic analysis for the largest such effort for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> more generally. They focus their study on ~100 samples isolated and whole-genome sequenced from the Hawaiian islands, and integrate this outstanding dataset with ~175 <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild isolate strains from around the world that the authors genome-sequenced previously. Their data collection also incorporates an extremely streamlined protocol for associating geographic, ecological and environmental data with the isolates, which they use to demonstrate species differentiation by elevation/temperature (in the process discovering and naming a new species) as well as some genetic differentiation within <italic>C. elegans</italic> by island and elevation. They corroborate some previously established patterns of polymorphism across the genome and, more novel, discover a trove of diversity for those isolates from Hawaii. The data and analysis pipeline are publicly available. This abundance of polymorphism in Hawaii exceeds the sum total of molecular variation for all other strains found around the world and hints at the evolutionary and ecological origins of <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a species potentially deriving from cool, high-elevation habitats in or around the Pacific within the last 10My.</p><p>The clearly presented analysis, despite comprising an impressively large sample of genomes, is relatively simple. These results will be valuable for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> research community, especially for researchers interested in its ecology and evolutionary history, but also those interested in using natural allelic variants to understand molecular mechanisms. My criticisms are mostly to do with wording, specifically around the meaning and consistency of use of &quot;population.&quot;</p><p>Subsection âHawaiian <italic>C. elegans</italic> are divergent from the global populationâ and elsewhere: use of the word &quot;population&quot; to refer to the Hawaiian vs. non-Hawaiian samples seems a bit inconsistent/misleading, as the additional analyses show that they each comprise multiple genetic clusters (also referred to as populations) and the non-Hawaiian sample in particular is geographically global, and so may confuse readers. I would be more comfortable with &quot;population sample&quot; or &quot;sample of strains&quot; or just &quot;sample.&quot; This issue appears again in paragraph two of the Discussion after much effort went into analyzing distinct genetic groups within the Hawaii sample that are not entirely defined by geography. In subsection âThe ancestral niche of <italic>C. elegans</italic> might be similar to the Hawaiian nicheâ, it seems the use of &quot;populations&quot; might better be replaced by &quot;localities.&quot; Please comb through the manuscript for use of &quot;population&quot; to ensure consistency in what is meant, and what the analysis shows.</p><p>Subsection â<italic>C. elegans</italic> population structure on Hawaiiâ: I think this conclusion may be too strong. The admixture analysis does provide evidence for 11+ genetically-distinguishable groups, though whether these necessarily correspond to (geographic) ancestral populations is tricky to infer. This challenge is especially true given the highly selfing reproduction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that violates assumptions for what populations mean in admixture, so some caution is needed in interpretation. I'd be more comfortable with wording along the lines of, &quot;This analysis identified at least 11 genetic groups for this sample of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, each of which we refer to as a population for the purposes of further analysis.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50465.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Drawing from reviewer 1 we all agreed that the paper should acknowledge the current limitations of sampling more, i.e. it may be that the Pacific region at large shows a high diversity and there is nothing special about Hawaii.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we completely agree about this concern.

We chose to group these substrates into six major categories: leaf litter, fruit, flower, fungus, invertebrate, and vegetation. The vegetation category contains all substrates that do not fall into any of the other five categories. We chose to distinguish the leaf litter, fruit, and flower substrates from the vegetation category because we suspect these substrates provide distinct microhabitats and each substrate was sampled extensively.â</p><p>Importantly, while we were updating the categories, we discovered 19 samples that had been inadvertently filtered from our data set prior to plotting Figure 2 and running the statistics involving substrate categories in the original manuscript.
