Herein we report the crystal structure of human LCAT in complex with a potent piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator and an acyl intermediate-like inhibitor, revealing LCAT in an active conformation. Unlike other LCAT activators, the piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator binds exclusively to the membrane-binding domain (MBD). Functional studies indicate that the compound does not modulate the affinity of LCAT for HDL, but instead stabilizes residues in the MBD and facilitates channeling of substrates into the active site. By demonstrating that these activators increase the activity of an FLD variant, we show that compounds targeting the MBD have therapeutic potential. Our data better define the substrate binding site of LCAT and pave the way for rational design of LCAT agonists and improved biotherapeutics for augmenting or restoring reverse cholesterol transport in CHD and FLD patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41604.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cholesterol is a fatty substance found throughout the body that is essential to our health. However, if too much cholesterol builds up in our blood vessels, it can cause blockages that lead to heart and kidney problems. The body removes excess cholesterol by sending out high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that capture the fatty molecules and carry them to the liver where they are eliminated. The first step in this process requires an enzyme called LCAT, which converts cholesterol into a form that HDL particles can efficiently pack and transport. The enzyme acts by interacting with HDL particles, and chemically joining cholesterol with another compound.</p><p>Finding ways to make LCAT perform better and produce more HDL could improve treatments for heart disease. This could be particularly helpful to people with genetic changes that make LCAT defective. Several small molecules that ‘dial up’ the activity of LCAT have been identified, but how they act on the enzyme is not always well understood.</p><p>Manthei et al. therefore set out to determine precisely how one such small activator promotes LCAT function. The experiments involved using a method known as crystallography to look at the structure of LCAT when it is attached to the small molecule. They also evaluated the activity of the enzyme and other aspects of the protein in the presence of the small molecule and HDL particles.</p><p>Taken together, the results led Manthei et al. to suggest that the small molecule works by more efficiently bringing into LCAT the materials that this enzyme needs to create the transport-ready form of cholesterol. The small molecule also partially restored the activity of mutant LCAT found in human disease.</p><p>This knowledge may help to design more drug-like chemicals to ‘boost’ the activity of LCAT and prevent heart and kidney disease, especially in people who carry a defective version of the enzyme.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LCAT</kwd><kwd>HDL metabolism</kwd><kwd>high density lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remaley</surname><given-names>Alan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Division of Preclinical Innovation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jadhav</surname><given-names>Ajit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15POST24870001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manthei</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HL131288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manthei</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16POST27760002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Wenmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL071818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tesmer</surname><given-names>John JG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL122416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tesmer</surname><given-names>John JG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13SDG17230049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwendeman</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase with a covalent acyl-intermediate mimic and a small molecule activator reveals an active conformation and that the enzyme can be activated via its membrane binding domain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the world and typically develops as the result of atherosclerotic plaque build-up in the arteries. Risk for CHD is inversely related to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in plasma. In reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), HDL receives cholesterol from cholesterol-enriched macrophages, which is then esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) bound to HDL. LCAT preferentially catalyzes the transfer of the <italic>sn</italic>-2 acyl group from phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to cholesterol, creating a cholesteryl ester (CE) that partitions to the hydrophobic core of the HDL particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calabresi et al., 2012</xref>). This process drives the maturation of discoidal pre-β HDL to spherical α-HDL and promotes further cholesterol efflux from arterial plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glomset, 1968</xref>).</p><p>LCAT esterification of cholesterol in HDL is promoted by ApoA-I, the most abundant structural apolipoprotein in HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fielding et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jonas, 2000</xref>). The structural determinants that underlie ApoA-I activation of LCAT are poorly understood, but clues have been provided by a series of crystal structures of LCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunawardane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piper et al., 2015</xref>) and the closely-related lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>). Both enzymes contain an α/β-hydrolase domain and two accessory domains referred to as the membrane-binding domain (MBD) and cap domain. The MBD contains hydrophobic residues important for LPLA2 to bind liposomes and for LCAT to bind HDLs. Protruding from the cap domain is an active site lid that has been observed in multiple conformations. In the case of LCAT, crystallographic and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX MS) studies suggest that the lid blocks the active site in its inactive state, and opens in response to the binding of substrates and, presumably, upon interaction with HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>). The lid region is also important for HDL-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>), and thus we hypothesize that activation imposed by ApoA-I involves conformational changes in LCAT that stabilize its lid in an open state that is more competent to bind substrates.</p><p>To date, over 90 genetic mutations in LCAT have been described and are responsible for two phenotypes of LCAT deficiency: fish-eye disease (FED), wherein patients retain residual LCAT activity, particularly on apoB-containing lipoproteins, and familial LCAT deficiency (FLD), wherein patients exhibit a total loss of LCAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuivenhoven et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rousset et al., 2009</xref>). Both are characterized by low levels of HDL-C and corneal opacities, but FLD presents additional serious symptoms including anemia, proteinuria, and progressive renal disease, the main cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahsan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ossoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rousset et al., 2011</xref>). Novel treatments for raising HDL-C largely based on inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein have failed to protect against CHD in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kingwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rader, 2016</xref>). Therefore, there is currently great interest in investigating alternative pathways for modulating HDL metabolism. In particular, the focus has switched from raising HDL-C to developing drugs that increase the beneficial properties of HDL, such as cholesterol efflux, which is enhanced by LCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czarnecka and Yokoyama, 1996</xref>). New treatments that increase LCAT activity could therefore be beneficial for both FLD and CHD patients.</p><p>Recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT), which raises HDL-C and increases cholesterol efflux, was shown to be safe in a phase I study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shamburek et al., 2016b</xref>) and is now in phase II trials for CHD (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02601560, NCT03578809). This same rhLCAT has also been tested in enzyme replacement therapy for one patient with FLD with encouraging results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shamburek et al., 2016a</xref>). However, small molecule activators would be less expensive and easier to administer than a biotherapeutic. Previously, Amgen identified Compound A (3-(5-(ethylthio)−1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)pyrazine-2-carbonitrile)), which binds covalently to Cys31 in the active site of LCAT and increases plasma CE and HDL-C levels in mice and hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kayser et al., 2013</xref>). Other sulfhydryl-reactive compounds based on monocyclic β-lactams have also been shown to activate LCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2017</xref>). Although highlighting the promise of LCAT-activating molecules, these compounds are expected to have many off-target effects. Recently, Daiichi Sankyo reported a new class of reversible small molecule activators that have demonstrated the ability to activate LCAT isolated from human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Onoda et al., 2015</xref>), and increased HDL-C up to 1000-fold when orally administered to cynomolgus monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Onoda et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we determined the structure of LCAT bound to both a Daiichi Sankyo piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator and isopropyl dodecyl fluorophosphonate (IDFP), a covalent inhibitor that mimics an acylated reaction intermediate, in which the enzyme adopts an active conformation with an open lid. The activator binds in a pocket formed exclusively by the MBD but does not influence affinity of LCAT for HDL. The lid, which contains positions mutated in FLD, undergoes a large conformational change from that observed in inactive LCAT structures. We show that variants of Arg244 within the lid recover acyltransferase activity when treated with a piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator, highlighting the promise of compounds that target the MBD for many missense FLD variants. Our results thereby provide a better understanding of the key conformational changes that LCAT undergoes during activation, insight into how the enzyme alters its conformation in response to acyl substrates, and a rational framework for the design of new small molecule LCAT modulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of LCAT activators</title><p>We first synthesized and confirmed the ability of three recently reported piperidinylpyrazolopyridine and piperidinylimidazopyridine LCAT activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Onoda et al., 2015</xref>) (compounds <bold>1</bold>–<bold>3</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) to activate hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl palmitate (MUP) by full-length LCAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The bicyclic head of <bold>1</bold> binds in a pocket chiefly formed by the b1-b2 loop and a1 and a2 helices (nomenclature as in LPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>)), including the Cys50-Cys74 disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). Its pyrazole ring donates and accepts a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl and amide of Met49 and Tyr51, respectively, which mandates the hydrogen to be on the 2-position of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>, Compound <bold>1-b</bold>). The C4 hydroxyl donates a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Asp63, and the C6 carbonyl accepts a hydrogen bond from the side chain of Asn78. The C4 trifluoromethyl group is buried against the a1 and a2 helices. Thus, although compound <bold>1</bold> was synthesized as a racemic mixture at the C4 position, the binding site is only compatible with the <italic>R</italic> enantiomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>, Compound <bold>1-c</bold>). For simplicity, in future descriptions the compound observed in the structure is still referred to as compound <bold>1</bold>. The stereochemical preference is consistent with previous observations that one optical enantiomer of a given activator is typically at least ten-fold more potent than the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2015b</xref>). The pyrazole moiety packs between the side chain of Tyr51 and the Cys50-Cys74 disulfide. The central piperidine ring of <bold>1</bold> forms van der Waals contacts, but also positions the terminal pyrazine ring of <bold>1</bold> in a hydrophobic cleft formed by the side chains of Met49, Leu68, Pro69, and Leu70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). One edge of the pyrazine moiety also participates in crystal lattice contacts with residues in the αA-αA′ loop (residues 111–119), a region proposed to be involved in cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>), although these lattice contacts are distinct in each chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a–b</xref>). This contact may explain why similar crystals could not be obtained with compounds <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, which have bulky trifluoromethyl substitutions for the pyrazine cyano group. Notably, the binding site for compound <bold>1</bold> is also occupied in some prior LCAT and LPLA2 crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>), either by a Phe-Tyr dipeptide of an inhibitory Fab fragment (Fab1) (PDB entries 4XWG, 4XX1, 5BV7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunawardane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piper et al., 2015</xref>) or by a HEPES molecule in structures of LPLA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the MBD in the LCAT/LPLA2 family serves as a robust binding site for diverse chemical matter.

The density is progressively weaker beyond the phosphonate, and the alkyl chain past the C2 carbon is not observed. However, the location of IDFP in our structure and the dynamic nature of the alkyl chain is consistent with results from the LPLA2-IDFP structure (PDB entry 4X91), wherein multiple conformations of bound IDFP suggested two hydrophobic tracks likely used for binding the acyl chains of phospholipid substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c</xref>).

We previously used HDX MS to show that IDFP stabilizes elements in the MBD and the lid region of LCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>).

In these structures, the N- and C-termini are disordered except for an N-terminal pentapeptide in the 27C3–LCAT–Fab1 structure (containing mutations L4F/N5D) that docks in the active site of a neighboring symmetry mate. It is unclear which of these structures, if any, represent an activated conformation of LCAT, although the LCAT–Fab1 and LCAT-closed structures are more similar to each other and likely to be inactive, whereas 27C3–LCAT–Fab1 has a more exposed active site. The conformation of the active site lid is highly variable among these three structures.</p><p>The ∆N∆C-IDFP·<bold>1</bold> structure affords a high-resolution view of LCAT in what is expected to be a fully activated conformation unobstructed by conformational changes that might be induced by Fab binding. The structure of LCAT here is most similar to that in 27C3–LCAT–Fab1 (RMSD 0.70 Å for all Cα atoms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunawardane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>), including in their active site lid regions and in the relative configuration of their three domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). The active site lid can be divided into two regions, with the C-terminal portion (residues 233–249) being most consistent between the two structures. Both structures contain similar disordered segments (residues 236–242 in 27C3–LCAT–Fab1, chain A residues 239–240 and chain B residues 236–242 in ∆N∆C-IDFP·<bold>1</bold>). The N-terminal portion of the lid (residues 225–232) is most variable, although it is consistent between the two unique chains of the ∆N∆C-IDFP·<bold>1</bold> structure and, given the substrate analog, more likely to adopt a physiological conformation. Indeed, the N-terminal pentapeptide of a symmetry mate in the 27C3–LCAT–Fab1 structure would clash with Asn228 in the lid region of ∆N∆C-IDFP·<bold>1</bold>. Regardless, such differences highlight the high plasticity of the active site, which is likely required for LCAT to accommodate its various lipidic substrates.</p><p>Comparison of the structure of LCAT-closed with ∆N∆C-IDFP·<bold>1</bold> provides a unique glimpse of how LCAT transitions from inactive to active states (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Domain motion analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Berendsen, 1998</xref>) reveals two hinge regions: residues 219–229 and 251–255 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The dihedral angles between Asn228-Gln229 and Gln229-Gly230 undergo a large rotation that flips the lid region away from the active site in the ΔNΔC-IDFP·<bold>1</bold> complex. On the other end of the lid, the α5 helix of the cap domain unwinds in the lid open state, with the dihedral angles between Pro250-Trp251 undergoing the most change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The lid transition is accompanied by a 4˚ change in the orientation of the adjacent cap domain relative to both the α/β-hydrolase and MBD, which remain fixed with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Interestingly, in all reported LCAT structures the binding site for compound <bold>1</bold> is accessible (with obvious exception of those in complex with Fab1, which takes advantage of the same site), regardless of the orientation of the cap domain. In other words, initial HDL-binding and subsequent occupation of the active site by a ligand are most likely responsible for triggering the lid opening and rearrangement of the cap domain we observe in the structure, and not the binding of <bold>1</bold>.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-41604-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41604.017</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Transition between closed and open conformations of LCAT.</title><p>The video highlights the opening of the lid and corresponding cap domain movements that occur upon LCAT activation.

Track A is furthest from the lid loop and is only solvent-accessible when the lid is retracted, and the α5 helix, including hinge residue Trp251, unwinds and moves inwards to block this track in the closed lid conformation of LCAT-closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Although the exchange of pyrazole (<bold>2</bold>) to imidazole (<bold>3</bold>) eliminates the hydrogen bond with Met49, this resulted in only a minimal change in EC<sub>50</sub> (280 and 320 nM for <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively) and no change in the maximum response (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>). However, interruption of both of these hydrogen bonds by swapping the pyrazole (<bold>2</bold>) for isoxazole (<bold>9</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>) dramatically increased the EC<sub>50</sub> to 7.7 μM and decreased the response to 1.6-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">5</xref>). It was previously shown that removal of the C4 hydroxyl group (<bold>4</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>), which interacts with Asp63 in the structure, caused a ~ 6 fold drop in potency compared with <bold>2</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2015b</xref>). This is consistent with elimination of the hydroxyl group of <bold>3</bold> to give the more planar structure of <bold>8</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>) which decreased the potency to 4.6 μM, yet interestingly it still activated LCAT with increased efficacy of 3.7-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">5</xref>). Surprisingly, although the bicyclic head of these compounds is expected to play an important role in the retention of potency, the imidazole-containing head group of <bold>3</bold> has no activating effect at concentrations up to 10 μM (<bold>6</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>), perhaps due to loss of favorable interactions with Met49.

In data obtained from patient plasma, the amount of LCAT-R244G isolated from homozygotes was ~25% of the amount from WT LCAT plasma and there was ~15% of WT LCAT activity, whereas heterozygotes of the R244G and R244H mutations had ~80% and~50% of WT LCAT activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pisciotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vrabec et al., 1988</xref>), thus supporting an important role for this residue. Arg244 is found in the lid of LCAT and interacts with the backbone carbonyls of Leu223 and Leu285 in ΔNΔC-IDFP·<bold>1</bold>, and with the side chain of Asp335 in the lid closed state of LCAT-closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Thus, piperidinylpyrazolopyridine and piperidinylimidazopyridine activators like compound <bold>1</bold> can partially rescue defects in the activity of LCAT-Arg244 variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have defined a novel activator binding site in the MBD of LCAT as well as the active conformation of LCAT, and have demonstrated that these activators can restore the activity of some FLD variants. However, the mechanism of activation mediated by compound<bold> 1</bold> and its analogs is not straightforward. The activators do not alter the binding constant of WT LCAT for HDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that they do not contribute to HDL binding despite occupying a site in the MBD. Thus, one would expect that the residues that interact with compound <bold>1</bold> are not involved in HDL binding, or else these compounds would act as inhibitors. However, the site is closely juxtaposed with residues that are involved in HDL binding. HDL-binding residues such as Trp48 and Leu70 are adjacent to the activator binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>), and the double mutant Y51S/G71I was 4-fold decreased in its affinity for HDLs due to a defect in the k<sub>off</sub>, and lost acyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). A G71R variant has also been reported in LCAT genetic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hörl et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The compounds increase activity of WT LCAT up to 3.7-fold, specifically by increasing the V<sub>max</sub>, although by acting at a site remote from the catalytic triad and IDFP binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The typical mechanism for acting at a distance would be allostery, wherein ligand binding induces a conformational change that alters the active site. Indeed, ΔNΔC-IDFP·<bold>1</bold> adopts what we believe is a more active state with alterations in the active site that should promote activity. However, the MBD of LCAT does not appreciably change its orientation with respect to the hydrolase domain in any reported structure thus far, and the activator binding site seems available regardless of LCAT conformation. Moreover, the increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> caused by IDFP and compound <bold>1</bold> is additive, not synergistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–g</xref>), and our previous HDX MS data suggested that IDFP alone can stabilize LCAT in an active, lid open conformation that is likely represented by the current structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, IDFP is more likely to be the driver of the observed global conformation change observed in the crystal structure of ΔNΔC-IDFP·<bold>1</bold>. Although both ligands stabilize, they do so via independent mechanisms and compound <bold>1</bold> may only do so locally.</p><p>Thus, we hypothesize that the activators such as compund <bold>1</bold> act by stabilizing the MBD and facilitating substrate entry into the active site cleft of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In support of such a model, we note that the two chains of LCAT in the asymmetric unit of the ΔNΔC-IDFP·<bold>1</bold> crystals pack to form a pseudo-symmetric homodimer utilizing an interface with many of the hydrophobic residues from the MBD including Trp48, Leu64, Phe67, Leu68, Pro69, Leu70 and Leu117 from the αA-αA′ loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The interface is centered on the side chains of Leu64 and Phe67. The pyrazine ring of the activator is prominently featured in this hydrophobic surface. This hydrophobic ring packs next to residues in the MBD well-known to be important for membrane interactions, such as the conspicuously solvent exposed Trp48 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This same interface was also proposed by a recent molecular dynamics study exploring the ability of LCAT to dock to a model membrane in both the closed and open conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casteleijn et al., 2018</xref>). In the closed conformation, the active site lid blocks Leu64, Phe67, and Leu117 from being able to access membranes, though the rest of the MBD and the hydrophobic N-terminus of LCAT, which is also key for HDL binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>), would still be available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The simulations in this study also suggested that residues such as Phe67 were involved in promoting transfer of lipids into the active site tunnel of the enzyme. Mutation of Arg244, unlike compound <bold>1</bold>, clearly affects binding to HDL, and thus this residue, or the lid region in which it resides, could be a major ApoA-I binding determinant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

For example, our crystal structure revealed the preferred enantiomer of bound piperidinylpyrazolopyridines, thus one could expect at least two-fold higher potency could be achieved with an enantiopure preparation. A recent patent has improved the potency of these compounds 3-fold by using an optically pure compound, as well as adding a hydroxyl to the C5 position on the bicyclic head, which our structure indicates would add a second hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that there is potential to increase the efficacy of the compounds, because compound <bold>8</bold> activated 3.7-fold compared to the parent compounds, which activated an average of 2.3-fold. However, <bold>8</bold> had lowerpotency, and so more modulations will be required to determine if potency and efficacy can be improved simultaneously.</p><p>The ability to perform rational design is important because we also demonstrated here the therapeutic potential of using small molecule activators targeting the MBD in FLD patients. We focused on mutations at Arg244 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charlton-Menys et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLean, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pisciotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sampaio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strøm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vrabec et al., 1988</xref>) because of its apparent role in the switch mechanism of the active site lid, but in principle any patient harboring an alternative missense mutation that does not directly perturb the hydrolase active site may also benefit from this compound series. In this sense the ability of piperidinylpyrazolopyridine LCAT activators to rescue Arg244 mutants parallels the allosteric action of ivacaftor on the G551D mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, although their mechanisms of action are necessarily different due to the unique structure of the MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McPhail and Clancy, 2013</xref>). Even a relatively small increase in activity could potentially slow or reverse the progression of renal disease in some FLD patients because FED patients with only partial LCAT activity do not develop renal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahsan et al., 2014</xref>). Certainly, treatment with a small molecule activator would be more cost effective and easier for patients comply with than rhLCAT enzyme replacement therapy. In future experiments, it will be important to examine the utility of activators like compound <bold>1</bold> for other FLD variants. Lastly, because these compounds were demonstrated to effectively increase HDL-C in monkeys with normal levels of LCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Onoda et al., 2015</xref>), it will be important to continue to interrogate their mechanism and determine if they also increase cholesterol efflux and promote atherosclerotic plaque regression. If so, then activation of LCAT by a small molecule approach and improving HDL function could be widely used in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and would likely complement our existing drugs for lowering LDL-C, such as statins and PCSK9-inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293F</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher: R79007</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293F ∆N∆C-LCAT</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">polyclonal stable cell line</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pcDNA4 LCAT</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>) DOI:10.1038/ncomms7250</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pcDNA4 ∆N∆C-LCAT</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>) DOI:10.1038/ncomms7250</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pProEX HT-EndoH</td><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">D.

A codon-optimized human ∆N∆C-LCAT construct with a C-terminal 6x histidine-tag in pcDNA4 was SspI digested and transfected into HEK293F cells. Cells were selected with zeocin and grown in adherent culture on 150 mm plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium high glucose medium with GlutaMAX and 1 mM pyruvate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> zeocin. Kifunensine was added to 5 μM once the cells were confluent to prevent complex glycosylation. Conditioned media was harvested every 5 days, purified via Ni-NTA, dialyzed against reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), and then frozen. For crystallographic trials, samples were thawed and subsequently cleaved with a 1:3 endoglycosidase H:LCAT molar ratio in reaction buffer supplemented with 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 for 2.5 hr at room temperature, which reduces the heterogeneous <italic>N</italic>-glycans to single <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamines. HEPES pH 8 was then added to 100 mM prior to re-purification via Ni-NTA to remove the glycosidase, and finally LCAT was polished via tandem Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). The identity of the stable cell line expressing ∆N∆C-LCAT was initially verified by western blot with an anti-His antibody and abundant secretion into the conditioned media, followed by structural characterization of the correct protein.</p><p>Protein for biochemical analysis was made using pcDNA4 containing the codon-optimized human LCAT gene with a C-terminal 6x histidine-tag, which was transiently transfected in HEK293F cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glukhova et al., 2015</xref>).

The same volume of assay buffer was dispensed into column 1 and 2 for a no-enzyme control. Then 23 nL DMSO or compounds titrated at 11-point 1:3 dilution series starting at 10 mM were transferred using a pintool. After 15 min incubation, 2 μL MUP (16 μM final concentration) was added to initiate the reaction. The hydrolysis of MUP was monitored using a ViewLux plate reader (excitation 380 nm/emission 450 nm) for 20 min. The fluorescence signal was normalized against no-activator and no-enzyme control after subtraction of background signal (t = 0 min).

HDLs were prepared with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and 16:0 biotinyl Cap PE in a ratio of 49.5:49.5:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>). HDLs were diluted 1/20 in assay buffer (1X PBS pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 60 µM fatty acid free bovine serum albumin) and then immobilized on streptavidin tips for 600 s, followed by a wash in assay buffer for 600 s to remove unbound HDLs. The tips were then moved to buffer containing DMSO or compound <bold>1</bold> and allowed to equilibrate for 120 s before a baseline was established for 30 s. The tips were then moved into LCAT protein in assay buffer (containing DMSO or 10 µM <bold>1</bold>) or buffer alone (with DMSO or 10 µM <bold>1</bold>) as a control and allowed to associate for 200 s, and then dissociated in assay buffer for 480 s. All steps were performed at 25 ˚C with shaking at 1000 rpm. LCAT was titrated from 0.4 to 2.4 µM in triplicate. However, for some data sets (R244H, R244H + <bold>1</bold>, and Y51S/G71I), the 0.4 µM point was excluded due to low signal. The appropriate control of buffer containing DMSO or compound <bold>1</bold> was used to subtract the baseline and correct for drift using FortéBio’s Data Analysis 7.0. The association and dissociation curves were fit using GraphPad Prism with a two-phase model. In order to determine K<sub>d</sub> values, the k<sub>obs</sub> (from association) were determined at each concentration for the fast phase and then plotted against LCAT concentration. The slope of the line was evaluated as k<sub>on</sub> using the equation k<sub>obs</sub> = k<sub>on</sub>[LCAT]+k<sub>off</sub> and the resultant K<sub>d</sub> = k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. For statistical analysis, the k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>off</sub>, and K<sub>d</sub> for each replicate was determined individually and the results were compared to WT using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-test in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>DHE acyltransferase assay</title><p>Peptide-based HDLs were used in this assay as there is no difference between peptide HDLs and ApoA-I HDLs in both HDL binding and acyltransferase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>). The peptide HDLs were made using the ESP24218 peptide with the sequence PVLDLFRELLNELLEALKQKLK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dassuex et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>) with a DPPC:POPC:DHE ratio of 47:47:6 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manthei et al., 2017</xref>). The assay was performed in 384-well low volume black microplates (Corning 4514) with a total assay volume of 16 μL. In each reaction, LCAT was diluted in assay buffer to 15 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> in the presence of either 1% DMSO or 10 μM <bold>2</bold> with 1% DMSO. Compound <bold>2</bold> was used in this assay because it has lower background fluorescence than <bold>1</bold>. The DHE HDLs were diluted in 1X PBS with 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. 8 μL of the HDLs were added to the plate, and the reactions were initiated with 8 μL of LCAT, so that LCAT was assayed at 7.5 μg mL<sup>−1</sup> with and without 5 μM compound with a range of DHE concentrations from 0 to 50 μM. The reactions were stopped after 25 min at 37 ˚C with the addition of 4 μL of stop solution (1X PBS with 1 mM EDTA, 5 U mL<sup>−1</sup> cholesterol oxidase (COx), and 7% Triton X100). Following the addition of stop solution, the plates were incubated for another 60 min at 37 ˚C to allow for the COx to react. After the plates were re-equilibrated at room temperature, fluorescence was determined on a SpectraMax plate reader with excitation at 325 nm and emission at 425 nm, with a 420 nm cutoff. Reactions without LCAT were used for background subtraction, and reactions without LCAT and stop solution lacking COx were used to generate a standard curve for DHE. Reactions were performed in triplicate with three independent experiments per LCAT variant. Data were processed via background subtraction to remove excess fluorescence that results from the higher concentrations of DHE. These values were divided by the slope of the line from the standard curve, which yields the amount of DHE-ester that resulted in each well, and then by time to determine the rate. Outliers were removed using automatic outlier elimination within Prism.

The filtrate was concentrated and purified by silica gel chromatography using 30-70–100% EtOAc/hexane as the eluent to give tert-butyl 4-(4-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (<bold>6b</bold>, 2.25 g, 7.59 mmol, 38.0% yield).</p><p>Step 2: In a 2-neck flask was placed tert-butyl 4-(4-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (<bold>6b</bold>, 2.4 g, 8 mmol) and Pd-C (0.43 g, 0.40 mmol). Then, EtOH (50 ml) was added. The air was removed by house vacuum and refilled with N<sub>2</sub> for two times. Then, a H<sub>2</sub> balloon was attached. The N<sub>2</sub> air was removed by house vacuum and refilled with H<sub>2</sub> for three times. The mixture was stirred at RT for 2.5 hr. The H<sub>2</sub> balloon was removed and refilled with N<sub>2</sub>. The mixture was filtered to remove most of Pd and the filtrate was then filtered again through a nylon 0.45 μM filter using EtOH as the eluent. The filtrate was concentrated to move most of EtOH until ~2–3 mL left. Then, to the crude product was added EtOH (6 mL), acetic acid (12 ml), and then ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoro-3-oxobutanoate (3.51 ml, 24.0 mmol). The mixture was then stirred at 65–70°C for 2.5 hr.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This comprehensive report uses structural and biochemical analysis to describe a compound that increases the activity of LCAT by ~4-fold by an interesting, indirect mechanism. LCAT is the key enzyme in the conversion of discoidal pre-β HDL to spherical α-HDL, and activators of LCAT hold promise for disease settings where LCAT is deficient (fish eye disease and familial LCAT deficiency) and for modulating HDL levels. The reviewers all agreed that the data were of high quality, the findings were significant, and recommended acceptance pending the addressing of a few concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide all materials used for structural determination: the electron density map, including the major structural elements and the loop regions (particularly, the lid) that are discussed in the manuscript should be presented in the supplementary materials. Also, the authors should provide the image to show the crystal packing in the supplementary materials.</p><p>2) The Ramachandran outliers are very high (over 1%). Although the reviewers understand that the protein contains many flexible regions that may be difficult to refine, the authors should refine the structure; also the authors should provide the molprobity score and clash score in Table 4.</p><p>3) Please provide a model cartoon figure of LCAT outlining the various domains of the enzyme, where the activator and IDFP bind, and their speculative mode of action of the activator? While all of these are provided in various figures, a single summary model figure would be very helpful for readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41604.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide all materials used for structural determination: the electron density map, including the major structural elements and the loop regions (particularly, the lid) that are discussed in the manuscript should be presented in the supplementary materials.

We updated the table with these values and added the MolProbity score and clashscore. We also updated the PDB, the new PDB code will be 6MVD, which will replace 6DTJ and be released upon publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide a model cartoon figure of LCAT outlining the various domains of the enzyme, where the activator and IDFP bind, and their speculative mode of action of the activator?
