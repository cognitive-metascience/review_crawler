single-celled organisms. Transcriptional variation in unicellular malaria parasites from the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genus is associated with critical phenotypes including red blood cell invasion and immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation at an individual parasite level has not been examined in depth. Here, we describe the adaptation of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to deconvolute transcriptional variation for more than 500 individual parasites of both rodent and human malaria comprising asexual and sexual life-cycle stages. We uncover previously hidden discrete transcriptional signatures during the pathogenic part of the life cycle, suggesting that expression over development is not as continuous as commonly thought. In transmission stages, we find novel, sex-specific roles for differential expression of contingency gene families that are usually associated with immune evasion and pathogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33105.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease that affects hundreds of millions of people every year and causes around 500,000 deaths, mostly among young children. The disease is caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, which have a complex life cycle that involves different stages in different hosts. During mosquito bites, the parasites can be transmitted to people where they spend part of their life cycle inside red blood cells. Inside these cells, they can multiply rapidly and eventually burst the blood cells, which causes some of the symptoms of the disease. The parasite also produces sexual stages, which can be passed on to the next mosquito that feeds on the host.</p><p>Scientists have been studying these different stages to better understand how the parasites manage to evade the human immune system so successfully. Most of the research has looked at how genes differ between large pools of parasites, but this approach hides important differences between individual parasites. Understanding variation and how individual parasites behave could help to develop new and effective drugs and vaccines for malaria.</p><p>Now, Reid et al. used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing, which allowed them to hone in on individual genes within a single parasite. This revealed hidden patterns in the way the parasites use their genes across the life cycle. When the parasite is developing inside a red blood cell, distinct groups of genes turn on simultaneously and are later switched off together. Reid et al. found clues about the genes that might be controlling these groups. The experiments also showed that a set of genes previously thought to be involved solely in evading the immune system is also important for the transition from human to mosquito.</p><p>A next step will be to see if single-cell RNA sequencing technology could be used to reveal more about the basic biology of the parasite and how it resists drugs or evades the immune system. In the future, this may help to develop drugs that interfere with the synchronisation of these groups of genes to disrupt the parasite’s development and stop it from causing the disease. The genes involved in transmission between hosts could be another promising drug target, and one day, may help to eliminate the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scRNAseq</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT098051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Billker</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><name><surname>Berriman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Lawniczak</surname><given-names>Mara KN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1100339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawniczak</surname><given-names>Mara KN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01239/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illingworth</surname><given-names>Christopher J R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite transcription shifts dramatically along asexual development, and transmission stages variably express important immune evasion genes, suggesting much interesting biology has until now been hidden by bulk analyses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is caused by unicellular eukaryotic parasites from the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genus. These organisms have a complex life cycle comprising many different developmental stages. In the blood of infected patients, asexual intra-erythrocytic replication of parasites is solely responsible for pathogenesis, whilst sexual stages, termed gametocytes, are the only stage capable of transmission to the next host via the mosquito vector. These distinct life stages have been extensively investigated using transcriptomic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozdech et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">López-Barragán et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Llinás et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lasonder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2014</xref>), but this has been largely at a population level. Little is known about how individual cells vary within stages.</p><p>Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) produces transcriptomic profiles for multiple individual cells. This has allowed the decomposition of cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haber et al., 2017</xref>), uncovered previously unknown cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grün et al., 2015</xref>) and enhanced our understanding of developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohammed et al., 2017</xref>). Several scRNA-seq methods with different attributes have now been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziegenhain et al., 2017</xref>), with some providing depth – a good representation of full length transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>) from tens or hundreds of cells – and others providing breadth, with poorer representation of transcriptomes but from a much greater number of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>). scRNA-seq promises powerful new examinations of unicellular organisms, especially those that are difficult to obtain in large numbers or are not amenable to in vitro cultivation. A number of important questions in malaria biology will benefit from single-cell technology. For instance, what are the transcriptional switches in individual parasites that drive phenotypes such as commitment to the sexual development pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kafsack et al., 2014</xref>), parasite sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tembo et al., 2014</xref>) and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poran et al., 2017</xref>) demonstrated the use of a high-throughput, low-coverage scRNA-seq technique (Drop-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>]) to identify a signature of sexual commitment in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Here, we use a lower throughput (fewer cells), but higher coverage (both more genes detected and more of each gene’s length detected via full-length transcript sequencing) approach to examine transcriptional dynamics of the parasite during the blood stages in both the most popular rodent model parasite (<italic>P. berghei</italic>) and the most deadly human malaria parasite (<italic>P. falciparum</italic>). We show that this method is highly effective at capturing transcriptional variation associated with different parasite stages and cell cycle states, and we also uncover previously unknown aspects of the parasite's progression through its asexual cycle and in its sexual stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimisation of a single-cell RNA-seq protocol for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites</title><p>The greatest coverage of genes in mammalian cells using scRNA-seq has been achieved with the Smart-Seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>). In this method, cells are sorted by FACS into individual wells, followed by full-length cDNA generation using a viral reverse transcriptase. This mediates the addition of a triple cytosine overhang to the 3′ end to the first strand cDNA that allows the annealing of a strand switching oligonucleotide for second strand synthesis and direct cDNA amplification by PCR. This plate-based approach tends to result in detection of more transcripts from more genes than other approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Svensson et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, it is a full-length transcript method, providing information about transcript structure, allowing deconvolution of splicing variants and inference about the strand of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Initially, we trialled the standard version of the Smart-seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>) on sorted, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum-</italic>infected single red blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), adjusting only the number of PCR cycles (30 rather than 18) to account for the relatively low RNA content of protozoan cells.

The following reagents were tested: Oligo(dT)s containing a terminal anchoring base (A,G,C; V) or not (T) and of varying lengths (20 Ts vs. 30 Ts); four reverse transcriptase enzymes; 25 or 30 cycles of preamplification.

We generated libraries for pools of 10 sorted late stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells and tested the abundance of transcripts from the <italic>msp-1</italic> gene by quantitative RT-PCR. A longer, unanchored oligo(dT) primer (T30) significantly improved yield and SuperScript II and SMARTScribe were the highest yielding reverse transcriptases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Amplification for 25 and 30 cycles appeared to give equivalent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Initial trials were performed with 2 µl of lysis buffer, this was increased to 4 µl to augment capture efficiency. Permutations of the protocol that were tested were a terminal anchoring base (A,G,C; V) or not (T), two reverse transcriptase enzymes (Smartscribe (SmSc); Superscript II (SII)) and 25 or 30 cycles of preamplification.

experiments. First, single-sorted cells could actually comprise multiple cells, resulting in a hybrid signal that adds noise to downstream analyses. Second, ambient RNA from lysed cells in the cell suspension could be transferred along with intact cells into each well. To evaluate these potential sources of contamination, we flow-sorted individual parasites from a mixture of fluorescently-labelled GFP <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (Pf) and mCherry <italic>P. berghei</italic> (Pb) late-stage parasites into a 96-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then prepared and sequenced transcriptome libraries for each cell. The reads were mapped to a combined reference of both genome sequences. No evidence for doublet events was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and, for each cell, the vast majority of reads (98.1% for <italic>P.berghei</italic>, 99.4% for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) mapped uniquely to the genome of the expected species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The few transcripts that mapped to the wrong genome were those most highly expressed in the other species and most likely to be picked up from the solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). A very low number of individual ambient transcripts were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

We then removed genes unless they had at least ten reads in each of five or more cells. In total, we detected expression of 4579 genes: over 90% of genes in the <italic>P. berghei</italic> genome. From each cell, we identified expression from, on average, 1981 genes (~33%), similar to the proportion of transcriptomes detected in mammalian single-cell experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We also generated single-cell transcriptomes for the human malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and processed them using the same filtering procedure as for <italic>P. berghei</italic>.

First, we checked if some regions were overrepresented amongst our transcript sequences due to preferential amplification of less AT-rich sequences by PCR. Second, because the reverse transcriptase ought to process a complete mRNA in order to produce cDNA, we determined whether there was a bias against long genes. In fact, neither GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) nor gene length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) had an impact on transcript detection. In the case of many long genes, the lack of a length-bias could be due to the sequencing of mRNA fragments, rather than full-length sequences. This suggests that the Smart-seq2 protocol is susceptible to internal priming by oligo-d(T) (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nam et al., 2002</xref>]) and template-switching at the exposed 5’ ends of mRNA fragments. The benefit of this is that we are able to assay transcription levels of long and short genes with similar accuracy. Many RNA-seq approaches display a signal bias towards the 5’ or 3’ end of transcripts and in our data, a slight 5’ bias was detected that might also reflect binding of oligo(dT) to internal polyA-rich regions of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Using single-cell RNA-seq to resolve parasite populations</title><p>Having developed and assessed our protocol for sequencing single-cell transcriptomes, we next determined whether different parasite stages could be resolved among the 144 <italic>P. berghei</italic> mixed blood stage transcriptomes. Using a combination of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), k-means clustering using SC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiselev, 2016</xref>), and comparison to bulk transcriptome datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoo et al., 2016</xref>), we classified each cell as male, female, or asexual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Bulk RNA-seq studies monitoring transcriptional patterns along the complete asexual cycle of both human and rodent malaria parasite species have consistently revealed a continuous cascade of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bozdech et al., 2003b</xref>) similar to that seen in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>). Although these analyses have used synchronised parasite populations that allow reasonably tight windows of expression to be assayed, their resolution has been limited by surveying pools of cells within each expression window that can differ in developmental progression by several hours. Single-cell RNA-seq allows unsynchronised populations to be sampled, from across large parts of the cycle, and the order of cells in the cycle to be identified using pseudotime analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). Pseudotime analysis orders cells into developmental trajectories by identifying cells with transcriptomes that are most similar to each other and placing those closest to each other in order. To reconstruct the latter part of the asexual development cycle, we first used M3Drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews and Hemberg, 2016</xref>) to identify genes that varied between the asexual cells. This tool takes account of the large number of zero values (drop outs) in the data that are due to the low capture rate inherent in single-cell approaches. We then used these genes to compare each transcriptome and carry out a pseudotime analysis with Monocle 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). This enabled us to place each <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual cell along a developmental trajectory. The cell orderings determined by pseudotime analysis were highly concordant with previously published transcriptional studies of the developmental time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">López-Barragán et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoo et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Cluster 2 in <italic>P. berghei</italic> (equivalent to cluster 3 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>) was associated with the rhoptry secretory organelle, including <italic>ron2</italic>, <italic>ron4</italic>, <italic>ron5</italic>, <italic>ron12</italic>, <italic>rop14</italic>, <italic>rap1</italic> and <italic>rap2/3</italic>. Cluster 3 in <italic>P. berghei</italic> was enriched for the microneme secretory organelle and the inner membrane complex, including <italic>sub2</italic>, <italic>ama1</italic>, <italic>ripr</italic>, <italic>imc1c</italic>, <italic>imc1e</italic>, <italic>imc1f</italic>, <italic>imc1g</italic>, <italic>imc1m</italic> and <italic>isp3</italic>. This latter cluster was not captured in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. These clusters may represent discrete transcriptional modules that underlie parasitic cell cycle checkpoints during the transition from a metabolically active, fast growing trophozoite to a budding multinucleated schizont. We note that two essential ApiAP2 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) were associated with equivalent gene expression clusters in both species: PBANKA_1453700 (PF3D7_1239200) with the early cluster (1) and PBANKA_0939100 (PF3D7_1107800) with the late cluster (2), implicating them as potential regulators of these modules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Some types of transcripts vary independently of the asexual cell cycle and these are conserved between stages and between species</title><p>Like many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>), the point at which <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites are within their cell cycle dominates the transcriptional variation observed within a genetically clonal population. However, there are also genes that vary independently of the cell cycle including clonally variant gene families, which are found largely in the subtelomeric regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rovira-Graells et al., 2012</xref>). A unique chromatin environment is thought to allow switching between expression of different members of gene families and this mechanism allows parasite populations to adapt to the host immune system (<italic>var</italic> genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>), establish chronic infection (<italic>pir</italic> genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scherf et al., 2008</xref>) and vary red blood cell invasion pathways (p235) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Preiser et al., 1999</xref>). Because they enable the parasite to adapt to unexpected environments, members of these multigene families have been termed contingency genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reid, 2015</xref>). There is also evidence for variation in expression in response to nutrient sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mancio-Silva et al., 2017</xref>) and to a variety of chemical interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). We used a regression approach to identify genes that vary independently of the cell cycle (scLVM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buettner et al., 2015</xref>) by removing cell-cycle-dependent variation from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual cells. To train this method, we used genes that varied in pseudotime (i.e. the cell cycle). We found that the first two latent factors of the expression data were driven by the cell cycle, each explaining at least 5% of variation in cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). After adjusting for these, we identified 56 genes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual cells that showed residual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Unlike clonally variant genes identified in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rovira-Graells et al., 2012</xref>), these 56 genes were not located in subtelomeric regions. The products of these genes were involved in nucleosome assembly, the proteasome and vacuolar acidification, suggesting a role in controlling gene expression through transcription initiation, protein stability and protein localisation. The expression patterns of the 56 genes were not correlated, as might have been expected if they were part of a coordinated transcriptional response, such as a stress response. We therefore investigated whether the observed expression pattern resulted from variations in steady-state mRNA levels due to intermittent expression of these genes, followed by rapid mRNA decay. From a published dataset of mRNA half-lives in the asexual cycle, we found that these genes actually have moderately longer than average half lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that the variability of these genes was more likely to be driven by variable transcription initiation than by rapid decay. We found that these genes are more conserved in evolution than expected by chance (p=2.2e-16), and that that this is not simply because they tend to be highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Intriguingly, 22 of these 56 genes are also variably expressed genes in the sexual stages, suggesting an intrinsic variability across the life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3E</xref>). Furthermore, similar types of genes were variable in <italic>P. berghei</italic> sexual stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A,C</xref>), but we were unable to identify many cell-cycle-independent variable genes in <italic>P. berghei</italic> asexual cells, perhaps due to too few cells examined. It is yet to be seen whether the volatile expression of these genes is also reflected in protein abundance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33105.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>After removing the signal of cell cycle progression, we identify a new class of cell-cycle independent variable genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes with &gt;= 50% of their variance attributed to cell-cycle associated latent variable one vary in pseudotime.

Little is known about the role of these families in sexual stages and although transcriptional variation has not been observed, expression has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Florens et al., 2002</xref>) and suggests a role for contingency genes in transmission. Several important parts of transmission might require contingency genes encoding cell surface proteins. First, mature gametocytes are found in the blood and are thus susceptible to attack by the host adaptive immune system in much the same way as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> rings or <italic>P. berghei</italic> rings and trophozoites. Second, it has been suggested that gametocytes may cluster in order to make transmission more reliable and this might require antigenically variable cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pichon et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, after transmission, gametes face a complex and hostile environment in the mosquito midgut where male gametes must rapidly find females, which they do at rates that are difficult to explain without invoking non-random movement such as chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawniczak and Eckhoff, 2016</xref>). Our data revealed that males and females are very different in their expression of contingency gene families. In <italic>P. berghei</italic> male gametocytes, we observed significant variability of a set of <italic>pir</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2014</xref>) (p=0.014; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), whose protein products have previously been identified in male gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Talman et al., 2014</xref>), indicating a potential role in fertilization.

In asexual parasites, expression of two different non-coding <italic>var</italic> transcripts is common and is involved in maintaining the mutually exclusive <italic>var</italic> gene expression that is essential for their immune evasion role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit-Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guizetti and Scherf, 2013</xref>). They are both transcribed from a bidirectional promoter within the single <italic>var</italic> intron. This means that the presence of coding <italic>var</italic> transcripts in gametocyte transcriptomes can be assessed by identifying intron-spanning reads. We found that within any single female cell, only a single <italic>var</italic> gene had reads supporting correct splicing, suggesting that mutually exclusive expression of <italic>var</italic> genes occurs in sexual stages, as it does in asexual parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guizetti and Scherf, 2013</xref>). The coding <italic>var</italic> transcripts were always from internal <italic>var</italic> gene clusters, often with the <italic>upsC</italic> class of promoters, distinct from the subtelomeric <italic>var</italic> genes seen in asexual stages, with <italic>upsB</italic> and <italic>upsA</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Single male gametocytes were not represented well in this study, so instead we examined previously published bulk male and female gametocyte RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lasonder et al., 2016</xref>) for male <italic>var</italic> gene expression. Male gametocytes only ever showed mRNA from a single <italic>var</italic> gene, <italic>var2csa</italic>, known for its importance in pregnancy related malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This gene has also been proposed as an important regulator of <italic>var</italic> gene expression switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mok et al., 2008</xref>).

We observed a marked, conserved sex-specific pattern of TF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, one female-specific TF in particular (ap2-o) has been previously shown to have a female function and is likely to have a role in differentiating male and female forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Modrzynska et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have established an optimised protocol for generating single-cell transcriptome sequences of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites with power to identify not only different cell types but also to explore potential functional variation from one cell to another.

We hope that this optimisation framework may assist in extending full-length transcript scRNA-seq to a much wider range of diverse eukaryotic cell types.</p><p>As well as establishing a new tool, our study has made several new observations about <italic>Plasmodium</italic> biology. First, we used single-cell data to produce high-resolution surveys of schizogony and observed sharp transcriptional transitions over the asexual life cycle, which was previously thought to be a continuous process. The intracellular cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is complex, consisting of several rounds of endomitotic DNA replication followed by a final synchronised cytokinesis. Although checkpoints are most likely required to ensure timeliness of complex cellular events, such as assembly of the red cell invasion machinery, they have not yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerald et al., 2011</xref>). We speculate that the sharp transitions we have observed correspond to such checkpoints. Although we found clues as to the possible underlying regulatory architecture, the true regulators remain to be confirmed.</p><p>A second major finding of our study was unexpected cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. Most genes are known to vary during the asexual, blood stage cell cycle with a single peak of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozdech et al., 2003a</xref>). Some genes in subtelomeric regions are known to vary independently of the cell cycle, by switching on and off in individual parasites. These include the multigene families of contingency genes known to be involved in sequestration and chronic infection (<italic>var</italic> and <italic>pir</italic>). But unexpectedly we found another class of genes varying independently of the cell cycle both in cycling and arrested cells. We found that, unlike contingency genes, they were highly conserved between species and the same types of genes were variable in parasite species infecting both humans and rodents. One could speculate that this is due to noisier signals associated specifically with some cellular function for which it is beneficial to relax transcriptional control. Generating variation in a population of many millions of closely related parasites occupying an ever varying host environment may be a bet-hedging strategy favouring success of at least some of the members of this population.</p><p>Finally, because our approach was able to dissect both male and female gametocyte transcriptomes, and assess expression of multigene families, we were able to discover an unexpected sex-specificity in expression of several multigene families. Especially intriguing is that these families are known to encode extracellular proteins involved in host-parasite interactions in asexual blood stages. They could have similar host interactive functions not yet described for sexual stages or have uncharted roles in sexual behaviour of the parasite. In the mammalian host, they might be involved in sequestration of mature gametocytes in the peripheral vasculature, as an immune evasion strategy or to aid in transmission through a mosquito bite. The sex-specific nature of the expression of <italic>var</italic> and <italic>pir</italic> genes could also indicate a possible role in fertilisation in the mosquito midgut.</p><p>Single-cell RNA-seq will have many applications for malaria parasites.

Trimmed, paired reads were mapped to either genome sequence using <italic>hisat2 --max-intronlen 5000 p 12</italic>. For the dual sort experiment, we mapped against a combined reference, allowing us to exclude reads that map to both genomes. SAM files were converted to BAM using <italic>samtools-1.2 view –b</italic> and sorted with <italic>samtools-1.2 sort</italic>. GFF files were downloaded from GeneDB (October 2016) and converted to GTF files using an in-house script. All feature types (mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, pseudogenic_transcript and ncRNA) were conserved, with their individual ‘coding’ regions labelled as CDS in every case for convenience. Where multiple transcripts were annotated for an individual gene, only the primary transcript was considered. Reads were summed against genes using HTSeq: <italic>htseq-count -f bam -r pos -s no –t CDS</italic> (v0.6.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2015</xref>];). HTSeq excludes multimapping reads by default (-a 10). This means that reads mapping ambiguously to similar genes from the same family, are not considered in our analysis. For downstream analysis (excluding examination of rRNA counts), transcripts not included in the GeneDB cDNA sequence files were excluded.

We concentrated here on rRNA because we had observed that this was a particular problem. To do this we began with HISAT2 BAM files produced as described above. Total read pairs were all the unique read pair identifiers. Ribosomal RNA reads were counted using <italic>bedtools intersect</italic> (v2.17.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>];) to find the overlap of unique read pair ids with rRNA features. Other coding reads were counted in the same way, but looking for overlap with all other features. Unmapped reads were identified using <italic>samtools view -f 0 × 8</italic> (v1.2) and extracting unique read pair identifiers. Where a read pair occurred in more than one of these lists, it was counted as ambiguous.</p><p>We compared the library complexity of different iterations of our protocol in order to determine whether more reads resulted in more complexity, or simply more reads from the same genes, perhaps due to large numbers of PCR cycles. Different sequencing runs had very different library sizes and so we downsampled the data. To maximise the number of cells included, while also allowing a reasonable number of reads per cell, we chose to downsample to 50,000 reads per cell. To do this, 50,000 counts from HTSeq were randomly sampled for each cell. Counts associated with protein coding genes were enumerated and genes were called as detected if there were at least 10 reads mapping to them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Assessing bias in single-cell sequencing libraries</title><p>Different library preparation and sequencing protocols exhibit different biases in representation of GC/AT-rich sequences and 5` or 3` transcript ends. In order to assess such biases, we took an approach of using the mapped RNA-seq data to identify fragments of genes that were expressed and examined the coverage of genes by these fragments. The reason for doing this, rather than looking at coverage depth was that we had noticed that genes often did not have full coverage, particularly when very long or expressed at a low level. This suggests that, although we would expect Smartseq-2 to amplify full length transcripts, in some cases only partial transcripts survived the full protocol. We used Stringtie (v1.2; default options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>];) to call expressed fragments from our HISAT2 BAM files. We then looked for Stringtie transcript features overlapping each mRNA feature in our reference annotation. Where multiple Stringtie transcripts overlapped each other, these were merged. We then determined, for each gene, the exonic sequence covered by the merged Stringtie transcripts. The length, GC content and relative start and end of these regions was calculated. Observed GC content was compared against the GC content for the whole coding region. Each relative position along a coding sequence (0–100) covered by a fragment was incremented for each fragment covering it. The coverage of each relative position for each gene was then normalised between 0 and 1 based on the highest coverage across that coding sequence. To examine the effect of gene length, we compared the length distribution of all 4943 <italic>P. berghei</italic> genes used in our initial analysis to the 4579 which passed our filtering criteria (having at least 10 reads in at least five cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of contamination with a dual sort of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> schizonts</title><p>Reads for the dual sort samples were mapped as above, but to a combined reference of both parasites, enabling reads that map equally well to both genomes to be discarded as their origin could not be determined. Read counts were converted to FPKMs and transcripts with an FPKM &gt;= 10 were counted as expressed. We used these data to show that no well contained more than one cell, that is wells with good data (a large number of expressed genes) never had similar numbers of genes from both species. Furthermore, no good wells contained a large number of genes from the incorrect species. To explore whether contaminating genes were similar in different wells, we compared <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes identified in wells with a <italic>P. berghei</italic> cell sorted into them and vice versa between wells. Similarity was calculated as the number of common contaminating genes with an FPKM &gt;= 10, divided by the average number of contaminating genes between the two wells. Each cell contained very few contaminating genes. This was higher for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> contamination of <italic>P. berghei</italic> than <italic>P. berghei</italic> contamination of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, suggesting <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells contribute more to extracellular RNA in the medium. Different cells shared very few contaminating transcripts, but the more commonly occurring contaminants were also more highly expressed in their cells of origin.</p><p>To examine the effect of contamination on downstream experiments, we filtered <italic>P. berghei</italic> transcriptomes to excluded those with fewer than 10,000 reads and fewer than 500 genes, leaving 16 cells out of 32. We then excluded genes which were not present with at least five read counts in at least two cells. Of 3566 transcripts detected in <italic>P. berghei</italic> cells (with at least five read counts in at least two cells), 15 were from <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The most highly expressed of these were two ribosomal RNA genes - PF3D7_0532000 and PF3D7_0726000. There were also other ribosomal RNA genes, histones and several known highly expressed genes such as MSP1, S-antigen, 60S ribosomal protein L6-2 and ETRAMP2. We then used M3Drop (min.genes = 500, MT threshold FDR = 0.01) to determine whether there were any variable genes across the samples. We found only four, none of which were from <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Filtering and normalisation of single-cell read count data</title><p>The three main datasets (Pb mixed, Pf asex, Pf sex) were processed using Scater v1.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>). Firstly we removed genes with no counts in any cell, and the control cells (100 cell pools). We then removed cells with a total of less than or equal to 25000 read counts and/or less than 1000 genes with at least one read. Subsequently we removed genes that did not have at least 10 reads in 5 cells. For the <italic>P. berghei</italic> dataset, this resulted in 144/183 cells and 4579 unique genes detected across all cells. For the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocyte dataset, there were 191/238 cells and 4454 unique genes after filtering and for the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual dataset 161/180 cells and 4387 unique genes. The counts were then normalised using scran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lun et al., 2016</xref>) (v1.0.3). Normalisation is required due to technical variation between samples due to, for example, variable sequencing depth and capture efficiency. Single-cell RNA-seq read count data contain many zeroes compared to bulk RNA-seq data. These are caused by drop out of low expressed genes or variation between cells and reduce the accuracy of normalisation methods designed for bulk RNA-seq data. Scran uses a pooling approach to reduce these zeroes. Furthermore, it allows an initial clustering of the data and normalisation within these clusters (e.g. cell types), prior to a final normalisation step across the whole dataset. This is particularly useful for our <italic>P. berghei</italic> data, where the asexual, male and female gametocyte cells differ greatly in their expression patterns. The initial clustering step was performed with the <italic>scran</italic> function <italic>quickCluster</italic> (minimum size = 30). This resulted in three clusters representing the asexual, male and female gametocyte populations. The <italic>computeSumFactors</italic> function was run using these clusters, with sizes = 20 and positive = TRUE. All downstream analyses were performed with the scran normalised data except where stated. For <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes, the <italic>computeSumFactors</italic> function was run with sizes = 15. For <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual stages, we set min.size = 20 for quickCluster and the <italic>computeSumFactors</italic> function was run with sizes = 10.</p><p>For some applications, it is necessary to normalise the data by transcript length. For instance, when comparing ranked gene expression values to reference data for determining life cycle stage of a cell. We therefore normalised the scran values by taking the exponent (2<sup>x</sup>), multiplying by 1000 and dividing by the cDNA length, determined from the GeneDB cDNA FASTA file (coding sequence only, no UTRs). This is similar to the FPKM calculation, except the library size normalisation is already accomplished. We refer to these values as <italic>l-scran</italic>, for length-normalised scran values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Determining parasite life cycle stages using bulk reference data and clustering</title><p>We used several bulk RNA-seq data sets to assign a life cycle stage to each cell. For <italic>P. berghei</italic> asexual stages, we used both microarray data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoo et al.

In the Hoo microarray experiment, Cy5 was used to label each time point while Cy3 was used to label a pool of all samples. The ‘F635 Median - B635’ values are the difference in Cy5 intensity between the median foreground and the median background. This intensity value is related to the actual expression level and these are the values we used. Their data were generated using the <italic>P. berghei</italic> v2 genome assembly, so we remapped their probe sequences against v3 using HISAT2 (default parameters; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>]). We then used <italic>htseq-count -a 200 f sam -r name -s no</italic> to identify the genes to which the probes mapped (cut -f1,21 probes_berghei_htseq.sam | grep PBANKA | grep -v ambiguous &gt;probes_berghei.map). We then used the GPR files provided from ArrayExpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parkinson et al., 2005</xref>) (accession GSE80015) and the probe map to produce a table of percentile ranks for each gene in each condition. RNA-seq reads from the Otto et al. dataset were downloaded from the ENA (PRJNA212241). They were mapped to <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA v3 transcript sequences using Bowtie2 v2.2.9 (-a -X 800; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>]) and eXpress v1.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roberts and Pachter, 2013</xref>). The resulting read counts were converted to FPKM.</p><p>Single-cell gene expression values were converted to length normalised scran values (l-scran), as described above, in order to produce more accurate rank expression levels for our scRNA-seq data. We compared each single-cell expression profile against each reference data set. To reduce noise, genes that do not vary greatly between conditions in the reference data were removed. For the <italic>P. berghei</italic> 24 hr intraerythrocytic developmental cycle reference data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoo et al., 2016</xref>), genes were only included if their expression profile had a mean rank of greater than 30 and less than 70 and standard deviation in rank across samples of greater than 3. Genes from the query dataset with l-scran &lt;3 were also removed. A minimum of 100 remaining genes common to both the reference and query profiles were required to calculate a correlation between them. The Spearman rank correlation was used in order make the microarray and RNA-seq datasets more comparable. The best correlation of a single-cell expression profile with a reference expression profile was taken as the stage prediction for that single-cell. As new data (e.g. single-cell analysis of timepoints across the full, synchronised erythrocytic development cycle) become available, benchmarking staging algorithms will become feasible. Bulk RNA-seq data to classify <italic>P. berghei</italic> males and females directly was not available. Therefore, we used bulk RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Otto et al., 2014</xref>) that includes mixed-sex gametocyte samples, after converting the profiles to v3 using previous id annotation from PlasmoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aurrecoechea et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine distinct groups of single-cells based on their expression patterns, we used the clustering tool SC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiselev, 2016</xref>). We used the combined Euclidean, Pearson and Spearman distance, plus the combined PCA and spectral transformation. For the <italic>P. berghei</italic> dataset the optimal <italic>k</italic> was 3 (average silhouette width = 0.99), with four being nearly as good (average silhouette width = 0.97). We found that the additional cluster split the asexual parasites into trophozoites and schizonts, while both <italic>k</italic> values retained the male and female gametocytes as separate clusters. However, there was still extensive variation within these clusters so we further investigated this by excluding asexual cells and clustering again. With this reduced dataset we were able to get a new, robust clustering with k = 3 (width = 0.99). Here, outliers from both the putative male and female clusters clustered together, exclusive of the core of male and female clusters. Markers suggested that six of these outlier cells possessed both male genes and asexual genes, while a single cell possessed both female genes and asexual genes. It is possible that these cells are early gametocytes, committed schizonts or cells doubly infected with both asexual and sexual parasites. These were excluded from further analysis. The <italic>markers</italic> function of SC3 (AUROC threshold 0.85, p-value threshold 0.01) was used on the initial clustering, with k = 3, to identify novel markers for asexuals, males and females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Bulk RNA-seq data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otto et al.

To do this, expression value data, ordered by pseudotime, were normalised, then Fourier transformed, sorting transcripts according to the phase of the most prominent frequency. Signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios were calculated for each transformed signal and normalised with respect to the maximum achievable value for the dataset.

To fit the latent cell cycle factor, we used the 2104 genes identified as differentially expressed in pseudotime using Monocle with corrected p-value&lt;=0.01. We were aware from our PCA analysis that the first two principal components were likely driven by the cell cycle, and found using the latent factor analysis that only the first two factors explained at least 5% of variation in cell cycle genes. Therefore, we refitted the model with two latent factors. We identified only four genes that had &gt;= 50% of their variance attributable to biological noise after correction, for example the variation in their expression is largely not driven by the cell cycle or by technical noise. These appeared to be driven by a small number of potential outlier cells, which had not been identified in previous analyses.

Gene ontology terms for <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes were extracted from GeneDB EMBL files.

In order to identify sense transcripts, we looked for reads mapping over the single intron of each <italic>var</italic> gene.

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lawniczak et al., utilize cutting edge technology to inspect the transcriptional dynamics of two malaria parasite species at single-cell resolution. In addition to generating new scRNA data, the authors make good use of existing public datasets, thoroughly remapping to updated genomes and reanalyzing from scratch for more reliable comparisons to the current work. This paper reports evidence that the canonical waveform model of transcription during the intra-erythrocytic development cycle (IDC), based on bulk analysis of synchronized cultures, is actually characterized by more discrete transitions that are only evident at single-cell resolution. They further implicate transcription factors that are temporally associated with key transition points and go on to discuss IDC independent genes. This is very well written paper and it is a very nice addition to the literature. The study presents a great deal of well-curated data. Collectively, the reviewers considered this work to be of a valuable contribution to the literature on the subject of discrete gene expression that as has been thought comes in waves in Plasmodium.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was an agreement amongst the reviewers that the authors need to provide a more thorough but tempered discussion of intraerythrocytic development cycle transcriptomics. The authors are also requested to provide a more complete and transparent description of the methodology, particularly describing filtering method, as it could be the source of discrepant interpretations.</p><p>2) One of the possibly exciting observations is that pir genes may be needed for fertilization. Based on what is shown in the spreadsheets, this appears to be true. However, members of multigene families are known to be problematic, as they may mitotically recombine during routine culture and reads can map to multiple places in the genome-for example, one that is mentioned by the authors (PBANKA_1246400), although not mapping perfectly to other pir genes, still gives an e values of zero in BLASTN owing to stretches of identity that may be 60 bases or more long (e.g. PBANKA_0700061.1)). Although the authors say that this shouldn't be a problem and that the filters/parameters that they used should appropriate it would be good to see some sort of supportive data to make sure this isn't an alignment artifact. Maybe the authors could generate a figure with the actual RNA-seq sequences for a few genes? The sequences that are obtained in this single cell method might have a significantly higher error than other methods, and this could create alignment problems. Alternatively, perhaps the authors may want to prove some orthologous evidence?</p><p>3) The depiction of a discontinuous pattern of gene expression throughout the life cycle is not particularly convincing. Two issues may confound this description. Firstly, that pseudotime does not scale evenly to time (i.e. one unit of pseudotime may equal minutes at one part of the lifecycle and hours at another). This would undermine the ability to detect abrupt shifts. Secondly, through the life cycle there is a tremendous increase in RNA abundance. The detectability of genes through the lifecycle would vary along with this (as would the robustness of scRNAseq).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33105.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was an agreement amongst the reviewers that the authors need to provide a more thorough but tempered discussion of intraerythrocytic development cycle transcriptomics.

Alternatively, perhaps the authors may want to prove some orthologous evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your excitement about our findings. We do not believe that there are mapping problems relating to multigene families of the sort described by the reviewer because we do not allow reads to map to multiple places in the genome. We count each read only once if it has an unambiguous (unique) mapping and not at all if it is ambiguous (aligns to multiple places). Those genes which we analyse must have sufficient unique sequence to be uniquely identified.</p><p>The example suggested by the reviewer of <italic>pir</italic> genes PBANKA_1246400 and PBANKA_0700061 is a good one, because they are indeed very similar and we detect expression of both genes in some of the same cells. We confirmed that when we blast the spliced nucleotide sequence of PBANKA_1246400 back against the genome, it hits PBANKA_0700061 with an E-value of 0. However, there are many mismatches. Only 88% of the bases match. Most reads of 50-75 base pairs would come from stretches with a mismatch. We then looked at how many reads map uniquely to the genes in a particular cell as suggested by the reviewer. The male <italic>P. berghei</italic> gametocyte sample PbMB.186 expressed both these genes at a reasonably high level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows reads from this sample mapped to the two genes. We found 221 unfiltered reads (e.g. some may map to multiple places) mapping to PBANKA_0700061. When we removed reads mapping to multiple places, by excluding those with a mapping quality &lt; 10, we found 137 reads still mapped. This filtering is exactly the same as what we do for our main analyses – mapping quality of &lt;10 means that the reads map in multiple places. For PBANKA_1246400 we counted 403 reads (unfiltered) versus 379 (filtered). Therefore, despite some regions, around the length of a read, of 100% identity between the two genes, most reads map uniquely. It is heartening that despite such high identity between members of a gene family, RNA-seq is robustly able to identify them uniquely.</p><p>We have made this point more clearly in the methods section when describing our mapping strategy:</p><p>“HTSeq excludes multimapping reads by default (-a 10). This means that reads mapping ambiguously to similar genes from the same family, are not considered in our analysis.”</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33105.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Many reads map uniquely to similar <italic>pir</italic> genes.</title><p>Despite being very similar in identity (88% at the nucleotide level), most reads deriving from these transcripts map uniquely. It is notable here that there appears to be variable splicing of coding regions of PBANKA_1246400. This is a novelty which we are currently following up. Genes are shown in yellow.

However, it is unlikely that a sequencing error would lead a read to map better to even a closely related gene than to the gene of origin. The chance of having an error in exactly the right place to make it look like another gene is very low and Illumina errors are random. Because errors are random, reads will not systematically map to the incorrect gene. We did some further analysis and found that 99.6% of mapping reads had no more than two errors. Reads with more errors were mapped evenly across the genome with no more than two or three in a single gene.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows mismatches between reads and the reference as red marks on the reads. These show that the errors are infrequent, random, and that there are no systematic differences between the reads and the reference. Furthermore, there is no evidence of unannotated gene duplication, which might occur during mitotic recombination as suggested by the reviewer. This would be evidenced by consistent red marks over individual positions, e.g. where the gene is duplicated and has one or more mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The depiction of a discontinuous pattern of gene expression throughout the life cycle is not particularly convincing. Two issues may confound this description. Firstly, that pseudotime does not scale evenly to time (i.e. one unit of pseudotime may equal minutes at one part of the lifecycle and hours at another). This would undermine the ability to detect abrupt shifts. Secondly, through the life cycle there is a tremendous increase in RNA abundance. The detectability of genes through the lifecycle would vary along with this (as would the robustness of scRNAseq).</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that pseudotime does not scale evenly to real time we do not think that this affects our conclusions. It is the absence of cells expressing only some members of the gene clusters we identified that indicates an abrupt transition. If cells spent a significant amount of time over intermediate stages e.g. turning off some genes from cluster 1 and turning on others from cluster 2, we would expect to observe them in some of our datasets. In addition to our own datasets, we have observed the same abrupt shifts in the more high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq experiment of Poran et al., 2017. While their approach detects fewer genes than ours, their study does have many more cells than ours. It would therefore have a better chance of capturing any intermediates if they were present. We do not see these, giving further support to the claim based on our own data (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Total RNA quantities indeed vary greatly across the life cycle. This is most keenly seen in rings, which have very low levels of RNA. However, we are concerned in this study only with trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes. The difference between these stages is less severe. Trophozoites are the most transcriptionally active stage according to recent work Otto et al., 2010 and we observe around twice as many genes being expressed there as in schizonts. However, detectability in scRNA-seq experiments has more to do with mRNA levels of individual transcripts than the cell as a whole. There is a well understood relationship between expression level and detectability of a transcript (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/25/065094). In this context detectability is referred to as drop-out rate. In gene cluster 1, we observed transcripts at a variety of different expression levels and drop-out rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) and yet their expression ceases to register at the same time (Cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> of manuscript). Furthermore, despite a drop in overall mRNA content, moving towards schizonts, we see a large number of genes, at a range of expression levels and drop-out rates, all come on at the same time in cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> of manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We find it very unlikely that anything other than large, simultaneous changes in expression levels of genes within each cluster is responsible for the discontinuous patterns we have observed.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33105.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Plots of expression level against dropout rate for each cluster.</title><p>These data show that dropout rates within each cluster are generally very low and expression levels are high but cover a range of values.
