We report the structure of tetrameric HMPV M2-1. Each protomer features a N-terminal zinc finger domain and an α-helical tetramerization motif forming a rigid unit, followed by a flexible linker and an α-helical core domain. The tetramer is asymmetric, three of the protomers exhibiting a closed conformation, and one an open conformation. Molecular dynamics simulations and SAXS demonstrate a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations in solution. Structures of adenosine monophosphate- and DNA- bound M2-1 establish the role of the zinc finger domain in base-specific recognition of RNA. Binding to ‘gene end’ RNA sequences stabilized the closed conformation of M2-1 leading to a drastic shift in the conformational landscape of M2-1. We propose a model for recognition of gene end signals and discuss the implications of these findings for transcriptional regulation in pneumoviruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02674.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02674.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02674.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To produce a protein from a gene, the gene must first be transcribed to make a molecule of RNA. In general, the enzyme building the RNA molecule stops building when it reaches the end of a gene and encounters a termination signal. When a virus replicates, however, it needs to transcribe all the genes in its genome, so it relies on antiterminator proteins to make the enzyme building the RNA ignore the termination signal. Therefore, medicines that stop antiterminators working could stop viral infections spreading.</p><p>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause severe respiratory infections in children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. A protein called M2-1 that is found inside HMPV must be present for the virus to infect humans, and it was recently shown that this protein plays a role in antitermination in a virus closely related to HMPV.</p><p>Using a range of techniques, including X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations, Leyrat et al. worked out the structure of M2-1 in HMPV, and showed that it can flip between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ forms. The open structure presents surfaces that could be targeted by antiviral drugs. When M2-1 binds to RNA, the closed structure is stabilized as a result of the RNA binding to two separate sites on the protein.</p><p>Leyrat et al. suggest that similar antiterminator proteins in related viruses—including respiratory syncytial virus, Marburg and Ebola—could also bind in this way. Leyrat et al. also propose a model describing how M2-1 can recognize the end of a gene, which could help with the development of new antiviral treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02674.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02674.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>human metapneumovirus</kwd><kwd>virus transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>structural virology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013 SILVER 260644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leyrat</surname><given-names>Cedric</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimes</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090532/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leyrat</surname><given-names>Cedric</given-names></name><name><surname>Renner</surname><given-names>Max</given-names></name><name><surname>Harlos</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name><name><surname>Huiskonen</surname><given-names>Juha T</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimes</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>060208/Z/00/Z and 093305/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huiskonen</surname><given-names>Juha T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099667/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renner</surname><given-names>Max</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Acadamy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>130750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huiskonen</surname><given-names>Juha T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Acadamy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>218080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huiskonen</surname><given-names>Juha T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics and small angle X-ray scattering shows that the transcription antiterminator M2-1 is a structurally dynamic homotetramer that undergoes large concerted conformational changes upon binding its target RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a negative-strand, non-segmented ssRNA virus of the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family and a major cause of acute respiratory tract infections in children, elderly and immunocompromised populations worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van den Hoogen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van den Hoogen et al., 2003</xref>). HMPV and the closely-related respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) constitute respectively the <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic> and <italic>Pneumovirus</italic> genera of the <italic>Pneumivirinae</italic> subfamily. These viruses share conserved replication strategies and similar genome organizations with other members of the <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> order, which includes numerous important human pathogens such as measles, rabies, and Ebola virus. The HMPV genome encodes nine proteins, three of which are necessary and sufficient for viral replication, namely the nucleoprotein (N), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and its essential cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P). The genomic RNA is encapsidated by the N protein, which acts as a template for the L protein that is responsible for both replication and transcription. The replicase is highly processive, and generates a complete, encapsidated positive-sense antigenome, which is in turn used as a template for the synthesis of genomic RNA. The transcriptase produces capped and polyadenylated monocistronic mRNAs using a sequential stop and restart mechanism in which the polymerase responds to <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals located in intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutherland et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Members of the <italic>Pneumovirinae</italic> subfamily harbour highly conserved 9–10 nucleotide transcription promoters (‘gene start’) and semi-conserved 12–13 nucleotide ‘gene end’ (GE) signals with the consensus sequence 5′-AGUUAnnnAAAAA-3′ (positive sense), which direct polyadenylation and release of nascent mRNA and are critical for polymerase processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harmon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutherland et al., 2001</xref>). Termination of each gene is required to allow transcription of the next gene downstream, and the propensity of the polymerase to dissociate from its template results in transcriptional attenuation at each gene junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fearns and Collins, 1999</xref>).</p><p>HMPV M2-1 is a basic protein of 187 amino acids that is required for virus infectivity in vivo, but has been found to be dispensable for recovery or growth of recombinant virus in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchholz et al., 2005</xref>). The closely-related M2-1 protein from avian metapneumovirus, which shares 85% sequence identity with HMPV M2-1, has been shown to increase minigenome expression by at least 100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Naylor et al., 2004</xref>). These observations are in contrast with studies of RSV M2-1, which was shown to be absolutely essential for transcription of full-length viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fearns and Collins, 1999</xref>). M2-1 proteins from HMPV and RSV are amongst the most conserved within the <italic>Pneumivirinae</italic> and share 38% overall sequence identity, suggesting similar functional roles. In addition, M2-1 shares structural and functional similarity with Ebola virus VP30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, the crystal structure of RSV M2-1 has been solved by X-ray crystallography, revealing a tight, disk-like tetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>), which contrasts with previous solution studies that suggested a non-globular, extended tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esperante et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>M2-1 is recruited to the viral transcription complex by the intrinsically-disordered P protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khattar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derdowski et al., 2008</xref>). The recruitment of M2-1 occurs through an interaction with the M2-1 core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in the formation of a high-affinity, non-globular complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esperante et al., 2012</xref>), which in RSV is controlled by phosphorylation of Thr108 of the P protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asenjo et al., 2006</xref>). Studies on RSV have shown that M2-1 functions as both an intragenic and intergenic transcription antitermination factor in <italic>Pneumoviruses</italic>, allowing synthesis of complete viral mRNAs and inhibiting transcription termination at the GE signal with various efficiencies, resulting in an increased proportion of polycistronic read-through mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardy and Wertz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hardy et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, NMR studies have shown that the RSV M2-1 core domain preferentially recognizes poly-A tails of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>), and this property has been confirmed with full-length protein using fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). On the basis of this data, it has been suggested that M2-1 likely binds nascent mRNA transcripts, thus preventing premature termination through stabilization of the transcription complex and inhibition of RNA secondary structure formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). As structural data are lacking for HMPV M2-1, its role in HMPV transcription antitermination has remained elusive.</p><p>In this study, we report X-ray crystallographic structures of the HMPV M2-1 at resolutions ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 Å. Unlike the disk-like assembly reported for RSV, our HMPV M2-1 structures revealed dissociation of one protomer core domain from the tetramer interface. Solution small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and atomistic coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that M2-1 behaves as a dynamic, modular protein in equilibrium between open and closed forms. Crystallographic studies of M2-1 bound to nucleic acids reveal how the M2-1 zinc finger specifically recognizes RNA. Finally, SAXS and electron microscopy showed that interaction with GE signals induces the closed conformation of M2-1, a process which is coupled with concentration-dependent aggregation in solution. Our results provide a structural basis for the recognition of GE signals by M2-1, and the prevention of premature mRNA termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HMPV M2-1 forms a tetramer with an open and a closed conformation</title><p>M2-1 crystallized in space group <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub> and its structure was solved at 2.5 Å resolution, by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) using zinc anomalous scattering (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The structure reveals an asymmetric tetramer, where three monomers display a canonical globular conformation, whilst unexpectedly, the fourth protomer adopts an open conformation where the core domain has flipped away from the rest of the molecule by approximately 60 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). This open conformation is in striking contrast with the symmetrical RSV M2-1 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, a second structure solved by molecular replacement at 2.1 Å resolution showed significant interdomain motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), in addition to highlighting the flexibility of the molecule and the importance of crystallographic packing for the stability of the assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In the open conformer, the core domain, which has dissociated from the tetramer, packs against closed subunits of crystallographically related molecules, resulting in the formation of a planar two-dimensional array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02674.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>X-ray data collection and refinement statistics</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02674.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02674.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Data Set</th><th>MAD–Peak</th><th>MAD–High-Energy Remote</th><th>Native</th><th>AMP-Soak</th><th>DNA-Soak</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">Data collection and processing statistics</td></tr><tr><td> λ (Å)</td><td>1.2828</td><td>1.2802</td><td>0.9686</td><td>0.9686</td><td>0.9795</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution range (Å)</td><td>33.13–2.47</td><td>33.13–2.51</td><td>44.81–2.10</td><td>49.80–2.01</td><td>63.04–2.28</td></tr><tr><td> Space group</td><td><italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub></td><td><italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub></td><td><italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub></td><td><italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub></td><td><italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td> Unit cell constants (Å)/(°)</td><td colspan="2">50.2, 92.7, 82.8/90.0, 94.5, 90.0</td><td>50.0, 93.4, 85.2/90.0, 95.4, 90.0</td><td>50.1, 93.6, 85.6/90.0, 95.8, 90.0</td><td>50.1, 93.9, 85.5/90.0, 95.8, 90.0</td></tr><tr><td> Measured Reflections</td><td>182, 655</td><td>167, 780</td><td>538, 740</td><td>660, 719</td><td>235, 027</td></tr><tr><td> Unique Reflections</td><td>27, 190</td><td>25, 798</td><td>45, 494</td><td>51, 659</td><td>35, 938</td></tr><tr><td> Completeness (%) (outer shell)</td><td>99.8 (99.9)</td><td>99.9 (99.7)</td><td>99.8 (99.2)</td><td>98.8 (85.1)</td><td>99.7 (98.8)</td></tr><tr><td> Multiplicity (%) (outer shell)</td><td>6.7 (6.7)</td><td>6.5 (3.3)</td><td>11.8 (5.8)</td><td>12.8 (5.1)</td><td>6.5 (5.0)</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>pim</sub> (outer shell)</td><td>0.039 (0.604)</td><td>0.031 (0.367)</td><td>0.021 (0.420)</td><td>0.019 (0.401)</td><td>0.023 (0.421)</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>merge</sub> (outer shell)</td><td>0.078 (1.338)</td><td>0.062 (0.516)</td><td>0.074 (0.937)</td><td>0.068 (0.839)</td><td>0.054 (0.843)</td></tr><tr><td> Mean (&lt;I&gt;/sd &lt;I&gt;) (outer shell)</td><td>12.2 (1.7)</td><td>14.9 (1.9)</td><td>23.1 (2.0)</td><td>22.5 (1.8)</td><td>19.6 (1.8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Refinement and Ramachandran statistics</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>wor</sub>k (%)</td><td colspan="2">23.34</td><td>19.23</td><td>18.64</td><td>19.35</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>free</sub> (%)</td><td colspan="2">26.15</td><td>22.20</td><td>20.83</td><td>22.21</td></tr><tr><td> RMSD Bond lengths (Å)</td><td colspan="2">0.012</td><td>0.009</td><td>0.010</td><td>0.009</td></tr><tr><td> RMSD Bond angles (°)</td><td colspan="2">1.18</td><td>1.00</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.03</td></tr><tr><td> Residues in preferred regions (%)</td><td colspan="2">95.3</td><td>97.8</td><td>97.3</td><td>97.3</td></tr><tr><td> Residues in allowed regions (%)</td><td colspan="2">3.9</td><td>2.2</td><td>2.4</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td> Outliers (%)</td><td colspan="2">0.8</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.3</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td> PDB ID</td><td colspan="2">4CS7</td><td>4CS8</td><td>4CS9</td><td>4CSA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02674.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of HMPV M2-1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top view (left) and side view (right) of M2-1 asymmetric tetramer in cartoon representation.

Interestingly, incubation of M2-1 with 5 mM of EDTA decreased the proportion of closed-state conformers from 50% to ∼20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,I</xref>), suggesting that a bound zinc ion and the integrity of the zinc finger motif is important for the stability of the closed state.</p><p>The addition of increasing concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) from 1 M to 3 M resulted in the disappearance of closed state conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>). In 1 M Gdn-HCl, 65% of the conformers are in an intermediate state with two core domains opened, while the addition of 3 M Gdn-HCl induces a shift in the equilibrium such that nearly 60% are found to be in the fully open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Addition of Gdn-HCl was unlikely to cause unfolding of the core domain or tetramer dissociation, as evidenced by the good quality of the fit using our models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This was despite some discrepancies in the molecular weight estimated from the SAXS data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), which may result from the low signal-to-noise ratio. The ability to shift the equilibrium towards open states with low concentrations of Gdn-HCl is consistent with the polar nature of the interactions between the core domain and the rest of the molecule, and suggests that these interactions are weak in solution. An additional possibility, that cannot be ruled out on the basis of the SAXS data given the low resolution of the technique, is that the disruption of the closed state by Gdn-HCl may be enhanced through destabilization of the zinc finger structure by the denaturant, as this would result in only minor changes in the scattering profile.</p><p>The conformational equilibrium of M2-1 quantified by ensemble analysis was corroborated by comparing dimensionless Kratky plots of M2-1 measured in different buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), providing a model-free analysis of M2-1 flexibility. The analysis shows that M2-1 measured in the presence of NDSB-201 is more flexible than a theoretical ensemble of closed state models, and that this flexibility is further increased by addition of Gdn-HCl. As the dimensionless Kratky plots are normalized by the particle's R<sub>g</sub> and forward scattering intensity I<sub>0</sub>, they also enable qualitative analysis of M2-1 conformational states in conditions where a small proportion of higher order oligomers is formed such as in the absence of NDSB. Normalized Kratky plots of data measured in the presence of 600 mM, 1.15 M or 3 M NaCl were relatively similar to the plot obtained in the presence of 500 mM NDSB, indicating a comparable equilibrium between open and closed states, and suggesting that the main effect that NDSB exerts on M2-1 in solution is the disruption of soluble aggregates.</p><p>Addition of AMP in the absence of NDSB and in the presence of high salt concentrations resulted in improved solubility and inhibited the formation of soluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The conformational landscape is dominated in these conditions by conformers in a fully open state (45%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,H</xref>), likely resulting from electrostatic screening. Addition of nucleotides in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 500 mM NDSB also led to an increase in open state conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>), as observed in 1.15 M NaCl buffer. Interestingly, measurements performed in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and in the absence of NDSB resulted in data that was consistent with an M2-1 tetramer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), but could not be fitted correctly with our ensemble (χ<sub>exp</sub> &gt;10), in particular at high Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>, bottom curve), suggesting that M2-1 binds AMP in these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>M2-1 binds more strongly to AMP than to other mononucleotides</title><p>To study the recognition of RNA by M2-1, we performed fluorescence-based thermal shift assays (TSA) in the presence of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Crystals soaked with CMP, GMP, or UMP (or UU and GUU) revealed no additional electron density, however addition of AMP led to F<sub>o</sub>–F<sub>c</sub> difference maps with strong density in the vicinity of the zinc finger. This region harbours conserved aromatic and positively charged residues on its surface, as can be seen in a superimposition with the equivalent RSV zinc finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In three protomers out of four, one AMP molecule is buttressed between the zinc finger and core domain of a crystallographically related molecule, resulting in clearly defined electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The proposed binding specificity enables a detailed interpretation of RNA binding results obtained for RSV M2-1 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al. (2014)</xref>. The authors reported an affinity of ∼20 nM for a poly-A 13-mer, which was decreased by only twofold on using the RSV positive SH gene end sequence (5′-AGUUAAUUAAAAA-3′), indicating that not all adenine bases are important for high affinity. Interestingly, a much larger change was observed when comparing the affinity of M2-1 for the negative F gene end (Kd ∼ 1 µM), which contains a single adenosine in position five, and the poly U, C, or G sequences (Kd &gt;100 µM). This indicates that A5 is indeed the main determinant of M2-1 RNA binding specificity. Additional binding stability is provided by the presence of an adenine in position six (n6), consistent with a fivefold increase in affinity measured for RSV M2-1 for the positive sense SH gene end (5′-AGUUAAUUAAAAA-3′) over the F gene end (5′-AGUUAUAUAAAAC-3′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>), which differ by the presence of an adenine at this position, and by the length of their A tract. Nucleotides in position seven and eight (n7/8) are located in between the two RNA binding sites, consistent with them being more variable. This model suggests that the length of this variable region is important for optimal recognition. Interestingly, the leader RNA sequence used in RNA titration experiments is quite similar to the portion of the gene end sequence that is recognized by M2-1, with an adenine base located four nucleotides upstream of an A<sub>6</sub> tract.</p><p>The proposed model of M2-1 recognition of RNA can be integrated into a model of the viral transcription complex in order to understand how M2-1 may affect transcription termination in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

The tetrameric P protein acts as a hub, connecting the nucleocapsid–RNA complex to the viral polymerase L and the M2-1 protein, and most probably prevents M2-1 aggregation observed in vitro. In this context, nascent viral mRNAs can be accessed by M2-1 and closure of the core domain triggered upon recognition of high affinity sequences such as gene ends and polyA tails. Because the binding of M2-1 core domain to RNA and P has been shown to be competitive due to partially overlapping binding surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>), the tetrameric nature of M2-1 enables specific RNA recognition, while maintaining a tight association with P.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The M2-1 protein functions as an antitermination factor by preventing premature transcriptional termination of long mRNAs and increases the synthesis of polycistronic read-through mRNAs by the polymerase, at least in RSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fearns and Collins, 1999</xref>).

Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of VP30 core domain have identified sets of residues that decreases both nucleocapsid protein (NP) binding and transcription activation (R179E, K180A, and K183E), or that decrease association with NP (E197A) without impairing transcription activation, that map to opposite faces of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartlieb et al., 2007</xref>). Comparisons between the functional surfaces of structurally aligned M2-1 and VP30 core domains indicate that the same face of the core domain might be involved in interaction with the zinc finger and oligomerization domains in both viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this scenario, mutation of VP30 R179, K180, and K183, on the face that is involved in interaction with the zinc finger and oligomerization domains, would prevent conformational changes in VP30 that are required for transcription activation, while mutation of E197 on the other face of the core domain would decrease binding to the NP protein without affecting VP30 conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The stability of the closed state is critical for M2-1 function</title><p>In solution, HMPV M2-1 samples a range of conformations between the open and closed state. This observation reconciles conflicting earlier solution and crystallographic studies obtained for RSV, where solution characterization suggested a non-globular, extended tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esperante et al., 2011</xref>) while the crystal structure indicated a compact, stable, intertwined tetrameric assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, mutating RSV M2-1 zinc finger residues Leu16 and Asn17 to the corresponding residues of murine pneumovirus (Ser and Arg, respectively) has identified these residues as critical to protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). In the RSV M2-1 crystal structure, Leu16 is involved in extensive hydrophobic contacts with the core domain, suggesting it stabilizes the closed tetramer, while Asn17 is exposed on the zinc finger surface. These residues map in HMPV to Asn16 and Arg17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and our structural data indicate that Asn16 is similarly involved in stabilization of the closed state of M2-1 through hydrogen bonding to Gln104. This suggests that the stability of the closed state and the fine-tuning of M2-1 dynamics are critical to antitermination. The role of Arg17 is less clear due to its aliphatic sidechain but it seems to be involved in RNA recognition, as well as intramolecular contacts with Glu20, Asn 77, and Tyr9 in the apoprotein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>M2-1 zinc finger specifically recognizes adenosine bases and binding is modulated by the protein conformational state</title><p>Numerous studies in RSV have investigated the functional role of the CCCH zinc finger of M2-1, demonstrating its involvement in M2-1 antitermination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardy and Wertz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). However, the nature of this involvement has remained unclear. Here, we obtained adenosine- and DNA-bound structures of the M2-1 zinc finger and have shown its homology to RNA binding eukaryotic motifs such as Nab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brockmann et al., 2012</xref>) or Tis11d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hudson et al., 2004</xref>). Using X-ray crystallography, we showed that the M2-1 zinc finger specifically recognized two adenine bases. Binding of the first adenine base in position five is stabilized in the closed state through induced folding of the disordered C-terminal of the protein onto the bound nucleotide. The interaction with the second adenine in position six was observed only in the open state, likely due to the interaction with Asn16 which is only flipped out in the open state and thus able to contact the adenosine ring. These observations reveal intricate communication between the zinc finger and core domains, leading to a modulation of RNA binding by the protein conformational state that may be important for M2-1 function. Specifically, these results suggest that binding at position six may be less stable in the closed state than in the open state, and result in increased exposure of this nucleotide to the solvent once the M2-1 core domain closes onto the zinc finger.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for intragenic and intergenic antitermination</title><p>The preference for adenosine, the observed compaction on addition of gene end RNA and its inhibition by EDTA, and the identity of RNA binding residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>), allow us to propose a model of gene end RNA recognition by M2-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The model suggests that the zinc finger recognizes A5 and A6, while the core domain binds to the poly-adenosine tract (A8 to A13). Interestingly, mutagenesis studies of the gene end sequences in RSV have shown that mutations of position five and six to nucleotides other than adenosine resulted in a strong decrease in antitermination efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harmon et al., 2001</xref>). This observation was surprising, given that the nucleotide in position six is not conserved within gene end sequences. However, the occurrence of an A in this position is associated in RSV with a higher affinity of the RNA for M2-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>), and with increased antitermination efficiency at the corresponding gene junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hardy et al., 1999</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that differential recognition of the nucleotide in position six of the gene end sequence by the zinc finger may result in exposure of n6 in the bound state, enabling the polymerase to discriminate between different gene junctions. Nucleotides n7 and n8 are located in between the two binding sites, consistent with their lack of conservation. In particular, mutations of n7 to any of the four nucleotides were found to have a minimal effect on antitermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harmon et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, the position of the A-tract relative to the upstream sequence element and a minimum length of five A bases has been shown to be critical for antitermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harmon et al., 2001</xref>).Our model is entirely consistent with these findings.</p><p>The nucleotides in position 2 to 4 (GUU) were also intolerant of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harmon et al., 2001</xref>), and are located in our model in close proximity to Arg3 and Lys4, which have been shown to have a moderate effect on RSV M2-1 RNA binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, our DNA-bound structure suggests that M2-1 zinc finger might bind bases located in position three or four, perhaps with lower specificity as positions five and six, as no binding was observed when crystals were soaked with UMP or GMP (data not shown).</p><p>The dynamic equilibrium between the M2-1 open and closed states likely confers to the protein the flexibility required to bind non-specific RNA sequences, by allowing modulation of the distance between the A-tract and the upstream sequence element. Interestingly, in proteins with multiple binding sites linked by intrinsically disordered regions, observed higher binding rates have been explained by ‘a fly casting’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shoemaker et al., 2000</xref>). This suggests that the sampling of a larger volume by M2-1 through the flexible linker may result in increased RNA scanning and binding rates. It may also allow binding to both genomic RNA and nascent mRNA transcripts, contributing to intragenic antitermination, by prevention of premature dissociation of the polymerase during transcription. When the spacing between optimally recognized RNA motifs becomes sufficiently small for M2-1 to recognize them in the closed state, the protein is locked in a closed state. This feature enables M2-1 to detect gene end sequences in its environment, and presumably also poly-adenosine sequences. Conformational changes induced by simultaneous binding may be recognised by the viral polymerase L, resulting in polyadenylation and release of the mRNA transcripts. It is currently unknown whether the signal is sensed solely through the intermediate of the P protein, or involves a direct interaction between M2-1 and L as has been suggested for VP30 in filoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Groseth et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, the tetrameric nature of both M2-1 and P, together with the reported competitive binding of P and RNA onto M2-1 core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tran et al., 2009</xref>), suggests that the tetrameric state could enable binding of RNA simultaneously to one or two subunits without disruption of the M2-1/P interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Negative cooperativity in binding RNA, as observed in RSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>), would favour this mechanism. The P protein might additionally play a role in preventing M2-1 aggregation in the presence of RNA, and act as a chaperone for M2-1 as it does for the nucleoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leyrat et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Oligomerization of M2-1</title><p>We observed, using SAXS, that M2-1 forms higher order oligomers in a variety of conditions. In particular, we found that RNA binding induces the closed conformation of M2-1, and is coupled with aggregation into linear and branched polymers, which could be observed by electron microscopy. While these structures may simply arise from nonspecific electrostatic interactions and are likely not relevant to M2-1 antitermination activity, the ability of M2-1 to exist in both open and closed states suggests that the protein may engage in domain swapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gronenborn, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, RSV M2-1 has been shown to mediate interactions between the viral nucleocapsids and the matrix protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>), and electron cryotomography of RSV virions has revealed a protein layer located between the matrix protein and ribonucleoproteins assigned to M2-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liljeroos et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that higher order oligomeric forms of HMPV M2-1 might be involved in viral morphogenesis and may adopt specific structures in the presence of M and viral nucleocapsids, as was recently shown for RSV, where M2-1 was found to coincide with genomic RNA and to closely follow its distribution within filamentous viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiss et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we have determined the crystal and solution structures of HMPV M2-1, unveiling a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations.

This question should be answered or the aggregation/higher oligomer formation part be removed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the comments concerning the biological relevance of these observations and concede that we should have been more explicit in the Results and Discussion in stating that the aggregation observed by SAXS and EM in presence of RNA reflects biophysical, rather than biological properties of the protein. Indeed, as pointed out by the reviewers, they may arise from non-specific electrostatic interactions.</p><p>The rationale for including the EM observations of M2-1 aggregates is technical rather than biological, as it confirms that these assemble from globular units, as inferred from solution SAXS data. The SAXS reveals that even though aggregation occurs, by analysing the normalized Kratky plots, we are still able to extract information on the open and closed state of M2-1 in the presence of RNA. Normalized Kratky plots represent a reliable, model-free analysis that is frequently used in polymer science but was only recently popularized for the analysis of protein flexibility (Receveur-Bréchot et al., 2012). This type of analysis thus is a facet of BioSAXS that is not commonly exploited, and data showing the formation of soluble aggregates are often discarded without further analysis. For this reason, we believe it is useful to confirm the SAXS analysis with an additional technique such as EM.</p><p>Since M2-1 functions in complex with N, P and L within the viral transcription/replication complex, the ability of M2-1 to associate with RNA and/or with neighboring M2-1 tetramers is tightly controlled in vivo. Specifically, association of M2-1 with tetrameric P is likely to prevent the formation of any atomic contacts between M2-1 tetramers and thus inhibit M2-1 aggregation. Additionally, genomic RNA is encapsidated by N and likely is not accessible to M2-1 because of steric hindrance from P and L. Consequently, only transcribed viral mRNA will be available for binding M2-1 and thus M2-1 will never exist in the presence of an excess of RNA. Thus carrying out a reverse titration of M2-1 into a solution of RNA would then also be of doubtful biological relevance since, in the context of the viral lifecycle, M2-1 will not be in excess of RNA and N,P and L are not present. We have produced a scheme illustrating how M2-1 may function in the presence of N, P and L, which has been included as a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>To clarify this issue of biological relevance, the titles and contents of the paragraphs describing M2-1 aggregation in the Results and Discussion have been modified, the EM observations have been moved to a new figure supplement, and it is now clearly stated in the text that M2-1 aggregation is not relevant to M2-1 antitermination activity.</p><p><italic>2) Are the authors sure that addition of the Guanidinium Hydrochloride does not unfold for example the zinc finger domain? The addition of EDTA which unfolds the zinc finger domain seems to populate similar regions in the plot as the addition of 2M Gd Hcl. This issue could in principle be easily investigated by measuring CD spectra at the same condition as the SAXS data which would either show that all secondary structure elements are preserved or not</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers point out that Gdn-HCl may unfold the Zn finger domain of M2-1, which indeed is a possibility that cannot be completely ruled out on the basis of the SAXS data. Our ensemble analysis allows us to conclude that Gdn-HCl doesn't cause tetramer dissociation, or unfolding of the tetramerization helix or core domains, as this would result in larger increases in radius of gyration, and in the case of tetramer dissociation, changes in the calculated molecular weight. For the same reason, it is likely that the zinc finger doesn't adopt completely extended conformations in the presence of moderate amounts of Gdn-HCl. However, in the case of the Zn-finger domain, the expected changes on the scattering profile would be small and thus we can't exclude this possibility. This has now been clearly stated in the text.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, changes in M2-1 secondary structure could in principle be monitored via circular dichroism. The analysis is in practice complicated by several factors. (1) In the case of M2-1, the equilibrium between open and closed states affects the stability of α1 in the zinc finger domain, and causes unfolding of the first alpha helix of the core domain (α3). This is in agreement with the crystal structures, in which higher B factors and lower quality electron density for the zinc finger are observed in the open state. Furthermore, unfolding of α3 is accounted for in our MD simulations and ensemble analysis of the SAXS data. This is also consistent with the fact that in RSV M2-1, α3 is present in the crystal structures reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>, however, adopts unfolded conformations in the NMR structure of the core domain from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blondot et al., 2012</xref>. These observations would make it difficult to assign any changes in the CD spectra to a particular region of the protein. (2) Measuring CD spectra of M2-1 in the presence of Gdn-HCl, NDSB-201, Tris and NaCl is challenging due to the heavy absorption of these compounds in the far UV region. This could in principle be overcome by using a shorter path length, however a very high concentration of M2-1 would be needed and this is very difficult to reach. (3) It is well known that low concentrations of Gdn-HCl can induce molten globule states which retain some degree of compactness but may have a lower secondary structure content than the native protein.</p><p><italic>Discussion</italic>:</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear at all why the protein is a tetramer.

We believe that the requirement for a tetrameric M2-1 results from its function in anti-termination, and allows optimal binding to tetrameric P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tran et al. 2009</xref>, have shown that there is a competition between RNA and P binding to the M2-1 core domains, which suggests that the formation of a tetramer/tetramer complex between M2-1 and P enables M2-1 to recognize and close onto a single stranded viral mRNA without dissociating from the viral transcription complex.</p><p>The reviewers pointed out that comparisons between HMPV M2-1 and EBOV VP30 are missing from our study. We have run disorder predictions on VP30, which suggest that the protein might share a similar modular organization as M2-1, with additional disordered regions located at the N terminus and C terminus, as well as a much longer disordered region connecting the oligomerization domain with the core domain. The VP30 protein has been suggested to form hexamers via its oligomerization domain (residues 94 to112), and dimers via its core domain. Hartlieb et al. have identified mutants located on two opposite faces of the protein, both of which affected the ability of VP30 to co-immunoprecipitate the NP protein. One set of mutations (R179, K180, K183) also affected VP30 transcription activation. It is interesting to speculate on the effect these mutations could have on VP30 conformation and RNA binding and we have generated a figure to map and compare identified functional surfaces on M2-1 and VP30, as well as a new paragraph in the discussion<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>4) The authors cite, but don't really discuss Tanner's symmetric structure of M2-1</italic>. <italic>How can M2-1 conformational dynamics revealed in this study be used to decipher and reconcile Tanner's perfectly symmetric structure?

How do they explain a fully symmetric conformation of M2-1?</italic></p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, a discussion of the factors leading to symmetric versus asymmetric crystal structures of M2-1 is missing from our study. Interestingly, WT RSV M2-1 was crystallized at pH 10 in the presence of 0.1 M of 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS), and mutant RSV M2-1 (S58DS61D) crystallized at pH 8.5 and in the presence of 0.2 M trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is a well known stabilizer of protein folded states. The conformation of M2-1 may be further affected by the use of high pH, as the interface is rich in positively charged residues with a total of eight arginine or lysine residues. Most of these residues are involved in salt bridges and likely possess high pKa values, however, Lys19 and Arg38 are primarily involved in hydrogen bonds with neutral residues (Ala73 backbone oxygen and Asn40, Asn44 side chains), which may result in deprotonation at pH 10 and overstabilization of the closed state.</p><p>Regarding the solution structure of HMPV M2-1, our ensemble analysis shows that in the buffer conditions that we used for crystallization (150 mM NaCl and 500 mM NDSB-201), 50% of the molecules adopt a closed, symmetric conformation, 30% display dissociation of a single core domain (which is the state seen in the crystal structures), while the remaining molecules are in more open states, mostly with two core domains dissociated (15%), as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, white histogram bars. Given this distribution, one would expect the protein to have crystallized in its closed, symmetric state rather than in the intermediately open state observed in HMPV M2-1 crystals. However, it appears that this intermediate state was able to generate a stable crystal lattice, resulting in an equilibrium shift. These observations highlight the importance of using solution techniques to assess whether protein conformations seen in crystalline states are consistent with the structure in solution.</p><p><italic>5) Following up on point #4, could asymmetry seen in this paper be 'enhanced' by high salt and/or NDSB-201 used during purification? Interestingly, Tanner et al express M2-1 as a GST-fusion and purify it under native conditions</italic>.</p><p>The discussion regarding the effect of salt and NDSB-201 on the HMPV M2-1 structure is interesting and we have included additional SAXS data as a new supplement of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Data was measured in the presence of 600 mM, 1.15 M or 3 M NaCl and could not be fitted by our ensembles due to the presence of a small proportion of soluble aggregates/higher order oligomers. However, we were able to use normalized Kratky plots to assess the flexibility of M2-1 in these conditions by comparing them to the Kratky plots obtained in the presence of NDSB-201, Gdn-HCl or with a theoretical closed state ensemble of models. The data shows that the conformational equilibrium of M2-1 in the presence of 600 mM to 3 M NaCl is relatively similar to that observed with 500 mM NDSB-201, showing only a slight compaction in 3 M NaCl, which likely results from an increased hydrophobic effect. This additionally suggests that the main effect of NDSB-201 on the conformational equilibrium of M2-1 may be to prevent aggregation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
