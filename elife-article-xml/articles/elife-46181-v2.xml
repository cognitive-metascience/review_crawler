as signaling reporters and biomarkers to monitor pathway activities and determine cell type identities. However, a large amount of dynamic information is lost due to the long half-life of the fluorescent proteins. To better detect dynamics, fluorescent transcriptional reporters can be destabilized to shorten their half-lives. However, applications of this approach in vivo are limited due to significant reduction of signal intensities. To overcome this limitation, we enhanced translation of a destabilized fluorescent protein and demonstrate the advantages of this approach by characterizing spatio-temporal changes of transcriptional activities in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, by combining a fast-folding destabilized fluorescent protein and a slow-folding long-lived fluorescent protein, we generated a dual-color transcriptional timer that provides spatio-temporal information about signaling pathway activities. Finally, we demonstrate the use of this transcriptional timer to identify new genes with dynamic expression patterns.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46181.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fruit flies and other animals have complex body plans containing many different types of cells. To make and maintain these body plans, individual genes must be switched on and off at specific times in particular cells to control how the animal grows. Some of these genes may be switched on for long periods of time, while others may be rapidly switched on and off on repeated occasions.</p><p>Fluorescent reporter proteins have been extensively used to study gene activity in cells. Typically, this involves linking the gene encoding the fluorescent reporter to a gene of interest, so that when the gene is switched on a fluorescent protein will also be produced. The fluorescent protein emits light of a particular color and measuring this light provides a way to monitor a gene’s activity.</p><p>Unfortunately, fluorescent proteins tend to break down slowly, and the level of fluorescence emitted cannot fluctuate quickly enough to reflect rapid changes in gene behavior. One way to overcome this limitation is to use destabilized fluorescent proteins that degrade more rapidly inside cells. However, current strategies for creating these proteins cause them to emit less light, making fluorescence more difficult to detect.</p><p>To address this issue, He et al. developed a new green destabilized protein, adding elements that increase production of the protein so a greater amount of light can be emitted. The green destabilized protein was then combined with a red fluorescent reporter that degrades more slowly to develop a new tool called TransTimer. When the gene linked to the reporter switches on, the green destabilized protein turns on before the red reporter turns on. But, as the gene switches off, the destabilized protein will degrade until only the red signal remains. This allows the ratio of green to red color emitted from the TransTimer to indicate the timing of a gene’s activity.</p><p>Using this tool, He et al. uncovered new details about the patterns of activity of two signals, known as Notch and STAT, that were largely missed by studies using traditional fluorescent reporters. Further experiments demonstrated that TransTimer can be used to carry out large-scale screens in living fruit flies, which have not been possible with more time consuming live-cell imaging techniques.</p><p>The fluorescent reporter developed by He et al. will be a useful tool to understand when and where genes are switched on during the lives of fruit flies. In the future, TransTimer could be adapted for use in other model animals or plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptional dynamics</kwd><kwd>fluorescent reporter</kwd><kwd>transcriptional timer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DA039582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A simple and effective method facilitates the study of in vivo transcriptional dynamics using transcriptional enhancers and destabilized fluorescent protein, which is suitable for both live imaging and fixed studies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Changes in gene expression are one of the key mechanisms that organisms use during both development and homeostasis. Gene expression is a highly dynamic process, which not only bears critical information about regulatory mechanisms but also controls the fate of many biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Purvis and Lahav, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yosef and Regev, 2011</xref>). For example, oscillatory or constant expression of the Notch effector <italic>Hes1</italic> dictates the choice of neuron stem cells between proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isomura and Kageyama, 2014</xref>). In addition, defining the exact ‘on’ and ‘off’ timing of a relevant signal is vital to control different developmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doupé and Perrimon, 2014</xref>). For example, during the development of fly compound eyes, simultaneous activation of EGF and Notch signals determines a cone cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flores et al., 2000</xref>), while cells that experience sequential expression of EGF and the Notch-ligand Delta differentiate into photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuda et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Documenting precisely the spatio-temporal changes in gene expression that occur in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals is a challenging problem in cell and developmental biology. Traditionally, transcriptional reporters that drive expression of fluorescent proteins (FPs) under the control of signaling response elements (SREs) have been widely used to visualize the activities of transcriptional events; however, the slow degradation (half-life &gt;20 hr) of FPs makes it hard to achieve the temporal resolution needed to dissect the dynamic nature of gene expression. Recently, this problem has been addressed by the application of a fluorescent timer, a slow maturing fluorescent protein that changes its from blue to red in ~7 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bending et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the still relatively long conversion time, this fluorescent timer has two additional limitations: the signal is hard to fix for long-term storage, and because it can be photoconverted from blue to red, this timer only allows one single image and prohibits live-imaging application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subach et al., 2009</xref>). Another strategy is the development of a destabilized version of GFP with a half-life of ~2 hr, which is achieved by fusing GFP with a PEST peptide signal for protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rogers et al., 1986</xref>). However, despite many in vitro successes, this strategy has met a major limitation when applied in vivo due to substantial loss of fluorescent intensity. Therefore, regular stable FPs are still the primary choice for generating transcriptional reporters to study gene expression patterns in vivo.</p><p>Here, we address this problem by using translational enhancers to boost production of the destabilized reporters and demonstrate the advantages of using short-lived FPs to study dynamic gene expression in vivo. In addition, we generate a transcriptional timer that can be readily applied to study spatio-temporal activation of signaling pathways. Finally, we document how this transcriptional timer can be used, either using the UAS/Gal4 system or in an enhancer trap screen, to identify genes with dynamic expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Current limitations of stable transcriptional reporters and challenges of the destabilization strategy</title><p>Matching reporter dynamics with the activity of target genes is essential to faithfully recapitulate signaling activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doupé and Perrimon, 2014</xref>). Two primary kinetic properties dictate reporter activities: the ‘switch-on’ and ‘switch-off’ speeds. The ‘on’ kinetic of FPs have been improved by engineering fast folding FPs, which shorten the maturation time of FPs from more than 1 hr to less than 10min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). The ‘off’ kinetics of FPs has been improved from more than 20 hr to around 2 hr by fusing FPs with PEST peptides that promote degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Although the advantages of using a short-lived reporter have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 1998</xref>), a systematic analysis of the differences between long-lived and short-lived reporters is still lacking. Using a protein synthesis and degradation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>), we first simulated the dynamics of the reporters and demonstrated a significant improvement by decreasing the half-life (Tp<sub>1/2</sub>) of the reporters from 20 hr to 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–f</xref>). Specifically, we illustrate this problem using simulated responses of FP reporters to four basic types of promoter activities: switch on, switch off, pulse activation, and oscillation. Compared to FPs with a half-life of 20 hr, FPs with a half-life of 2 hr have a 90% shorter response time (time to achieve 50% maximal intensity) during the ‘on’ or ‘off’ events, and up to four times larger dynamic range in the case of oscillatory expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46181.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Advantages and limitations of destabilized fluorescent transcriptional reporters.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the biological processes that affect the final concentration of mature fluorescent protein, including transcription, translation, protein maturation, mRNA degradation, and protein degradation with the general half-life of mRNA, FP maturation time, and half-life of protein labeled. Destabiliation of the FP, achieved by fusion of FP with PEST domain, shortens the half-life of regular FP from over ~20 hr to ~2 hr. (<bold>b-d</bold>). Comparison between simulated signals from a destabilized fluorescent reporter (green, <italic>T<sub>p1/2</sub></italic> = 2 hr) and a regular fluorescent reporter (blue, <italic>T<sub>p1/2</sub></italic> = 20 hr) following switch-on, switch-off, 1 hr pulse, and oscillation with a period of 2 hr. The half-life of mRNA (<italic>T<sub>m1/2</sub></italic>) is set as 0.5 hr, and the protein maturation time (<italic>τ<sub>m1/2</sub></italic>) is set as 0.1 hr. The time points when the fluorescent signals reach 50% of the maximal intensity (for switch-on and switch-off) and the maximum response (for transient pulse activation) are indicated by black arrows. (<bold>e</bold>). Simulated signal intensities of fluorescent proteins with different protein half-lives to a sinusoid transcriptional oscillation with a period of 4 hr. The rest of the parameters are the same with above. The dynamic portion (the difference between the peak and valley) of the reporter (a half-life of 0.5 hr) is indicated by black arrows. (<bold>f</bold>). The dynamic range (the difference between the peak and valley of the signal compared to its average intensity as indicated in (<bold>e</bold>) of reporters with indicated half-lives generated by sinusoid transcriptional activity with different length of the period. The dynamic range of the total signal positively correlates with the oscillation period and negatively correlates with the protein half-life. (<bold>g</bold>) The intensity of the reporter signal for a constitutively active promoter (with no temporal variation) linearly depends on its protein half-life (black line). However, the maximal intensity of the reporter is less reduced by the shortened half-life for a shorter transient activation: a short-lived reporter (half-life of 2 hr) shows a 90% reduction of maximal signal compared with a stable reporter (half-life of 20 hr) for a constitutively active promoter. Nevertheless, the intensity is only reduced by 50% if the promoter is transiently activated for 1 hr. Td: the duration of a pulse transient promoter activation.

Thus, at constant expression, the intensity of the maximum signal is linearly proportional to the protein half-life, and decreasing the half-life from 20 hr to 2 hr causes a 90% signal loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, black curve). The reduction of maximum signal intensity is also affected by different types of transcriptional activation. In the case of short pulsatile activation, a more transient activation (a shorter duration Td) is less sensitive to a reduction in the protein half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> colored curves); however, transient activation also triggers weaker reporter activity, which makes it more vulnerable to intensity reduction.</p><p>We further analyzed the effects of reducing mRNA half-life (Tm<sub>1/2</sub>) compared to protein destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h,i</xref>). Measurements of Tm<sub>1/2</sub> of FPs in the literature are highly variable, ranging from several minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Parker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sacchetti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houser et al., 2012</xref>), which is probably due to differences in the 3’ UTR used or different mRNA expression levels relative to the mRNA degradation machinery. According to our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), the Tm<sub>1/2</sub> of FP reporters is about 0.5 hr. Therefore, we used 0.5 hr to 3 hr in our modeling. According to the model, the mRNA half-life significantly influences reporter intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), which is approximately proportional to the Tp<sub>1/2</sub>* Tm<sub>1/2</sub>. In contrast, reducing mRNA half-life has much less effect on reporter response time, which is mainly controlled by Tp<sub>1/2</sub> + Tm<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Because in our system, Tp<sub>1/2</sub> is much longer than Tm<sub>1/2</sub>, shortening the mRNA lifetime will significantly reduce signal intensity without endowing the reporter with more range in dynamic detection. Therefore, we decided to primarily use destabilized FPs in our study. For a system with a large Tm<sub>1/2</sub> relative to Tp<sub>1/2</sub>, strategies to shorten mRNA lifetime by addition of RNA destabilizing sequence can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voon et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Application of translational enhancers to rescue the signal loss caused by destabilization</title><p>The significant loss of signal limits implementation of the destabilization strategy, especially in systems like <italic>Drosophila</italic> where a transgene is usually present in 1 or 2 copies per genome. To overcome this obstacle, we searched for ways to increase the signal of destabilized FPs. One possible solution is to use FPs with high intrinsic brightness. To test this, we used a fly codon-optimized sfGFP for its fast folding and bright fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). The effectiveness of destabilization was first tested in cultured fly S2 cells. Adding the PEST sequence from mouse ornithine decarboxylase (MODC) effectively reduced the half-life of sfGFP to ~3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, to test the approach in vivo, we generated transgenic flies with destabilized sfGFP (dGFP) for two widely used signaling reporters: STAT (containing the STAT response element from <italic>Socs36E</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2007</xref>) and Notch (containing the Notch response element Su(H)Gbe; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>). GFP signals were examined in tissues previously reported to show high STAT and Notch activities (embryo for STAT and wing imaginal disc for Notch). Destabilization reduced the signal intensity of these reporters to near background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). As further increasing the intrinsic brightness of FPs is challenging—even with the brightest FPs currently available the increase in signal intensity is still limited (less than two fold; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cranfill et al., 2016</xref>)—we decided to test other strategies to increase the FP signal. One potential solution is to increase expression of the FP by expressing multiple tandem FPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shearin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genové et al., 2005</xref>). However, this strategy makes cloning cumbersome and may render the insertion unstable due to recombination. Thus, we instead decided to use translational enhancing elements that have been demonstrated to increase protein production from mRNA by up to 20 fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pfeiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>). These elements include a short 87 bp intervening sequence (IVS) from myosin heavy chain to facilitate mRNA export to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), a synthetic AT-rich 21 bp sequence (Syn21) to promote translational initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pfeiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>), and a highly-efficient p10 polyadenylation (polyA) signal from baculovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Oers et al., 1999</xref>). To test if these elements can be used to increase the reporter signals, we inserted the translational enhancing elements into reporter constructs containing dGFP (destabilized sfGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). Transgenic flies were generated by phiC31-mediated site-directed integration into the same genomic locus (attP40) to avoid potential position effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groth et al., 2004</xref>). Strikingly, the addition of translational enhancers successfully increased the reporter signal with an expression pattern similar to that of previously reported stable reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>). We further measured the in vivo half-life of the dGFP in live tissues by blocking transcription with Actinomycin (10 μM) and monitored degradation of the GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The result shows a reporter half-life (T<sub>GFP1/2</sub> ~2.6 ± 0.3 hr) similar to what was observed in cultured cells (~3.7 ± 0.7 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d-f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We also tested the absolute signal intensity of regular GFP with the translational enhancer (eGFP) and destabilized GFP with the same enhancer (edGFP). The total signal intensity from edGFP is about 8% of what is observed for eGFP, consistent with a 91% reduction in protein half-life.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46181.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Using translational enhancers to increase the signal from destabilized fluorescent reporters for in vivo study.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the regular and destabilized GFP reporters.

However, not all tissues are amenable to live imaging. Further, live imaging experiments are time-consuming and hard to adapt for large-scale studies. From our previous analyses, we noticed that dynamic information, including the initiation, maintenance, and reduction of transcriptional activities, can be directly estimated by comparing the ratio of fluorescence from stable vs destabilized reporters from a still image. Because the GFP matures faster than RFP (maturation time ~0.1 hr for sfGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>] vs. ~1.5 hr for TagRFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merzlyak et al., 2007</xref>] used in this study), when the promoter switches on, a green signal is detected first. As the promoter remains active, both GFP and RFP signals reach a balance and such that their overlay produces a yellow color (when the max intensities of GFP and RFP are normalized). Furthermore, when transcription switches off, because the GFP signal decreases more quickly (the half-life of dGFP is ~2 hr, and the half-life of RFP is ~20 hr), only the RFP signal is left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

During development, STAT activity has been shown to act as a negative signal that antagonizes progression of the cell differentiation wave, which triggers the transition of neuroepithelial cells (NEs) into neuroblasts (NBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>).

In addition, analysis of <italic>STAT::edGFP</italic> and <italic>STAT::eRFP</italic> in fixed larval optic lobes at different developmental stages further support this wave-like propagation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>Another example of the dynamic information revealed by combining edGFP and eRFP is the expression of the Notch reporter in larval brain NBs. NBs undergo an asymmetric cell division to generate smaller progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the Notch suppressor complex PON/Numb is preferentially localized to progeny cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Oers et al., 1999</xref>) and that ectopic activation of Notch generates a brain tumor phenotype attributable to excess NBs, suggesting that Notch activity is required for NB self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Strikingly, whereas the stable Notch reporter accumulates in both NBs and their progeny, the destabilized reporter is preferentially expressed in NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>), consistent with functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Combining the information from the edGFP and eRFP reporters reveals a clear Notch activity gradient that decreases as NBs differentiate. Importantly, in addition to its superior spatial resolution, the destabilized reporter also shows improved temporal resolution in NBs under live imaging conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that combining edGFP and RFP creates a useful tool to study transcriptional dynamics, even in fixed samples.

In the second instar, the adult midgut progenitors (AMPs) exist as individual cells and disperse throughout the intestine. Using TransTimer, we observed considerable variation in the dGFP/RFP ratio, indicating an unexpected heterogeneity in this cell population. In the third instar intestine, the AMPs proliferate and form clusters called midgut imaginal islands (MIIs). Some AMPs with high Notch activity start to differentiate into peripheral cells (PCs), which surround the AMPs to create a transient stem cell niche. Consistent with this model, cells at the periphery of MII showed more red color, suggesting that these cells started to differentiate and lost their stemness. During the early pupal stage, the MIIs break down, while PCs and a large portion of AMPs differentiate into pupal intestine cells, which will be degraded at the end of the pupal stage. Consistent with this, many <italic>esg</italic> +AMPs turn red as these cells start to differentiate. During metamorphosis, the larval intestine is completely turned over, and the late pupal intestine, which will become the future adult intestine, is newly generated from AMPs.

Sub-confluent S2R + cells were seeded in 6-well plates and subsequently transfected using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN). Cells were cultured for 48 hr before experiments. 10 μM (final concentration) Actinomycin D was used to block RNA synthesis, and 100 μg/ml (final concentration) cycloheximide was used to block protein synthesis. Cells were treated with the indicated drugs up to 4.5 hr before significant cell death was observed. Plasmids expressing pUbi-dGFP-Myc (0.03 ug), and pUbi-RFP-HA (0.01 ug), together with empty plasmids (to reach a total of 0.3 ug of DNA) were added in each 6-well plate during transfection. The dilution of the expression plasmid was important: we observed that too much protein expression saturates the degradation machinery and prolongs the observed half-life. S2R + cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in RIPA buffer. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting. Quantitative Western blots were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eaton et al., 2014</xref>).

The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Prospero (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), mouse anti-HA (1:500, Abcam, ab18181), rabbit anti-Myc tag (1/250, Cell signaling), goat anti-mouse IgGs conjugated to Alexa 647 (1:500, Molecular Probes), mouse IgGs conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:500, Molecular Probes), IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:10,000 LI-COR P/N 926–32211), and IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG (1:20,000 LI-COR P/N 926–68070). Dissected fly tissues were mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). In all micrographs, the blue signal shows the nuclear marker DAPI. Fluorescence micrographs were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. All images were adjusted and assembled in NIH ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Modeling of FP production, maturation, and degradation</title><p>The model used to calculate reporter synthesis, maturation, and degradation was modified from previously described equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) with the addition of an equation for mRNA degradation. Briefly, degradation of mRNA and the synthesis rate of premature (nonfluorescent) protein (NP) is proportional to the mRNA concentration (R). Generation of the mature reporter (MP), modeled as a first-order chemical reaction, only depends on the concentration of NP. Protein degradation is modeled independently of the maturation process. The degradation rates of mRNA and proteins are first modeled based on Michaelis-Menten (MM) function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement b, equations 1-3), which considers the potential saturation of the degradation machinery. When the substrate concentration is significantly smaller than the Michaelis constant <italic>Km</italic>, the equations can be simplified with the half-life of the mRNA and protein explicitly displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, equations 1’−3’). Dilution by cell division is not included in this model because the fluorescent signal is analyzed in a cell cluster rather than in individual cells, and cell division does not affect the total intensity from the entire cell group and no significant changes in degradation speed have been observed between different cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). With this first-order kinetic model, the transcriptional activity of the promoter <italic>F(x)</italic> can be calculated through equation from the observed fluorescent reporter signal <italic>[MP]</italic> (4). For sfGFP, the maturation time is ~0.1 hr, which is much smaller than its protein half-life, such that equation 4 can be further simplified as 4’. To calculate <italic>F(x)</italic>, the dGFP signal was fitted with a polynomial function (order = 4) to generate the first and second derivatives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live-cell imaging and data analysis</title><p>Live-cell imaging of developing embryos and dissected larval brains was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lerit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemon et al., 2015</xref>). Images were captured on a Zeiss Lightsheet Z1 microscope using a 20X (N.A. 1.0) lens. A z-stack of the dual-color image (488 nm excitation/500–550 nm detection for GFP, and 561 nm excitation/580–650 nm detection for RFP) was recorded at 10 min intervals. This interval was chosen empirically to minimize photobleaching without losing temporal information. Photobleaching was measured by continuously imaging of the sample for 50 frames for 10 min and adjusted during image processing. Images of fixed tissue were captured on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. Total fluorescent intensity in 3D volume was acquired using Imaris image analysis software (Bitplane). The rest of the analysis was completed using NIH ImageJ with customized macros. Simulation of the model was completed in MATLAB. The Student’s unpaired, two-tailed t-test was used to determine statistical significance between samples.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Douglas Richardson at Harvard Biological Imaging Center for technical support and advice, and Ben Ewen-Campen, Benjamin Housden, Stephanie Mohr, and Muhammad Ahmad for comments on the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;In vivo study of gene expression with an enhanced dual-color fluorescent transcriptional timer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Julie Simpson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, He and colleagues generated a new in vivo reporter to detect spatial and temporal activity of gene expression by combining a fast-folding destabilized fluorescent protein (FP) and a slow-folding long-lived FP. While existing transcriptional reporters combined with stable FPs are successful in detecting signaling activities, this is at the expense of detecting dynamic changes due to the long-lived fluorescent signals. The authors improved spatial and temporal resolution of these reporters by generating short-lived GFP through the inclusion of PEST peptides (GFP-PEST). Since the shorter half-life of GST-PEST caused significant loss of signals, the authors combined super-folder GFP and translational enhancing elements. The utility of these features were demonstrated by generating STAT and Notch reporters. The authors next combined short-lived GFP/long-lived RFP reporters, and generated STAT reporters that can detect dynamic STAT activity in embryos by live imaging (or in fixed sample by ratiometric imaging of the FPs). To expand this tool for broader contexts (and requiring less genetic crosses), the authors generated a clever construct they called TransTimer that includes the self-cleaving 2A peptide between edGFP and RFP under the control of a single promoter. Using TransTimer with enhancer-trapped GAL4 lines or through insertion near an enhancer region allowed the discovery of new genes showing dynamic expression changes. Indeed, the authors found that a new gene, CG30159, is required for the maintenance of intestinal stem cells. Finally, the authors generated TransTimerLex, which achieved both detection and manipulation of gene expression at the same time.</p><p>This is a nicely designed study with strong proof of principle. Together, these different transcriptional reporters enhance the current tools/methods available to study dynamic transcriptional changes. They will be very useful to the wider <italic>Drosophila</italic> research committee, and as pointed out by the authors. The design elements should be transferrable to other research organisms as well. In summary, we believe this is a very clever tool that will be useful for the community and <italic>eLife</italic> readership.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) When Transtimer is used as a direct reporter construct under the control of a gene's promoter and enhancer, it directly reflects the expression dynamics of that gene. It is more complex when Transtimer is used as a UAS construct. This use employs GAL4 which is a stable intermediary. The authors should model how using a stable intermediary such as GAL4 affects detection of signaling dynamics. This would strengthen the conclusion that can be reached using the Transtimer as a UAS construct. If there are already GAL4 reagents (e.g. generated as part of Flylight project) for any of the genes for which the authors have a direct reporter, a head to head comparison would be beneficial.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46181.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) When Transtimer is used as a direct reporter construct under the control of a gene's promoter and enhancer, it directly reflects the expression dynamics of that gene.

To test that, we modeled the change of reporter dynamics after adding Gal4 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-F), and compared the dGFP and RFP driven directly by the Notch responding element Su(H)Gbe vs. a UAS-dGFP-2A-RFP (TransTimer) driven by Su(H)Gbe-Gal4 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1G,H). The modeling result suggests that the response time (time to reduce the signal to half of the original when the promoter is off) is generally proportional to the T<sub>G1/2</sub> (half-life of Gal4) + TF<sub>P1/2</sub> (half-life of fluorescent protein). This suggests that adding Gal4 will generally slow down the dynamic of the reporter. This is particularly clear in Figure 6—figure supplement 1E,H: the dGFP driven directly by the enhancer is more restricted in neuroblast cells (NB) than the dGFP driven by enhancer-Gal4 due to the retention of Gal4 intermediary. However, because the Gal4/UAS can amplify the signal, the system may reveal cells that weakly express the reporter and may be missed by reporter driven directly by the enhancer: in Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,G, the pattern driven by Gal4/UAS system is significantly broader.</p></body></sub-article></article>
