However, not all regulatory elements are functionally methylation-dependent (MD). Here, we report a method, mSTARR-seq, that assesses the causal effects of DNA methylation on regulatory activity at hundreds of thousands of fragments (millions of CpG sites) simultaneously. Using mSTARR-seq, we identify thousands of MD regulatory elements in the human genome. MD activity is partially predictable using sequence and chromatin state information, and distinct transcription factors are associated with higher activity in unmethylated versus methylated DNA. Further, pioneer TFs linked to higher activity in the methylated state appear to drive demethylation of experimentally methylated sites. MD regulatory elements also predict methylation-gene expression relationships across individuals, where they are 1.6x enriched among sites with strong negative correlations. mSTARR-seq thus provides a map of MD regulatory activity in the human genome and facilitates interpretation of differential methylation studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenomics</kwd><kwd>high-throughput reporter assay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

These observations argue that between-individual variation in DNA methylation should be important in explaining trait variation. In support of this argument, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified thousands of correlations between DNA methylation levels at individual CpG sites and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winnefeld and Lyko, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marioni et al., 2015</xref>), short-term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrès et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pacis et al., 2015</xref>) and long-term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dominguez-Salas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tobi et al., 2014</xref>) reactions to environmental perturbations, and disease, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hinoue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aran et al., 2013</xref>), type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dayeh et al., 2014</xref>), and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakulskia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Jager et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>If differential DNA methylation is mechanistically important in trait variation, it should also have downstream consequences for gene regulation. However, while a functional relationship between differential methylation and gene expression levels is often assumed, experimental studies have shown that it does not always hold. For example, targeted demethylation of CpG sites within the human <italic>HBB</italic> promoter using TALE-TET1 fusion proteins revealed that demethylation of some CpG sites causally alters gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>). At other CpG sites in the same promoter, however, demethylation had no effect on <italic>HBB</italic> expression. Mapping methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity on a genome-wide scale is therefore essential for both sifting through the growing number of DNA methylation-trait associations and for understanding the basic biology of epigenetic gene regulation. However, current approaches for assaying MD activity are limited, as they either do not provide locus-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christman, 2002</xref>) or can only assay a single locus per experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rivenbark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maeder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Using this novel approach, we map MD regulatory activity across the human genome in the K562 immortalized human cell line. Further, we test whether regions with MD activity can be reliably predicted using information about CpG site density, endogenous chromatin state, and TF binding, and we identify both known and candidate novel TFs involved in DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation and active demethylation. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of mSTARR-seq to data from real populations by showing that inter-individual variation in DNA methylation is more tightly coupled to inter-individual variation in gene expression for CpG sites within MD regulatory elements than sites in methylation-insensitive (non-MD) regulatory elements. Our findings indicate that a minority of CpG sites in the genome have MD regulatory activity. Thus, the functional importance of DNA methylation for gene expression at any given site should be tested empirically and not assumed as a default.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37513.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mSTARR-seq experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The CpG-free <italic>pmSTARRseq1</italic> vector is designed so that functional regulatory elements self-transcribe to produce a processed mRNA transcript, including a transcribed region (dark blue) that spans a synthetic intron (teal) and the sequence of the regulatory element itself (green).

(<bold>C–D</bold>) For fragments that had zero counts from all mRNA-seq libraries, the proportion of regions that overlap chromatin states (<bold>C</bold>) lacking H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (indicating inactive regions) and (<bold>D</bold>) marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (indicating active regions). Proportions are binned by quantile of normalized mean DNA-seq coverage across all input libraries (x-axis). DNA fragments that were input into the experiment at high abundance, but for which no mRNAs were observed, were more likely to come from endogenously inactive regions and less likely to come from endogenously active regions. This pattern suggests that lower fragment diversity in mRNA-seq libraries relative to DNA-seq libraries is not purely technical, but also influenced by the fragment’s regulatory potential.

However, the original STARR-seq vector is not appropriate for isolating the effects of DNA methylation on gene expression because it contains over 300 CpG sites in the backbone, as well as potential targets of bacterial methylation.

A second aliquot is treated only with <italic>M.SssI</italic> buffer, producing a sham treatment in which all query fragment CpG sites are left completely unmethylated. The regulatory activity of unmethylated versus methylated fragments can then be compared using high-throughput sequencing to quantify their relative abundances in reporter gene-derived mRNA. In total, this approach allows us to obtain a functional, quantitative readout of enhancer activity across the genome, and to compare the activity levels of the same regulatory element in a methylated versus unmethylated state.</p><p>To illustrate this approach, we generated an mSTARR-seq input library from randomly sheared DNA from the human GM12878 cell line, combined with additional GM12878 <italic>MspI</italic>-digested genomic DNA to enrich for CpG-containing fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; this input library contained 93% of expected fragments from a full <italic>MspI</italic> digest of the human genome).

We also confirmed that our results were not confounded by two issues recently raised for classical STARR-seq assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muerdter et al., 2018</xref>), namely: (i) enhancer interactions with the bacterial plasmid origin-of-replication, which contains core promoter sequence, instead of the intended core promoter (see Materials and methods), and (ii) induction of a type I interferon (IFN) response during DNA transfection (note that K562s do not express cGAS/STING pathway genes and are thought to be unaffected by this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muerdter et al., 2018</xref>)). To confirm that K562s do not mount an IFN response to mSTARR-seq plasmid transfection, we measured the expression levels of six genes identified by Muerdter and colleagues as diagnostic of IFN activity.

Our feature set included information about absolute CpG number and density; endogenous chromatin state, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kundaje et al., 2015</xref>); evolutionary conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>); and TF binding from K562 ENCODE ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunham et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting RF model predicted MD regulatory element activity with 78.8% accuracy (72.3% without the top features of CpG density and CpG number; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to CpG number and density, 26 features were identified as significant predictors (permutation-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archer, 2015</xref>) FDR &lt; 10%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Measures of DNase I hypersensitivity and endogenous methylation levels were among the top predictive features: relative to non-MD enhancers, enhancers suppressed by DNA methylation were more likely to occur in open chromatin or in highly methylated regions of the genome. MD enhancers were also more likely to contain binding sites for TFs that contain CpG sites in their canonical binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with these results, many TFs are thought to be sensitive to DNA methylation levels in or near their binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). This ability to ‘read’ epigenetic modifications to DNA sequence could contribute to variation in MD regulatory activity in our data set. To test this possibility, we therefore investigated TF binding motif enrichment within mSTARR-seq identified MD enhancers, using motifs defined in the HOMER database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Among the 2543 MD enhancers in which DNA methylation suppresses activity, we identified 32 significantly enriched TF-binding motifs (relative to all regions with mSTARR-seq regulatory activity, FDR &lt; 1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). These results agree with known cases of methylation-dependent binding for well-studied classes of TFs (e.g. ETS family TFs, some of which are known to be methylation-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Polansky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephens and Poon, 2016</xref>)). Additionally, they are significantly correlated with estimates of methylation-dependent TF binding to naked DNA using a completely orthogonal method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, when we compared estimates of motif enrichment from mSTARR-seq-identified MD enhancers versus estimates of affinity for methylated DNA in SELEX experiments, we found significant agreement for both TFs that preferentially bound unmethylated (linear model, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.342; p = 1.33 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) and TFs that preferentially bound methylated DNA (linear model, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.113, p = 0.028; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37513.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>mSTARR-seq identifies MD transcription factor-DNA binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transcription factor motifs enriched in MD enhancers that are more active when unmethylated, colored by TF family.

This observation is consistent with reports that GATA3 and GATA4 can bind to methylated DNA outside the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, ETS family TF binding sites were almost universally (38 of 41 tested) enriched in DNMT knockout-specific open chromatin regions.</p><p>Because the treatment condition—methylated versus unmethylated—is the only exogenous variable in mSTARR-seq, all signals of MD activity we detect depend on the original treatment status. In this respect, mSTARR-seq is conservative: rapid demethylation of the methylated treatment or de novo methylation of the unmethylated treatment would attenuate or eliminate any MD signal, as the two treatments would effectively become identical. However, methylation-dependent TF binding could also lead to subsequent changes in DNA methylation, as some TFs are associated with demethylating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>). To test this possibility, we generated an additional locus-specific bisulfite sequencing data set on fragments extracted 48 hr post-transfection. As in our previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), introduced CpG sites in the fragment-backbone linker retained their experimentally-induced methylation status (mean CpG methylation levels = 1.6% and 95.1% in the unmethylated and methylated condition, respectively). However, CpG sites in fragments that mapped to the human genome partially converged towards endogenous levels in K562s, for both unmethylated (rho = 0.476, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>) and methylated replicates (rho = 0.223, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, 23.1% of sites in the unmethylated condition became methylated, while 15.7% of sites in the methylated condition lost methyl marks.</p><p>This effect was driven in part by altered methylation levels at specific transcription factor binding sites. We observed the strongest evidence for post-transfection demethylation at K562 ChIP-seq-identified binding sites for ZNF274 and GATA2 (loss of a mean of 35.9% and 26.5% methylation, respectively), and for post-transfection de novo methylation at ChIP-seq-identified binding sites for POL2 and KAP1 (gain of a mean 26.0%, and 18.6% methylation, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). However, GATA family TFs showed some of the most consistent evidence for demethylation overall: among the top 20 TFs ranked by mean loss of methylation (in the methylated condition), GATA family TFs were enriched 6.7-fold relative to chance expectations (p=3.60×10<sup>−4</sup>). Our data are thus consistent with both methylation-dependent binding and subsequent demethylating activity at GATA-bound TFBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>), and support the argument that sequence alone provides important information about cell-typic DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schübeler, 2015</xref>). They also suggest that, while not the original motivation for the method, mSTARR-seq could be applied to screen for TFs associated with active demethylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>mSTARR-seq explains site-to-site heterogeneity in the strength of DNA methylation level-gene expression level correlations in vivo</title><p>Our mSTARR-seq results indicate that, at many CpG sites, DNA methylation may be functionally silent (i.e. it has no effect on regulatory activity). This result may explain the observation that, in population data sets, inter-individual variation in DNA methylation levels is a good predictor of inter-individual variation in gene expression levels at some CpG sites, but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, DNA methylation-gene expression correlations are expected to be stronger at CpG sites where DNA methylation causally affects gene expression than at sites where DNA methylation is functionally silent.</p><p>To test this prediction, we drew on paired DNA methylation and gene expression data for 1202 human primary monocyte samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>). In this data set, the correlation between CpG methylation levels and the expression level of the closest gene is relatively strong within a single individual’s genome (mean rho = -0.152 ± 0.018 s.d., rho calculated for each of n = 1202 paired genome-wide methylation and gene expression data sets, all p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>), but near zero when estimated across individuals (mean rho = 0.008 ± 0.188 s.d., n = 32,843 site-gene pairs measured in 1202 individuals each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, in mSTARR-seq identified MD enhancers, there is an enrichment of sites with significant DNA methylation-gene expression correlations across individuals (FDR &lt; 10%), relative to non-MD enhancers (two-sided Fisher’s exact test, log<sub>2</sub>odds = 0.186, p=4.967×10<sup>−8</sup>). This enrichment increases further for sites in the monocyte data set that display the canonical negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression levels (log<sub>2</sub>odds = 0.491, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>), and is strongest when these sites also occur in promoter regions (log<sub>2</sub>odds = 0.592, p&lt;10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Overall, CpG sites found in mSTARR-seq MD regulatory elements are 1.6-fold more common among sites where DNA methylation is strongly negatively correlated with gene expression (rho &lt;−0.2, FDR &lt; 10%) than among all other sites.</p><p>mSTARR-seq data can therefore help discriminate between sites where population variation in DNA methylation can drive differences in gene expression, and those where differential methylation is either independent or downstream of gene expression variation. Notably, although mSTARR-seq is designed to test the effects of experimentally induced DNA methylation on gene expression, it is consistent with the observation that major environmental or developmental perturbations to gene expression are also associated with changes in DNA methylation. To demonstrate this property, we challenged K562s carrying methylated mSTARR-seq constructs with interferon alpha (IFNA), which induces a strong antiviral innate immune response. We identified 7010 CpG sites that occurred within 2678 regions tested for enhancer activity in both the control and IFNA-challenged samples, and for which we were also able to measure IFNA-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. Increased enhancer activity post-IFNA treatment was significantly correlated with loss of DNA methylation at individual sites (rho = 0.043, p=0.025; n = 7010 independently analyzed CpG sites), but not significantly correlated with mean loss of CpG methylation across each region (n = 2678, 200 bp regions; rho = 0.014, p=0.687). For both region- and site-level analyses, the strength of the correlation between IFNA induction and loss of DNA methylation became progressively stronger for more strongly induced enhancers (up to rho = 0.125 or rho = 0.139 for the 15th quantile of induced enhancers, for regions and sites, respectively, p&lt;0.05 for both; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The magnitude of the IFNA effect on enhancer activity thus was a significant predictor of CpG demethylation versus maintenance (logistic regression: p=0.043, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.071, n = 7010 CpG sites).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present a novel high-throughput assay for performing genome-scale tests of methylation-dependent regulatory activity. Our results demonstrate the utility of mSTARR-seq for differentiating between regions of the genome in which DNA methylation is causally important for gene regulation and those in which it is effectively silent. mSTARR-seq thus provides an efficient, cost-effective strategy for interrogating the functional importance of candidate genomic regions. Notably, the information obtained from the original STARR-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>), which tests a sequence’s capacity to act as an enhancer, is also generated as a by-product of the mSTARR-seq protocol (e.g. data from the unmethylated condition is analogous to STARR-seq data, although the vector backbone differs).</p><p>Together, our findings emphasize substantial variability in the functional relationship between DNA methylation and gene regulation across the genome. In particular, our data indicate that MD activity is probably less common for CpG sites in the human genome than methylation-independent activity, at least in any given cell type and environmental condition; further, where it does occur but was missed by our analysis, dependence on DNA methylation is likely to be weak. In addition, in agreement with several proposed models for the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, we find that both basic sequence characteristics (e.g. density of CpG sites) and the sensitivity of their cognate TFs to local methylation play an important role in predicting MD elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domcke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schübeler, 2015</xref>). Our results provide support for the hypothesis that pioneer TFs, such as members of the GATA TF family, have a higher affinity for methylated DNA, potentially aiding in their ability to bind condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, methylated fragments that contained endogenous GATA-binding sites also tended to become demethylated during our experiments, consistent with the role of pioneer TFs in remodeling the epigenome. Other TFs important in development and cell fate, such as MyoD and TCF21, are also enriched among MD enhancers with increased activity when methylated, supporting the idea that preferential binding of methylated DNA could be used to aid in pioneer TF discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). A caveat to our approach is that, like all massively parallel reporter assays, the regulatory elements we identify operate outside the context of the endogenous genome (and thus, interactions between DNA methylation and higher order chromatin structure will be missed). Consequently, mSTARR-seq isolates the effects of DNA methylation alone, identifying the subset of MD elements for which changes in DNA methylation are sufficient to causally alter gene regulation.</p><p>Finally, mSTARR-seq results can be used to identify the CpG sites for which interindividual variation in DNA methylation is most tightly linked to gene expression variation in vivo. Thus, maps of MD regulatory activity obtained from mSTARR-seq can help prioritize DNA methylation-trait associations for further investigation. Notably, the effects of DNA methylation on gene expression are not only cell-type-dependent, but may also vary depending on environment, genotype, or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jirtle and Skinner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang and Meaney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernando-Herraez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banovich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hernando-Herraez et al., 2015</xref>). mSTARR-seq can be adapted to investigate these dependencies by varying the transfected cell types, input DNA fragment library (e.g. via targeted capture or ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vanhille et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vockley et al., 2016</xref>)), or the cellular environment (e.g. through in vitro stimulation of transfected cells, similar to the IFNA treatment reported here). Thus, we expect that mSTARR-seq will become a useful tool for facilitating screening and dissection of the causal relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in many contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species)or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (human)</td><td valign="top">K562</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC CCL-243</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pmSTARRseq1</td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">Plasmid #96945</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">IFN-α</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab48750</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic> cells</td><td valign="top">GT115 strain</td><td valign="top">Invivogen</td><td valign="top">ChemiComp GT115</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Electrically competent <italic>E. coli</italic> cells</td><td valign="top">GT115 strain</td><td valign="top">Intact Genomics</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom order to grow Invivogen's ChemiComp GT115 strain and prepare cells for <break/>electroporation</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>pmSTARRseq1 design</title><p>We constructed a self-transcribing CpG-free vector that was built from Invivogen’s pCpGfree-promoter-Lucia plasmid, which contains an R6Kγ origin of replication and a Zeocin resistance gene.

GT115 cells were initially purchased from Invivogen, and a custom electrocompetent version of the strain was prepared by Intact Genomics (standard <italic>E. coli</italic> strains cannot be used in this protocol due to the R6Kγ origin of replication). We used the BioRad Gene Pulser Xcell system for electroporation and the <italic>E. coli</italic> 2 mm gap three kv program. Following electroporation, each of the 7 pools of 300 ul of cells was allowed to recover in 10 mL of SOC for 1 hr at 37°C.

All transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with reagent quantities scaled as follows per replicate: 20 million cells, 40 ug of DNA, 110 ul of Lipofectamine 3000, and 100 ul of P3000. We transfected six unmethylated condition and six methylated condition replicates for the primary data set on mapping MD regulatory activity. For the additional experiments focusing on the IFNA response, we transfected an additional 2 and 6 replicates with unmethylated and methylated DNA, respectively, and added 2000 U/mL IFNA (ThermoFisher Scientific) to 3 of the methylated replicates 38 hr post-transfection. At the same time, we added an equivalent volume of water as a negative control to the remaining methylated and unmethylated replicates (total number of replicates: n = 3 methylated, IFNA+, n = 3 methylated, IFNA-, n = 2 unmethylated, IFNA-).</p><p>Total RNA and plasmid DNA was isolated from each K562 replicate cell population 48 hr post-transfection.

Cells were then pelleted and washed with 1X PBS, and an aliquot of ~10% unlysed cells per replicate was set aside for later plasmid extraction.

Each isolated mRNA sample was then DNase-treated by adding 1 ul of Turbo DNase, 3 ul of Turbo DNase buffer, and 1 ul of water, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37°C and purification using the RNeasy MiniElute Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN). Purified mRNA was eluted in 25 ul of RNase free water, after which reverse transcription was performed using Super Script III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for higher yield. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with a primer specific to the mSTARR-seq reporter plasmid (CAAACTCATCAATGTATCTTATCATG), including the optional RNase H step. cDNA from each replicate was purified and concentrated using a 2X Agencourt AMPure XP bead cleanup. Each sample was eluted in 20 ul of nuclease free water.</p><p>We amplified the cDNA obtained from reverse transcription for Illumina sequencing using a two step, nested PCR strategy. In the first PCR, we amplified each cDNA pool (n = 12 from the main experiment, n = 8 from the IFNA experiment) using two primers specific to the mSTARR-seq reporter plasmid (forward: GGGCCAGCTGTTGGGGTG*T*C*C*A*C (3’ end is protected by phophorothioate bonds), reverse: CAAACTCATCAATGTATCTTATCATG). The forward primer spans the splice junction of the synthetic intron and specifically amplifies the reporter cDNA without amplifying any residual, unspliced plasmid DNA left in the reaction mixture. Each PCR reaction contained 2.5 ul of the forward and reverse primers at 10 uM, 25 ul of NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix, and 20 ul of cDNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: 98°C for 2 min; followed by 15 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 65°C for 30 s, 72°C for 120 s; followed by a final 5 min extension at 72°C for 5 min.

Cycling conditions were as described above (but using 10 cycles instead of 15). PCR products were purified using a 1.2X Agencourt AMPure XP bead cleanup.</p><p>To measure the relative abundance of each DNA fragment in the input plasmid libraries, we created DNA-seq libraries from plasmid DNA extracted from each replicate 48 hr post transfection. 10 ng of plasmid DNA was used as the input for 50 ul PCRs each containing 25 ul of NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix, 2.5 ul of universal primer, and 2.5 ul of an indexed primer (NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina). Cycling conditions were as described above (using 10 cycles) and PCR products were purified using a 1X Agencourt AMPure XP bead cleanup.

Approximately 1 ng of unmethylated phage DNA (Sigma Aldrich) was spiked in with each sample for downstream assessment of the bisulfite conversion efficiency. We performed end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation following previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyle et al., 2012</xref>). After adapter ligation, all samples (n = 12) were pooled together and subjected to two rounds of sodium bisulfite conversion using the EpiTect Bisulfite Conversion kit (QIAGEN). Libraries were then PCR amplified and purified as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyle et al.

First, we removed adapter contamination, low-quality bases, and bases artificially introduced during library construction using the program <italic>cutadapt</italic>. We then isolated CpG sites introduced through Gibson assembly (the Illumina-style adapters used for cloning and sequencing contain CpG sites) and estimated CpG methylation levels directly from these introduced sequences. In addition, we used BSMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xi and Li, 2009</xref>) to map reads to the lambda phage genome. Following mapping, we extracted the methylated read count and total read count for each plasmid library and CpG site using a Python script packaged with BSMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xi and Li, 2009</xref>). We then estimated the conversion efficiency of each bisulfite sequencing library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banovich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lea et al., 2016</xref>); all conversion efficiency estimates exceeded 99.7% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>For plasmid DNA extracted from the IFNA experimental replicates (n = 3 methylated, IFNA+, n = 3 methylated, IFNA-, n = 2 unmethylated, IFNA-), we aimed to generate higher coverage bisulfite-sequencing libraries to facilitate locus-specific analysis. To do so, we digested the plasmid DNA extracted from each replicate with <italic>BfaI</italic> using the conditions described above. We ran the digestion products on a 2% agarose gel and extracted the 250–650 bp region containing human DNA inserts as well as digested plasmid backbone (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, QIAGEN). Two of the eight replicates (n = 1 methylated, IFNA +replicate and one methylated, IFNA- replicate) did not yield detectable amounts of gel-extracted, size-selected DNA and were dropped from further library preparation. The remaining samples (ranging from 25 to 46 ng total), were each spiked with a small amount of unmethylated phage DNA, and this mixture was used as input for bisulfite-sequencing library preparation. To accommodate the low input, we used the NEXTflex Bisulfite-Seq Kit (Bioo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing output (from a HiSeq 4000 instead of a MiSeq, due to the need for increased coverage) from these six libraries were processed as described above with the following exceptions: (i) we only analyzed reads that showed evidence of proper <italic>BfaI</italic> digestion and that started with the plasmid sequence we expected to precede the cloning site for human insert fragments; (ii) we trimmed the plasmid sequence from the human insert fragments prior to mapping; and (iii) we mapped to a combined reference that included the human genome (<italic>hg38</italic>), the <italic>pmSTARRseq1</italic> plasmid sequence, and the unmethylated phage genome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Low-level data processing of mRNA-seq and DNA-seq libraries</title><p>Following sequencing, we removed adapter contamination and low-quality bases from each library using <italic>cutadapt</italic>.

We estimated the number of unique fragments assayed in our experiments by counting the number of RNA fragments with unique start and end positions within each replicate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; note that we excluded mRNA and DNA-seq data for one replicate from all analyses because of low sequencing depth).</p><p>For all analyses, we focused on counts of the number of mapped reads in each library that overlapped 200 bp non-overlapping genomic intervals created with the BEDtools function ‘makewindows’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). Pileups were determined with the ‘coverage’ function. For the main experiment (i.e. excluding IFNA experiment samples; n = 11 DNA-seq and 11 mRNA-seq libraries), we removed 200 bp regions that had zero mRNA counts in three or more replicates per condition, as well as regions that had low stability and repeatability of DNA counts. Specifically, to identify high variability regions, we first normalized the filtered DNA library count matrix using the function ‘voomWithQualityWeights’ from the R package ‘limma’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Law et al., 2014</xref>). We then computed the distribution of pairwise differences in abundance between all pairs of DNA replicates. Next, we removed regions from our analysis if &gt;25% of pairs fell outside the central 90th percentile of this distribution. This filtering approach resulted in 262,829 200 bp regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Identification of enhancers and methylation dependent (MD) enhancers</title><p>Using the set of 262,829 200 bp analyzable regions from our main dataset, we first identified regions that exhibited self-transcribing regulatory activity (more mRNA relative to DNA input).

Problem (i) is unlikely to be an issue for mSTARR-seq because the <italic>pmSTARRseq1</italic> plasmid contains the R6Kγ origin of replication, unlike typical plasmids used for high-throughput reporter assays (e.g. STARR-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>) and MPRAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>)), which are built from the popular pGL3/4 family of plasmids. Importantly, when we applied a computational algorithm for prediction of eukaryotic PolII promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knudsen, 1999</xref>) to pGL3 and <italic>pmSTARRseq1</italic>, a transcription start site was predicted within the pGL3 origin of replication but not within the <italic>pmSTARRseq1</italic> origin of replication.</p><p>Problem (ii) is also unlikely to affect our mSTARR-seq experiments because K562s have inactive cGAS/STING pathways (the major avenue through which cells sense cytoplasmic DNA and induce an IFN-I response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muerdter et al., 2018</xref>)). To test this hypothesis, we performed qPCR for 6 IFN-I response genes and two control genes on total RNA extracted from K562s that either (i) had not been transfected with plasmid, or (ii) had been transfected with an unmethylated or methylated <italic>pmSTARRseq1</italic> pool. We performed qPCR on RNA from three replicate cell populations and RNA extractions for each condition (untransfected, transfected with methylated DNA, or transfected with unmethylated DNA), using the primer sequences and methods from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muerdter et al.

In addition, we used Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and the program PANTHER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mi et al., 2016</xref>) to ask whether regions with significant mSTARR-seq activity in the unmethylated condition were more likely to fall near (within 100 kb of the transcription start or end site) genes involved in the IFN-I response or other immune-related pathways, compared to the background set of all genes near a region analyzed in our K562 data set. We also asked whether the strongest unmethylated condition enhancers (top decile) were more likely to fall near genes involved in particular GO categories compared to the background set of all genes near significant mSTARR-seq enhancers. No GO categories associated with the IFN-I response or immune processes were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Luciferase reporter assays</title><p>We chose 18 candidate regions that spanned a range of mSTARR-seq activity patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5A</xref>).

We ligated each synthesized fragment to the linearized pCpGL backbone using Gibson assembly (Gibson Assembly Master Mix, New England BioLabs). Each ligation reaction was purified using a 1.5X Agencourt AMPure XP bead cleanup (Beckman Coulter), and the resulting reactions were chemically transformed into competent <italic>E. coli</italic> GT115 cells (InvivoGen), selected and grown on LB agar plates in the presence of Zeocin, and purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN).</p><p>We subjected the purified plasmid DNA (containing the pCpGL backbone and a human sequence insert) to two treatments: (i) in vitro methylation by <italic>M.SssI</italic> methyltransferase in the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which results in methylation of all CpGs; or (ii) a mock treatment using only SAM and no methyltransferase. We confirmed that the human sequence insert was methylated as expected by digesting each treated plasmid with <italic>MspI</italic>, a methylation insensitive enzyme that targets the sequence motif CCGG, and <italic>HpaII</italic>, an isoschizomer of <italic>MspI</italic> whose activity is blocked by DNA methylation.</p><p>We transfected each methylated or unmethylated plasmid construct into the K562 line. Specifically, when cells were approximately 70% confluent, we washed and seeded them in pools of 25,000 cells. Transient transfection was performed by adding 20 uL of OPTIMEM Reduced Serum Media (Gibco) containing the following reagents: (i) 100 ng of methylated or unmethylated vector (eight replicates for each condition); (ii) 10 ng of Renilla control vector; (iii) 0.5 uL of Lipofectamine; and (iv) 0.1 uL of the PLUS reagent (from the Lipofectamine 2000 system, Life Technologies). Cells were incubated for 72 hr following transfection, and subsequently assayed for transgene luciferase expression with the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega; full results presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5B</xref>). We excluded 1–2 replicates for certain constructs because of obvious liquid evaporation during luciferase expression measurement (resulting in a final data set with 6–8 replicates per construct).</p><p>We quantified enhancer activity by first normalizing firefly luciferase activity against renilla luciferase activity to control for variation in transfection efficiency or cell number. We then asked whether human DNA fragments with strong enhancer activity in the unmethylated condition in mSTARR-seq also displayed strong enhancer activity in our validation experiments (specifically, in the ‘sham’ condition where the sequence was unmethylated). To do so, we used linear mixed effects models to predict log<sub>2</sub> normalized luciferase activity as a function of the synthesized fragment length (because larger query fragments tend to have stronger activity), the estimate of enhancer strength in the unmethylated condition from mSTARR-seq (provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and a random effect of assay batch. To ask whether fragments with MD enhancer activity in mSTARR-seq also displayed MD enhancer activity in our validation experiments, we used a similar modeling approach with log<sub>2</sub> normalized luciferase activity in the unmethylated condition divided by log<sub>2</sub> normalized luciferase activity in the methylated condition as the outcome variable. In this case, our model included the synthesized fragment length, the estimate of MD activity from mSTARR-seq (provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), and a random effect of assay batch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Annotation of analyzed mSTARR-seq fragments</title><p>Each 200 bp region was originally assayed on one or more ~300 bp fragments.

We compared MD enhancers with greater activity when unmethylated against enhancers with no evidence for methylation dependence in the K562 cell line (FDR &gt; 50% in the test for MD activity). Because random forests require a complete data set, we removed regions with missing values for any of the predictive features, resulting in a data set of n = 2317 MD enhancers and n = 2657 non-MD enhancers. We did not attempt a parallel analysis using MD enhancers with greater activity when methylated because of the relatively small data set of sequences that exhibited this pattern.</p><p>We then used the R package ‘randomForest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</xref>) to iteratively construct training sets comprised of approximately 2/3 of the original data, and test sets comprised of the remaining enhancers in the data set (the ‘out of bag’ set). We grew 1000 classification trees and evaluated predictive accuracy using the out of bag test sets (note that although the set of regions used as the training versus test set differ in each iteration, for any given run, the test set were completely held out during model training). We then assigned a given region to a given predicted outcome class if the majority (&gt;50%) of trees ‘voted’ for this class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for true positive/false positive trade-offs using alternative thresholds). To estimate the predictive value of individual features, we calculated the mean decrease in accuracy and the Gini coefficient, and estimated the significance of these contributions via comparison to the results of permutation analyses (1000 permutations of MD versus non-MD classification) implemented in the R package ‘rfPermute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archer, 2015</xref>). We considered a variable to be significant if the mean decrease in accuracy and Gini coefficient estimates both passed a 10% empirical FDR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for significant variables; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> for information on all features). We note that these importance measures do not account for correlations between features (e.g., CpG number, CpG density, and methylation level). None of our variables are perfectly collinear, however, and our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> indicate that all significantly predictive features contain some independent information (otherwise the accuracy of the RF would not drop when one feature was removed).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Transcription factor binding motif enrichment analyses</title><p>To ask whether binding sites for certain TFs were consistently associated with windows with MD enhancer activity, we used the ‘findMotifsGenome.pl’ script in the motif analysis program HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) to test for enrichment of 364 known vertebrate binding motifs relative to the background set of fragment windows associated with all mSTARR-seq enhancers. We performed this analysis twice, focusing on test sets of fragment windows associated with MD enhancers that were more active when unmethylated and more active when methylated, respectively.

To test for enrichment of specific TF families among the set of significant motifs identified in the K562 data set, we used hypergeometric tests to compare the proportion of significant motifs belonging to a particular TF family (e.g. ETS, GATA) to the proportion of all tested motifs that belong to that family.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of locus-specific DNA methylation data</title><p>We generated bisulfite sequencing libraries across six replicates from our IFNA experiments (n = 2 unmethylated, IFNA-; n = 2 methylated, IFNA+; n = 2 methylated, IFNA-). Using data from the IFNA- samples, we estimated mean methylation levels for the plasmid backbone (where we expect no methylation) and human insert fragments separately. To ask whether the endogenous methylation level of a given CpG site affects the likelihood of that site gaining or losing DNA methylation marks post-transfection, we used ENCODE whole genome bisulfite sequencing data for K562s (NCBI GEO accession GSM958729). Specifically, for IFNA- unmethylated and methylated replicates separately, we calculated the Spearman correlation between the mean post-transfection methylation level of each CpG site sequenced at ≥1 x coverage in at least one mSTARR sample and its endogenous methylation level in K562s (for CpG sites sequenced at &gt;5 x coverage in the ENCODE dataset; n = 201,524 and 91,103 sites analyzed for the unmethylated and methylated replicates, respectively). To understand whether CpGs in certain TFBS were more likely to gain or lose methylation post-transfection, we estimated the mean methylation level of all CpGs in binding sites identified from K562 ChIP-seq data, for 127 TFs separately (see item (v) in <italic>Annotation of analyzed mSTARR-seq fragments</italic>). We excluded TFs from this analysis if we did not cover at least 100 CpGs in binding sites for the focal TF, leaving us with 123 and 121 analyzable TFs for unmethylated and methylated samples, respectively. Finally, we used hypergeometric tests to investigate enrichment of individual TF families among the top 20 TFs associated with the greatest change in DNA methylation post-transfection (increase in methylation in the unmethylated condition or demethylation in the methylated condition), using TF family annotations from HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression levels in primary cells and after IFNA treatment</title><p>To understand whether mSTARR-seq data explains heterogeneity in in vivo DNA methylation-gene expression correlations across individuals, in primary cells, we used a publicly available data set on 1202 monocyte samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>). We downloaded paired genome-wide DNA methylation data (measured on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) and gene expression data (measured on the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip) for each sample. DNA methylation data were provided as continuously varying, unbounded M-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Du et al., 2010</xref>) and expression data were provided as raw signal intensity values, which we normalized using the <italic>voom</italic> function in the <italic>limma</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Law et al., 2014</xref>)).</p><p>We filtered the DNA methylation data and expression data to remove probes with mean detection level p-values&gt;0.05. We further filtered the DNA methylation data to remove probes with M-values corresponding to an average methylation level &lt;0.1 or&gt;0.9, which represent constitutively hypo- and hypermethylated regions, respectively. This filtering left us with 15,247 probes measuring gene expression and 425,895 probes measuring DNA methylation. We next identified CpG sites that overlapped regions with significant enhancer activity in our mSTARR-seq assay. We associated each of these CpG sites to its closest gene and removed CpG sites from our analysis that were &gt;100 kb from any gene. In the remaining set of 2699 unique CpG sites (associated with 1002 unique genes), we used linear models to test for an association between methylation levels at each filtered CpG site and gene expression levels. We extracted the p-value and estimated coefficient from each model, and considered a correlation to be significant if it passed a 10% FDR. Finally, we annotated each CpG based on whether it overlapped an MD or non-MD enhancer. We used two-sided Fisher’s Exact Tests to investigate enrichment of CpG methylation-expression correlations in MD versus non-MD mSTARR-seq enhancers.</p><p>Finally, to confirm that DNA methylation-gene expression correlations arise following major environmental perturbations to gene expression, we generated mRNA-seq, DNA-seq, and BS-seq data from K562s transfected with methylated libraries and treated with either IFNA (IFNA+) or water (the control condition: IFNA-). After confirming there were no systematic differences in plasmid DNA input between replicates (all R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.98, linear models comparing limma-normalized counts between all pairs of replicates), we used the mRNA-seq data to estimate IFNA effects on enhancer activity. Specifically, we calculated the mean difference in limma-normalized counts between IFNA + and IFNA - samples for each 200 bp region captured in at least one replicate per condition (n = 217,439 regions). To estimate IFNA effects on plasmid DNA methylation levels, we calculated the mean difference in post-transfection methylation levels between IFNA + and IFNA - samples, for CpGs covered by at least one replicate per condition and that also overlapped the set of 217,439 analyzable 200 bp regions (n = 7010 CpG sites from 2678 200 bp regions). We then calculated the Spearman correlation between the effect of the IFNA challenge on enhancer activity and the effect of IFNA on mean plasmid methylation levels, for all 200 bp regions and for 200 bp regions that showed progressively more strongly induced enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, we used logistic regression to test whether IFNA-induced changes in enhancer activity predicted the probability of demethylation after IFNA treatment, where sites were categorized into those that either retained (0) or lost (1) their initial, <italic>M.SssI</italic>-induced methylation status.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Cell lines</title><p>All experiments described here used the K562 cell line (ATCC CCL-243).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Genome-wide quantification of the effects of DNA methylation on human gene regulation&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions requested, including potentially new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>We request that your plan to revise the manuscript includes an analysis, using existing data, of whether the enhancers, bound by methylation-independent binders, are methylated at the endogenous loci (potentially using DNA methylation data from K562). If they are found to be endogenously de-methylated, then you will need to explain why the endogenous enhancer is hypomethylated, while the episomal constructs remain methylated, even when the same transcription factors are bound at both sites. If such data are shown, interpreted and discussed, then the reader can better understand this issue.</p><p>The reviewers noted that no strong correlation between methylation and expression was reported previously, yet differential methylation does correlate with gene expression variance. For example, an increase in gene expression is correlated with a decrease in methylation of promoter and/or enhancers that underlie this up-regulation. To take this into account, the reviewers requested a plan for further measurements in the reporter assay, along with the methylation state of the episomal constructs during a state transition, such as cell differentiation, or a treatment (e.g., a drug treatment of K562, which causes large transcriptional changes) in which changes in transcription factor binding and consequent effects are expected. We finally note that the prediction of motifs in methylation dependent vs. independent enhancers is good, but remains at the prediction level, and is not validated experimentally.</p><p>The reviewers also request a plan for extended analyses on assay coverage and other aspects of the computational analysis (see reviewer #3's comments).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors propose a new experimental approach, mSTARR-Seq, for testing the causal effects of DNA methylation on gene expression at millions of methylation CpG sites. They find that few sites are 'methylation dependent' but those that are MD are predictable from chromatin state measurements. The approach, to my knowledge, is novel, robust and produces important new findings. I do not have substantive concerns. The comments that I provide below are thus not intended to imply a lack of support for this manuscript.</p><p>I was surprised that the 8% figure in Results paragraph three was not emphasised more. It is important, to my mind, that the reader is told explicitly about this 92%:8% split. Previous statements, such as &quot;our observations indicate a substantial degree of coordination between methylation levels and gene expression&quot; (Banovich et al.) might be interpreted as implying otherwise.</p><p>The RF approach predicted MD regulatory element activity with ~79% accuracy, with 26 features being significantly contributing. The MD transcription factor-DNA binding findings (summarised in Figure 4) are complementary to similar findings from others, e.g. Yin et al., 2017 and Table 1.</p><p>&quot;We also show that MD regulatory elements explain site-to-site heterogeneity in the strength of DNA methylation-gene expression correlations measured within a population sample&quot;. Can the authors be clearer quantitatively how explanatory this is?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Lea et al. describe mSTARR-seq: STARR-seq using a library of enhancers, whereby the library is either methylated (in bacteria) or unmethylated. Comparison of enhancer reporter levels between both conditions, allows identifying methylation-dependent enhancers, as well as methylation-independent. What is interesting about this study is that it aims to provide a direct measurement of the causality of DNA methylation of an enhancer/promoter sequence in driving gene expression. However, the interpretation of the data is not fully convincing, there is little follow-up, and because of that the study, in its current form, has limited depth. This is a difficult problem, so the attention and approach is timely, but given the confusion and contradictions in the field about DNA methylation and TF binding, it is important that the threshold for understanding is high enough (which I believe, in its current form, is not the case). Basically, to enable causal relationship between a priori DNA methylation state and reporter output is very difficult to achieve simply because transcription factors are at play.</p><p>– Transcription factors can drive cell state transitions (e.g., differentiation, reprogramming, etc.), and are known to &quot;override&quot; DNA methylation state, and also to maintain methylation state. Specificity of regulatory regions is firstly determined by active transcription factors (e.g. GATA in K562). Regions with GATA motifs are found to be active independent of DNA methylation, which is in line with this, since GATA factors play a driving role of K562 identity/transcriptome. If the same library would be transfected into another cell line, with other driving factors, then other enhancers would be predicted to show methylation-independent regulation. The conundrum in this reasoning, is that these driver TFs, when positively regulating reporter gene expression, would result in de-methylation; while the authors report that methylation before and after is unchanged.</p><p>– Reasoning further on this point. The fact that enhancer methylation remains &quot;intact&quot; after transfection is not in agreement with current literature, whereby transcription factors that bind to the enhancer, and activate a target gene (here, the reporter), result (directly or indirectly) in loss of methylation. Since such methylation changes are not observed in the presented experiments, there may be at least two possible explanations. Firstly, there could be a technical problem/artefact somewhere, for example in the re-sequencing of the plasmids after transfection, or in the analysis; secondly: the methylation/demethylation could be dependent on chromatin, while the episomal constructs are not chromatinized (they could be chromatinized, but the authors have not tested whether they are). Which of these explanations the authors think is the correct one? This should all be discussed and supported by experiments/analyses. If the authors claim that it is normal that methylation is so stable that changes in transcription do not alter DNA methylation, then they go against existing data, and should support this with additional experiments. For example, induction/over-expression of a transcription factor, or knock-down of a transcription factor, which causes significant transcriptional changes of its target genes, does (unequivocally) alter DNA methylation state of the enhancers/promoters of its target genes (the genes that are directly bound, can be checked with ChIP-seq and motifs) and that are significantly up or down-regulated. In such an experiment, if the endogenous enhancer does changes in DNA methylation, but the episomal construct with a copy of that enhancer does not, then it's clear that methylation changes are not recapitulated in the episomal construct. If, on the other hand, the episomal enhancer also changes, then the conclusion in the current version, that DNA methylation does not change, is incorrect. In conclusion, the entire premise of this work is that TFs are fully dependent on the DNA methylation state; they can either bind unmethylated or methylated DNA, but not alter it. This goes against most literature, where transcription factors &quot;rule&quot;, in the sense that over-expression of a particular combination of TFs (e.g., Yamanaka factors), or sometimes one, results in changes of cell state, transcriptome, hence DNA methylation.</p><p>– Related to this point again. No strong correlation between methylation and expression was reported before, yet differential methylation does correlate with differential gene expression. For example, an increase in gene expression is correlated with a decrease in methylation of promoter and/or enhancers that underlie this up-regulation. To take this into account, it may be required to measure the reporter assay, and the methylation state, of the reporters during a state transition, such as differentiation, or a treatment (e.g., drug treatment of K562 that causes large transcriptional changes).</p><p>– The prediction of motifs in methylation dependent vs. independent enhancers is good, but remains at the prediction level, and is not validated experimentally.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The paper reports a massively parallel reporter assay to adapt STARR-seq to probe methylation dependent regulatory activity. In principle, this assay is innovative and important, as it will be able to address timely and relevant questions. Understanding the functional consequence of DNA methylation variation is a major open challenge, which can be addressed using this assay. Overall, the paper is clear and well written. The technical controls present a largely sufficient. However, I have a few technical comments and would request extended analyses on assay coverage and other aspects of the computational analysis.</p><p>1) Improved analysis of sequence coverage. Based on the current description of the text, it is hard to decipher the coverage properties of the method. It would be helpful to clarify the CpG coverage as a function of the number of fragments assayed and the number of replicates taken into account. Also, how uniform is the fragment coverage compared to a complete MspI digest? Are there any &quot;blindspots&quot; of the protocol?</p><p>2) Assessment of raw count data and quantification of regulatory activity. Access of plasmid-derived mRNA relative to DNA input is used to define regulatory activity. I would like to see more analysis on the characteristics of these quantitative data. What is the dynamic range of this activity measure, e.g. in their distribution for the 200bp bins that are used for analysis? A related question is additional QC for the linear model that is used to call (MD) regulatory activity. The approach outline in the Materials and methods seems sensible, however I would request additional diagnostics to check that the calls are statistically calibrated. Given that only a small proportion of all windows are regulatory active, the distribution of p-values should be uniform up the ~8% that contain signal. A QQ plot would be reassuring to validate that the filters employed are appropriate.</p><p>3) Impact of fragment length. If I interpret Figure 2B correctly, the enrichment of mSTARR-seq enhance activity for enhancer annotations are substantially higher for longer fragments. The authors comment on a relationship of assay sensitivity with fragment length. However, I feel this issue warrants further exploration. In particular, the enrichment analysis is not strictly a measure of sensitivity only but instead a combination of sensitivity and specificity. A more detailed analysis of coverage by fragment size and specificity and sensitivity would seem useful, also to guide the user for designing future studies.</p><p>4) Prediction of MF and non-MD regulatory activity. The random forest analysis is interesting. I would request additional controls/clarifications. First, the evaluation approach is somewhat misleading. The results are presented in terms of accuracy at an undefined threshold. A canonical approach would be a precision/recall curve for a continuous range of prediction thresholds. Similarly, a &quot;clean&quot; hold-out assessment, e.g. using a certain proportion of bins that were not used during training, would be much better than using outer bags of the RF. Finally, I am puzzled about the presented results on feature importance. CpG_number, CpP_density and Methylation_level are correlated variables, yet taking out anyone of these predictors does appear to result in a substantial drop in accuracy. It is not clear whether the importance measure accounts for correlations between features and what precisely is shown in Figure 3F.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37513.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors propose a new experimental approach, mSTARR-Seq, for testing the causal effects of DNA methylation on gene expression at millions of methylation CpG sites.

Further, power to detect MD activity depends on the level of experimental replication; some regions do exhibit greater enhancer activity in one condition relative to the other, but do not reach statistical significance in our study (as now observable in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

However, TF binding can also itself be methylation-dependent (as shown in Yin et al., 2017, Hu et al., 2013, and supported by the data presented here in Figures 4 and 5A/B). Thus, we now clarify that our data are best interpreted as a test of whether differences in DNA methylation are <italic>sufficient</italic> to causally alter gene regulation, in the context of the cellular environment in which the assay is conducted (Discussion section, paragraph two). Because the treatment condition (methylated versus unmethylated) is the only exogenous variable in an mSTARR-seq experiment, all signals of MD activity depend on the original treatment status—even if methylation status changes after TF binding. In this respect, the assay is conservative because rapid demethylation of the methylated treatment (or rapid methylation of the unmethylated treatment) would result in no MD signal: the two treatment conditions, methylated and unmethylated, would effectively become identical (see paragraph five of subsection “Determinants of methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity”).</p><p>Nevertheless, we very much appreciate your point about TF remodeling of DNA methylation. Our initial report of DNA methylation stability was based on bisulfite sequencing analysis of CpG sites introduced through Gibson assembly of test fragments ligated to Illumina-style adapters, which contain 2 CpGs. This was described in the Materials and methods (subsection “Generation and low-level processing of bisulfite sequencing libraries”) but is now clarified in paragraph two of the Results section and the legend for Figure 1E. Figure 1E therefore shows that <italic>transfection itself</italic> does not compromise our experimental manipulation of DNA methylation. It does not speak to the methylation status of individual fragments with binding sites for specific TFs. However, we agree that changes in DNA methylation post-transfection are expected near the binding sites of TFs linked to demethylating behavior (to our knowledge, this behavior is well-supported for some, but not all TFs: e.g., Suzuki et al., 2017 and references therein).</p><p>To test this prediction and address the concerns raised above, we therefore performed additional experiments to generate a locus-specific bisulfite sequencing data set that allowed us to ask whether and where DNA methylation levels change post-transfection (our earlier data in Figure 1E are too low coverage to address this question). Consistent with our previous findings, at the CpG sites introduced by Gibson assembly (that is, at sites that link fragment inserts to the plasmid backbone), the mean methylation level post-transfection is high for the methylated treatment (95.1%) but very low for the unmethylated treatment (1.6%). Thus, we again confirm that transfection itself does not appreciably disrupt our experimental treatment.</p><p>However, for human DNA fragments inserted in the mSTARR-seq vector, we observe low levels of both demethylation (of methylated condition fragments) and the addition of methyl groups (to unmethylated condition fragments). These changes result in convergence to endogenous K562 DNA methylation levels post-transfection (now reported in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and paragraph five of subsection “Determinants of methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity”), suggesting that the sequence of mSTARR-seq query fragments, in combination with the environment of K562 cells, provides information about cell type “appropriate” DNA methylation levels. Further—and directly relevant to the concerns raised above—specific transcription factor binding sites (based on ChIP-seq data in K562s) are overrepresented in these regions (see new Supplementary File 9) and demethylation is most strongly enriched at GATA TF ChIP-seq peaks. Our data are therefore consistent with the argument that some, but not all, TFs are methylation-sensitive and some, but not all, are associated with subsequent demethylation; however, pioneer TFs like the GATA TFs may have both of these characteristics. We describe these results in paragraph six of subsection “Determinants of methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity”, and new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript, and thank the reviewer for motivating this important experiment and analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Related to this point again. No strong correlation between methylation and expression was reported before, yet differential methylation does correlate with differential gene expression. For example, an increase in gene expression is correlated with a decrease in methylation of promoter and/or enhancers that underlie this up-regulation. To take this into account, it may be required to measure the reporter assay, and the methylation state, of the reporters during a state transition, such as differentiation, or a treatment (e.g., drug treatment of K562 that causes large transcriptional changes).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that major changes in cell state will produce shifts in gene expression that correlate with shifts in DNA methylation. Our analysis relating mSTARR-seq to DNA methylation-gene expression correlations focused on DNA methylation and gene expression values measured <italic>across individuals</italic> (at the same loci), whereas DNA methylation-gene expression correlations after changes in cell state focus on correlations <italic>across loci</italic> in a single genome. These are different levels of analysis that produce different results. For example, while the mean correlation across individuals in the monocyte data set is near 0, the mean correlation within a single genome is rho = -0.152 +/- 0.018 s.d. (all p&lt;10<sup>-16</sup>; rho is calculated for each of n=1202 human monocyte data sets).</p><p>In the revision, we have clarified these key differences (see subsection “mSTARR-seq explains site-to-site heterogeneity in the strength of DNA methylation level-gene expression level correlations in vivo”). In addition, because we agree that DNA methylation-gene expression correlations across loci following major gene expression shifts are of interest, we have added a new experiment to the manuscript. Specifically, we perturbed K562 gene expression via treatment with IFN alpha, and measured subsequent changes in plasmid DNA methylation and reporter gene expression. These results highlight that large scale changes in the expression of mSTARR-seq fragments (i.e., an increase in mSTARR-seq RNA levels relative to input DNA levels, induced by IFN alpha treatment) are associated with changes in methylation status on the same fragments. Thus, while mSTARR-seq is designed to ask “what happens to gene expression when DNA methylation is perturbed/varies?” rather than “what happens to DNA methylation when gene expression is perturbed/varies?”, it remains entirely consistent with previous observations that differential methylation and differential expression are correlated within a genome, when that genome undergoes a major state transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The prediction of motifs in methylation dependent vs. independent enhancers is good, but remains at the prediction level, and is not validated experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity: we do not perform any prediction of TF motifs in our manuscript. We now clarify that our random forests analysis uses experimentally ascertained TF binding sites from K562 ChIP-seq data (subsection “Determinants of methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity” and “Annotation of analyzed mSTARR-seq fragments”), while our analyses of TF motifs in MD and non-MD enhancers and in comparison to SELEX data rely on a library of known TF motifs from the HOMER database (paragraph three of subsection “Determinants of methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity” and subsection “Transcription factor binding motif enrichment analyses”). We also integrate independent experimental data in two ways: (i) we compare TFs enriched in MD enhancers that are more active in either methylated or unmethylated states to DNMT triple-knockout DNase-seq data (paragraph four of subsection “Determinants of methylation-dependent (MD) regulatory activity” and Figure 4); and (ii) we compare our enrichments for MD and non-MD enhancers to SELEX data on TF binding to methylated versus unmethylated DNA ligands (paragraph three and Figure 5). Both analyses corroborate our findings, providing a key form of experimental validation even though the other data sets were generated elsewhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) Improved analysis of sequence coverage. Based on the current description of the text, it is hard to decipher the coverage properties of the method. It would be helpful to clarify the CpG coverage as a function of the number of fragments assayed and the number of replicates taken into account. Also, how uniform is the fragment coverage compared to a complete MspI digest? Are there any &quot;blindspots&quot; of the protocol?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these summaries are useful. We now show how the number of fragments assayed, number of CpGs analyzed, and coverage per CpG site scales depending on sequencing depth and the number of technical replicates performed (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). With respect to possible ‘blindspots’ of our protocol, we report in Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Results paragraph three that our final dataset includes 57% of fragments expected from a complete <italic>Msp1</italic> digest of the human genome. However, our plasmid input library contains 93% of expected fragments (Results paragraph two), indicating that the majority of fragments that are “missing” in our analysis are not represented because they are not consistently expressed in either methylated or unmethylated conditions. Our data thus suggest minimal true “blindspots,” but do point to many regions with minimal regulatory activity. We have added this information to the legend for Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Assessment of raw count data and quantification of regulatory activity. Access of plasmid-derived mRNA relative to DNA input is used to define regulatory activity. I would like to see more analysis on the characteristics of these quantitative data. What is the dynamic range of this activity measure, e.g. in their distribution for the 200bp bins that are used for analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>To show the dynamic range of enhancer activity, and particularly the range we are able to identify as showing significant enhancer activity, we have added two new plots (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The first figure shows the distribution of log2 fold changes between normalized RNA and normalized DNA counts (where excess RNA relative to DNA implies enhancer activity) for regions we called as enhancers versus regions without significant regulatory activity. The second shows the proportion of regions we called as enhancers as a function of the log<sub>2</sub>-fold change. As we note above (response to Reviewer 1), these plots show that weak enhancers may be undetected at the significance thresholds we employed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related question is additional QC for the linear model that is used to call (MD) regulatory activity. The approach outline in Materials and methods seems sensible, however I would request additional diagnostics to check that the calls are statistically calibrated. Given that only a small proportion of all windows are regulatory active, the distribution of p-values should be uniform up the ~8% that contain signal. A QQ plot would be reassuring to validate that the filters employed are appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the distribution of p-values should be uniform for the set of true negatives (true non-MD enhancers). However, although our dataset includes more replicates than typically employed in massively parallel reporter assays, our set of regions without significant activity undoubtedly contains false negatives due to power constraints (especially after correction for multiple hypothesis testing and especially for loci with weak enhancer activity: see new paragraph two of subsection “Validation against low-throughput reporter assays and comparison with endogenous measures of regulatory function”). This is evident in the QQ plot in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Importantly, however, permutation analyses show that true negatives produce the expected uniform distribution of p-values when using the same modeling approach (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This result indicates that our statistical tests are well-calibrated, even if we miss weakly MD enhancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Impact of fragment length. If I interpret Figure 2B correctly, the enrichment of mSTARR-seq enhance activity for enhancer annotations are substantially higher for longer fragments. The authors comment on a relationship of assay sensitivity with fragment length. However, I feel this issue warrants further exploration. In particular, the enrichment analysis is not strictly a measure of sensitivity only but instead a combination of sensitivity and specificity. A more detailed analysis of coverage by fragment size and specificity and sensitivity would seem useful, also to guide the user for designing future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, this is an excellent point. We now show the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 3, for enhancers found on fragments of different lengths. We note that this analysis is somewhat limited by the assumption that ENCODE enhancer annotations are all true positives and that regions that are not annotated as enhancers are all true negatives. Even with this limitation, however, specificity/sensitivity is still clearly quantitatively related to fragment length: larger fragments are both better at detecting true enhancers and less prone to false positives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Prediction of MF and non-MD regulatory activity. The random forest analysis is interesting. I would request additional controls / clarifications. First, the evaluation approach is somewhat misleading. The results are presented in terms of accuracy at an undefined threshold. A canonical approach would be a precision/recall curve for a continuous range of prediction thresholds.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We report the proportion of regions that were correctly assigned by the random forests analysis as MD enhancers or non MD enhancers. Each model iteration/classification tree assigns a given region to a given outcome class, and we considered a given region to be assigned to a given outcome overall if the majority (&gt;50%) of trees ‘voted’ for this class (we used 1000 model iterations/classification trees). We now clarify this procedure in subsection “Random forests classification” of the revised Materials and methods and show an ROC curve that explores our results if we require a threshold &gt;50% for class assignment in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, a &quot;clean&quot; hold-out assessment, e.g. using a certain proportion of bins that were not used during training, would be much better than using outer bags of the RF.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on the importance of using a distinct test set. We set our random forest procedures such that each model iteration used 2/3 of the data for training and a completely independent 1/3 of the data for testing. The set of regions used as the training versus test set are permuted across each of the 1000 model iterations, but within a given run the test data are completely held out during model training, which we now clarify in the revised text (subsection “Random forests classification”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I am puzzled about the presented results on feature importance. CpG_number, CpP_density and Methylation_level are correlated variables, yet taking out anyone of these predictors does appear to result in a substantial drop in accuracy. It is not clear whether the importance measure accounts for correlations between features and what precisely is shown in Figure 3F.</p></disp-quote><p>Our importance measures do not account for correlations between features. Thus, Figure 3F shows the mean decrease in accuracy when excluding each focal variable in isolation. If the information contained in that focal variable is completely redundant with the information provided by other, correlated variables, the accuracy of the RF will not drop. Although CpG_number, CpG_density and Methylation_level are correlated (Spearman’s rho: CpG_number and Methylation_level, -0.048; CpG_density and Methylation_level, -0.155; CpG_number and CpG_density, 0.91), they are not perfectly collinear. Our results therefore indicate that they contain some independent pieces of information about methylation-dependent activity. We now clarify this point in subsection “Random forests classification”, and note that if we remove CpG_number and CpG_density, our model accuracy drops from 78% to 72%.</p></body></sub-article></article>
