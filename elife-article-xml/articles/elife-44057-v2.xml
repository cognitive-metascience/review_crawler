The <italic>Zdbf2</italic> gene—involved in growth control—provides a valuable model to study this window: upon exit from naïve pluripotency and prior to tissue differentiation, it undergoes a switch from a distal to a proximal promoter usage, accompanied by a switch from polycomb to DNA methylation occupancy. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) system to mimic this period, we show here that four enhancers contribute to the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter switch, concomitantly with dynamic changes in chromatin architecture. In ESCs, the locus is partitioned to facilitate enhancer contacts with the distal <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter. Relieving the partition enhances proximal <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter activity, as observed during differentiation or with genetic mutants. Importantly, we show that 3D regulation occurs upstream of the polycomb and DNA methylation pathways. Our study reveals the importance of multi-layered regulatory frameworks to ensure proper spatio-temporal activation of developmentally important genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>polycomb</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cog EpiRepro</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourc'his</surname><given-names>Deborah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LTF 457-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Maxim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doc Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Maxim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Three-dimensional chromatin architecture facilitates a promoter switch in order to ensure maintained expression of a gene involved in growth during embryonic stem cell differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the early stages of mammalian development, as the embryo implants into uterine wall, the pluripotent cells that will go on to form somatic tissues transition from ‘naïve’ to ‘primed’ for lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). One hallmark of the naïve pluripotent state is globally low DNA methylation, whereas primed cells are highly DNA methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seisenberger et al., 2012</xref>). Incidentally, chromatin architecture and the underlying histone modifications are also dramatically remodeled during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu and Xie, 2018</xref>). Collectively, this process is referred to as epigenetic reprogramming, and it accompanies dynamic changes to the transcriptional landscape.</p><p>Yet, during the naïve-to-primed transition, certain genes must maintain constant expression despite the massively reshaping epigenome underfoot. A well-documented mechanism during this window is the phenomenon of enhancer switching: as cells differentiate, and therefore express a different suite of transcription factors, enhancers specific for the naïve state will cease their activity, and enhancers attuned to the primed state will become active. In this manner, distinct enhancers can regulate the same promoter, thus ensuring continuous expression. Notably, the general regulator of pluripotency <italic>Oct4</italic> (also known as <italic>Pou5f1</italic>) relies on an naïve and primed cell-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yeom et al., 1996</xref>), as does the developmental regulator <italic>Nodal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papanayotou et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, it was demonstrated that the transcription factor GRHL2 coordinates a large set of these enhancer switches for epithelial genes by activating the primed set of enhancers during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus exhibits an alternative strategy to maintain expression during this cellular transition. In the naïve state, the distal <italic>Long isoform of Zdbf2</italic> promoter (<italic>pLiz</italic>) is active. As cells exit naïve pluripotency, a promoter switch occurs, resulting in activation of the proximal <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter (<italic>pZdbf2</italic>), located 73 kilobases (kb) downstream. From the primed state and then throughout life, <italic>pZdbf2</italic> is the functional promoter while <italic>pLiz</italic> is constitutively silenced. It should be noted that despite the genomic distance, there is no change in the message between the <italic>Liz</italic> and <italic>Zdbf2</italic> isoforms, thus the promoter switch does not result in protein diversity. Rather, there is a stratified relationship between the two promoters: <italic>pLiz</italic> activity is absolutely required for imprinted deposition of DNA methylation at a somatic differentially methylated region (sDMR). The sDMR DNA methylation, in turn, antagonizes a block of polycomb-mediated repression, freeing <italic>pZdbf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duffié et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Mice that are deficient for <italic>pLiz</italic> are never able to activate <italic>pZdbf2</italic>, and this leads to a substantial growth defect. Thus, the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus provides a valuable model to dissect how promoter switching occurs in concert with changing chromatin dynamics during cellular differentiation.</p><p>We show here using a cell-based approach that several enhancers cooperate to regulate the dynamics activity of the different <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoters. Moreover, CCCTC-BINDING FACTOR (CTCF)-mediated contacts at the locus change dynamically during differentiation, and contribute to the sequential activity of the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoters. Saliently, 3D organization of the locus appears to exert its effect epistatically with respect to the DNA methylation and polycomb pathways. This implies that there are two layers of chromatin-based control of <italic>Zdbf2</italic>: one at the level of chromatin marks and the other at the level of chromatin architecture. The highly regulated nature of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> underscores the importance of structural chromosome topology occurring in concert with chromatin marks to control proper spatio-temporal expression of developmentally consequential genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two classes of putative enhancers lie in the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus</title><p>To discover functional genetic elements that regulate <italic>Zdbf2</italic> alternative promoter usage during de novo DNA methylation, we performed an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) on DNA hypomethylated naïve ESCs (cultured in 2i/LIF + vitC) and on primed, highly DNA methylated epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) at day 7 (D7) of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A protracted differentiation protocol is necessary to observe the promoter-switch dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>), which distinguishes this protocol from typical short-term EpiLC differentiation methods that generally last two or three days. As such, the transcriptome at later time-points of differentiation is more in line with primed epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) in culture, as opposed to ‘formative’ EpiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalkan and Smith, 2014</xref>).

Given that these regions of accessible chromatin were not lying on obvious active promoters, we reasoned that they were potential enhancer elements and named them E1 to E4, from the closest to the most distal to <italic>pLiz</italic>. Therefore we assayed for enrichment of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), a mark of active enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>). E1-3 appeared enriched for the H3K27ac mark in both cell types, while E4 was enriched for the mark only in D7 EpiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, while E1-3 can be classified as active in ESCs and EpiLCs, the chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac dynamics at E4 are reminiscent of so-called ‘poised’ enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>).

OCT4 is enriched at all of the putative enhancers in both naïve ESCs and D7 EpiLCs (two pluripotent cell types), indicating that both classes of enhancers are likely regulated in a pluripotency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buecker et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, publicly available in vivo data from the naïve pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst exhibit a chromatin accessibility and H3K27me3 pattern akin to what we observed in ESCs for the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus, suggesting that the in vivo and in cellula regulation are coherent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>High resolution 4C reveals enhancer-promoter dynamic interactions</title><p>Given that E1-4 exhibit the chromatin signature of enhancer elements, it is possible that the <italic>Liz</italic> and <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoters undergo dynamic interactions with these regulatory elements during the ESC to EpiLC transition.

This is consistent with the possibility that E1-3 contribute to <italic>pLiz</italic> regulation. Given the close proximity between <italic>pLiz</italic> and E1-3, interactions remained unsurprisingly high in EpiLCs, when <italic>Liz</italic> is repressed. No marked looping appeared to occur between <italic>pLiz</italic> and E4 in either ESCs or D7 EpiLCs.</p><p>A clear picture emerged from the analysis for the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter (<italic>pZdbf2</italic>), which is active in D7 EpiLCs while E1-4 are all marked by H3K27ac. Our 4C-seq revealed that <italic>pZdbf2</italic> exhibited increased contacts with all four of the putative enhancers in D7 EpiLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This indicates a potential cooperative role for E1-4 in activating <italic>pZdbf2</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Determination of enhancer function and regulation</title><p>From our 4C-seq analyses we reasoned that E1-3 potentially regulate <italic>pLiz</italic> in ESCs, while E4 is inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test this, we generated homozygous deletions of combinations of putative enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The E3 element also serves as the promoter of the <italic>Gpr1</italic> gene, which is lowly expressed in our system and we previously showed plays no role in <italic>Zdbf2</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>). As such, deleting the element had no impact on expression or DNA methylation at the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). If E3 is an enhancer element, it may be redundant with E1 and/or E2. Therefore, we generated a ~ 13 kb deletion that encompassed E1-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the absence of these elements, the <italic>Liz</italic> transcript was markedly repressed, and the canonical <italic>Zdbf2</italic> isoform failed to properly activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As <italic>Liz</italic> transcription is required to activate <italic>pZdbf2</italic>, it should be noted that this deletion does not confirm E1-3 elements regulate <italic>pZdbf2</italic> directly.

In sum, the enhancer E4 is necessary for <italic>pZdbf2</italic> activation, irrespective of the local DNA methylation or polycomb status.</p><p>The E4 enhancer element bears the hallmark of a poised enhancer in that it is enriched for P300 in ESCs, but only becomes active in EpiLCs. However, poised enhancers were originally defined as being enriched for H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>), whereas E4 is depleted for the mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). H3K27me2, which like H3K27me3 is deposited by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), has also been reported to prevent firing of enhancers in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>). Yet H3K27me2 ChIP analysis revealed that E4 is relatively depleted for this mark as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). E4 does seem to play a role in preventing ectopic polycomb spreading: deleting E4 resulted in a slight increase of H3K27me3 enrichment 1 kb upstream of the WT polycomb domain, however the signal was identical to WT levels by 5 kb upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that in ESCs containing loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>Embryonic ectoderm development</italic> (<italic>Eed</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoeftner et al., 2006</xref>)—a core component of PRC2—there was precocious activation of <italic>pZdbf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we wanted to observe if a PRC2 mutant would result in a change in the chromatin status of E4.

We performed 4C-seq in <italic>Eed</italic> mutant ESCs in order to determine if polycomb impacts the chromosome conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In fact, in a PRC2 mutant, <italic>pZdbf2</italic> interacted even more frequently within the domain normally defined by a polycomb block in WT cells. This is likely due to the activation of E4, and increased promoter-enhancer interactions. It has recently been shown that active promoters exhibit increased agitation in the nucleus, leading to a potential increase of promoter-enhancer contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2018</xref>). Given that <italic>pZdbf2</italic> becomes preciously active in <italic>Eed</italic> mutant ESCs, logic would dictate that it would interact more frequently with E1-3, which are also active. However, our 4C-seq in the polycomb mutant showed that this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We analyzed the 4C-seq patterns of four CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>) present throughout the locus (data available upon request). In ESCs, a CTCF-binding site proximal to the <italic>Gpr1</italic> promoter formed a looping structure with two CTCF sites downstream of the <italic>Gpr1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We tested this by differentiating <italic>Dnmt</italic> tKO ESCs, which are able to differentiate to a state akin to WT D7 EpiLCs despite a total lack of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hassan-Zadeh et al., 2017</xref>).

A recent study reported that transcription can disrupt CTCF binding and chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>), yet we observed reduced CTCF enrichment even in the absence of the <italic>Liz</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

As such, <italic>Liz</italic> failed to properly express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, the deletion did not perturb expression of <italic>Gpr1</italic> nor the genes flanking the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that insulation from neighboring regulatory domains was intact. Consistently, using a CTCF degron line where CTCF is globally depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nora et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Liz</italic> was also downregulated, although it should be noted that both moderate and complete reduction of CTCF resulted in a comparable reduction of <italic>Liz</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). During differentiation of the <italic>∆CTCF_PS</italic> line, the <italic>Liz</italic> transcript was still able to attain WT levels, nevertheless <italic>Zdbf2</italic> failed to properly activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, while DNA methylation occurred normally at <italic>pLiz</italic>, the sDMR remained relatively hypomethylated compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), likely due to the delayed kinetics of <italic>Liz</italic> upregulation. Furthermore, the relative reduction of DNA methylation at the sDMR in <italic>∆CTCF_PS</italic> mutant EpiLCs was correlated with a slight retention of H3K27me3 in comparison with WT, which may contribute to the failure of <italic>pZdbf2</italic> to properly activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>pLiz</italic> activation was less efficient in <italic>∆CTCF_PS</italic> mutant ESCs, <italic>pZdbf2</italic> exhibited increased contacts with E2 and E3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, <italic>Zdbf2</italic> remained repressed, as polycomb enrichment remained unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). It should be noted that upon global depletion of CTCF, <italic>Zdbf2</italic> is de-repressed, indicating that independently of the partition site, CTCF does play a role in <italic>Zdbf2</italic> regulation in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Regardless, given that in PRC2 mutant ESCs, <italic>Zdbf2</italic> is already partially de-repressed, we reasoned that by generating an <italic>Eed</italic> mutation in combination with deleting the partition site, we could observe further increase in <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression, as <italic>pZdbf2</italic> would be unhindered from interacting with all four enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In parallel, we generated a new <italic>Eed</italic> mutation, so all cell lines would be in the identical genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We confirmed that the <italic>Eed</italic> mutant lines failed to exhibit EED protein nor H3K27me3 by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Indeed, while <italic>Zdbf2</italic> was upregulated in absence of <italic>Eed</italic> alone, the expression was significantly increased in the <italic>∆CTCF-PS; Eed-/-</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Importantly, these results were confirmed when we subjected WT and <italic>∆CTCF_PS</italic> lines to a potent PRC2 inhibitor to induce acute depletion of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that in addition to contributing to proper <italic>pLiz</italic> activation, the CTCF partition acts as a second level of protection, along with polycomb, to restrain precocious <italic>pZdbf2</italic> firing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we revealed the dynamic chromosome conformation of the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus that occurs concomitantly with epigenetic programming during differentiation. For proper <italic>Zdbf2</italic> activation, it is imperative to properly trigger <italic>Liz</italic> expression at the time de novo DNA methylation. Here we show that a CTCF-structured loop organization forms at the locus in naïve ESCs. This partition allows for proper regulation of <italic>pLiz</italic>, which in turn can facilitate a local polycomb-to-DNA methylation switch through <italic>Liz</italic> transcription. During differentiation, the partitioning is relaxed, as <italic>pLiz</italic> becomes shut down, thus allowing distal enhancers to bolster <italic>pZdbf2</italic> activation. It is conceivable that E1-3 act in a hierarchical manner with respect to E4 and <italic>pZdbf2</italic>; that is, they are important for activation of the proximal promoter rather than sustaining <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression, although further testing must be performed to formally confirm his possibility. Deleting the CTCF_PS resulted in reduced <italic>Liz</italic> activation kinetics, but a fairly substantial effect on <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression. This is consistent with our previously published <italic>Liz</italic> transcriptional interruption, where <italic>Liz</italic> expression and DNA methylation are only moderately affected, but nonetheless <italic>Zdbf2</italic> cannot attain WT levels of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Such results underscore the sensitivity of <italic>pZdbf2</italic> activity to proper epigenetic programming.</p><p>In <italic>∆CTCF_PS</italic> ESCs, <italic>Zdbf2</italic> transcription did not ectopically occur, even though there were no longer apparent restrictions for <italic>pZdbf2</italic> to interact with the active enhancers E1-3. The explanation for this is the polycomb-mediated silencing that persists over <italic>pZdbf2</italic> in the absence of CTCF_PS. Thus, there are at least two layers of regulation of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> activation that act independently from classical transcription factor control at gene promoters: 1) instructive chromosome conformation allowing for proper <italic>pLiz</italic> and <italic>pZdfb2</italic> activity, and 2) a <italic>Liz</italic>-dependent epigenetic switch to evict polycomb at <italic>pZdbf2</italic>. This tiered model, with chromosome conformation acting upstream, emphasizes the exquisite choreography that can occur to program developmentally important genes during the exit from the naïve pluripotent state. Interestingly, global depletion of CTCF leads to upregulation of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> in ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Whether this is due to direct CTCF-mediated regulation at other binding sites in the locus, or is simply an indirect effect, remains to be tested.</p><p>One outstanding question is what is the cue that releases CTCF from the partition site during differentiation? The obvious candidate was DNA methylation, and while CTCF binding at the site may indeed be DNA methylation-sensitive, we found that CTCF was released during differentiation, whether the methyl mark was present or not. Another likely explanation is that CTCF is bound in combination with pluripotency-associated transcription factors. While CTCF is generally reported to be largely invariant across mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), there are cell type-specific CTCF binding patterns, and roughly 60% occur in a DNA methylation-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our study presents a rare description of two alternative promoters utilizing a shared set of enhancers, but in a CTCF-guided, developmentally timed manner. In ESCs, CTCF is required to facilitate one promoter’s interactions (<italic>pLiz</italic>) while restricting the other’s (<italic>pZdbf2</italic>). Only upon removal of CTCF binding, the opportunity for <italic>pZdbf2</italic> is created to contact its enhancers. On the face of it, such a mechanism resembles the imprinted <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> locus, where CTCF binding near the <italic>H19</italic> gene on the maternal allele restrict interactions between a shared set of enhancers and the more distal <italic>Igf2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murrell et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Igf2/H19</italic> locus behaves differently from the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus, though, as differential CTCF binding is DNA methylation-dependent and set in the gametes—not dynamically regulated during cellular differentiation. Moreover, <italic>Igf2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> are two different genes, not isoforms of the same gene.</p><p>CTCF has been previously shown to mediate enhancer switching. For example, at the <italic>Hoxd</italic> locus in mice, CTCF facilitates the interactions between the same set of gene promoters but different sets of enhancers depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>). As mentioned, dynamic enhancer switching during the naïve-to-primed differentiation is a common mechanism in mammals to maintain gene expression; however, this phenomenon represents the inverse scenario from <italic>Zdbf2</italic> regulation, as during enhancer switching, promoters remain unchanged.</p><p>Promoter switching is a widespread and developmentally important phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davuluri et al., 2008</xref>). Aberrant promoter usage is associated with pathologies, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarda et al., 2017</xref>). CTCF is a likely candidate to organize genic three-dimensional structure and protect from aberrant promoter firing, as it does at <italic>Zdbf2</italic>. The <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus presents a compelling case, because if <italic>pLiz-</italic>to-<italic>pZdbf2</italic> promoter switch does not occur at the proper developmental time, synchronized with the de novo DNA methylation program, <italic>pZdbf2</italic> cannot be activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the organization of this locus is conserved between mouse and humans, implying the likelihood of a shared regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duffié et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies should continue to shed light on the role that CTCF dynamics play in programming developmentally important promoter activity in the crucial window that precedes somatic tissue formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

DNA was immediately purified using Qiagen MinElute Kit (Qiagen). qPCR was used to determine the optimal cycle number for library amplification. The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform to obtain 2 × 100 paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)</title><p>ChIP was performed exactly as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, cells were cross-linked directly in 15 cm culture plates with 1% formaldehyde. After quenching with 0.125 M glycine, cells were washed in PBS and pelleted. After a three-step lysis, chromatin was sonicated with a Bioruptor (Diagenode) to reach a fragment size averaging 200 bp. Chromatin corresponding to 10 μg of DNA was incubated rotating overnight at 4°C with 3–5 μg of antibody. A fraction of chromatin extracts (5%) were taken aside for inputs. Antibody-bound chromatin was recovered using Protein G Agarose Columns (Active Motif). The antibody-chromatin mix was incubated on column for 4 hr, washed eight times with modified RIPA buffer and chromatin eluted with pre-warmed TE-SDS (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). ChIP-enriched and input samples were reverse cross-linked (65°C overnight) and treated with RNase A and proteinase K. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with glycogen in sodium acetate and ethanol and resuspended in tris-buffered water. Enrichment compared to input was analyzed by qPCR (Viia7 thermal cycling system, Applied Biosystems).

To avoid technical artifacts, crosslinking and library preparation were performed in parallel for each experiment. For each VP, approximately 1 µg of library material was amplified using 16 individual PCR reactions with inverse primers containing indexed Illumina TruSeq adapters (primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). PCR products were originally purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) to remove unincorporated primer, but we found that purification was more efficiently performed using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter).

Restriction fragments that did not contain a cutting site of the second restriction enzyme or are smaller than 20 bp were filtered out. Fragments 2.5 kb up- and downstream from the viewpoint were excluded during the procedure. Intrachromosomal contacts were kept. Valid fragments were quantified. The fragment counts were then normalized per one million reads.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael Buszczak as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity:; Alvaro Rada-Iglesias (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Recent studies have begun to reveal how specific transcription factors (TFs) serve to change the global chromatin landscape as naïve pluripotent embryonic stem cells transition to a primed pluripotent epiblast-like state. This study builds upon these findings and explores the cause and effect relationship between changes in 3D organization and changes in enhancer activity during this developmental transition. As a model, the authors focus on the regulation of the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus, which undergoes a switch from distal (<italic>pLiz</italic>) to proximal (<italic>pZdbf2</italic>) promoter usage, accompanied by a switch in polycomb to DNA methylation occupancy. The authors define a number of different enhancer elements (E1-4). E1-3 are active in ESCs, while E4 becomes active in EpiLCs. The authors use high resolution 4C to show enhancer-promoter dynamic interactions during the process of differentiation. They then delete specific enhancers to demonstrate their functional significance in regards to the regulation of chromatin marks throughout the region and the expression of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> itself. The authors provide evidence that <italic>Liz</italic> transcription and polycomb function play a minor role in the 3D architecture of the region during differentiation. They end by showing that a CTCF binding site acts to partition the Zbdf2 locus in ESCs. Interestingly, they show that in the absence of this partition, polycomb mediated silencing keeps <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression at relatively low levels. Removal of both the partition site and polycomb activity results in a dramatic increase of <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression in ESCs.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and robust data generally support the authors' conclusions. The paper will be of interest to the field and will significantly contribute to our understanding of how chromatin organization and architecture change during developmental transitions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The state of the cells being examined needs to be better defined. EpiLC differentiation, as originally described by the Saitou lab, typically takes 2-3 days and this recapitulates the postimplantation epiblast (E5.5-6). Some authors refer to this state as formative, rather than primed pluripotency, which in vitro might be best represented by EpiSCs. However, in the manuscript the authors use a 7 days EpiLC differentiation protocol. What kind of cells are the authors really obtaining after 7 days? Are they in fact in the process of adapting their ESC to EpiSC (not EpiLC) conditions? If the typical 2-3 day EpiLC differentiation protocol is considered, then some of the changes in <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression are not actually observed (E4 deletion or CTCF_PS deletion). Furthermore, it is also unclear whether a 7 day differentiation is always used when referring to EpiLC (e.g. H3K27ac ChIPs). If the authors want to use this 7 day EpiLC differentiation, they should better characterize or describe which cells they are truly working with.</p><p>2) The hierarchical activity of <italic>pLiz</italic> and <italic>pZdbf2</italic> needs to be examined in greater detail. There are concerns that clonal differences within the ES cell population could account for some of the described results. This point needs to be addressed in the text and by using another complementary experimental approach such as FISH.</p><p>In addition, there is the possibility that E1-3 and E4 enhancers are sequentially used and stage-specific, with E1-3 being important to initially activate the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> proximal promoter (and perhaps E4), while E4 might become dominant in controlling later <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression. The authors should conditionally delete or inactivate E1-3 (e.g. CRISPRi) during EpiLC differentiation to more conclusively support their model.</p><p>3) There are concerns that the <italic>Eed</italic> knockout could have secondary effects. The authors could use an EZH2 inhibitor to more acutely inhibit PRC2 function in their experiments. This would complement their current data and potentially avoid major confounding effects.</p><p>4) There are concerns about the authors' claims regarding the CTCF partition. Considering the possibility that loss of CTCF partitioning can lead to a loss of insulation, the authors should evaluate the expression of the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> flanking genes upon deletion of the CTCF PS site in both ESCs and EpiLCs.</p><p>In addition, using an alternative experimental approach such as FISH (see point 2 above) to evaluate their various deletion cells would help support their model.</p><p>Without CTCF knockout, the authors should temper their language regarding whether CTCF itself is needed for the partition. Alternatively, they could attempt to conditionally knockdown CTCF. This was recently done in ESCs using an AID degree system (Nora et al., 2017) and the authors could perhaps request those cells to save time.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dynamic enhancer partitioning instructs activation of a growth-related gene during exit from naïve pluripotency&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

If the authors want to use this 7 day EpiLC differentiation, they should better characterize or describe which cells they are truly working with.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this issue, as it is an important point that we did not adequately address in the original manuscript. For the purpose of this study, we wanted to emphasize the promoter switch that occurs at the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> gene. However, in our EpiLC differentiation protocol, the promoter switch does not occur until roughly day 4, and <italic>Liz</italic> is not fully shut down (at the population level) until day 7, which we published in Greenberg et al., 2017. Hence, it was important we used these timepoints in our study. We now justify our strategy in the text, subsection “Two Classes of Putative Enhancers Lie in the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> Locus”, and have added a new panel to that depicts expression dynamics (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, we clarify throughout the manuscript the day of differentiation for each experiment. We also provide below some RNA-seq analyses that we are not including in the manuscript, but may help answer the reviewer’s question of what cells these are. We performed hierarchical clustering of our ESCs and EpiLCs at various timepoints (in bold italics) with recently published ESC, D2 EpiLC and (in vitro) EpiSC RNA-seq data (Bao et al., 2018) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Indeed, our D4 and D7 EpiLCs cluster more closely with EpiSCs. Moreover, the primed pluripotency markers Foxa2 and T (Brachyury) are expressed at D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). This is also consistent with our in vivo data demonstrating that <italic>Zdbf2</italic> does not activate until E6.5 (Duffié et al., 2014). But without more thorough characterization, we feel it is more prudent continue referring to the cells as D7 EpiLCs.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44057-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The hierarchical activity of pLiz and pZdbf2 needs to be examined in greater detail. There are concerns that clonal differences within the ES cell population could account for some of the described results. This point needs to be addressed in the text and by using another complementary experimental approach such as FISH.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that clonal variation can lead to misleading interpretations. That said, we are confident in the results presented here, bolstered by some of the experiments performed for this revised version. The enhancer deletion effects are strong on the expression of the genes—in addition to being coherent with the 4C-seq results—that it is highly likely these are regulatory elements. Moreover, experiments in polycomb mutants have been performed in multiple PRC2 genes (Ezh2 in Duffie et al., 2014, <italic>Eed</italic> in Greenberg et al., 2017 and here), as well as in different CRISPR clones for the <italic>Eed</italic> mutation (data not presented). Finally, we used a PRC2 inhibitor as suggested (described in detail below), which was wholly in line with our genetic mutant cell line. The subtlest result was the deletion of the CTCF-binding site. For this revision, we also used the CTCF-degron line, which also points to CTCF-based regulation of <italic>Liz/Zdbf2</italic> (See below).</p><p>With regards to performing DNA FISH, this is an experiment we would be eager to perform in principle. However, the locus is quite compact—the distal enhancers (E1-3) and proximal promoter are only separated by about 60kb of genomic space. A DNA FISH experiment would mean implementing a high-resolution microscopy technique that we are not equipped to perform at this moment. We hope the reviewers understand and accept our rationale. Relatedly, we would also like to note that RNA FISH does not allow us to distinguish the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> transcript from the <italic>Liz</italic> transcript, however in our previous publication (Greenberg et al., 2017), we performed single-cell RT-qPCR, which showed that <italic>Liz</italic> and <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter activity is mutually exclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, there is the possibility that E1-3 and E4 enhancers are sequentially used and stage-specific, with E1-3 being important to initially activate the Zdbf2 proximal promoter (and perhaps E4), while E4 might become dominant in controlling later Zdbf2 expression. The authors should conditionally delete or inactivate E1-3 (e.g. CRISPRi) during EpiLC differentiation to more conclusively support their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thought this was an absolutely excellent comment, and we were eager to carry out the experiment. We opted for the CRISPRi technique, and designed the experiment thusly: we utilized a doxycycline (dox) inducible Tet-on promoter driving expression of a dCas9-KRAB chimeric construct. We targeted the construct to the ROSA26 locus to ensure proper induction. In parallel we designed a single plasmid containing sgRNAs targeted to E1, E2, and E3 (i.e., three sgRNAs total, each with their own U6 promoter and terminator). Once the dCas9-KRAB line established, we stably transfected the sgRNA plasmid under blasticidin selection. The idea was that we could induce KRAB-mediated silencing of E1-3 at different points during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), and therefore determine the sequence of events that leads to <italic>Zdbf2</italic> activation. For example, as the reviewers suggested, perhaps we could resolve whether E1-3 are required for maintaining <italic>Zdbf2</italic> expression after the initial activation event. We were able to induce dCas9-KRAB at both the protein and RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B,C</xref>). Unfortunately, in ESCs we did not observe any reduction of the <italic>Liz</italic> transcript upon dCas9-KRAB induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2D</xref>). This could be due to technical reasons: we did not have time to vet different sgRNAs in the interest of time. Therefore, we simply designed sgRNAs with low off-target scores as close as we could to the center of each enhancer region. However, it is possible that one or more of the sgRNAs did not properly lead to enhancer silencing, and thus <italic>Liz</italic> transcription was unperturbed. We also performed the experiment on a bulk population of sgRNA stable-transfectants. It is possible that clonal sub-populations exhibit silencing, but are in the minority, and the effect was masked. Once again, we were not able to screen clones due to time constraints. Regardless, given the lack of impact on <italic>Liz</italic> in ESCs, we did not feel comfortable carrying out the differentiation experiment without further optimization. In sum, we are quite disappointed we were not able to produce the result for the revision, but we hope the reviewers are sympathetic to the fact that without several more weeks, if not months, of testing we will likely not be able to carry out this particular experiment. As such, we hope the current results using the deletion mutants will be sufficiently convincing to show the hierarchy of events during differentiation.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44057-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are concerns that the Eed knockout could have secondary effects. The authors could use an EZH2 inhibitor to more acutely inhibit PRC2 function in their experiments. This would complement their current data and potentially avoid major confounding effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we agree with the reviewers that there is always a concern with secondary effects in constitutive mutants, especially after prolonged time in culture. Therefore, as suggested, we incubated both our WT and ∆CTCF_PS ESCs in presence of a potent EZH2 inhibitor (UNC 1999, https://www.tocris.com/products/unc-1999_4904) and a negative control compound (UNC 2400, https://www.tocris.com/products/unc-2400_4905). After 4 days, H3K27me3 was undetectable by western blot, as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3D, whereas there was a strong signal in the negative control. RT-qPCR from these cells confirmed our results from the <italic>Eed</italic> mutant cell line, and we have added a panel to Figure 4—figure supplement 3E. This strongly confirms our previous result, and bolsters our interpretation that both polycomb and 3D organization instruct <italic>Zdbf2</italic> activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are concerns about the authors' claims regarding the CTCF partition. Considering the possibility that loss of CTCF partitioning can lead to a loss of insulation, the authors should evaluate the expression of the Zdbf2 flanking genes upon deletion of the CTCF PS site in both ESCs and EpiLCs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and we thank the reviewer’s for raising it. We now have included RT-qPCR graphs for <italic>Eef1b2</italic> and <italic>Ndufs1</italic>, which are immediately upstream of <italic>Liz; Gpr1</italic>, which overlaps <italic>Liz</italic>; and <italic>Adam23</italic>, which is immediately downstream of <italic>Liz/Zdbf2</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). There is no significant change in expression for any of these genes during EpiLC differentiation when the CTCF_PS is deleted. Our interpretation of this result is that <italic>Eef1b2</italic> and Ndufs1 remain insulated from the <italic>Zdbf2</italic> locus because of CTCF bound in between <italic>Eed1b2</italic> and <italic>Gpr1</italic> (shown in Figure 4), which does not deplete during differentiation. Our 4C and available HiC data suggest that <italic>Adam23</italic> also exists within its own interacting domain separated from <italic>Zdbf2</italic> possibly because of CTCF-mediated insulation between <italic>Zdbf2</italic> and <italic>Adam23</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This result indicates that the CTCF at the partition site plays no role in this insulation. Finally, we have long had interest in <italic>Gpr1</italic>’s possible role in this locus, but we never have observed any major impact on <italic>Gpr1</italic> expression in any of our cis or trans mutations in the ESC-EpiLC system. This experiment is consistent with prior results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, using an alternative experimental approach such as FISH (see point 2 above) to evaluate their various deletion cells would help support their model.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree, this experiment was too technically challenging to undertake for the purpose of this revision (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without CTCF knockout, the authors should temper their language regarding whether CTCF itself is needed for the partition. Alternatively, they could attempt to conditionally knockdown CTCF. This was recently done in ESCs using an AID degree system (Nora et al., 2017) and the authors could perhaps request those cells to save time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the reviewers’ advice, and moderated our language on the role of CTCF, per se, in the manuscript. Additionally, as suggested, we utilized the CTCF Degron line described in Nora et al. We converted the cells to 2i+vitC (12 days), and then incubated with or without auxin for two days as described in Nora et al. The results are indeed intriguing, and are now incorporated in Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,E. In short, even in the untreated Tir, CTCF-AID line, <italic>Liz</italic> expression is decreased compared to the wild-type control. Our interpretation is that CTCF levels are already lower in the untreated cell line due CTCF protein instability (as previously reported, and confirmed here by western blot). Adding auxin on results in a marginal, statistically insignificant further decrease in expression. Perhaps as even in the untreated cells, lower CTCF levels create a landscape where <italic>Liz</italic> expression is decreased due to decreased enhancer-promoter contacts, and this has reached a minimal threshold. Incidentally, we also observed de-repression of the proximal, <italic>Zdbf2</italic> promoter in both untreated and especially auxin-treated cells. As opposed to our ∆CTCF_PS deletion line where we did not observe a significant effect on <italic>Zdbf2</italic>, globally depleting CTCF apparently leads to upregulation. Whether this is somehow due to direct recruitment of polycomb via CTCF or indirect regulation is a worthwhile avenue of investigation for a future study. As the latter result was somewhat difficult to interpret without further experimental interrogation, we opted to withhold this information in this version of the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we also performed EpiLC differentiation in the absence of CTCF, but we observed so much cell death compared to control cells, we chose not to include those results as we found the data difficult to interpret due to potentially confounding effects.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers appreciate that you addressed most of concerns raised during the first round of the review.
