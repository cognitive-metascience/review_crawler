that pathogenic protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases spread from cell to cell through the brain in a manner akin to infectious prions. Here, we show that mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates associated with Huntington disease transfer anterogradely from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system. Trans-synaptic transmission of mHtt aggregates is inversely correlated with neuronal activity and blocked by inhibiting caspases in presynaptic neurons, implicating synaptic dysfunction and cell death in aggregate spreading. Remarkably, mHtt aggregate transmission across synapses requires the glial scavenger receptor Draper and involves a transient visit to the glial cytoplasm, indicating that phagocytic glia act as obligatory intermediates in aggregate spreading between synaptically-connected neurons. These findings expand our understanding of phagocytic glia as double-edged players in neurodegeneration—by clearing neurotoxic protein aggregates, but also providing an opportunity for prion-like seeds to evade phagolysosomal degradation and propagate further in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>huntingtin</kwd><kwd>prion-like</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>phagocytic glia</kwd><kwd>Draper</kwd><kwd>protein aggregate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000945</institution-id><institution>Pittsburgh Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Integrated Research &amp; Education Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panning Pearce</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001340</institution-id><institution>W.

A common molecular feature of many neurodegenerative diseases [e.g., Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementias (FTD), Parkinson disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington disease (HD)] is the misfolding of certain proteins, driving their accumulation into insoluble, amyloid aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>). Appearance of proteinaceous deposits in patient brains correlates closely with neuronal loss and clinical progression, and strategies to lower production or enhance clearance of pathological proteins in the degenerating brain have shown therapeutic promise in animal models and clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tabrizi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Post-mortem histopathological analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braak and Braak, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brettschneider et al., 2013</xref>) and in vivo imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poudel et al., 2019</xref>) indicate that proteopathic lesions associated with neurodegeneration appear in highly-reproducible and disease-specific spatiotemporal patterns through the brain. Interestingly, these patterns largely follow neuroanatomical tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mezias et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a central role for synaptic connectivity in pathological aggregate spreading. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that intracellular aggregates formed by tau, α-synuclein, TDP-43, SOD1, and mutant huntingtin (mHtt) transfer from cell to cell and self-replicate by recruiting natively-folded versions of the same protein, analogous to how infectious prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) templates the conformational change of soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> in prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vaquer-Alicea and Diamond, 2019</xref>). Numerous studies have pointed to roles for endocytosis and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock and Ganetzky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeineddine et al., 2015</xref>), membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falcon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flavin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeineddine et al., 2015</xref>), tunneling nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharma and Subramaniam, 2019</xref>), and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) in entry and/or exit of pathogenic protein assemblies from cells, but the exact mechanisms by which amyloid aggregates or on-pathway intermediates cross one or more biological membranes in the highly complex central nervous system (CNS) remain an enigma.</p><p>Glia are resident immune cells of the CNS and constantly survey the brain to maintain homeostasis and respond rapidly to tissue damage or trauma. Reactive astrocytes and microglia provide a first line of defense in neurodegeneration by infiltrating sites of neuronal injury, upregulating immune-responsive genes, and phagocytosing dying neurons and other debris, including protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grathwohl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wyss-Coray et al., 2003</xref>). Prolonged activation of these glial responses results in chronic inflammation, exacerbating synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>). We and others have previously shown that Draper, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> scavenger receptor that recognizes and phagocytoses cellular debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freeman, 2015</xref>), regulates the load of mHtt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>) and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ray et al., 2017</xref>) aggregate pathology in the fly CNS. Remarkably, we also found that a portion of phagocytosed neuronal mHtt aggregates gain entry into the glial cytoplasm and once there, nucleate the aggregation of normally-soluble wild-type Htt (wtHtt) proteins, suggesting that glial phagocytosis provides a path for spreading of prion-like aggregates in intact brains. Consistent with these findings, microglial ablation suppresses pathological tau transmission between synaptically-connected regions of the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2015</xref>), and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> transfers from infected astrocytes to co-cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Victoria et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, phagocytic glia may play double-edged roles in neurodegeneration, with normally neuroprotective clearance mechanisms also driving dissemination of prion-like aggregates through the brain.</p><p>A plethora of studies from the last decade have strengthened the prion-like hypothesis for neurodegenerative diseases, but we still lack a clear understanding of how pathogenic protein aggregates spread between cells in an intact CNS. In this study, we adapted our previously-described <italic>Drosophila</italic> HD model to investigate roles for synaptic connectivity and phagocytic glia in prion-like mHtt aggregate transmission in adult fly brains. HD is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat region in exon 1 of the Htt gene, resulting in production of highly aggregation-prone mHtt proteins containing abnormally expanded polyglutamine (polyQ≥37) tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">MacDonald et al., 1993</xref>). By contrast, wtHtt proteins containing polyQ≤36 tracts only aggregate upon nucleation by pre-formed Htt aggregate ‘seeds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Preisinger et al., 1999</xref>). A growing body of evidence from cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharma and Subramaniam, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Trevino et al., 2012</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ast et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock and Ganetzky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Masnata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</xref>) models of HD supports the idea that pathogenic mHtt aggregates have prion-like properties—they transfer from cell to cell and self-replicate by nucleating the aggregation of soluble wtHtt proteins. Here, we report that mHtt aggregates formed in presynaptic olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons effect prion-like conversion of wtHtt proteins expressed in the cytoplasm of postsynaptic partner projection neurons (PNs) in the adult fly olfactory system. Remarkably, transfer of mHtt aggregates from presynaptic ORNs to postsynaptic PNs was abolished in Draper-deficient animals and required passage of the prion-like aggregate seeds through the cytoplasm of phagocytic glial cells. Together, these findings support the conclusion that phagocytic glia are obligatory intermediates in prion-like transmission of mHtt aggregates between synaptically-connected neurons in vivo, providing new insight into key roles for glia in HD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prion-like transfer of mHtt aggregates between synaptically-connected neurons in the adult fly olfactory system</title><p>Aggregates formed by N-terminal fragments of mHtt generated by aberrant splicing (e.g., exon 1; ‘Htt<sub>ex1</sub>’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sathasivam et al., 2013</xref>) or caspase cleavage (e.g., exon 1–12; ‘Htt<sub>ex1-12</sub>’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) accumulate in HD patient brains, are highly cytotoxic, and spread between cells in culture and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock and Ganetzky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ren et al., 2009</xref>). We have previously established transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> that employ binary expression systems [e.g., Gal4-UAS, QF-QUAS, or LexA-LexAop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riabinina and Potter, 2016</xref>)] to express fluorescent protein (FP) fusions of Htt<sub>ex1</sub> in non-overlapping cell populations to monitor cell-to-cell transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates in intact brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donnelly and Pearce, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>). Our experimental approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) exploits the previously-reported finding that wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> proteins aggregate upon physically encountering mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Preisinger et al., 1999</xref>), such that transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates from ‘donor’ cells is reported by conversion of cytoplasmic wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> from its normally soluble, diffuse state to a punctate, aggregated state in ‘acceptor’ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>-inset). To confirm that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> nucleates the aggregation of wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> in fly neurons, we co-expressed FP-fusions of these two proteins using pan-neuronal <italic>elav[C155]-Gal4</italic>. In flies expressing only mCherry-tagged mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> (Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry) pan-neuronally, aggregates were visible as discrete mCherry+ puncta throughout adult fly brains, with enrichment in neuropil regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, GFP-tagged wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> (Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP) was expressed diffusely in the same regions of age-matched adult brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upon co-expression with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry, Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP was converted to a punctate expression pattern that almost entirely overlapped with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>), whereas expression patterns of neither membrane-targeted GFP (mCD8-GFP) nor soluble GFP lacking a polyQ sequence were affected by the presence of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry aggregates in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Thus, in the fly CNS, Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates induce prion-like conversion of normally-soluble Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 via a homotypic nucleation reaction that requires the Htt<sub>ex1</sub> sequence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> or mHtt<sub>ex1-12</sub> aggregates formed in presynaptic ORNs induce the aggregation of wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> expressed in postsynaptic PNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary structure of full-length human Htt (3144 amino acids), including HEAT repeats (HR, <italic>gray regions</italic>) and the N-terminal variable-length polyQ region (<italic>green/red box</italic>), with the pathogenic threshold (~Q37) indicated by a white dotted line.

Because these puncta could be difficult to distinguish from surrounding non-aggregated Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP signal, and GFP+ puncta representing normal dendritic architecture and/or intracellular vesicles in the secretory pathway were visible in GH146+ PNs expressing mCD8-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), we defined Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates as GFP+ puncta that colocalized with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A1 and C1-7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

When aggregate volumes were analyzed across all time points, it became apparent that seeding-competent Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 or Htt<sub>ex1-12</sub>Q138 aggregates clustered in a subpopulation whose mean was significantly smaller than the mean volume for all Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 or Htt<sub>ex1-12</sub>Q138 aggregates (mean Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregate volume = 1.845 ± 0.068 μm<sup>3</sup>, mean Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregate volume = 2.19 ± 0.024 μm<sup>3</sup>, p=0.0005; mean Htt<sub>ex1-12</sub>Q138+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregate volume = 1.293 ± 0.071 μm<sup>3</sup>, mean Htt<sub>ex1-12</sub>Q138 aggregate volume = 2.40 ± 0.048 μm<sup>3</sup>, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).

Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> or mHtt<sub>ex1-12</sub> aggregates formed in presynaptic ORNs effect prion-like conversion of wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> in the cytoplasm of postsynaptic PNs, and that mHtt aggregate transmissibility in the fly CNS is correlated with smaller aggregate size.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transfer is enhanced across silenced DA1 ORN-PN synapses</title><p>Endocytosis, exocytosis, and neuronal activity have been previously implicated in neuron-to-neuron spreading of mHtt and other pathogenic aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock and Ganetzky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), but it is not known how these processes contribute to aggregate transfer across endogenous synapses in vivo. To examine a role for synaptic activity in DA1 ORN-to-PN transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates, we used well-established fly genetic tools that block fission or fusion of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic membrane to impair neurotransmission. First, we used <italic>shibire<sup>ts1</sup></italic> (<italic>shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983</xref>), a temperature-sensitive mutant of the GTPase Shibire/dynamin that blocks endocytic recycling of synaptic vesicles in flies raised at the restrictive temperature. Co-expression of shi<sup>ts1</sup> with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry in DA1 ORNs in flies shifted from the permissive temperature (18°C) to the restrictive temperature (31°C) in adulthood had no effect or slightly decreased numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates in the DA1 glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>), but, surprisingly, strongly enhanced formation of seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in DA1 PN dendrites compared with control flies expressing LacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B and D</xref>). Likewise, co-expression of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry with tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC), which inhibits SNARE-mediated fusion of synaptic vesicles with presynaptic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>), strongly increased numbers of seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in the DA1 glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F and H</xref>). At some time points, TeTxLC co-expression led to increased numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>); however, there appeared to be no correlation between numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 and Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in the DA1 glomerulus over time, so the increased numbers of seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates were unlikely to be simply due to abundance of presynaptic Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 seeds. To manipulate neuronal activity by an alternative approach, we co-expressed the heat-activated <italic>Drosophila</italic> transient-receptor potential A (dTrpA) channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry to thermogenetically stimulate DA1 ORNs. In adult flies shifted from ~21°C to 31°C upon eclosion, dTrpA-mediated activation of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry-expressing DA1 ORNs slightly increased Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregate numbers, but decreased formation of seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in the DA1 glomerulus compared with control flies expressing LacZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>). Together, these results indicate that prion-like transmission of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates from ORNs to PNs is inversely correlated with presynaptic ORN activity. These findings suggest that aggregate transfer could be enhanced across dysfunctional synapses, which are an early pathological finding in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transfer from ORNs to synaptically-connected PNs is inversely correlated with presynaptic activity.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, E, F, I, and J</bold>) Confocal z-stacks of DA1 glomeruli from 10 day-old males (<bold>A-B, and E-F</bold>) or 7 day-old females (<bold>I-J</bold>) co-expressing Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry with either LacZ (<bold>A, E, and I</bold>), shi<sup>ts1</sup> (<bold>B</bold>), TeTxLC (<bold>F</bold>), or dTrpA (<bold>J</bold>) in DA1 ORNs and Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP in GH146+ PNs.

This discrepancy could be due to construct- or cell type-specific effects or possibly different mechanisms regulating synaptic or non-synaptic aggregate transmission in the brain. Thus, we wondered whether blocking Shibire-mediated endocytosis in ORNs might create a more favorable environment for aggregate transfer across endogenous synapses in our HD model. To test this, we first quantified Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry-expressing DA1 ORN axonal surfaces using mCD8-GFP, a tool widely used to label neuronal cell bodies and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mosca and Luo, 2014</xref>) and to quantify neuron or neurite abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>) in fly brains.

This effect appeared to be specific since Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregate abundance in DA1 ORNs was not increased by shi<sup>ts</sup> co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and may reflect a homeostatic compensatory response to endocytic blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dickman et al., 2006</xref>) that could create additional exit sites for Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inhibiting Shibire-mediated endocytosis increases mHtt<sub>ex1</sub>-expressing ORN axon volume and enhances transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates from DA1 ORN axons to glia.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Confocal z-stacks of DA1 glomeruli from 10 day-old females co-expressing Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry, mCD8-GFP, and either LacZ (<bold>A</bold>) or shi<sup>ts1</sup> (<bold>B</bold>) in DA1 ORNs.

Our prior work showed that ORN-to-glia transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates is strictly dependent on Draper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>), a scavenger receptor responsible for phagocytic engulfment and clearance of neuronal debris in the fly CNS and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Etchegaray et al., 2016</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hoopfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether Draper-expressing phagocytic glia might play a role in transferring mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates from ORNs to PNs. To test this, we quantified numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 and seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in DA1 ORN axons and PN dendrites, respectively, in animals heterozygous or homozygous for the <italic>draper(drpr)<sup>Δ5</sup></italic> null mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freeman et al., 2003</xref>). We previously reported that <italic>drpr</italic> knockout (KO) increased steady-state numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates in DA1 ORN axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>); however, this effect was not found to be statistically significant between <italic>drpr<sup>Δ5</sup></italic> heterozygotes and homozygotes in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). We suspect this is for two reasons: (a) our image segmentation parameters improved identification of very small aggregates, which we show are more abundant when <italic>drpr</italic> is expressed at normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>), and (b) the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry transgene used here expressed at lower levels than the transgene used in our previous study. Thus, Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates initially form more slowly in DA1 ORN axons (compare numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates in young females in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> vs Figure 7I; the latter experiment used the same higher-expressing Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry transgene as in our prior study) and may be less affected by Draper depletion. Strikingly though, <italic>drpr</italic> KO completely blocked formation of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in postsynaptic PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B and D</xref>), suggesting that Draper mediates trans-synaptic transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates. This surprising effect of <italic>drpr</italic> KO on seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregate formation was also observed when shi<sup>ts1</sup> was co-expressed with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry in ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that enhanced transfer of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates from shi<sup>ts1</sup>-expressing ORNs occurs via the same Draper-dependent mechanism.

We found that immunolabeled aggregate subtypes were not amenable to volumetric segmentation, and so we instead manually quantified single-, double-, and triple-labeled Htt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates in confocal slices and used line scan intensity profiling to confirm colocalization. Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry expression in DA1 ORNs was partially diffuse and partially punctate in young (0–1 day-old) adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D,E and I</xref>), but became more punctate as the flies aged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,F,G and I</xref>). mCherry+/3xHA+ puncta representing Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates that transferred from ORNs to glia first appeared in 2 day-old adults and increased in number over the next ~24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F and J</xref>, <italic>blue bars</italic>).

The timing of appearance of these different aggregate subtypes supports our hypothesis that Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 seeds originating in DA1 ORN axons transit through the glial cytoplasm before reaching the cytoplasm of DA1 PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>route 1</italic>). mCherry+/YFP+ puncta representing aggregates that had transferred from DA1 ORNs to DA1 PNs without accessing the glial cytoplasm were not detected in these brains, arguing against direct transfer of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry aggregates from ORNs to PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <italic>route 2</italic>). Control animals expressing Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 proteins in paired combinations of ORNs, glia, or PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) confirmed that Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in glia or PNs were only detected when Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 was expressed in ORNs.

These data confirm that glial Draper mediates Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregate transmission from ORN axons to glia and across ORN-PN synapses. Taken together, these findings suggest that phagocytic glia act as obligatory intermediates in unidirectional prion-like spreading of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates from presynaptic ORNs to postsynaptic PNs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The hypothesis that prion-like spreading contributes to progression of protein aggregate pathology in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases is gaining considerable support, and yet we still understand very little about the mechanisms that underlie cell-to-cell spreading in vivo, the influences of cell- and tissue-specific vulnerability, and the relevance of aggregate transmission to disease progression. In this study, we report that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates transfer anterogradely from presynaptic ORNs to postsynaptic PNs via an obligatory path through phagocytic glia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains. ORN-to-PN transmission of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates was enhanced by blocking endocytosis and exocytosis and slowed by thermogenetically stimulating presynaptic ORNs, suggesting an inverse relationship between presynaptic activity and mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate spreading. mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transfer across synapses was inhibited by blocking apoptosis in presynaptic neurons and required the Draper scavenger receptor, which we have previously reported to mediate phagocytic engulfment of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates from ORN axons and prion-like conversion of wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> in the glial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we expand our understanding of the role that glia play in prion-like diseases by showing that phagocytosed neuronal mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates transit through the cytoplasm of glia before reaching postsynaptic PNs. To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first to uncover a role for a well-conserved phagocytic pathway in prion-like spreading of pathogenic aggregates between neurons in vivo.</p><p>The increased propensity of mHtt to aggregate as a result of polyQ expansion is held in check by the proteostasis network, and intrinsic differences in proteostatic capacity of neuronal subpopulations could underlie regional selectivity to inclusion body formation in HD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Margulis and Finkbeiner, 2014</xref>). However, accumulating evidence that mHtt aggregates have prion-like properties suggests that aggregate spreading could also contribute to HD pathogenesis by propagating mHtt pathology through networks of synaptically-connected but selectively-vulnerable neurons. We find that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transmission across ORN-PN synapses occurs selectively in the anterograde direction and is inversely correlated with synaptic activity. Some of the earliest changes seen in HD patient brains involve loss of presynaptic cortical inputs to the striatum, where more prominent pathological findings (e.g., mHtt aggregate accumulation and massive loss of medium spiny neurons) appear in later stages of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reiner and Deng, 2018</xref>). In addition, selective silencing of mHtt in both the cortex and striatum of BACHD mice inhibited striatal degeneration and motor phenotypes to a greater extent that silencing in just the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that mHtt-induced toxicity in presynaptic cortical regions could play an important role in early HD development. Thus, presynaptic dysfunction may be a driving force for mHtt aggregate spreading between synaptically-connected regions of the brain. While our findings do not directly address secondary consequences of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate spreading across synapses, we identify a novel mechanism whereby glial responses to pathological changes in synapses mediate spreading of toxic aggregates between neurons. How aggregate spreading via glia impacts neuronal viability and functioning at the synaptic and/or circuit level are important questions for future studies.</p><p>Glia survey the brain to maintain homeostasis and can rapidly switch between supportive and reactive states in response to perturbations in CNS microenvironments. Upon sensing neuronal insult or injury, reactive microglia and astrocytes undergo dramatic morphological, metabolic, and transcriptional changes and promote neuronal survival by releasing trophic factors and phagocytosing debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>). Central roles for phagocytic glia in neurodegeneration are becoming increasingly recognized as genome-wide association studies and transcriptomic analyses identify glial genes associated with increased disease risk. For example, rare variants in the microglial phagocytic receptor gene <italic>TREM2</italic> are associated with increased risk of AD, FTD, and PD, and loss of TREM2 function exacerbates Aβ-, tau-, and α-synuclein-associated neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Griciuc et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leyns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).

However, chronically-active or otherwise dysfunctional glia induce neuroinflammation and exacerbate neuronal damage. For example, hyperactivate microglia excessively engulf synapses in pre-plaque AD mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hong et al., 2016</xref>) and signal for formation of neurotoxic A1 astrocytes, which accumulate in several neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yun et al., 2018</xref>) and during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings thus add new insights to recognizing glia as double-edged players in neurodegeneration and suggest that rebalancing the protective and harmful effects of glial phagocytosis could be an effective new therapeutic strategy.</p><p>We provide several lines of evidence to support a model in which glia engulf mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates, or perhaps portions of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate-containing axons, from ORNs without internalizing elements of PNs: (i) mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transmission occurred exclusively in the anterograde direction across ORN-PN synapses, (ii) neuronal mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates did not colocalize with markers of lysosomes or autophagosomes in glia, and (iii) caspase inhibition in ORNs and not in PNs inhibited aggregate transfer. Our data suggest that glia selectively target presynaptic ORNs by recognizing apoptotic ‘eat me’ signals induced by mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate accumulation, and this process drives aggregate transfer to postsynaptic PNs. In developing mouse brains, pruned presynaptic structures are engulfed by microglia largely in the absence of postsynaptic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinhard et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that mammalian glia have the ability to selectively ‘nibble’ presynaptic components (a fine-tuned phagocytic process known as trogocytosis). In addition, astrocytes internalize dystrophic presynaptic terminals that accumulate near amyloid plaques in transgenic mouse and human AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez-Arboledas et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, astrocytes expressing the mammalian Draper homolog MEGF10 and complement-dependent microglia preferentially engulf ‘weaker’ synapses to refine neural circuits in developing and adult mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>), and aberrant activation of these pathways could contribute to early synaptic loss in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). We find that cell-to-cell mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transfer is accelerated from silenced ORN axons, suggesting that activity-impaired synapses are engulfed by nearby glia, enhancing spread along the ORN-to-glia-to-PN track. Thus, while the primary objective of phagocytic glia may be to eliminate toxic neuronal debris from the CNS, aberrant and/or excessive activation of phagocytic pathways could paradoxically promote disease. Premature elimination of live synapses could also drive network dysfunction, suggesting that attenuating glial responses could be an effective early intervention to preserve neurological functions in neurodegenerative disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpanini et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The most exciting yet unexpected finding we report here is that prion-like mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates do not directly transfer from ORNs to PNs, but instead make an obligatory detour through the phagocytic glial cytoplasm. This circuitous route could explain why relatively small numbers of seeded wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates form in glia or PNs, since seeding-competent mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> must escape from multiple degradative systems and from the membrane-bound phagolysosomal compartment in order to access cytoplasmic wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub>. Though transfer through glia is compulsory across ORN-PN synapses, our data cannot exclude the possibility that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates transfer directly between neurons in other regions of the brain or at later stages of disease, when neuron-glia communication and cell integrity could be severely compromised. Our findings suggest that phagocytic glia drive aggregate transfer across ORN-PN synapses by altering the transmissibility of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates formed in presynaptic ORN axons. We previously proposed that Draper-dependent phagocytosis could provide a temporary conduit for engulfed mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates to escape into the glial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>). This idea is supported by work from others showing that α-synuclein, tau, and mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates rupture cell surface or endolysosomal membranes to access the cytoplasmic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Falcon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flavin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeineddine et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that Draper-dependent phagocytosis could modify mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates to increase their capacity to cross biological membranes, for example by altering molecular features such as rigidity, frangibility, or size. Indeed, we report here that seeding-competent mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates belong to a smaller-sized aggregate subpopulation whose abundance is regulated by Draper, and other groups have observed that the seeding propensity of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ast et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2001</xref>) or tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) aggregates is strongly associated with smaller size. This raises the intriguing possibility that membrane fission or fusion events that occur during dynamin-mediated engulfment or phagosome maturation could directly fragment or allow for escape of partially-digested neuronal mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates that fall below an upper size limit for entry into the cytoplasm. Indeed, aggregate fragmentation and secondary nucleation events are thought to be key components of prion-like propagation in many neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An outstanding question raised by our study is how ORN-derived mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates physically transfer from glia to PN cytoplasms. This could be accomplished by a number of mechanisms already proposed for cell-to-cell spreading of prion-like aggregates, such as transport through extracellular vesicles or tunneling nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costanzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sharma and Subramaniam, 2019</xref>), endocytosis/exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock and Ganetzky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeineddine et al., 2015</xref>), secretion or passive release of aggregates from dying cells, and direct penetration of lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brundin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vaquer-Alicea and Diamond, 2019</xref>). In a mouse model of tauopathy, pathological tau is transported between anatomically-connected regions of the brain via exosomes secreted by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that phagocytosed neuronal aggregates may never encounter the extracellular space during transfer. It is also possible that dysfunction caused by continuous aggregate internalization, genetic mutations, and/or normal aging could decrease the efficiency by which glia clear aggregates, promoting their spread. In support of this, extracellular Aβ or α-synuclein fibrils accumulate inside microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frackowiak et al., 1992</xref>), and the ability of microglia to effectively degrade phagocytosed material declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bliederhaeuser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tremblay et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore favor a mechanism whereby phagocytosed aggregates resistant to degradation overwhelm the glial phagolysosomal system and promote aggregate release, either through active secretion (e.g., in an act of self-preservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron et al., 2017</xref>]) or during glial cell death. While we did not observe mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate transmission to non-partner PNs in flies up to 3 weeks old, suggesting that aggregate transfer at these ages is restricted to synaptic regions ensheathed by only 1–2 glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">MacDonald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), important remaining questions are whether aggregates that have invaded the glial cytoplasm can transfer to other cells in or near the DA1 glomerulus (e.g., other glia or local interneurons) or to downstream neurons in the olfactory circuit.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that phagocytic glia are active participants in the spread of prion-like protein aggregates between synaptically-connected neurons in vivo. Since microglial processes are highly motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2018</xref>), these findings raise the intriguing possibility that phagocytic glia could mediate not only trans-synaptic, but also long-range spreading of neuronal aggregate pathology in the mammalian CNS. Our findings have important implications for understanding complex relationships between aggregate-induced cytotoxicity and neuron-glia communication in health and disease. Deciphering the mechanisms that regulate helpful vs harmful effects of phagocytic glia in the brain will help to reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting key glial functions in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>All fly stocks and crosses were raised on standard cornmeal/molasses media at 25°C, ~50% relative humidity, and on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, unless otherwise noted.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript provides interesting evidence for glial transfer of pathogenic Htt to seed non-pathogenic Htt aggregation as a prion-like mechanism. The authors' main conclusion, that glia and the Draper pathway mediate the prion-like transmission of protein aggregates across neuronal synapses, could help further our understanding of the molecular events responsible for aggregate development, a major pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Phagocytic glia are obligatory intermediates in transmission of mutant huntingtin aggregates across neuronal synapses&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, Hugo Bellen. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. If you are willing and able to address the comments, we would be willing to reconsider an improved version but with no guarantee that it would be judged acceptable for publication.</p><p>A) The major concerns shared by the three reviewers are the quality/validity of your images especially those with the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP positive puncta in PNs. You need to address these questions by providing a detail description, quantification criteria and probably re-do some of the images and/or quantification.<italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1).… clearly far fewer Htt polyQ aggregates are forming in the postsynaptic cell than in the presynaptic cell (where polyQ Htt is expressed). Likewise, I have no idea how to interpret the primary readout of the assays – from 4-12 HttWT-GFP puncta forming in the PNs of interest. How many PN neurons are actually being assayed in a single glomerus? It seems like a very small effect to be honest…</p><p>2) Why is there so little overlap between green Q25and red Q91 Htt puncta in many of the figures? I'm surprised that so much aggregation of HttQ25 is occurring with only a tiny bit of the HttQ91 as a seed. What about the somal Q25 aggregates that don't appear to have any Q91? The authors mention some model of splitting, but I don't quite understand how this could occur.<italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>2) The robustness of the readout, especially on converted wt Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates. In this study, the definition on aggregates is primarily based on fluorescent imaging. Compared to the rather easily recognizable mHtt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q91 aggregates, the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates are often less clear and hard to distinguish from background. For example, the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates in Figure 1H, 2D, 5A and 7C (Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-YFP panels). In these images, many uneven GFP signals are present in the background and hard to differentiate with the assumed Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates.

The authors provide convincing genetic demonstration of the cell transit pathway and implicate decreased synaptic activity and glial Drapper function in the process. Overall, a very nice demonstration of some interesting biology of Htt's ability to act in a prion-like fashion only between synaptically connected pairs.</p><p>A few points of discussion:</p><p>1) I have no idea how significant this biology actually is for Htt-mediated pathology. There are no functional studies of the PN neurons to determine if they have any defects secondary to this synaptic transfer – clearly far fewer Htt polyQ aggregates are forming in the postsynaptic cell than in the presynaptic cell (where polyQ Htt is expressed). Likewise, I have no idea how to interpret the primary readout of the assays – from 4-12 HttWT-GFP puncta forming in the PNs of interest. How many PN neurons are actually being assayed in a single glomerus? It seems like a very small effect to be honest. This is my only real concern – the biology is quite clear with the Htt transfer and prion-like effects requiring a glial intermediate. This is very exciting and well documented. The significance to HD pathology or actual PN function is unknown. It could be quite significant or not really relevant for pathology.</p><p>2) Why is there so little overlap between green Q25and red Q91 Htt puncta in many of the figures? I'm surprised that so much aggregation of HttQ25 is occurring with only a tiny bit of the HttQ91 as a seed. What about the somal Q25 aggregates that don't appear to have any Q91? The authors mention some model of splitting, but I don't quite understand how this could occur.</p><p>3) Given the requirement of synaptic connectivity for aggregate transfer, it is important to think how the glia contribute to this. Are these glia limited specifically to 1 glomerulus, is there no transfer of Htt aggregates between glia? Seems like the glial transit could degrade the synaptic specificity in areas of the brain where you don't have such specificity driven by the olfactory glomeruli structure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Prion-like transmission of toxic protein aggregates is emerging as a new mechanism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Using the well-defined ORP/PN neuronal network in the fly olfactory system, the Pearce group previously showed that Draper, the glial phagocytic receptor, is essential for the transmission of mHTT-derived aggregates from ORN to the surrounding glia, where they can convert the wildtype, normally soluble HTT protein into aggregated species. In this follow up work by Donnelly et al., they further showed a similar Draper-dependent tran-synaptical transmission of the mHTT aggregate from ORN to the connected PN and the conversion of PN-expressed wildtype HTT (wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub>) to aggregated forms, with the glia cytoplasm as the critical aggregate transit center.</p><p>Among the other new findings, they showed that:</p><p>1) The transmission is preferably in antegrade direction;</p><p>2) The smaller mHTT aggregate species are likely the mediator of the transmission;</p><p>3) The transmission efficiency is inversely correlated with activities of presynaptic neurons (i.e., ORN), in contrast to reports from a few other earlier studies;</p><p>4) The mHTT-induced apoptotic signaling is likely a potentiator/activator of the Draper-mediated aggregate transmission process.</p><p>Although some findings are potentially interesting, overall the study is limited with the following concerns:</p><p>1) Limited novelty and mechanistic study.

In this study, the definition on aggregates is primarily based on fluorescent imaging. Compared to the rather easily recognizable mHtt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q91 aggregates, the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates are often less clear and hard to distinguish from background. For example, the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates in Figure 1H, Figure 2D, Figure 5A and Figure 7C (Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-YFP panels). In these images, many uneven GFP signals are present in the background and hard to differentiate with the assumed Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates.

They found that the aggregation-prone huntingtin (Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91) forms aggregates when it is expressed in the ORNs. The Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates are transferred anterogradely from ORNs to either glia or PNs. This further leads to the aggregation of the wild-type huntingtins (Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25) that are expressed in the glia or PNs. These data strongly support the hypothesized model that pathogenic protein aggregates, such as huntingtin; can spread from cells to cells in the brain.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) The major concerns shared by the three reviewers are the quality/validity of your images especially those with the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP positive puncta in PNs. You need to address these questions by providing a detail description, quantification criteria and probably re-do some of the images and/or quantification.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>1).… clearly far fewer Htt polyQ aggregates are forming in the postsynaptic cell than in the presynaptic cell (where polyQ Htt is expressed).

How many PN neurons are actually being assayed in a single glomerus? It seems like a very small effect to be honest…</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises two concerns here. First, why far more Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates formed in ORN axons than seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in PN dendrites. Htt aggregation is self-replicating, and so we expect many more Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates to form where this highly aggregation-prone protein was expressed. Our findings show that prion-like conversion of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 in PNs requires Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates to exit an ORN axon via Draper-dependent phagocytosis and transit through the glial cytoplasm before reaching the PN cytoplasm. On this journey, phagocytosed aggregates must escape several pathways that promote their clearance (e.g. phagolysosomal degradation, autophagy) and must travel across at least one membrane bilayer, so it is not surprising that Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregate formation would be a rare and perhaps unfavorable event. This idea is now added to the Results section and the Discussion section.</p><p>Second, the reviewer asks for clarification of the number of postsynaptic PNs assayed in our images. Here we use Or67d-QF to express Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry in ~40 DA1 ORNs, which synapse onto ~7 DA1 PNs that are among the larger population of PNs labeled by GH146-Gal4. This relevant information has been added to the Results section. Numbers of induced aggregates detected in the DA1 glomerulus over time are thus consistent with 1-2 Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates forming in each postsynaptic DA1 PN. Importantly, seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates were only detectable when Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry (and not Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-mCherry) was expressed in presynaptic ORNs, and this difference is statistically significant (see Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why is there so little overlap between green Q25and red Q91 Htt puncta in many of the figures?

Our data indicate that Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates co-localize with smaller Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates, giving the appearance of a Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry “core” inside each Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP punctum. This interesting feature is highlighted in 3D confocal stacks in revised Figure 2A-D and new Video 1, and in confocal slices in new Figure 1—figure supplement 2C (associated text in subsection “wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates in PNs are seeded by smaller mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates originating in ORNs” and the Discussion section). This finding suggests that smaller Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates act as prion-like “seeds,” in agreement with our previous study (Pearce et al., 2015) and with studies from other labs showing that seeding- and internalization-competent Htt<sub>ex1</sub> (Chen et al., 2001; Ast et al., 2018) and tau (Wu et al., 2013) belong to smaller-sized aggregate subpopulations. Seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates could grow by continual addition of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 until all available protein was converted, possibly increasing the ratio of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25:Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 monomers in each aggregate. It is also possible that secondary nucleation events could be at play, where a fragment of a seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregate that has little or no Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 component could propagate. This could explain why a few bright Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP puncta in the DA1 glomerulus do not have associated Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry signal, though these would represent only a very small fraction (&lt;10-15%) of all seeded wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates in our samples. However, these Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP-only aggregates were excluded from our analyses because we also observed puncta formed by mCD8-GFP in DA1 and non-DA1 antennal lobe glomeruli (see controls in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Because the majority of wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> puncta detected in PN soma did not colocalize with mHtt<sub>ex1</sub>, we have removed these data from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>2) The robustness of the readout, especially on converteds wt Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25 aggregates.

To directly address this issue, we have re-analyzed all of our data (except for Figure 7; see below) using a semi-automated quantification approach to first segment Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry fluorescence in volumetric confocal data into distinct surfaces (“aggregates”), followed by filtering for the subpopulation of these aggregates that is Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP-positive (further detail described in Results section and Materials and methods section). An additional panel showing Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 (red) and “Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25” (yellow) surfaces identified for each data set is now included for each applicable figure. A new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and animation (Video 1) were also added for further detail about this approach. We believe this strategy provides the most objective and rigorous method to quantify prion-like spreading of mHtt in our model.</p><p>In the experiments shown in Figure 7, immunostaining to detect Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-3xHA expressed in glia and Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-YFP in PNs precluded use of this semi-automated 3D segmentation approach, since fewer than half of co-localized Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 surfaces identified by manual counting were identified by 3D segmentation. This is likely because of poor antibody penetration and low contrast of immunolabeled aggregates. To reduce bias, two researchers blinded to the genotype and age of the flies manually counted aggregates in these samples, and we used line scan analyses to confirm colocalization of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> and wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> signals above surrounding signal (intensity profiles shown in Figure 7). Controls showing that wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> proteins in glia and PNs do not colocalize with soluble Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-mCherry in DA1 ORNs were added in a new supplemental figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), and glial-specific knockdown of Draper eliminated co-localization of any Htt<sub>ex1</sub> proteins (Figure 7H-J).

We have included new controls in this revised manuscript showing that a few GFP+ puncta appeared when mCD8-GFP was expressed in PNs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and Figure 1—figure supplement 3B) or in all neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). mCD8-GFP puncta also appeared in regions of the brain where Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 was not expressed, thus representing normal neurite architecture and/or mCD8-GFP-labeled intracellular vesicles in the secretory pathway transiting to the plasma membrane. None of these puncta colocalized with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates, measured either by Pearson’s correlation coefficient in all neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F) or using our semi-automated method in the DA1 glomerulus (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and 2D, and Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and 3F). Based on this, we conservatively define seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates as Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates that co-localize with punctate Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP. Controls in which Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-mCherry was expressed in DA1 ORNs did not generate any Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91+Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 puncta (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, E, and F, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B).

First, in the original Figure 3G (now Figure 3I and J) and in several other raw confocal images, seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates were not easily distinguished from the surrounding diffuse Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP signal in the DA1 and other glomeruli (same issue raised by reviewer 2 above). We now display all raw data for individual channels in grayscale to improve visibility of puncta, and more importantly, have added a panel for each relevant confocal data figure to show 3D surfaces representing segmented Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 and seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates. Additional text in the Results section and Materials and methods section describe these new details.</p><p>Second, original Figure 4B (now Figure 4A and B) showed DA1 ORN axon surfaces defined by mCD8-GFP signal, but did not clearly report differences in fluorescence intensity; these data are now displayed using a heat map LUT to indicate intensity differences between the two genotypes. Third, single z-slices in Figure 7 show aggregate subtypes that appeared in these brains over time; several new slices were selected to better represent the quantitative data, and line scan profiles were added to demonstrate co-localization (or lack thereof) in puncta indicated in each slice. Fourth, volumetric mHtt surfaces shown in original Figure 2D (now Figure 2A1’-3’, 2B1’-3’, 2C1’-3’, and 2D1’-3’) and 5D (now Figure 5E-F) were shown at a different magnification as adjacent raw data; they are now shown at the same magnification to demonstrate that segmented surfaces accurately report aggregate sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1 (A, C and D), the pattern of the mCherry staining is not consistent.

While we agree that this is an essential question, our current study does not make any direct claims about the relevance of our model to HD pathogenesis in humans. Instead, we use mHtt to model aggregate spreading between different CNS cell types in vivo, and our findings make important advances in understanding the basic cell biological mechanisms that underlie prion-like spreading of aggregates in intact brains. Specifically, our findings demonstrate to our knowledge for the first time that pathogenic aggregates spread unidirectionally between synaptically-connected neurons in vivo and unveil an unexpected role for glia in trans-synaptic aggregate transfer. As suggested, we have reworked our Discussion section to better highlight these exciting findings, while also emphasizing that our current study does not directly address functional consequences of mHtt spreading to glia or postsynaptic neurons, an important focus for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) All three reviewers suggest the authors to discuss/modify their model about the role of the glia.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>3) Given the requirement of synaptic connectivity for aggregate transfer, it is important to think how the glia contribute to this. Are these glia limited specifically to 1 glomerulus, is there no transfer of Htt aggregates between glia? Seems like the glial transit could degrade the synaptic specificity in areas of the brain where you don't have such specificity driven by the olfactory glomeruli structure.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 raises several interesting open questions about how glia could direct transfer of aggregates from presynaptic ORNs to postsynaptic PNs. This was the most surprising and exciting finding of our study, and we agree that these questions are fascinating. In our previous study (Pearce et al., 2015), we show that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates formed in DA1 ORN axons are efficiently transferred to the glial cytoplasm via phagocytosis. We show here that glial engulfment of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates is stimulated by caspase-dependent “eat me” signals on presynaptic ORNs, and because retrograde transfer could not be induced by expressing mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> in PNs, phagocytic glia must interact in unique ways with presynaptic ORN axons to drive trans-synaptic spreading. We have revised our manuscript with a more developed discussion about how glia-synapse interactions could promote this specificity (Discussion section). Whether this specificity is maintained at non-ORN-PN synapses in the brain was not examined in our study, but is an interesting idea for future work. Reported numbers of ensheathing glia that send processes into the antennal lobe suggests that roughly 1-2 of the glia enwrap each individual antennal lobe glomerulus. While we can’t exclude the possibility of glia-to-glia aggregate transfer, this information, together with the restricted localization of seeded wtHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates in glia or in PNs to the DA1 glomerulus in our model suggests that this is not likely to be a large component of ORN-to-PN aggregate transfer, nor would it change our overall conclusions about the role of glia in trans-synaptic transfer. Further discussion about glial-dependent and -independent modes of aggregate transfer in the CNS were added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1).… Further, the study did not provide any mechanistic understanding on how glia-to-PN transmission occurs.</p></disp-quote><p>The concern raised here by reviewer 2 is about our limited understanding of the mechanistic details underlying the glia-to-PN leg of the journey that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates take across ORN-PN synapses. Similar to the previous concern from reviewer 1, this question is one of the most interesting raised by our study and merits further investigation. Our previous study (Pearce et al., 2015) showed that mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates gain access to the glial cytoplasm at some point following Draper-dependent phagocytic engulfment. In our revised manuscript, we have expanded our Discussion section to include possible mechanisms that could specifically support glia-to-PN aggregate transfer, including previously-reported modes of aggregate transfer (e.g., exosomes or aggregate release) and the possibility that this transfer is driven by secondary cytotoxicity induced by aggregate entry into the glial cytoplasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>2) In Figure 7, the authors do not provide enough evidence to support their argument that Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates are transferred from ORNs to glia cells (1a) and then to DA1 PNs (1b). There are a few puncta still can be observed in Figure 7C-Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-YFP (7d, +DrprRNAi). This suggests that the expression of the DrprRNAi in glia cells does not completely block the formation of aggregates in the DA1 PNs. Hence, it is possible that a small portion of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates can be transferred directly from ORNs to DA1 PNs.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3’s concern is regarding our conclusion that glial Draper knockdown blocks formation of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in PNs (original Figure 7C, now Figure 7H). This concern relates directly to another that we addressed earlier about how aggregates are defined and distinguished from surrounding diffuse Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 signal in PN dendrites. In Figure 7, we have included line scan profiles to accompany confocal slice data, to demonstrate that Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-3xHA or Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-YFP signals in glia and PNs, respectively, do not overlap with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry puncta in DrprRNAi-expressing brains, and vice versa. Quantified data from multiple DrprRNAi-expressing brains is also now included in the graphs in Figure 7I and J, showing that knockdown of <italic>drpr</italic> in glia increases numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates [as we previously reported (Pearce et al., 2015)] but nearly eliminates formation of seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates in glia and in PNs. These data strongly support our model that ORN-derived Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates transfer to both glia and PN cytoplasms via Draper-dependent phagocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Other concerns</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1) Limited novelty and mechanistic study. Given the known role of Draper in the ORN-to-Glia aggregate transmission, the new findings on Draper and glia in ORN-to-PN transmission are less unexpected…</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that we have previously reported Draper dependent spreading of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates from ORNs to glia (Pearce et al., 2015). However, the current manuscript provides three important new findings: (1) Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91 aggregates spread anterogradely and not retrogradely across neuronal synapses in vivo, (2) aggregate spreading across ORN-PN synapses is inversely correlated with neuronal activity, and (3) a surprising, central role for phagocytic glia in trans-synaptic aggregate spreading. Since in vivo studies of prion-like spreading have largely involved focal injection of pre-formed aggregates into rodent brains at concentrations that likely far exceed that experienced in the disease state, we feel that a major contribution of our study is using transgenic methods to provide insight into how aggregates spread between individual cell cytoplasms under more physiological conditions (e.g. across naturally-formed synapses). Protein aggregates have been observed in glial cells in human brains and in animal models of many neurodegenerative diseases, but the details for how glia slow and/or enhance disease progression are not understood. We provide to our knowledge the first evidence that a conserved glial phagocytic pathway mediates both clearance and spreading of protein aggregates in intact brains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 6E, quantification of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>-Q25-GFP puncta, the baseline for &quot;LacZ in PNs&quot; (filled cycle) is already very low, near zero, thus it might not be meaningful to claim that &quot;Conversely, co-expression of p35 with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP in PNs did not affect numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q91-mCherry and Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP aggregates in the DA1 glomerulus (Figure 6D and E, circles), indicating that caspase-dependent signaling in PNs does not regulate mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregate spreading across ORN-PN synapses.&quot; (subsection “Caspase activation in ORNs regulates trans-synaptic transfer of mHtt<sub>ex1</sub> aggregates”).</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2’s concern is regarding the relatively small numbers of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregates that were present when p35 or LacZ was co-expressed with Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25-GFP in PNs (originally graphed in Figure 6E). We suspect this is due to competition of the Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 and LacZ/p35 transgenes for the GH146-Gal4 driver, leading to lower levels of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 expression. To increase the robustness of these data, we repeated the experiments shown in the original Figure 6C-E in older animals to compare effects when seeded Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 aggregate numbers are increased. These new data are shown in Figure 6F-K and support our previous conclusion that seeding of Htt<sub>ex1</sub>Q25 is affected by p35 expression in ORNs, but not in PNs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
