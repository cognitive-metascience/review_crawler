histones bound to cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs); here we show that this forms a cellular antibacterial defense system. Sequestered on droplets under normal conditions, in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), histones are released from the droplets and kill bacteria efficiently in vitro. Droplet-bound histones also function in vivo: when injected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos lacking droplet-bound histones, bacteria grow rapidly. In contrast, bacteria injected into embryos with droplet-bound histones die. Embryos with droplet-bound histones displayed more than a fourfold survival advantage when challenged with four different bacterial species.

In vitro, histones are very effective at killing bacteria, and there is some evidence that histones secreted from cells provide protection against bacteria living outside cells. However, many types of bacteria are able to enter cells, where they can avoid the immune system and go on to replicate.</p><p>In principle histones could protect cells against such bacteria from the inside, but for many years this was thought to be unlikely because most histones are bound to DNA strands in the cell nucleus, whereas the bacteria replicate in the cytosol. Moreover, free histones can be extremely damaging to cells, so most species have developed mechanisms to detect and degrade free histones in the cytosol.</p><p>Recently, however, it was discovered that histones can bind to lipid droplets—organelles in the cytosol that are primarily used to store energy—in various animal cells and tissues. Now, Anand et al. have demonstrated that histones bound to lipid droplets can protect cells against bacteria without causing any of the harm normally associated with the presence of free histones. In in vitro experiments with lipid droplets purified from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, they showed that histones bound to lipid droplets could be released to kill bacteria. The histones were released by lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid produced by the bacteria.</p><p>The effect was also observed in vivo: using four different bacterial species, Anand et al. injected similar numbers of bacteria into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos that contained histones bound to lipid droplets, and also into embryos that had been genetically modified so that they did not contain such droplet-bound histones. While most of the normal embryos survived, the vast majority of the embryos without droplet-bound histones died. Similar results were also found in experiments on adult flies, along with evidence which suggests that histones might also provide defenses against bacteria in mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00003.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00003.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>anti-bacterial</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM64624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM64687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Welte</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG031531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Welte</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2011-23745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pol</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LifeChips-IGERT fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cermelli</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histones bound to lipid droplets inside cells offer protection against bacteria in flies, and possibly mice, thus suggesting a possible new innate immunity pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histones are fundamental components of eukaryotic chromatin, and are therefore abundant in essentially all animal cells, for example, in humans, there are tens of millions of histone molecules per cell. While not generally appreciated, histones and histone fragments are surprisingly bactericidal in in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirsch, 1958</xref>). Thus, in principle histones could provide animals with a potent supply of microbicides for protection against bacterial invasion. In some cases, histones are released extracellularly, and then contribute to innate immunity against bacteria. For example, in the skin mucosa of catfish, secreted histone H2A contributes critically to the organismal defense against bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2002</xref>), and histones H3 and H4 are prominent antimicrobial agents in sebaceous gland secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Many bacterial pathogens invade cells and replicate intracellularly. This infectious strategy allows evasion of many host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, including antibody-based defenses in vertebrates. In principle, then, histones normally present in cells could confer protection against microbes that exploit intracellular niches. However, until now this has seemed unlikely for two reasons. First, histones typically are located in the nucleus, excluding contact with cytosolic bacteria. Second, histones are generally believed to be predominantly bound to DNA, with only minuscule amounts of excess histones. In fact, because unconfined histones cause genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, and lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saffarzadeh et al., 2012</xref>), cells minimize excess free histones by active mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Singh et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2009b</xref>). Given these constraints, it is not surprising that histone-mediated intracellular antibacterial responses have not been investigated extensively.</p><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous fat storage organelles that store triglycerides and sterols for energy production and as biosynthetic precursors. In addition to their fundamental role in lipid homeostasis, LDs have recently been proposed to act as protein sequestration sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Welte, 2007</xref>). Histones, in particular, have been detected on LDs in a number of animal cells and tissues, including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, fly embryos, moth fat bodies, and mammalian leukocytes, insulin producing β-cells, and muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Might these cytosolic extra-nuclear histone deposits allow cells to exploit the antimicrobial properties of histones without incurring the risks typically caused by excess histone accumulation?</p><p>We address this question using early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. In these embryos, LDs sequester large amounts of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>), and new work has provided mutants lacking droplet-bound histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we report that while histones are usually sequestered on droplets, they are released in response to the presence of bacterial cell wall components. These histones kill Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria, both in vitro and in vivo. Embryos injected with bacteria have considerably higher survival success when they have droplet-bound histones, establishing that histones on LDs contribute to innate immunity in embryos. A similar survival advantage was observed in adult flies. Simulation of bacterial infection in mice induces histone accumulation on LDs in the liver, a key organ for fighting infection; this observation suggests that lipid droplet histones may represent an ancient host defense strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LDs have antimicrobial activity</title><p>Our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>) established the presence of histones (usually believed to be nuclear) in cytosolic lipid droplets purified from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Based on our discovery of immunity-related mRNAs on the LDs (unpublished), we considered whether histones might play a role in the flies' immune response. When we found that there was a precedent for histone antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirsch, 1958</xref>), we hypothesized that the histones bound to the cytosolic LDs might act as an antibacterial system. To test whether LDs could indeed inhibit bacterial growth, we performed a traditional plate assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dilute suspensions of bacteria were grown in the presence or absence of potential antimicrobial agents (LDs equivalent to ∼500 μg total proteins and controls), and colony forming units (CFU) on an agar plate were counted after 24 hr of incubation with the agents. For both Gram-negative (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) and Gram-positive (<italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>) bacteria, LDs decreased the CFU dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare buffer vs LD), indicating that the droplets have an antimicrobial property. These effects were highly reproducible in multiple trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Complementary disc-diffusion assays confirmed the microbicidal effects of the droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00003.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LDs kill bacteria via droplet bound histones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). Representative plates in a colony forming assay, showing growth of Gram-negative (<italic>Escherichia coli DH5α</italic>, top) and Gram-positive (<italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, bottom) bacteria, where a known amount of bacteria were incubated at 37°C either in buffer alone, or with LDs pre-treated with or without anti-histone antibodies. In buffer (left, ‘Buffer’), many colonies (white spots) were observed, but in the presence of LDs (LD), the observed number of colonies was greatly decreased, demonstrating an antibacterial effect of the LDs. Pre-treatment of the droplets with anti-histone antibodies abolished this effect (LD + Anti-histones). (<bold>B</bold>). Quantification of colony forming assay in <bold>A</bold>.

Disc diffusion assay over a lawn of <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α. A potential antibacterial agent is placed on a small sterile piece of filter paper (white circle); a cleared area (darker region) indicates antibacterial activity. Positive control: the antibiotic kanamycin (Antibiotic); growth inhibition region indicated by the red arrow. Negative control: buffer (Buffer). LDs isolated in the presence (LD-CaCO<sub>3</sub>) or absence (LD) of alkaline carbonate were spotted on sterile discs; bacterial inhibition was observed in the untreated droplets (LD) but not in the carbonate-treated droplets (LD-CaCO<sub>3</sub>). The filter papers are 7 mm in diameter. (<bold>D</bold>). Quantification of the size of the clear zone in the disc diffusion assay from <bold>C</bold>. Fifteen independent disc diffusion assays were performed with purified LDs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, the antibiotic kanamycin, or buffer. Antimicrobial activity of compounds was quantified as the diameter of the clear zones surrounding the filter papers after subtraction of filter papers diameter (1 A.U. = 0.1 mm). (<bold>E</bold>). Use of a gel-overlay assay to determine the identity of the anti-bacterial protein(s) on the LDs. Proteins extracted from LDs (LD, left lane) were run in duplicate on an AU-gel; murine cryptdin 4 (Crp 4, right lane) served as positive control. After electrophoresis, the gel was split. One half (left) was stained by Coomassie Blue; the histone bands are indicated by a blue arrow and the crp 4 control is indicated by the green arrow. The other half (right) was used in a gel overlay assay (see ‘Materials and methods’) to reveal regions of the gel able to inhibit bacterial growth (inhibition by LD is indicated by the red arrow and that by crp 4 control is indicated by the violet arrow). Inhibition of bacterial growth due to proteins on the LDs was only observed in a single region, corresponding to the histones (red arrow). Consistent with this, mass spectrometry of proteins cut from the Coomassie gel corresponding to the killing region identified predominantly histones H2A and H2B (see ‘LDs have antimicrobial activity’). (<bold>F</bold>). <italic>E. coli ML35</italic> cultures were transiently (∼1 hr) exposed to commercial calf thymus pan-histone proteins (Sigma) or gel-extracted LD-histones (from the gel-overlay assay). Both preparations show similar potency for bacterial killing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00003.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00003.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00003-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>What is the molecular nature of this killing activity? LDs are complex organelles with both lipids and proteins. Thus, one potential source of antibacterial activity might be fatty acids released due to breakdown of the abundant triglycerides; because of their detergent-like properties, they might destroy bacterial membranes and thus impair bacterial viability. We therefore treated purified LDs with alkaline washes. This treatment removes electrostatically bound droplet proteins, but not lipids and proteins attached via hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasaemle et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>), these washes greatly reduced the levels of the electrostatically bound histone H2B, but not of the hydrophobically bound LSD-2. These treated droplets no longer had antibacterial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, LD-CaCO<sub>3</sub>), suggesting that the antimicrobial activity requires electrostatically bound proteins.</p><p>Our previous study identified hundreds of lipid droplet proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>), many present in low enough copy number to be detectable only by silver stain. In principle, any of them might be responsible for the antibacterial activity, but it seems likely that the active agents would be present in high copy number. We thus performed a traditional gel overlay assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), visualizing these high-copy number proteins by Coomassie stain. Droplet proteins were separated by Acid Urea (AU) gel electrophoresis, and the gel was overlain with nutrient agar seeded with bacteria. As in the disc assay, antibacterial proteins diffuse into the agar and locally inhibit bacterial growth, as shown by the positive control mouse α-defensin cryptdin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, gel overlay violet arrow). The lipid-droplet lane contained significant antibacterial activity in only one location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, gel overlay red arrow). MS analyses of proteins eluted from this location identified histones H2A and H2B as the predominant proteins present (spectra not shown). Therefore, the bactericidal activity of LDs is most likely due to histones, consistent with their known antimicrobial activities in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirsch, 1958</xref>). Importantly, pretreatment of purified LDs with anti-histone antibodies abolished or markedly reduced the droplet bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, 1B-LD + Anti-histones). Thus, we conclude that the majority of the in vitro antibacterial activity of LDs from early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos is due to histones.</p><p>We performed two tests to determine if these cytosolic droplet-bound histones are different from nuclear histones. First, using mass spectrometry, we compared post-translational modifications on droplet-bound and nuclear histones and found no major distinctions, suggesting that unique post translation modifications are not responsible for association of histones to LDs. Since our analysis was mostly qualitative, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences might arise from quantitative changes in post-translation modifications. We did identify several acetylation sites in histones H2A (serine 1 and lysines 5 and 8) and histone H2B (lysines 7, 11, 14 and 17). Some of these acetylation sites were previously found in shrimp histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ouvry-Patat and Schey, 2007</xref>). The histones previously examined for antimicrobial activity are reported to be un-acetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2000</xref>), though there was no indication of whether acetylation affected antimicrobial efficacy. Second, we compared the antibacterial potencies of droplet-derived histones with commercial calf thymus histones isolated from a calf thymus nuclear fraction in both bactericidal (killing bacteria outright) and bacteriostatic (inhibiting the growth or reproduction of bacteria) activity assays. Histones extracted from droplets using AU gel electrophoresis were combined with a suspension of <italic>E. coli</italic> ML35 for 1 hr, and bacterial cell survival was determined by measuring CFU. This assay showed that histones are bactericidal and that droplet-derived histones and commercial pan-histones purified from calf thymus do not differ significantly in antibacterial efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Enhanced bacterial growth in embryos lacking histone deposits on LDs</title><p>Although these studies indicate that histones present on embryonic LDs kill bacteria in vitro, it remained unclear whether histones make a meaningful contribution to the overall antibacterial defense in the embryos. In vivo, droplet-bound histones may have different properties, due to the presence of binding partners or the physiological state of the bacteria, their effective concentration might not be high enough to kill, or, relative to other antibacterial mechanisms, the contribution of histones might be negligible.</p><p>To test the significance of the histones on LDs in vivo, we took advantage of the recent identification of the putative histone receptor on droplets, jabba (CG42351), a novel 42 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Jabba</italic> is present on LDs in wild-type flies and is required for histone localization on droplets; in <italic>Jabba</italic> mutants LDs are present, but histones are absent from the LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

As tested in the embryos, and in a limited way in adult flies, the system appears efficient, resulting in a more than fourfold improvement in survival for challenges by multiple types of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including the known intracellular pathogen <italic>Listeria</italic>. Histones and histone fragments had previously been reported to play a role in extracellular antibacterial defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von Kockritz-Blickwede and Nizet, 2009</xref>). We propose here that by using histone-droplet sequestration, cells can position histones in the cytosol, so that they are both available to interact with cytosolic bacteria, and also can evade constitutive pathways responsible for degrading free histones. Determining whether the murine droplet-bound histones actively contribute to host defense remains for future studies.</p><p>In principle, any kind of cell has the ability to form LDs, and thus employing droplet-bound histones as antibacterial defence might be quite general. Indeed, proteomic studies have revealed histones on LDs in tissues from larval and adult insects as well as in a range of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smolenski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larsson et al., 2012</xref>), including mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Such a role of droplets in the antibacterial response may in part explain why the number and size of LDs increase in disease, from osteoarthritis to liver degeneration and cartilage overproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tilney and Portnoy, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielecki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lowder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Figueredo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). In mammalian leukocytes and macrophages, LDs have already been suggested to participate in the regulation of the host response to infection, by modulating the production of inflammation mediators like eicosanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozza and Viola, 2010</xref>). Our result discloses an additional role of droplets in innate immunity, a role potentially conserved from flies to mammals. Since many medically relevant bacterial pathogens enter the cytosol (e.g. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic>, <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> and <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ray et al., 2009</xref>) and histones are also reported to have anti-fungal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Lucca et al., 2011</xref>), and many such pathogenic fungi also enter the cytosol (e.g., <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bliska and Casadevall, 2009</xref>), it may be that the system described here has surprisingly wide utility.</p><p>At least in the case of bacteria, histone release from the droplets is triggered by bacterial cell envelope components. This release likely allows an appropriate cellular response: freeing enough histones to kill bacteria, but minimizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>) of excess free histones interfering with endogenous cellular processes. We speculate that this release is achieved via direct binding between LPS and histones, as histones can indeed directly bind LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolton and Perry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augusto et al., 2003</xref>) and the presence of LPS did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of histones in the plate assay. We propose that the negatively charged LPS or LTA neutralize the positively charged histones and therefore weaken their electrostatic interactions with <italic>Jabba</italic> on the LDs; histone binding to droplets is charge-sensitive, as indicated by the ability of CaCO<sub>3</sub> to detach the histones from the droplets.</p><p>If histones are so effective, why load them not at high levels onto all LDs? The observation that droplet-bound H1 increases in mouse liver in response to a simulated bacterial infection might suggest that there is a cost to storing histones on droplets. Cells likely have to balance immediate histone availability with possible undesirable uncontrolled histone release from droplets due to metabolic consumption of the underlying droplets, or alternatively, potential secondary effects due to the excess histones causing saturation of histone-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation of LDs and treatments</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (Oregon-R strain) were collected, aged and dechorionated with 50% bleach.

We searched in each embryo for the region(s) with the most bacteria visible, and quantified that number, using images with same field of view. At least three different embryos were used in each group. At the same time, we noted how many such high-bacteria fields were typically present in an embryo, as well as typical bacterial counts in the other fields. We estimate the embryo can be covered by approximately 10 independent fields of 40 µ each. For the wild-type, at t = 2 hr, the average number of bacteria in the (maximal) field of view was 24.3 ± 6.4, and there were between three and four such fields per embryo, with few bacteria elsewhere, leading to an estimate of ∼84 bacteria per embryo.

For the t = 24 wt embryos, the average maximal field had 21.7 ± 9.2 bacteria, but there was only one such field per embryo, typically with 3–4 other areas with 1–5 bacteria per field, resulting in an estimate of 33 bacteria per embryo. For the t = 24 <italic>Jabba</italic> mutant embryos, approximately 1/3 of the fields had the high bacterial count (∼180 ± 16.1 bacteria), and the rest typically had 10–30 bacteria per field, leading to an estimate of 840 bacteria per embryo.

Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p>This is a very nice description of a remarkable new finding – bacteria infected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos are killed by the release of histones from lipid droplets. The finding that in Jabba mutants histones do not accumulate in lipid droplets allowed a direct test of the involvement of histones in the process. A large difference in bacterial growth was observed, and a four to five fold difference in embryo survival was observed upon injection with bacteria. While the results are outstanding, the manuscript preparation is a bit wanting. In particular, there should be more quantitative assessment of the effects observed.</p><p>An important point that is currently not discussed in the paper is that, as of now, this phenomenon has been shown to apply to fly embryos (with some interesting results in murine liver added). But we feel there should be some discussion of whether this might apply to the adult organism – perhaps even some presentation as to whether adult Jabba flies are compromised or not when confronted with bacterial pathogens, if such trials have been done. While such experiments are not absolutely required (<italic>eLife</italic> policy is to suggest just the absolutely essential experiments), the text must be modified to bring forth this important limitation; as of now the effect has been seen only in early embryos and not in adult flies.</p><p>Aside from this important limitation that needs to be addressed, we recommend that the effect of Jabba be tested in another mutant background (jabba/deficiency) to exclude a possible background effect.</p><p>There were also some issues raised regarding the experiments using mammalian cell lines. Firstly, in the context of immunity, measuring the efficiency of an LPS infection is usually defined by cytokine response rather than hepatic injury. Secondly, if histones do act as cytosolic antibacterial agents in mammalian cells, it might to include a bacterial killing assay with intracellular bacteria and mammalian cells. In short, it would be good to tone down this section as well because the experiments presented are also rather limited, if provocative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00003.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>An important point that is currently not discussed in the paper is that, as of now, this phenomenon has been shown to apply to fly embryos (with some interesting results in murine liver added).

In the new version of the manuscript, we answer it in the affirmative—Figure 4 is entirely new, and shows new data quantifying survival of adult flies challenged with bacteria. Further, Figure 4 shows that we can indeed detect histones in the adult cytosol, and that histone levels are decreased in the Jabba mutant background.</p><p><italic>We recommend that the effect of Jabba be tested in another mutant background (jabba/deficiency) to exclude a possible background effect</italic>.</p><p>In fact, this was not an issue—the experiments presented had been done in two entirely different genetic backgrounds, but our description was lacking. We have now modified the text to show the exact details of the two different mutants used in this study to address the background effect. Alleles <italic>Jabba</italic><sup><italic>zl01</italic></sup> and <italic>Jabba</italic><sup><italic>f07560</italic></sup> were derived independently: <italic>Jabba</italic><sup><italic>zl01</italic></sup> is due to imprecise excision of a P element inserted near the Jabba promoter. <italic>Jabba</italic><sup><italic>f07560</italic></sup> is due to the insertion of a PBac element in the middle of the Jabba coding region. As the two alleles were generated in entirely different genetic backgrounds, this rules out any genetic background effects. This has now been clarified in the text.</p><p><italic>There were also some issues raised regarding the experiments using mammalian cell lines.

We have not been able to do a bacterial killing assay with the murine droplets, because a great deal of research in Spain (where our collaborators are located) is currently on hold due to the financial crisis there; the mouse facility is closed for a month or two. Given our new data on whole-fly data, and the expected large delay in being able to carry out the murine-droplet killing assays, we propose to leave establishing the efficacy of the murine droplets for future work. Accordingly, this section has been toned down as suggested by the reviewers, and in particular, we now include the sentence: “Determining whether the murine droplet-bound histones actively contribute to host defense remains for future studies.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
