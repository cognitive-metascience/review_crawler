Here, we identify a novel host cell effector export pathway that requires the Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5). We demonstrate that ASP5 cleaves a highly constrained amino acid motif that has similarity to the PEXEL-motif of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. We show that ASP5 matures substrates at both the N- and C-terminal ends of proteins and also controls trafficking of effectors without this motif. Furthermore, ASP5 controls establishment of the nanotubular network and is required for the efficient recruitment of host mitochondria to the vacuole. Assessment of host gene expression reveals that the ASP5-dependent pathway influences thousands of the transcriptional changes that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> imparts on its host cell. All these changes result in attenuation of virulence of Δ<italic>asp5</italic> tachyzoites in vivo. This work characterizes the first identified machinery required for export of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors into the infected host cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10809.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10809.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10809.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a parasite that is thought to infect over two billion people worldwide. Often these infections cause no noticeable symptoms, but can cause serious illness in people with weakened immune systems. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites must enter human cells in order to survive. To dramatically increase their chances of survival, the parasites then deliver specialized proteins into the host cell that disarm the host’s immune defenses. Understanding how these specialized proteins are transported from inside the parasite into the host cell, and how this process can be blocked, may lead to new treatments for these and related parasitic infections.</p> <p>By genetically modifying <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites to lack a parasite enzyme, Coffey et al. have now discovered that this molecule is required for correctly transporting parasite proteins. This enzyme is called aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5) and is found in the parasite in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which acts as a main hub for protein transport.</p> <p>ASP5 cuts proteins at a ‘barcode’ that is found in many different types of proteins, priming them for transport out of the parasite and for export into the host cell in some cases. Coffey et al. show that in parasites that lack ASP5, these proteins are no longer cleaved and are not transported correctly, blocking the activities that parasites normally perform to ensure their survival. Therefore, ASP5 plays an important role in transporting a wide range of proteins associated with disease, including transporting certain proteins directly into the host cell.</p> <p>Future studies that compare parasites that lack ASP5 to normal parasites will aim to identify new proteins used by the parasites to defeat the host’s immune defenses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10809.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10809.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma</italic></kwd> <kwd>effector</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>export</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boddey</surname><given-names>Justin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tonkin</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boddey</surname><given-names>Justin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tonkin</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boothroyd</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasite requires an enzyme called ASP5 to cleave proteins for export into host cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phylum Apicomplexa comprises a group of obligate intracellular parasites that cause a range of diseases by actively invading and replicating within host cells. Like all intracellular pathogens, these parasites extensively modify their host cells in order to prevent immune clearance, while permitting nutrient acquisition for growth. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, one of the most common human pathogens infecting 10–80% of individuals within a population, imparts a multitude of phenotypic changes on the infected host cell in order to promote survival and dissemination, including modulation of the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2013</xref>), hyper-migration of infected dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lambert et al., 2006</xref>), down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lüder et al., 2003</xref>), induction of c-Myc expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2014</xref>), activation of inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewald et al., 2014</xref>), and recruitment of host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldszmid et al., 2009</xref>) and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pernas et al., 2014</xref>) to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM).</p><p>Over the last decade, the mechanisms of host cell modification by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> have been explored. The first exported <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors were identified through genetic quantitative trait loci mapping between progeny of crosses between virulent and avirulent strains. These proteins were shown to be protein kinases that are injected from the rhoptries into host cells during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saeij et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peixoto et al., 2010</xref>). Two canonical effector rhoptry proteins, ROP16 and ROP18, are only known to be injected into the host cell at the onset of invasion, where ROP16 levels peak within the host cell nucleus between 10 min and 4 hr post infection. ROP16 phosphorylates signal transducers and activators of transcription 1/3/5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ong et al., 2010</xref>), thus skewing the immediate-early immune response to limit parasite clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saeij et al., 2007</xref>). While ROP16 and ROP18 were shown to be required for virulence differences between the three canonical <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains, they did not explain many other known phenotypic changes that occur during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection of host cells.</p><p>Recently, an additional class of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effector proteins was identified as coming from the dense granules. These include dense granule protein 16 (GRA16), which is exported to the host cell nucleus post invasion via the dense granules, where it contributes to cell cycle arrest, potentially as a mechanism to prevent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bougdour et al., 2013</xref>). Other parasite processes and host pathways now known to be impacted by the GRA proteins include: a skewing of the immune response through the effector GRA24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2013</xref>), influencing nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells nuclear translocation in some strains via GRA15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosowski et al., 2011</xref>), transport of small molecules across the PVM via GRA17 and GRA23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gold et al., 2015</xref>), generation of the nanotubular network (NTN, thought to aid nutrient acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mercier, 2002</xref>]) via GRA2 (and others) as well as recruitment of the host mitochondria to the PVM through the dense granule protein mitochondrial association factor 1 (MAF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pernas et al., 2014</xref>). The recent and rapid discovery of these effectors suggests that there may be many more proteins that are exported via the dense granules and that they may use a conserved export pathway to mediate changes in the infected host cell.</p><p>While some exported proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> have been identified, there is currently little information about how these proteins are transported across the PVM and into the host cell. In the related malaria-causing parasites, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., some of the mechanisms of protein export into the host erythrocyte have been revealed. Protein export by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> occurs almost immediately after invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riglar et al., 2013</xref>), and cargo proteins traffic via the parasite’s secretory pathway through the ER to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and across the PVM into the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wickham, 2001</xref>). In the majority of cases, a conserved pentameric motif, RxLxE/Q/D, referred to as the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> export element (PEXEL) or vacuolar transport signal (VTS), is required for export to the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marti, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiller, 2004</xref>). In all published cases involving <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins, the PEXEL resides ~15–30 amino acids after the signal peptide (SP), where it acts as a proteolytic cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boddey et al., 2009</xref>) for the ER-resident aspartyl protease plasmepsin V (PMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boddey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Russo et al., 2010</xref>). PEXEL processing occurs after the leucine (RxL<sup>↓</sup>xE/Q/D), which reveals a new N-terminus that is acetylated in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boddey et al., 2009</xref>). The current hypothesis is that the exposed new N-terminus (<sup>Ac-</sup>xE/Q/D) permits cargo selection for targeting to a parasite translocon located at the PVM, known as PTEX (for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> translocon of exported proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Koning-Ward et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elsworth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck et al., 2014</xref>). Effectors must be unfolded for translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gehde et al., 2009</xref>) through PTEX into the host cell before refolding and trafficking to their final destination in the host cell.</p><p>Given that several dense granule proteins are exported by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, we investigated whether a conserved pathway is used and whether it shares any similarities with the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> system. Here, we identify the novel Golgi-resident aspartyl protease 5 (ASP5) that is the first known component of the dense granule export machinery in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Our study of ASP5 has revealed a novel mechanism of protein export in this parasite and extended our understanding of the importance of this pathway in inducing changes to the infected host cell. This work highlights similarities and important differences between mechanisms of protein export in the agriculturally and medically important Apicomplexan phylum.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A pentameric motif is necessary for proteolytic processing of GRA16 and export to the host cell</title><p>Several hundred <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins contain a pentameric amino acid motif, also known as the PEXEL, that is essential for export into the infected erythrocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiller, 2004</xref>). Within the N-terminus of GRA16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bougdour et al., 2013</xref>), we observed a PEXEL-like motif (RRLAE) after the SP, at amino acid positions 63 to 67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine whether the PEXEL-like motif was involved in protein trafficking in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, we undertook a mutational analysis of GRA16 at the endogenous locus. This was achieved through double-homologous recombination whereby the endogenous <italic>GRA16</italic> gene was replaced with either wild-type (WT) <italic>gra16</italic> encoding the native PEXEL-like motif RRLAE and fused to a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (GRA16<sub>WT</sub>-HA), or a version of <italic>gra16</italic> with its PEXEL-like motif mutated from RRLAE to AAAAE (GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA). The resulting lines were analyzed for proteolytic processing and trafficking. Immunoblot analysis showed that GRA16<sub>WT</sub>-HA is represented by a strong signal at ~57 kDa and two minor species at approximately 60 kDa and 54 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Following mutation of the PEXEL-like motif (GRA16<sub>AAAAE</sub>-HA), the two lower molecular weight species were not observed, demonstrating that the mutated protein was no longer processed in the same way. The result is consistent with the slowest migrating species representing signal peptidase-cleaved GRA16, while the size shift of the dominant ~57 kDa species is consistent with cleavage of the PEXEL-like motif located ~45 residues beyond the SP.

These peptides were incubated with ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub>, as above, alongside corresponding RRL&gt;AAA or REL&gt;AAA mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The WT GRA19 TEXEL peptide was processed efficiently and this was inhibited when the TEXEL was mutated from RRL to AAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the RELLD sequence in GRA21, and the corresponding AAALD mutant, were not processed by ASP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Since the RRLAE in the N-terminus of GRA21 is the same sequence as the TEXEL in GRA16, it is highly likely that ASP5 processes GRA21 at this position. Taken together, this work demonstrates that ASP5 has relatively strict requirement for arginine at P<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>, and leucine at P<sub>1</sub> of its substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and that residues at P<sub>1</sub>’ and P<sub>2</sub>’ are dispensable for processing but can influence the efficiency of cleavage by this enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ASP5 modeling reveals key interactions with the TEXEL of GRA16</title><p>To investigate the structural basis for substrate selection by ASP5, we modeled the tertiary structure of this enzyme bound to the GRA16 substrate using the crystal structure of PMV from <italic>P. vivax</italic> complexed with the PEXEL mimetic inhibitor WEHI-842 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodder et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>P. vivax</italic> plasmepsin IV in complex with Pepstatin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>) as templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The model shows that the guanidyl side-chain of arginine at P<sub>3</sub> (the first position in the TEXEL sequence) forms interactions with the side-chains of E506 and Q549 in a manner completely analogous to that observed in the structure of PMV in complex with the statine inhibitor, WEHI-842 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodder et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-i</xref>). Furthermore, the leucine at P<sub>1</sub> of the TEXEL is surrounded by hydrophobic residues I429, Y503, F546 and I554 of ASP5; the isoleucine at position 554 in ASP5 is a valine in PMV, while the other residues, I, Y, F are identical between ASP5 and PMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-i</xref>). Our TEXEL cleavage data described above revealed that, unlike PMV, arginine is strongly preferred at the P<sub>2</sub> position for ASP5 activity and that this <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> enzyme could not efficiently process the PEXEL motif from KAHRP, which contains threonine at P<sub>2</sub>. This was supported using our model, as the AutoDock potential predicted that ASP5 binds the GRA16 peptide (SRRLAEE) 5 kJ/mol more tightly than an SR<bold>T</bold>LAEE mutant form of GRA16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-ii</xref>). In this mutant substrate, the side-chain guanidine of arginine at P<sub>3</sub> is still clamped by the side-chain carboxylate and amide of ASP5 residues E506 and Q549, respectively, and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the arginine residue also forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of T677 of ASP5. The backbone carbonyl of leucine at P<sub>1</sub> in the GRA16 TEXEL forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl and the backbone amide of S505. The guanidine side-chain of arginine at P<sub>2</sub> of native GRA16 forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain hydroxyl of S505 and the backbone carbonyl of A776 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-i</xref>), whereas the mutated GRA16 substrate containing threonine at P<sub>2</sub> forms only a single hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl of S505 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-ii</xref>). Taken together, these differences in binding interactions accounts for ~50% of the total difference in the calculated binding affinity between the two substrates, providing a clear structural explanation for the substrate specificity (i.e. RRL) observed for ASP5.</p><p>We also used structural modeling to understand the substrate preference at other sites within the TEXEL motif. Mutation of leucine at P<sub>1</sub> of the GRA16 TEXEL to valine reduces the calculated binding energy by 6 kJ/mol, which is in line with our observations that mutations at this position significantly reduce ASP5 activity. The major source of the reduction in binding energy in the L&gt;V mutation arises from a reduction in electrostatic interaction, similar to that seen for the R&gt;T mutation above. Mutation of alanine at P<sub>1</sub>’ (position 4 of the GRA16 TEXEL, RRLAE) to valine is predicted to slightly increase the binding energy, but by less than 1 kJ/mol. The small change in calculated binding energy is consistent with a lack of sensitivity at this position in the TEXEL sequence recognized by ASP5. Interestingly, mutation of glutamine at P<sub>2</sub>’ (position 5 of the GRA16 TEXEL) to alanine causes an 11 kJ/mol reduction in calculated binding affinity in the model, in contrast to the increase in ASP5 activity observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is possible the glutamine reside at position 6 (i.e. RRLAE<bold>E</bold>) can act as a surrogate for the loss of glutamine at position 5 in this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-ii</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Deletion of ASP5 causes loss of fitness and the inability of parasites to process GRA16</title><p>Following validation of ASP5 as the TEXEL-cleaving protease in vitro, we sought to determine whether this occurs in parasites in vivo through deletion of the <italic>ASP5</italic> gene in parasites expressing GRA16-HA.

This activation of c-Myc was not induced in response to parasite invasion or injection of rhoptry proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that one or more dense granule proteins may be responsible. To determine whether ASP5 is involved in up-regulation of host c-Myc, HFFs were infected with WT, <italic>Δasp5</italic> or <italic>Δasp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic>:ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub> parasites, and c-Myc expression was measured by IFA and immunoblot.

Analysis of this protein, MYR1 (TGGT1_254470), revealed a TEXEL-like RRLSE sequence approximately 230 residues from the C-terminus, the approximate position where cleavage is predicted to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This strongly suggests that ASP5 is required for cleavage of MYR1.

These parasites were incubated for 4 hr on 60% confluent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) engineered to express GFP fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of DIABLO (MTS-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verhagen et al., 2000</xref>). WT (parental RH<italic>∆hx</italic>) parasites efficiently associated with host mitochondria (MTS-GFP) and MAF1 was correspondingly observed at the PVM, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, panel 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pernas et al., 2014</xref>).

In contrast, the <italic>Δasp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic>:ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub> parasites exhibited correct trafficking of MAF1 and recruitment of host mitochondria to the PVM, which was validated in two independent complemented clones that expressed ASP5 at levels close to the endogenous expression of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, panels 5–6, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

There were no differences in MAF1 expression or processing between the two lines by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), consistent with a lack of any TEXEL motif within MAF1. This result suggests that the function of MAF1 is not directly dependent on ASP5, but rather, ASP5 may act on as yet unidentified protein(s) that interact with MAF1 to facilitate efficient HMA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ASP5 is necessary for correct biogenesis of the NTN</title><p>Another characteristic of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection is the formation of the NTN that likely aids nutrient acquisition across the PVM and within the PV through an increase in surface area.

WT and <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites were transfected with an ectopic copy of GRA24 fused to 3xMyc tags (GRA24-Myc<sub>3</sub>), which was integrated into the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (URPT) locus. GRA24-Myc<sub>3</sub> was expressed in parasites and exported to the host cell nucleus by WT parasites as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2013</xref>); however, export was completely blocked in <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While GRA24 lacks a canonical TEXEL sequence (RRLxx), it does contain the non-canonical TEXEL-like sequences RGYHG, RGGLQ and RSLGM, and so we assessed whether these might be cleaved by ASP5 using synthetic peptides; however, none were efficiently processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

Given that we determined there is little to no change in replication rates between WT and Δ<italic>asp5</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we harvested all samples 20 hr after infection and used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile gene expression in HFFs that were either uninfected (UI), infected with WT (RH<italic>∆ku80</italic>) parasites, or infected with <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites. To make sure that all the changes that we observed were due to loss of ASP5 and not differences in tachyzoites numbers, we first compared the proportion of reads (rpkm) from parasite versus host cell origin as a readout of relative parasite numbers per sample. We saw equal amounts of reads mapping to human genes between all samples (24–27 × 10<sup>6</sup> reads), while infection with WT saw parasite RNA proportions of 27% (replicate 1), 24% (replicate 2) and 23% (replicate 3). Infection with our ASP5 deficient line saw parasite RNA to be 18% (replicate 1), 35% (replicate 2) and 36% (replicate 3) of the total reads, therefore suggesting that, in 2 out of the 3 samples, we have slightly more ASP5-deficient parasites per sample. Therefore, any loss of gene expression in ASP5-deficient cells must be due to loss of this protease and not lower amounts of overall parasites per sample. The expression changes due to infection by the <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites were generally smaller than those for the WT parasites. The log-fold change during infection with <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites was, on average, only 60% of the log-fold change during infection with WT parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-i</xref>). This suggests that most genes responding to parasite infection do so, at least partly, due to an ASP5-dependent pathway. At a false discovery rate of 5%, 3402 genes were significantly up-regulated and 3369 genes were significantly down-regulated in response to the WT infection, whereas only 1033 genes were significantly up- and 817 were significantly down-regulated in response to <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites.

Central to this is the ability to manipulate host cellular pathways using exported effector proteins to circumvent the host response to allow for intracellular parasite growth and survival. Previous work has demonstrated that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors can be delivered to the host cell by secretion from the rhoptry organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saeij et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boothroyd and Dubremetz, 2008</xref>). These effectors largely consist of a family of kinases and appear to be exclusively delivered to the host cell during the short time frame of host cell invasion, potentially limiting their efficacy later during the infection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saeij et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peixoto et al., 2010</xref>). While injection of these polymorphic kinases explained some strain variances in virulence, it did not clarify how <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> induces changes that are more general across isolates. More recently, several new host cell effectors have been identified that appear to be delivered into the host cell via the dense granules—organelles constitutively secreted after invasion during intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bougdour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pernas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosowski et al., 2011</xref>). This strongly suggested that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> utilizes two export pathways; the rhoptry secretion pathway, which operates early during infection, and the dense granule export pathway, which we characterize here and show is dependent on ASP5 activity.</p><p>Upon the recent identification of GRA16, a dense granule effector that translocates into the host cell nucleus and affects p53 turnover, we noticed a PEXEL-like sequence at the approximate location that the PEXEL motif is located in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bougdour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marti, 2004</xref>). Our work described here shows that this TEXEL motif is involved in the export of GRA16 into the host cell and is processed by the Golgi-resident ASP5, consistent with a recent publication characterizing ASP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curt-Varesano et al., 2015</xref>). While we identified this system based on its similarity to the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> export pathway, and indeed it has now come to light that several other Apicomplexan species utilize this ‘PEXEL-like motif’ for protein export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellé et al., 2015</xref>), our work has uncovered important differences between the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> systems and therefore sheds new light on protein export by Apicomplexan parasites.</p><p>In this study, the consensus substrate sequence for ASP5 was determined to be RRLxx, demonstrating that this enzyme has different substrate specificity to PMV, which requires RxLxE/Q/D for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boddey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sleebs et al., 2014b</xref>). A small molecule compound that mimics RRL and contains the non-cleavable amino acid statine (WEHI-586), thus a likely competitive inhibitor, inhibited ASP5 activity, whereas WEHI-916, a potent PEXEL-mimetic inhibitor of PMV that contains valine at P<sub>2</sub> (RVL<sub>statine</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sleebs et al., 2014b</xref>) was a very poor ASP5 inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt;20 μM; data not shown). Our structural model of ASP5 in complex with the TEXEL of GRA16 provides a clear explanation for the requirement of RRL within the substrate. Interestingly, we observed that mutation of the P<sub>2’</sub> residue increased ASP5 activity. This likely reflects a reduced entropic penalty associated with forming the salt bridge between the otherwise flexible side-chains. The ASP5 model also revealed differences between it and PMV, including the absence of a helix-turn-helix motif in PMV that is thought to participate in protein–protein interactions in the ER, consistent with ASP5’s location in the Golgi.</p><p>The PEXEL in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is usually found in close proximity to the N-terminal signal peptide; however, we have shown here that this positional constraint does not occur in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> TEXEL. We demonstrate that MYR1, a novel protein essential secreted into the PV, has an ASP5-cleaved TEXEL motif approximately 558 amino acids from the predicated signal peptidase cleavage site. Plasmepsin V of <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> is an ER-resident enzyme that cleaves the PEXEL co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sleebs et al., 2014b</xref>), potentially residing in complex with signal peptidase, thus immediately licensing proteins for export upon ER entry. This cannot occur for ASP5, as it is located in the Golgi, which would require TEXEL-cargo proteins to be trafficked via vesicles to this compartment prior to its activity. It is interesting to note that this localization for ASP5 is not unique as other aspartyl proteases involved in protein trafficking, such as furin and the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE), are located in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evin et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore possible that the positional constraint of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> PEXEL within cargo proteins is the consequence of PMV’s ER localization, whereas ASP5’s location in the Golgi may permit cleavage of a TEXEL motif at any position within a substrate protein. It is possible, however, that PMV may also cleave PEXEL motifs found anywhere within <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins containing a signal peptide, as this is yet to be investigated. An important difference between the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> export pathways is that, while PEXEL cleavage appears to be solely involved in export, the apparent lack of export of cleaved MYR1 suggests that TEXEL processing may also be necessary for correct localization and/or function in the PV. We also found that <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites displayed a profound defect in the biogenesis of the NTN within the PV, which is known to require several PV proteins of dense granule origin. The NTN resides between replicating parasites and the PVM, where it potentially functions in the exchange of solutes by increasing surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mercier, 2002</xref>). It is presently unknown whether the genesis of the NTN requires proteins that are exported into the host cell but it is interesting to note that GRA14, a protein known to be involved in NTN formation, has a putative RRLxx motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rome et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We also show that trafficking of proteins that lack discernable TEXEL motifs are affected by deletion of <italic>ASP5.</italic> We show that mitochondrial recruitment, which depends on the dense granule protein MAF1, is reduced in parasites lacking <italic>ASP5.</italic> We also show that ASP5 is essential for the export of GRA24, an effector that promotes sustained MAPK signaling within the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2013</xref>). Some <italic>Plasmodium</italic> exported proteins do not have a PEXEL motif and instead rely on a transmembrane domain and other unknown factors for translocation through the PTEX translocon. These PEXEL-negative exported proteins (PNEPs) include the major virulence protein PfEMP1 and several proteins required for the transport of this large molecule to its final destination on the erythrocyte surface for cytoadherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rug et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sleebs et al., 2014b</xref>). The export of PfEMP1 is also dependent on several PEXEL-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maier et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rug et al., 2014</xref>) as well as PMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sleebs et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, our current hypothesis is that trafficking of GRA24, MAF1 and potentially other TEXEL-negative proteins rely on one or more TEXEL-containing proteins.</p><p>To understand the importance of ASP5-dependent export pathways on inducing transcriptional changes within the host cell we performed RNA-seq experiments and analyzed differences in up- and down-regulated genes induced by infection with wild type or ∆<italic>asp5</italic> parasites. We found that loss of ASP5 results in a global reduction in the magnitude of host cell transcriptional changes in response to parasite infection. By interrogating the biological processes and molecular functions of genes that are influenced by ASP5, it is evident that this protease plays an important role in influencing the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, nucleic acid metabolism, autophagy, peroxisome fusion, vacuole organization, cell differentiation, signaling processes and proteins that bind DNA and chromatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). While GRA16 has been implicated in cell cycle progression and GRA24 influences transcription factor expression, there are as yet no known effectors that influence the other characterized biological processes. It is clear that understanding how <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> influences these in the infected cell is an important step. Furthermore, profiling the transcriptional changes that occur in other cell types that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is known to infect, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, myocytes and neurons, and the ability to determine the influence of ASP5-dependent pathways on these changes is now imminently achievable.</p><p>It is noteworthy that ASP5 could be deleted from the genome of <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> demonstrating that this enzyme in not essential, unlike PMV, which cannot be genetically deleted using conventional approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boddey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klemba and Goldberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Russo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sleebs et al., 2014b</xref>). This may be due to the different target host cells of these parasites, with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infecting terminally differentiated erythrocytes that require extensive remodeling by exported proteins to sustain parasite development, in contrast to <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> which infects nucleated, dynamic host cells. However, <italic>Δasp5</italic> parasites displayed a growth defect, demonstrating that this enzyme is important for the lytic cycle of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, in some unknown capacity, at least within HFFs and MEFs.</p><p>Whilst ASP5-deficient lines appeared to replicate at a similar rate to wild type tachyzoites, our mouse studies suggest that this enzyme is an important virulence factor. Indeed, we show significant attenuation in mice infected with ~50 live ASP5-deficient tachyzoites, with one mouse surviving beyond 15 days post infection. Furthermore, we show that injection of ~15 live ASP5-deficient tachyzoites is non-lethal to mice and confers protective immunity to lethal challenge. This is in contrast to wild-type RH, which typically show an LD<sub>100</sub> of 1 parasite. Our data show that ASP5 is important for many cellular and transcriptional changes to the infected host cell and, therefore, this strongly suggests that collectively these changes, even in the highly virulent RH background, are important for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> virulence in vivo.</p><p>The identification of the TEXEL motif and its cleavage by ASP5 provides valuable new insights into the mechanism of host cell modification by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. We demonstrate similarities and important differences between this process and the analogous pathway in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. Our work therefore poses new questions as to the functions and mechanisms of protein export between these two parasites as well as other Apicomplexan species of agricultural and medical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Host cell and parasite cultures and transfection</title><p>All <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites used in this study are of the ‘type I’ RH background, either RHΔ<italic>hxgprt (Δhx</italic>), or RHΔ<italic>ku80 (Δku80</italic>).

Additionally, genes with no official symbol in the NCBI gene information file were removed. Following filtering, 15,018 genes remained for the downstream analysis. Compositional differences between samples were normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). All counts were then transformed to log2-counts per million (logCPM) with associated precision weights using voom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Law et al., 2014</xref>). Differential expression for the three comparisons, WT infected versus uninfected, <italic>Δasp5</italic> infected versus uninfected, and <italic>Δasp5</italic> infected versus WT infected, was assessed using empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smyth, 2004</xref>). Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they attained a false discovery rate of 0.05. Gene ontology analysis used the goana function. Shrunk log2-fold-changes for plotting were computed using edgeR’s predFC function with prior count set to 3. The barcode plot was drawn with limma’s barcodeplot function and the correlation of the <italic>Δgra16</italic> gene sets with the RNA-seq data was evaluated using a directional roast gene set test with 10,000 rotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). This data has been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE73986.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Virulence studies</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with regulations outlined by The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute’s Animal Ethics Committee. Wild-type (RHΔ<italic>hxgprt</italic>), Δ<italic>asp5</italic><sub>CRISPR</sub> and Δ<italic>asp5</italic><sub>CRISPR</sub>:ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub> parasites were grown in HFFs, harvested, and counted. Doses were either 100 tachyzoites in 200 μL of PBS (determined by plaque assay to be 15 ± 3 tachyzoites) or 200 parasites in 200 μL PBS (~50 live parasites). All tachyzoites were intraperitoneally injected into 6 × 6–8-week -old C57BL/6 mice. Mice were monitored daily and sacrificed when determined moribund. Sero-conversion was monitored by using serum collected from mice at 14 days post infection and used in Western blot (1:500 dilution) against purified tachyzoites and uninfected HFF lysates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the expert help of Liana Mackiewicz, Carolina Alvarado and Lisa Reid from WEHI Bioservices and Stephen Wilcox from the Ian Potter Centre for Genomics and Personalised Medicine at WEHI.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This paper reports the identification in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> of the resident Golgi protease ASP5 that appears to be necessary for trafficking and secretion of a large number of dense granule proteins of diverse function. The work spans the spectrum from molecular characterization of the requirements for ASP5 activity to studying its impact on well-characterized effectors that manipulate the host cell. Overall, your study is well performed, timely, and important. Although the Bougdour group just published related work earlier this month, your manuscript contains additional important data that significantly deepen our understanding of ASP5. However, there are several critical points that need to be addressed during revision.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) It is essential that murine virulence studies are performed to demonstrate unequivocally that dense granule secretion is important to virulence, since it is not essential for in vitro growth. If ASP5 is required for the secretion of multiple effectors and/or a large number of changes in gene expression in the host, one might expect a dramatic difference in vivo (and the plaque growth phenotype, if confirmed in multiple ASP5 mutants and reverted after complementation, would also predict a significant deficiency in vivo). While RH is not the best system in which to study this, slight alterations in pathogenesis can be detected in the form of reduced time to death and/or reduced morbidity (weight loss, parasite burden). Given that the strains are in hand, it should not be difficult to carry out these experiments.</p> <p>2) Many of the differences seen with the RNA-seq data could simply be due to differences in parasite growth rate. If this cannot be resolved, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> should be removed. Also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> is very difficult to follow as it is described. Could it be displayed in a simpler fashion or clarified? From the start the labels are confusing, how it is displayed and explained needs to be improved.</p> <p>3) Subheading “ASP5 modeling reveals key interactions with the TEXEL of GRA16”: The ligand docking studies are interesting but are still based on a threading model rather than a solved structure for ASP5. Therefore it is important that more control experiments are performed using a variety of peptides, showing that RRLAE and RTLAE bind differently. This is interesting, but what about RRL, that is, what is the effect of mutating only residues predicted to be unimportant?</p> <p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and text: Please demonstrate that rescue of the growth phenotype can be rescued by complementation. This seems to be important to ensure that the phenotype is really associated with <italic>asp5</italic> and not off-target effects of other plasmid insertions or CRISPR. Does the second mutant (discussed later in the manuscript) also make smaller plaques? Additionally, what is the impact of ASP5 deletion during infections in mice?</p> <p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and text associated with it: While the IFA suggests that there is residual c-myc nuclear translocation in ASP5 mutant parasites, we would like to see a protein blot from uninfected cells as well. Without it one cannot say that it was &quot;induced&quot; as is mentioned in the text. Also the word &quot;drastically&quot; in the figure legend is not quantitative. Please also discuss the doublet band in wild type and putative cross-reactive protein in the MYR 1 blots in the text in addition to the figure legend.</p> <p>6) Subheading “ASP5 influences host mitochondrial recruitment to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane”: It seems you quantified the numbers of dense granules or assessed Golgi ultrastructure in a quantitative way; this should be reported. If not, then this statement should be qualified or removed.</p></body> </sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10809.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>1) It is essential that murine virulence studies are performed to demonstrate unequivocally that dense granule secretion is important to virulence, since it is not essential for in vitro growth.

We injected 100 wildtype, <italic>△asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic> and <italic>△asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic>:ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub> into groups of four C57BL/6 mice. The viable effective dose was found to be 15 ± 3 tachyzoites by plaque assay. Strikingly, all mice infected with wildtype and <italic>△asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic>:ASP5<sub>WT</sub>-HA<sub>3</sub> (complemented line) succumbed to infection by day 8 whilst mice infected with <italic>△asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic> all survived to the completion (day 20) of the experiment. Surviving animals were monitored for sero-conversion to <italic>T. gondii</italic> by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is a profound attenuation in virulence for the hypervirulent RH strain.</p> <p><italic>2) Many of the differences seen with the RNA-seq data could simply be due to differences in parasite growth rate.

In doing this we could see only very small changes in replication rates between lines. This shows that replication rate is highly unlikely to be the cause of the profound changes in the transcriptional pattern of host cells induced by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lines. As such, we have opted to retain the RNA-seq data in the manuscript.</p> <p><italic>3) Subheading “ASP5 modeling reveals key interactions with the TEXEL of GRA16”: The ligand docking studies are interesting but are still based on a threading model rather than a solved structure for ASP5. Therefore it is important that more control experiments are performed using a variety of peptides, showing that RRLAE and RTLAE bind differently. This is interesting, but what about RRL, that is, what is the effect of mutating only residues predicted to be unimportant?</italic></p> <p>More controls have now been undertaken in this analysis. In addition to mutating the RR residues in the TEXEL, of GRA16, we have now explored the consequence of mutating the remaining residues, LAE, on binding to ASP5 in the dynamic model. Mutation of leucine to valine (L&gt;V) reduces the calculated binding energy by 6 kJ/mol, in line with this residue playing an important role in processing. However mutation of the fourth TEXEL residue, alanine to valine (A&gt;V) had almost no effect on binding energy in agreement with a lack of sensitivity at this position. Finally, mutation of glutamine at position five of the TEXEL to alanine (E&gt;A) had caused an 11 kJ/mol reduction in binding affinity, in contrast to the increase in ASP5 activity observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is possible that the glutamine reside at position 6 (i.e. RRLAEE) can act as a surrogate for the loss of glutamine at position 5 in this interaction. These data have now been discussed in the text (paragraph three, subheading “ASP5 modeling reveals key interactions with the TEXEL of GRA16”) and are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The text has also been updated to reflect these additional experiments.</p> <p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and text: Please demonstrate that rescue of the growth phenotype can be rescued by complementation.

Does the second mutant (discussed later in the manuscript) also make smaller plaques? Additionally, what is the impact of ASP5 deletion during infections in mice?</italic></p> <p>This has now been performed and added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-ii</xref>. <italic>△asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic>, like <italic>△ku80△asp5</italic>, also makes smaller plaques which is rescued upon complementation with ASP5. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> we also show that the replication rate of the <italic>△asp5<sub>CRISPR</sub></italic> parasites is not the cause of the reduced plaque size.</p> <p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and text associated with it: While the IFA suggests that there is residual c-myc nuclear translocation in ASP5 mutant parasites, we would like to see a protein blot from uninfected cells as well. Without it one cannot say that it was &quot;induced&quot; as is mentioned in the text. Also the word &quot;drastically&quot; in the figure legend is not quantitative (and words like this are always open to interpretation). Please also discuss the doublet band in wild type and putative cross-reactive protein in the MYR 1 blots in the text in addition to the figure legend.</italic> </p> <p>We have repeated the c-myc IFAs and quantitated their signal using confocal imaging. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). You can now clearly see that uninfected cells do not express c-myc, whereas cells infected with wild type parasites do. This reflects the previous work by Franco et al., 2014, Eukaryotic Cell, which shows that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> upregulates c-myc in the host cell. We furthermore show that we see c-myc induction is lost upon deletion of ASP5. It is also important to mention that the induction of c-Myc by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites has been extensively studied previously and reported in Franco et al., 2014, Eukaryotic Cell, which we cite throughout the appropriate section.</p> <p>We have also removed the word ‘drastically’ and have now referred to the doublet within the text.</p> <p><italic>6) Subheading “ASP5 influences host mitochondrial recruitment to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane”: It seems you quantified the numbers of dense granules or assessed Golgi ultrastructure in a quantitative way; this should be reported. If not, then this statement should be qualified or removed.</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this confusing wording.
