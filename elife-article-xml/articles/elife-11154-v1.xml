There has been remarkable evolutionary adaptation of this machine through the addition of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins whose individual effects on ribosome function are largely unknown.

Molecules called messenger RNAs (or mRNAs), which contain genetic information derived from the DNA of a gene, pass through ribosomes that then “translate” that information to build proteins. Although all living cells contain ribosomes, the protein building blocks that make up the structure of the ribosome are not the same in all species. Furthermore, the exact roles that each building block plays during translation are not known.</p><p>The ribosomes of plants, animals, and budding yeast contain the same protein, known as Asc1 in budding yeast and RACK1 in plants and animals. Thompson et al. have now explored the role of Asc1 in yeast cells by measuring translation in the absence of Asc1 using a technique called ribosome footprint profiling. This analysis revealed that cells lacking Asc1 translate fewer short mRNA molecules than normal cells. Short mRNAs encode small proteins that tend to play important ‘housekeeping’ roles in the cell — by forming the structural building blocks of ribosomes, for example.</p><p>It has been observed previously that short mRNAs are translated at a higher rate than longer mRNAs on average, although the reasons behind this bias are still mysterious. The findings of Thompson et al. suggest that the ribosome itself may discriminate between short and long mRNAs and that the Asc1 protein is involved in calibrating the ribosome’s preference for short mRNAs.</p><p>Cells need differing amounts of small proteins in different growth conditions. It will therefore be interesting to investigate whether mRNA length discrimination can be regulated by Asc1 and/or other components of the ribosome to tune gene expression to the environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11154.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11154.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>Asc1</kwd><kwd>RACK1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM094303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Mary Katherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Rojas-Duran</surname><given-names>Maria Fernanda</given-names></name><name><surname>Gangaramani</surname><given-names>Paritosh</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Wendy V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Mary Katherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Gangaramani</surname><given-names>Paritosh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Asc1/RACK1 promotes the translation of mRNAs associated with the translational closed loop complex, which have short open reading frames and encode proteins required for core metabolic processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosomes are universal protein-synthesizing machines that are highly conserved in their structure and function throughout all kingdoms of life. However, each domain of life has evolved unique ribosomal proteins that are added to the conserved core. The fundamental tasks of ribosomes — deciphering the genetic code and synthesizing peptide bonds — are the same in all organisms, so the functions of these ‘extra’ ribosomal proteins are intriguing, yet almost entirely unknown.</p><p>Eukaryotic ribosomes contain 13 domain-specific proteins that may play roles in translation initiation, which is both more complicated and more highly regulated in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ban et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Recruitment of prokaryotic ribosomes to mRNAs requires only three initiation factors, IF1, 2, and 3, and relies on base-pairing between the RNA of the small ribosomal subunit and the anti-Shine-Delgarno sequence of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boelens and Gualerzi, 2002</xref>). In contrast, translation initiation in eukaryotes requires at least 12 initiation factors and proceeds by a complex series of steps beginning with recognition of the mRNA 5′ cap structure, followed by unwinding of mRNA secondary structure, recruitment of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, scanning, recognition of the initiation codon, and finally, joining of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit to form a functional ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitken and Lorsch, 2012</xref>). Although the eukaryotic ribosome is generally considered to be a passive player during canonical initiation, several of its proteins have been implicated in mRNA recruitment. For example, RPL38 is required for the translation of the Hox body-patterning genes during embryonic development, allowing spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression through translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>). Other proteins including RPS25, RPL40, and RACK1 are essential for the translation of viral mRNAs that are recruited to the ribosome via alternative initiation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Landry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Majzoub et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The eukaryote-specific ribosomal protein RACK1 is a WD40-repeat β-propeller protein that binds the solvent-exposed face of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel, in close proximity to proteins that contact the mRNA during translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pisarev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sengupta et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to its function as a core ribosomal protein, in mammalian cells, RACK1 has been found in complex with several proteins involved in signal transduction including protein kinase C, Src kinase, and cAMP phosphodiesterase, among many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>). The location of RACK1 on the ribosome together with its interactions with signaling proteins suggests a possible role in conveying stimulus-dependent information to the translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nilsson et al., 2004</xref>). However, signaling pathways in yeast and human have diverged significantly compared to genes required for ribosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stuart et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that RACK1 might have another, more conserved function during translation.</p><p>Loss of RACK1 causes widespread and pleiotropic defects in many organisms. Deletion of the <italic>RACK1</italic> homolog in budding yeast, <italic>ASC1</italic>, leads to slow growth, loss of invasive growth, loss of cell wall integrity, and decreased 60S subunit levels, among many described effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melamed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valerius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoshikawa et al., 2011</xref>). In metazoans, RACK1 is required for cell migration, neural tube closure, and control of post-synaptic excitation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiely et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wehner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yaka et al., 2002</xref>). These cellular functions may explain why homozygous <italic>RACK1</italic> loss-of-function mutations cause early developmental lethality in mouse and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kadrmas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Volta et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is not known whether and how the effects of RACK1 on ribosome function contribute to the myriad cellular and organismal phenotypes observed in <italic>RACK1/ASC1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we have examined the translational functions of Asc1/RACK1 genome-wide by ribosome footprint profiling in yeast <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants. We show that Asc1 is required for the efficient translation of short mRNAs, including those encoding cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This requirement is specific as deletion of other ribosomal proteins does not cause similar translation defects. Using translational reporters we demonstrate that length per se determines translational sensitivity to Asc1, thus confirming a role for Asc1 in the translational privileging of short mRNAs, which is a dominant trend in genome-wide translational efficiency data from diverse eukaryotes. Remarkably, mRNA enrichment with proteins that mediate the formation of a ‘closed loop’ during translation — eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1 — is strongly biased towards short mRNAs and predicts Asc1-sensitivity, suggesting a role for Asc1 in closed-loop-dependent ribosome recruitment. Consistent with this prediction, we find that depletion of the central closed loop factor eIF4G mimics the translational effects of mutating <italic>ASC1</italic>. Finally, we show that loss of <italic>ASC1</italic> reduces mitochondrial translation and renders cells unable to use alternative carbon sources that require enhanced mitochondrial function, demonstrating the functional significance of translational perturbation in <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants. Together, our results reveal a role for Asc1 in the enhanced translation of short mRNAs and establish a direct connection between gene-specific effects of Asc1 on translation and defects in cellular physiology. Furthermore, because mitochondria are essential for energy generation and regulation of many cellular networks, our results suggest that the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with the Asc1/RACK1 protein should be re-examined in the context of mitochondrial health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of the Asc1 protein perturbs global translation</title><p>The <italic>ASC1</italic> locus encodes two distinct gene products — the Asc1 protein and an intronic small nucleolar RNA, snR24. Because snR24 directs 2′-O-methylation of 25S rRNA at positions C1437, C1449, and C1450, some of the reported phenotypes of <italic>ASC1</italic> null mutants (<italic>asc1Δ</italic>) could be due to effects of deleting <italic>SNR24</italic> on ribosome biogenesis or function. In addition, Asc1/RACK1 may have functions off the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coyle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</xref>). We therefore created an allelic series of yeast mutants with altered Asc1 function to enable direct comparison of cellular and translational effects of Asc1/RACK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We created protein null alleles by mutating a codon early in the <italic>ASC1</italic> ORF to a stop codon (<italic>asc1-M1X</italic> and <italic>asc1-E5X</italic>, where X denotes a stop codon), which abolished Asc1 protein expression but maintained wild type levels of <italic>SNR24</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Although bulk polysomes appeared normal in these strains, both <italic>asc1∆</italic> and <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> showed reduced levels of free 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This slight discrepancy between our results and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2009</xref>) may stem from differences in strain backgrounds because the Sigma1278b strain used here has higher free 60S subunit levels than S288C.

These findings suggest that either Asc1 primarily affects translation from a location off the ribosome, or that the ribosome-binding assay underestimates the extent of in vivo association of the D109Y and DE mutant proteins because ribosome-bound factors can dissociate during ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Valásek et al., 2007</xref>).

ORF length was slightly more predictive of wild type translation efficiency than transcript length, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>, partial correlation r=-0.09 (p=10<sup>–8</sup>) vs. r=0.03 (p=10<sup>–1</sup>)). For simplicity, and because transcript boundary annotations are not available for all yeast genes, we have used the ORF length metric in subsequent analyses.</p><p>To test whether length per se, and not some other feature common to short mRNAs, is responsible for Asc1-sensitive translation, we generated two constructs with identical regulatory regions (promoter, 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR) that differed only in the length of the ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These ORF length reporters contain either one or eight repeats of the I27 domain from the human cardiac protein titin, which has been used extensively in studies of protein folding because the small globular domains fold and unfold independently of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann and Dougan, 2012</xref>). This modular architecture allows the construction of proteins of different lengths that resemble linear chains and minimizes the potential for differential protein folding or stability to impact the abundance of the reporter proteins. We performed quantitative Western blotting by fluorescent detection of a common C-terminal epitope tag in combination with qRT-PCR measurements of mRNA levels to determine the translational efficiency (protein/mRNA) of each construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Remarkably, the translational efficiency of the short ORF (~300 nt) was two-fold lower in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant compared to the long ORF (~2400 nt) (p=0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together with the genome-wide trend, these reporter results demonstrate a role for Asc1 in the translational advantage of short mRNAs. Given that ORF length is strongly anti-correlated with translational efficiency in diverse eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>, data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stadler and Fire, 2011</xref>), this function of Asc1/RACK1 may be conserved.</p><p>How might short ORFs be translationally privileged and sensitive to loss of Asc1? Asc1’s position near the mRNA exit channel places it in close proximity to translation initiation factors that interact with the 5′ end of the mRNA during initiation, including eIF3 and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kouba et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, note that the structure shown is the mammalian ribosome, for which structural information regarding the orientation of eIF3 and eIF4G has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siridechadilok et al., 2005</xref>]). eIF4G has a well-characterized role in promoting a circularized form of the mRNA in which the 5′ and 3′ regions of the mRNA are bundled together via the interaction between the eIF4G protein, associated with the mRNA 5’ cap through the eIF4F complex, and Pab1, an RNA-binding protein that binds the poly(A) tail. The mRNA in this conformation is known as the closed loop, and closed loop formation is thought to enhance translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kahvejian et al., 2001</xref>). We hypothesized that mRNAs with short ORFs might form closed loop structures more efficiently than mRNAs with longer ORFs, and that Asc1 could promote the function of the closed loop in translation.</p><p>According to this model, mRNAs with short ORFs should be more highly associated with the closed loop factors — eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1 — than other mRNAs. To test this prediction, we analyzed data quantifying the association of specific mRNAs with the closed loop factors and the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) by RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costello et al., 2015</xref>). We grouped mRNAs into ‘closed loop’, ‘strong closed loop’, and ‘other’ categories based on the following enrichment profiles: ‘Strong closed loop’ mRNAs are enriched in immunoprecipitations of eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1, and de-enriched in immunoprecipitations of the 4E-BPs, which should not be associated with mRNAs in closed loops because 4E-BPs and eIF4G compete for binding to eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haghighat et al., 1995</xref>). ‘Closed loop’ mRNAs have similar enrichment profiles to ‘strong closed loop’ mRNAs, but are not de-enriched for association with the 4E-BPs. Remarkably, we found that both ‘closed loop’ and ‘strong closed loop’ mRNAs were dramatically shorter than other mRNAs (median ORF lengths= 489, 774, and 1694 nt for ‘strong closed loop’, ‘closed loop’, and ‘other’ mRNAs, respectively). This association between ORF length and closed loop association was observed regardless of whether mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Thus, although ~30% of the ‘strong closed loop’ mRNAs encode ribosomal proteins, a specialized mechanism for enhancing the translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs cannot explain the ORF length bias of the ‘strong closed loop’ group. This discovery — that closed-loop-associated mRNAs are much shorter than other mRNAs — provides a plausible biochemical explanation for the preference for higher translation efficiency of mRNAs with short ORFs observed here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arava et al., 2003</xref>). Remarkably, loss of Asc1 or eIF4G depletion (data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2011</xref>) similarly decreased the translation of closed-loop-associated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>).</p><p>Although ORF length, closed loop enrichment, and ∆TE in <italic>ASC1</italic> and <italic>eIF4G</italic> mutants are correlated, some longer RNAs are strongly associated with the closed loop and require Asc1 for efficient translation while some short mRNAs are neither enriched with closed loop factors nor particularly dependent on Asc1 for their translation. Accounting for the global relationship between ORF length and ∆TE by linear regression showed that closed loop association has additional explanatory power for translational sensitivity to Asc1 and eIF4G: the observed reductions in translation efficiency for closed-loop-enriched mRNAs were significantly more than would be expected if ORF length alone determined their translation efficiencies (p=10<sup>–14</sup> and 10<sup>–30</sup> for ‘closed loop’ and ‘strong closed loop’ groups, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). These results suggest that Asc1 is important for closed loop formation and/or stability or for closed-loop-dependent ribosome recruitment, a process that is apparently biased towards short ORFs.</p><p>What are the potential consequences of impairing translation of short mRNAs? Using gene ontology analysis, we found that transcripts annotated to the category ‘ribosomal subunit’ had significantly decreased TE in the <italic>ASC1</italic> null mutants (<italic>asc1-M1X</italic>, p=10<sup>–35</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). This category is composed of short mRNAs encoding both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (RPs, MRPs), which both displayed ~20% decreased TE in <italic>ASC1</italic> null mutants (<italic>asc1-M1X</italic>, p=10<sup>–37</sup> and p=10<sup>–10</sup>; <italic>asc1∆</italic>, p=10<sup>–35</sup> and p=10<sup>–10</sup>, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As the median RP and MRP ORF lengths are 434 and 716 nt, respectively, their translational defects are within the range predicted by their length.

If decreases in translation efficiency were caused by defects in no-go decay stabilizing mRNAs, thus inflating the denominator in the footprint RNA/total RNA calculation, then the levels of affected mRNAs should increase in the total RNA pool. However, the overall trend was for the levels of total mRNA for genes with decreased TE in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant to go down or remain constant rather than increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The translational defects of <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants are not a general consequence of perturbing the ribosome</title><p>The mRNAs that are sensitive to the loss of Asc1 are among the most efficiently translated in a cell.

Thus pervasive, moderate impairment of MRP translation is associated with substantial defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis.</p><p>Given the severe growth defects of the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant in glycerol, we wondered whether the moderate impairment of MRP translation observed in glucose would worsen under conditions of increased MRP expression. Adaptation to growth in non-fermentable carbon sources or low glucose is accompanied by a rewiring of the transcriptional network in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galdieri et al., 2010</xref>) and widespread reprogramming of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaidyanathan et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether the glycerol growth defect of <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> is linked to inadequate translational adaptation, we examined translation genome-wide 6 hr after transfer from glucose to glycerol, a point just before the resumption of rapid growth in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and coincident with the recovery of polysomes after the initial collapse upon glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant, polysomes recovered only partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, the ribosome-associated pool was strongly depleted of MRP mRNAs compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the magnitude of translational defect (ΔTE) for this class of mRNAs was similar in both glucose and glycerol, supporting a constitutive rather than regulatory role for Asc1 in translation of MRP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The fact that <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> shows a bulk translation defect in glycerol but not in glucose may reflect the fact that MRP mRNAs make up a larger portion of the translatome in glycerol. Thus, the cellular context is an important factor in determining the phenotypic consequences of translational perturbations in <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> and likely in other ribosomal protein mutants as well. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for Asc1 in supporting cellular respiration by promoting synthesis of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have demonstrated that the eukaryote-specific ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of short mRNAs, a category that includes functionally related groups of genes required for vital cellular processes (e.g. cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins). A correlation between ORF length and translation efficiency or ribosome density has been observed since the advent of genome-wide translation profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arava et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) and we observed this relationship in data collected from diverse eukaryotes including yeast, nematodes, mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stadler and Fire, 2011</xref>). To account for this trend, it was proposed that the rate of translation initiation is higher for short ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arava et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shah et al., 2013</xref>), but the mechanism(s) underlying length-dependent initiation rate differences were unknown.</p><p>It has been suggested that the increased probability of mRNA circularization by diffusion could make initiation more efficient on short mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Our results add an additional nuance to these physical models — the presence of a ribosome-dependent regulatory mechanism that specifically enhances the translation of short mRNAs by promoting the formation and/or function of the closed loop. Our analyses reveal a clear trend that short mRNAs preferentially associate with closed loop factors in vivo, and consistent with these observations, short mRNAs form more stable closed loop complexes than longer mRNAs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amrani et al., 2008</xref>). A challenge for the future will be to determine how the mRNA, the closed loop factors, and the ribosome cooperate to privilege the translation of short mRNAs.</p><p>How might Asc1/RACK1 promote closed loop formation? RACK1’s placement on the solvent exposed side of the head of the small subunit puts it in close proximity to the mRNA exit channel, in a position with the potential to interact with the mRNA-bound closed loop factors during initiation. Intriguingly, eIF4G co-purifies with Asc1 from yeast lysates under stringent conditions in which most other initiation factors do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gavin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2006</xref>), suggesting that Asc1 may interact directly with the closed loop via eIF4G. Our results also raise the possibility that translation of many mRNAs could be co-regulated by mechanism(s) that target Asc1/RACK1’s function in closed-loop-dependent initiation. Moving forward, it will be important to determine how the many signaling pathways that have been linked to Asc1/RACK1 impact the translation of closed-loop-dependent mRNAs.</p><p>More generally, our study highlights the fact that individual ribosomal proteins can contribute to efficient translation of subsets of mRNAs with important consequences for cellular physiology. In particular we show that loss of the non-essential ribosomal protein Asc1/RACK1 causes a concerted decrease in MRP expression that leads to mitochondrial insufficiency. Given the central role of mitochondria in energy and metabolite production in eukaryotic cells, it is not surprising that mitochondrial defects elicit pleiotropic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo and Mootha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fleming et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kushnir et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shoffner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>). In light of our findings, many of Asc1/RACK1’s ascribed cellular functions should be re-evaluated for potential connections to mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, it is intriguing that several distinct mutations in human ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors result in anemia, the cause of which is currently the source of much debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narla et al., 2011</xref>).

The <italic>asc1-DE</italic> and matched WT libraries were constructed using an earlier version of the protocol that used Microcon YM-100 (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) filters to enrich for small RNA fragments, poly(A) tailing to capture the small RNA fragments, and downstream library construction steps as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). For all other libraries, we ligated a pre-adenylated 3’ adaptor (5Phos/TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG/3ddC/) to the fragments using T4 RNA Ligase 1 (NEB). First strand synthesis was performed with Superscript III (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) or AMV (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) using primer OJA225 (/5Phos/GATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCTGAACCTGTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT/iSp18/CACTCA/iSp18/GCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA). cDNA was amplified using primer oNTI230 (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA) and (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATXXXXXXGTGACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA), where XXXXXX denotes a six nucleotide barcode used to distinguish samples run in the same lane. Samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument or an Illumnina GAIIx.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted using the hot acid phenol method. RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Life Technologies). First strand synthesis was performed with AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) using an anchored oligo-dT primer (for coding transcripts) or a random hexamer primer (for <italic>SNR24</italic>). Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Fast reagents (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, Massachusetts) using a Lightcycler 480 (Roche, Switzerland). Gene-specific primer sequences are: ACT1: (TTCTGAGGTTGCTGCTTTGG, CTTGGTGTCTTGGTCTACCG), ASC1: (ATGTTTGGCCACTTTGTTGG, GTTACCGGCAGAAATGATGG), MRP2: (AATAGGTGCGTGGACTCTGG, CTGGCAAATTACCCTTCAGAGC), SNR24: (TTGCTACTTCAGATGGAACTTTG, TCAGAGATCTTGGTGATAATTGG), V5: (AGATCTTCCGGAGGCGGG, GGATCTATTACGTAGAATCGAGACC), YML6: (AGAGTAGGCGCCTCAAATCC, TTGGAGAGTTAGCATCCCCG), 18S: (TGGCGAACCAGGACTTTTAC, CCGACCGTCCCTATTAATCAT), FLUC: ( GTACCAGAGTCCTTTGATCGTGA, ACCCAGTAGATCCAGAGGAATTC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Total protein levels were determined using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). For total Asc1 level quantification, 1 μg of total protein obtained by TCA precipitation followed by cell lysis was loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels. For polysome Westerns, the same volume of each fraction was loaded per well. Blots were overexposed to show the remaining ribosome-associated protein for the ribosome-binding mutants. Membranes were blotted with α-Asc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coyle et al., 2009</xref>) and α-Pgk1 (Life Technologies 22C5D8). After secondary antibody incubation, blots were incubated with ECL (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, United Kingdom) and exposed to X-ray film.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ORF length reporter assays</title><p>Yeast grown overnight in SC-Leu (synthetic complete media lacking leucine) were diluted to OD 0.2 in YPA + 2% galactose and grown for 8 hr before harvest. Cells were lysed in PBS pH 7.4 supplemented with protease inhibitors (1X Roche complete mini EDTA-free, 1 mM PMSF) with glass beads. Total protein was quantified by the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) and 1 ug (octamer) or 2 ug (monomer) total protein was loaded per lane with each sample loaded in 4 different lanes as technical replicates for each of three biological replicates. A standard curve encompassing 2X, 1X, 0.5X and 0.25X of the WT extract concentration was loaded on each gel. Western blotting was performed using the ECL Plex kit (GE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and blots were scanned with a Typhoon imager (FLA 9500, GE). Primary antibodies were α-Pgk1 (Life Technologies 22C5D8) and α-V5 (Sigma-Aldrich V8137). Images were quantified with ImageStudio (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska) and the values of each sample were calculated relative to the standard curve. Although all standards were in linear range (linear fit of signal vs. concentration r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.95 for all blots), we used a quadratic fit as it fit the standards slightly better. RNA was extracted from the extracts in parallel, and the mRNA levels of each reporter were quantified by qRT-PCR using primers recognizing the region encoding the V5 tag and normalized to 18S levels also determined by qRT-PCR. For each sample, a translation efficiency was calculated from the ratio of the normalized protein levels of the reporter (V5 protein/Pgk1 protein) to the normalized mRNA levels of the reporter (V5 mRNA/18S rRNA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mitochondrial translation</title><p>Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funes and Herrmann, 2007</xref>). In brief, cells were grown overnight in SC-Met (with glucose) to OD 0.4 then transferred to SC-Met with glycerol for 3 hr. Equal OD units of cells were then incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (EasyTag L-[35S]-Methionine, PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts) and cycloheximide to inhibit cytoplasmic protein synthesis. After 30 min, total protein synthesis was halted by the addition of puromycin. TCA-precipitated protein was visualized by Coomassie staining (total protein normalization) and autoradiography on a Typhoon imager (mitochondrial proteins). Total protein in each sample was quantified with ImageJ using Coomassie signal across the whole lane. Six bands corresponding to mitochondrial translation products were quantified with ImageQuant (GE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Read mapping and positional alignment</title><p>Yeast reads were aligned to the Sigma1278b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dowell et al., 2010</xref>) genome downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database on June 29, 2014. We used Tophat to map first to annotated splice junctions and then to the genome. We used only uniquely-mapping reads for all downstream analyses. Because ribosome footprint reads generally start 12 nt upstream of start codons and end 18 nt upstream of stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>), we used only reads mapping within these boundaries. Additionally, to avoid potential variability that can be present at the 5’ end of mRNAs, we excluded the first 30 codons from counting for quantification of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>For comparisons between libraries, we used normalized values obtained from running count data through the DE-Seq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) because RPKM values are strongly biased by the transcript lengths of the RNA pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). For gene expression measurements, we only included genes for which there were at least 128 mapping reads total among the libraries used for the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>).

We then took the residuals from this correlation (i.e. the part of ∆TE that cannot be accounted for by the global correlation between ∆TE and ORF length) and plotted these values among the ‘strong closed loop’, ‘closed loop’ and ‘other’ mRNAs, as shown by the dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>. Note that this analysis assumes linear relationships between ∆TE and ORF length. These results demonstrate that the decrease in translation efficiency of the ‘closed loop’ mRNAs in <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> is more than would be expected if ∆TE was determined entirely by ORF length, thus suggesting that ‘closed loop’ enrichment may be more important. However, as with all correlative analyses, the results cannot assign causality.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of TE in other organisms</title><p>For correlations of TE with ORF length shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, processed data files were downloaded from NCBI GEO and used to calculate TE.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Asc1/RACK1 is required for efficient translation of short mRNAs&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Allan Hinnebusch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Leos Valasek.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your paper has been reviewed by three experts in the field and the general consensus is that it is potentially suitable for publication pending the outcome of additional analyses and revisions.</p><p>One key issue concerns the view that there is inadequate analysis of protein synthesis from native genes or reporters to back up the claim that translation of short mRNAs with a heightened propensity to form the closed-loop is particularly sensitive to elimination of Asc1. The one reporter you analyzed where the coding sequence length was varied systematically was considered a creative approach, but the results obtained were not very compelling. Suggestions were offered for a different kind of reporter analysis, where a native long mRNA would be systematically shortened, and to examine protein synthesis of a panel of native mRNAs representing Asc1-dependent versus independent genes to confirm the interpretations of the ribosome-profiling data for authentic mRNAs. You could extend the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> to include additional Asc1-dependent mRNAs, and also include Asc1 independent mRNAs, but it might be difficult to detect changes in polysome distribution for short mRNAs, in which case measurements of protein and mRNA synthesis or reporter expression would be required. I recall that in our paper on eIF4G depletion (Park et al), which you used creatively in your analysis, we validated a number of mRNAs as being eIF4G-dependent or -independent, and perhaps some of these mRNAs that are short and enriched for both eIF4G and PABP occupancy could be analyzed in your strains to achieve stronger validation of your ribosome profiling data.</p><p>Another important issue was whether you have effectively untangled the contributions of mRNA length and propensity to form the closed loop as determinants of Asc1-dependence using bioinformatics and statistical analysis. There was general agreement among the reviewers during the consultation session that you should attempt to bolster your model by showing that an existing eIF4G mutation known to disrupt the closed loop mRNP would dampen the effects of eliminating Asc1 on translational efficiency of Asc1-dependent mRNAs or reporters. As these eIF4G mutations were made in the S288C background, such experiments would also address a concern that your study employed the Sigma background, which is rarely employed in studies on gene expression. A related point is that, without demonstrating that elimination of at least one other 40S protein in the vicinity of Asc1 on the solvent-exposed surface of the 40S subunit does not have the same effects on TE you observed on elimination of Asc1, it is dangerous to conclude that Asc1 is specifically dedicated to this regulatory function.</p><p>There was also agreement that it is necessary to measure mitochondrial protein synthesis and show that it is reduced in cells lacking Asc1 rather than relying on growth assays in nonfermentable carbon sources. And one of the reviewers is concerned that your conclusion that Asc1 is required for normal 60S biogenesis is at odds with other careful work done previously that ruled out this possibility, and feels that your measurements of 40S:60S subunit ratios from the polysome profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> do not represent the most rigorous approach to establishing this point. I think it is important to carefully consider these criticisms to avoid &quot;muddying the waters&quot; concerning the involvement of Asc1 in ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Another of the reviewers was justifiably concerned that you may have overlooked the effects of deleting Asc1 on &quot;no-go&quot; decay and that defects in this pathway and attendant changes in progression of stalled ribosomes on no-go substrates, or changes in mRNA levels, could be influencing conclusions about alterations of translational efficiency. It is important to consider this possibility and more fully document the effects of eliminating Asc1 on mRNA levels and the extent to which changes in TE might be driven by defects in no-go decay.</p><p>Finally, there were some issues with a lack of adequate descriptions of procedures and bioinformatics analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper shows convincingly that elimination of Asc1 alters the translational efficiency of a substantial fraction of the yeast translatome with a heightened effect on short mRNAs. As short mRNAs tend to be the most efficiently translated, Asc1 is thus particularly important for the group of most highly translated mRNAs in the cell. Analysis of synthetic reporter constructs in which mRNA length was progressively increased suggests that short length per se confers an increased dependence on Asc1; however, unfortunately the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> have a lot of variance and the results are significantly different only for the longest and shortest mRNAs in the series of constructs. As it was shown previously by Jacobson that short mRNAs can more readily form the closed-loop intermediate in vitro, they attempt to explain the Asc1-dependence of short mRNAs by analyzing a published data set on eIF4G and PABP binding to yeast mRNAs and find that (in WT cells) short mRNAs are indeed enriched in the mRNA classes with high occupancies of both proteins and thus likely to form the closed-loop mRNP intermediate. These mRNAs are also particularly dependent on Asc1, but I think that this would be expected from the finding that short mRNAs are Asc1-dependent. They claim to have shown that Asc1-dependence of the &quot;strong&quot; closed-loop category can be functionally separated from the Asc1 dependence of short mRNAs, but it's not clearly explained how they accomplished this, nor whether it can be done convincingly with only bioinformatics. They conclude that Asc1 is either important for closed-loop formation, or for the enhanced translation (ribosome recruitment?) of mRNAs in the closed-loop configuration. They finish by showing that the reduced translation of short mRNAs encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins is associated with a growth defect of <italic>asc1</italic> cells in non-fermentable carbon sources where mitochondrial function is important. However, they do not show directly that mitochondrial protein synthesis is impaired in <italic>asc1</italic> cells and it seems that they cannot rule out effects on expression of other genes required for growth in nonfermentable carbon sources.</p><p>General critique:</p><p>It is quite interesting that Asc1 is found to be particularly important for efficient translation of short mRNAs and also mRNAs with strong potential for closed-loop formation, and it is noteworthy that they have discovered in previously published datasets unsuspected relationships between short mRNA length and both high closed-loop forming potential and heightened dependence on eIF4G. However, since short mRNAs are enriched for both closed-loop formation potential and for dependence on eIF4G, it isn't entirely clear whether it is length per se, ability to form the closed loop, or dependence on eIF4G that confers the greater than average requirement for Asc1 for efficient translation.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The key experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref> should be bolstered with additional replicates in an effort to increase the statistical significance of differences between the monomer vs dimer or trimer.</p><p>If that can't be accomplished, then an additional, complementary experiment could be conducted where they start with a native, long mRNA that is Asc1-independent and show that Asc1-dependence is conferred by progressive removal of coding sequences. Perhaps this could be done for an mRNA whose protein product is a scaffold comprised of multiple modular domains.</p><p>An important experiment that would test their conclusion that Asc1 is important for enhanced translation of mRNAs in the closed-loop configuration would be to examine the effect of deleting Asc1 in a previously published strain in which the PABP binding site in eIF4G1 is deleted, eliminating its ability to form the closed -loop intermediate, and eIF4G2 is deleted. (Tarun and Sachs showed in 1997 that the entire N-terminus of eIF4G1 can be deleted in a strain lacking eIF4G2 with only moderate effects on cell growth.) Their model strongly predicts that the effect of deleting Asc1 on translation of short, &quot;strong closed-loop mRNAs&quot; will be substantially dampened in this eIF4G1 mutant.</p><p>They do not show directly that mitochondrial protein synthesis is impaired in <italic>asc1</italic> cells and cannot rule out effects on expression of other genes required for growth in nonfermentable carbon sources. It seems necessary to measure mitochondrial protein synthesis directly in <italic>asc1</italic> cells, which is a feasible experiment, to justify their claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors assess the role of the ASC1/RACK protein in protein synthesis. They use the ribosome footprinting technology to address the impact of different mutants in <italic>ASC1</italic> and conclude that these mutations preferentially alter the translation of short mRNAs. I found the data interesting but oversold in places. The paper was also quite difficult to read due to a lack of technical detail in many of the methods descriptions and legends. Finally, I was not convinced that the authors had effectively shown that Asc1 affected translation directly.</p><p>The authors desperately need to provide some direct measure of protein synthesis in this paper. The ribosome footprinting pattern across mRNAs provides an approximation of translation and how this changes, but there are other reasons that ribosomes might accumulate on mRNAs (see point about no-go mRNA decay below). So claims are made about the rates of initiation and the role of Asc1 in protein synthesis without actually ever measuring the synthesis rate of any endogenous proteins directly. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the authors do measure the translation efficiency of a series of artificial engineered proteins to study the correlation between ORF length and the impact of <italic>ASC1</italic> mutation. However, they need to show the primary data here so that the impact of the mutation on protein synthesis can be directly assessed by the reader. Also in my view validation that Asc1 specifically affects the synthesis of protein from some short mRNAs relative to some longer ones is essential.</p><p>The choice of strain for this study is very strange. While the Σ1278b strain is widely used for studies into filamentous growth in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> it is quite rarely used outside this, and it has some odd characteristics that raise concerns over the generality of the results shown. As has been shown previously on a number of occasions and is now shown in the polysomes presented here, Σ1278b is very unusual in that it has abnormally high levels of free 60S subunits. The <italic>asc1</italic> null has previously been shown to decrease 60S subunit levels and again the authors reconfirm this observation. The authors state that the <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants have relatively subtle effects on protein synthesis and make statements about how subtle effects on translation as judged by polysome profiling can conceal a wider perturbation of cellular translation. It is possible that the abnormal ratio of free 40S/60S subunits in the Σ strain obviates potentially more dramatic effects of the <italic>ASC1</italic> mutation on translation. In my view the authors should really test key observations from their study in a laboratory strain of yeast that has a more standard profile of free 40S and 60S subunits. Obviously this may be an unrealistic expectation as ribosome footprinting is neither cheap nor trivial- but some attempt to generalize the data could be made and the non-standard nature of the strain and the ratio of ribosomal subunits should be commented upon.</p><p>For the polysomes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> the polysomes profiles have very high 80S peaks relative to the polysome peaks for unstressed cells, this suggests that some stress has occurred during the polysome preparation? Could this be masking the impact of the <italic>asc1</italic> mutations on polysome association?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> – I find this formaldehyde polysome analysis particularly unconvincing. The polysomes are barely visible and the pattern of the other peaks looks substantially altered. The authors claim that Asc1 is maintained across the gradient in the mutants seems inappropriate based on the data presented and based on what is in the literature.</p><p>As the authors state, Asc1 has also been shown by the Inada group to play a role in the no-go mRNA decay process. It promotes translation arrest to facilitate mRNA decay by this pathway. It is therefore possible that the alterations in ribosome density on mRNAs for <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants could be associated with this role. First, the authors do not present the genome wide transcript level datasets in detail, which they must have obtained for the <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants relative to wild type.

One key issue concerns the view that there is inadequate analysis of protein synthesis from native genes or reporters to back up the claim that translation of short mRNAs with a heightened propensity to form the closed-loop is particularly sensitive to elimination of Asc1. The one reporter you analyzed where the coding sequence length was varied systematically was considered a creative approach, but the results obtained were not very compelling. Suggestions were offered for a different kind of reporter analysis, where a native long mRNA would be systematically shortened, and to examine protein synthesis of a panel of native mRNAs representing Asc1-dependent versus independent genes to confirm the interpretations of the ribosome-profiling data for authentic mRNAs. You could extend the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> to include additional Asc1-dependent mRNAs, and also include Asc1 independent mRNAs, but it might be difficult to detect changes in polysome distribution for short mRNAs, in which case measurements of protein and mRNA synthesis or reporter expression would be required. I recall that in our paper on eIF4G depletion (Park et al), which you used creatively in your analysis, we validated a number of mRNAs as being eIF4G-dependent or -independent, and perhaps some of these mRNAs that are short and enriched for both eIF4G and PABP occupancy could be analyzed in your strains to achieve stronger validation of your ribosome profiling data.</italic> </p><p>We have improved the quantification of the ORF length reporters by quantifying protein levels from each of three biological replicates with four technical replicates. We now observe a more convincing difference in translational efficiency between the shortest and longest ORFs in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant (p = 0.002, Student's t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We saw the same trend as before for the intermediate length reporters, but an unfeasible number of biological and technical replicates would likely be needed to assess the significance of these changes. We therefore excluded the intermediate length reporters from the revised figure. We note that the global relationship between ∆TE and ORF length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), predicts a TE reduction for the 600 nt reporter of &lt;15%, which is extraordinarily difficult to measure by quantitative Western blotting.</p><p><italic>Another important issue was whether you have effectively untangled the contributions of mRNA length and propensity to form the closed loop as determinants of Asc1-dependence using bioinformatics and statistical analysis. There was general agreement among the reviewers during the consultation session that you should attempt to bolster your model by showing that an existing eIF4G mutation known to disrupt the closed loop mRNP would dampen the effects of eliminating Asc1 on translational efficiency of Asc1-dependent mRNAs or reporters.</italic> </p><p>We agree that determining the effect of Asc1 in a closed loop deficient background is a good experiment, which we attempted using the <italic>eif4g1-N∆300 eif4g2∆</italic> mutant that removes the Pab1 binding site from eIF4G1 (strain obtained from Allan Jacobson, originally described in (Tarun et al., 1997)). Unexpectedly, the <italic>eif4g1-N∆300 eif4g2∆</italic> mutant displayed slightly <italic>increased</italic> rather than decreased translation efficiency of the ‘closed loop’ mRNAs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref> (note: for reviewers only). The increase in TE was reduced in the presence of the <italic>asc1∆</italic> mutation, but this result is murky to interpret given the unexpected behavior of the <italic>eif4g1-N∆300 eif4g2∆</italic> mutant by itself. We are concerned that the <italic>eif4g1-N∆300 eif4g2∆</italic> strain, which grows very well in our hands, may have acquired a suppressor that allows robust translation in the absence of the closed loop interaction. We plan to reconstruct this eIF4G mutation in a strain carrying a repressible copy of wildtype eIF4G and/or seek closed loop mutant strains from other sources. We hope that this time-consuming work will eventually be presented elsewhere.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11154.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11154.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11154.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-11154-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>As these eIF4G mutations were made in the S288C background, such experiments would also address a concern that your study employed the Sigma background, which is rarely employed in studies on gene expression. A related point is that, without demonstrating that elimination of at least one other 40S protein in the vicinity of Asc1 on the solvent-exposed surface of the 40S subunit does not have the same effects on TE you observed on elimination of Asc1, it is dangerous to conclude that Asc1 is specifically dedicated to this regulatory function.</italic> We now include ribosome footprint profiling data for two additional mutants affecting small subunit ribosomal proteins in the vicinity of Asc1 near the mRNA exit channel, <italic>rps0b∆</italic> and <italic>rps16b∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) These mutants show growth and bulk translation defects ≥ <italic>asc1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref> and data not shown) and cause substantial translational changes globally which do not correlate with the changes observed in <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, the other 40S mutations do not decrease translation of the ‘closed loop’ mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Note that we do not exclude the hypothesis that other proteins may be involved in regulating the activity of the closed loop; however, our data clearly demonstrate that the effect of Asc1 on ‘closed loop’ mRNAs is not a general phenomenon caused by defects in ribosomal proteins.</p><p><italic>There was also agreement that it is necessary to measure mitochondrial protein synthesis and show that it is reduced in cells lacking Asc1 rather than relying on growth assays in nonfermentable carbon sources.</italic> </p><p>We have now assayed mitochondrial protein synthesis in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant by 35S incorporation. Synthesis of each mitochondrially-encoded protein decreased by ≥two-fold in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). These results are consistent with our model that poor growth in glycerol reflects compromised mitochondrial function downstream of reduced translation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins in <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants.</p><p><italic>And one of the reviewers is concerned that your conclusion that Asc1 is required for normal 60S biogenesis is at odds with other careful work done previously that ruled out this possibility, and feels that your measurements of 40S:60S subunit ratios from the polysome profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> do not represent the most rigorous approach to establishing this point. I think it is important to carefully consider these criticisms to avoid &quot;muddying the waters&quot; concerning the involvement of Asc1 in ribosome biogenesis.</italic> Thank you for raising this concern. We have taken care to reword that section of the text to avoid discrediting the previous study (Li et al., 2009). Li et al. concluded that loss of snR24 (also known as U24) was responsible for both the halfmer phenotype and the 60S depletion phenotype of the <italic>asc1∆</italic> mutant because experiments reintroducing intronless <italic>ASC1</italic> and <italic>SNR24</italic> separately showed that <italic>SNR24</italic> expression rescued both the 60S levels and the halfmer phenotype of <italic>asc1∆</italic>. We note that our data are not truly at odds with this finding because our WT Σ1278b polysome profiles have higher free 60S subunit levels compared to 40S subunits. The fact that loss of the Asc1 protein reduces the free 60S/40S ratio may be specific to the Σ1278b background, and we did observe that loss of <italic>SNR24</italic> was responsible for the halfmer phenotype of the <italic>asc1∆</italic> mutant at 37 ˚C, in agreement with the previous study.</p><p><italic>Another of the reviewers was justifiably concerned that you may have overlooked the effects of deleting Asc1 on &quot;no-go&quot; decay and that defects in this pathway and attendant changes in progression of stalled ribosomes on no-go substrates, or changes in mRNA levels, could be influencing conclusions about alterations of translational efficiency. It is important to consider this possibility and more fully document the effects of eliminating Asc1 on mRNA levels and the extent to which changes in TE might be driven by defects in no-go decay.</italic> The observed changes in gene expression and translational efficiency are not consistent with defects in no-go decay. If decreases in translation efficiency were caused by defects in no-go decay stabilizing mRNAs (thus inflating the denominator in the footprint RNA/total RNA calculation), then we would expect the levels of those mRNAs to increase in the total RNA pool. However, the overall trend is for the levels of total mRNA for mRNAs with decreased TE in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant to go down or remain constant rather than increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have added a short discussion of this effect in the text as well as a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Finally, there were some issues with a lack of adequate descriptions of procedures and bioinformatics analysis.</italic> Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have expanded our descriptions of procedures and analyses to address these concerns (see detailed descriptions below in the point-by-point response).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>General critique:</italic></p><p> <italic>It is quite interesting that Asc1 is found to be particularly important for efficient translation of short mRNAs and also mRNAs with strong potential for closed-loop formation, and it is noteworthy that they have discovered in previously published datasets unsuspected relationships between short mRNA length and both high closed-loop forming potential and heightened dependence on eIF4G. However, since short mRNAs are enriched for both closed-loop formation potential and for dependence on eIF4G, it isn't entirely clear whether it is length per se, ability to form the closed loop, or dependence on eIF4G that confers the greater than average requirement for Asc1 for efficient translation.</italic> We were also quite struck by the relationship between ORF length and closed loop formation and its potential to explain the high translational efficiency of short ORFs observed in ribosome profiling data from diverse eukaryotes. We agree that it is difficult to say using bioinformatics alone what the direction of causality is between Asc1, eIF4G, and the closed loop. Indeed, if they all act on the same mRNAs as part of a common pathway, it will be difficult to assign specific effects to each individual component. We are interested in this problem, but believe that it will take years of careful experiments to fully disentangle the effects of each player in the translational regulation of ‘closed loop’ mRNAs. However, we do show that the decrease in TE of the closed loop genes in the <italic>asc1-M1X</italic> mutant cannot be accounted for by a simple linear relationship between ∆TE and ORF length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), and we have explained this analysis more thoroughly in the Methods section under the heading “ORF length correction of ∆TE values for closed loop groups”.</p><p><italic>Specific comments: The key experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref> should be bolstered with additional replicates in an effort to increase the statistical significance of differences between the monomer vs dimer or trimer.</italic> </p><p> <italic>If that can't be accomplished, then an additional, complementary experiment could be conducted where they start with a native, long mRNA that is Asc1-independent and show that Asc1-dependence is conferred by progressive removal of coding sequences. Perhaps this could be done for an mRNA whose protein product is a scaffold comprised of multiple modular domains.</italic> </p><p>We have included additional replicates of the ORF length reporter experiments and now show more significant differences (p=0.002). Please see the response to this point in the summary review above.</p><p><italic>An important experiment that would test their conclusion that Asc1 is important for enhanced translation of mRNAs in the closed-loop configuration would be to examine the effect of deleting Asc1 in a previously published strain in which the PABP binding site in eIF4G1 is deleted, eliminating its ability to form the closed -loop intermediate, and eIF4G2 is deleted. (Tarun and Sachs showed in 1997 that the entire N-terminus of eIF4G1 can be deleted in a strain lacking eIF4G2 with only moderate effects on cell growth.) Their model strongly predicts that the effect of deleting Asc1 on translation of short, &quot;strong closed-loop mRNAs&quot; will be substantially dampened in this eIF4G1 mutant.</italic> </p><p>We attempted this experiment, with suggestive but ambiguous results potentially due to problems with the <italic>eif4g1-N∆300 eif4g2∆</italic> mutant strain we obtained. Please see our detailed response in the summary above.</p><p> <italic>They do not show directly that mitochondrial protein synthesis is impaired in asc1 cells and cannot rule out effects on expression of other genes required for growth in nonfermentable carbon sources. It seems necessary to measure mitochondrial protein synthesis directly in asc1 cells, which is a feasible experiment, to justify their claims.</italic> We now provide these data. Please see our response in the summary above.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>In this manuscript the authors assess the role of the ASC1/RACK protein in protein synthesis. They use the ribosome footprinting technology to address the impact of different mutants in ASC1 and conclude that these mutations preferentially alter the translation of short mRNAs. I found the data interesting but oversold in places. The paper was also quite difficult to read due to a lack of technical detail in many of the methods descriptions and legends. Finally, I was not convinced that the authors had effectively shown that Asc1 affected translation directly. The authors desperately need to provide some direct measure of protein synthesis in this paper. The ribosome footprinting pattern across mRNAs provides an approximation of translation and how this changes, but there are other reasons that ribosomes might accumulate on mRNAs (see point about no-go mRNA decay below). So claims are made about the rates of initiation and the role of Asc1 in protein synthesis without actually ever measuring the synthesis rate of any endogenous proteins directly. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the authors do measure the translation efficiency of a series of artificial engineered proteins to study the correlation between ORF length and the impact of ASC1 mutation. However, they need to show the primary data here so that the impact of the mutation on protein synthesis can be directly assessed by the reader. Also in my view validation that Asc1 specifically affects the synthesis of protein from some short mRNAs relative to some longer ones is essential.</italic> We have validated the effect of Asc1 on the translational efficiency (protein/mRNA) of a short vs. long ORF reporter, and now include many more replicates demonstrating the significance of the length-dependent difference in sensitivity to Asc1. The primary data for the ORF length reporter experiments is quantitative Western blotting using fluorescent antibodies and qRT-PCR. A representative Western blot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> to show the reader the clean nature of the fluorescent signal used to determine protein abundance. Since it is difficult to quantify protein abundance changes on this scale by eye, presentation of all the Western blots does not seem likely to be very helpful to the reader.</p><p>We are not sure what the reviewer had in mind for a “direct measure of protein synthesis” for a specific gene.</p><p><italic>The choice of strain for this study is very strange. While the Σ1278b strain is widely used for studies into filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae it is quite rarely used outside this, and it has some odd characteristics that raise concerns over the generality of the results shown. As has been shown previously on a number of occasions and is now shown in the polysomes presented here, Σ1278b is very unusual in that it has abnormally high levels of free 60S subunits. The asc1 null has previously been shown to decrease 60S subunit levels and again the authors reconfirm this observation. The authors state that the ASC1 mutants have relatively subtle effects on protein synthesis and make statements about how subtle effects on translation as judged by polysome profiling can conceal a wider perturbation of cellular translation. It is possible that the abnormal ratio of free 40S/60S subunits in the Σ strain obviates potentially more dramatic effects of the ASC1 mutation on translation. In my view the authors should really test key observations from their study in a laboratory strain of yeast that has a more standard profile of free 40S and 60S subunits. Obviously this may be an unrealistic expectation as ribosome footprinting is neither cheap nor trivial- but some attempt to generalize the data could be made and the non-standard nature of the strain and the ratio of ribosomal subunits should be commented upon.</italic> Our laboratory has done several previous studies using the Σ1278b strain, which, because it is wildtype for <italic>FLO8</italic>, retains characteristics of natural isolates that make it attractive for study. The <italic>asc1∆</italic> mutant has a striking phenotype, complete loss of invasive growth, in the Σ1278b background. We therefore began our studies in this strain. There seems to be no firm basis for characterizing the free 40S/60S ratios of Σ1278b, S288c, or w303 as ‘normal’ for yeast, although it is interesting that they differ. We are ultimately interested in looking at the conserved function of Asc1 in other eukaryotic species rather than other strains of yeast. The conservation of Asc1 and the closed loop factors suggests that this function of Asc1 should be highly conserved.</p><p><italic>For the polysomes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> the polysomes profiles have very high 80S peaks relative to the polysome peaks for unstressed cells, this suggests that some stress has occurred during the polysome preparation? Could this be masking the impact of the asc1 mutations on polysome association?</italic> These polysome profiles are typical for unstressed profiles from our lab. However, even if there has been some stress during polysome preparation, both the wildtype and the mutant cultures were processed identically.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> – I find this formaldehyde polysome analysis particularly unconvincing. The polysomes are barely visible and the pattern of the other peaks looks substantially altered. The authors claim that Asc1 is maintained across the gradient in the mutants seems inappropriate based on the data presented and based on what is in the literature.</italic> We used previously published and widely accepted methods for formaldehyde crosslinking of polysomes (see (Valásek et al., 2007)), and our crosslinked polysomes look similar to those described in this reference. We hypothesize that the polysomes are lower because some fraction of them are crosslinked to larger complexes that do not resolve in the sucrose gradient. We agree that crosslinking is not quantitative and only seek to make the qualitative claim here that the data support some remaining association of the <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants with the ribosome in vivo; thus it cannot be assumed that these mutations fully abrogate ribosome binding.</p><p><italic>As the authors state, Asc1 has also been shown by the Inada group to play a role in the no-go mRNA decay process. It promotes translation arrest to facilitate mRNA decay by this pathway. It is therefore possible that the alterations in ribosome density on mRNAs for ASC1 mutants could be associated with this role. First, the authors do not present the genome wide transcript level datasets in detail, which they must have obtained for the ASC1 mutants relative to wild type. Is there any evidence for alterations in mRNA levels correlating with the ribosome densities? Indeed, at one point the authors show in a supplementary figure that translation efficiency correlates with mRNA half-life measurements from the Cramer group. Could this be the reason ASC1 mutants are altered in their ribosome density on short mRNAs? – Could it be that the role of Asc1 in mRNA decay pathways is the key?</italic> Defects in no-go decay are inconsistent with the effects we see on ∆TE. Please see our complete response in the summary above. We bring up the half-life correlations because we speculate that mRNA decay downstream of translational repression could explain the decrease in total RNA levels for some mRNAs with decreased TE in the <italic>ASC1</italic> mutants. A full understanding of this effect is outside the scope of this study, but recognizing the effect is an important aid to future discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p> <italic>In the presented paper, Thompson et al. uncover a role for Asc1/RACK1 in a length-dependent initiation mechanism optimized for efficient translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

We have now clarified the method used for 60S/40S ratio quantification in the Methods section. You are right in that we quantified the native polysome profiles directly without subunit dissociation. We did so because pilot experiments using subunit dissociation did not appear to be as sensitive to small changes as using the whole polysome profile. It is expected that a slight subunit imbalance will be more apparent in the whole polysome profile because only unassociated 40S and 60S subunits will be quantified. Although we cannot interpret the obtained values at the literal 60S/40S ratio (as in the case of polysome dissociation), we see no reason that they cannot be compared between different mutants as a way to assess their subunit imbalance.</p><p><italic>I would think that the most appropriate way to show that the observed effects are really specific for ASC1 would be to use mutants of some small ribosomal proteins occurring on the solvent-exposed side of the 40S ribosome in the vicinity of ASC1 and examine their effects in the same way as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.
