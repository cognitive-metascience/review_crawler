voltage-sensing domain (VSD) activation. In the heart, KCNQ1 associates with KCNE1 subunits to form I<sub>Ks</sub> channels that regulate heart rhythm. KCNE1 suppresses the IO state so that the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel opens only to the AO state. Here, we tested modulations of human KCNQ1 channels by an activator ML277 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. It exclusively changes the pore opening properties of the AO state without altering the IO state, but does not affect VSD activation. These observations support a distinctive mechanism responsible for the VSD-pore coupling at the AO state that is sensitive to ML277 modulation. ML277 provides insights and a tool to investigate the gating mechanism of KCNQ1 channels, and our study reveals a new strategy for treating long QT syndrome by specifically enhancing the AO state of native I<sub>Ks</sub> currents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>VSD-pore coupling</kwd><kwd>KCNQ1 channel</kwd><kwd>ML277</kwd><kwd>state-dependent activation</kwd><kwd>long QT syndrome</kwd><kwd>activated open state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS092570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jianmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL126774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jianmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AHA 18POST34030203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Panpan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ML277 exclusively enhances the AO state voltage-sensing domain (VSD)-pore coupling of KCNQ1 channels, providing an effective tool to investigate the voltge-dependent gating and new strategies for treating long QT syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>KCNQ1, also known as K<sub>V</sub>7.1 or K<sub>V</sub>LQT1, belongs to a subfamily of voltage-activated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1996</xref>). It adopts the canonical structural organization of the homo-tetrameric K<sub>V</sub> superfamily, in which each subunit contains six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with the first four (S1-S4) forming the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and the latter two (S5-S6) folding to the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). In response to membrane depolarization, the S4 segment in the VSD undergoes outward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glauner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>) and triggers pore opening via electromechanical (E-M) coupling interactions between the VSD and the pore. Similar to other K<sub>V</sub> members such as the Shaker channel, the VSD of KCNQ1 channels shows two steps activation: it activates sequentially from the resting state to an experimentally resolvable intermediate state before finally arriving at the fully activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bezanilla et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho-de-Souza and Bezanilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delemotte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacroix et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ledwell and Aldrich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osteen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sigg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sigworth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silverman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zagotta et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>). However, unlike the Shaker channel which opens only when the VSD moves to the fully activated state, the KCNQ1 channel opens when its VSD occupies both the intermediate and fully activated conformations, resulting in intermediate-open (IO) and activated-open (AO) states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The two open states, IO and AO, are distinctive from each other. Structurally, they associate with different VSD and pore conformations. During membrane depolarization, the S4 segment moves outward from its resting state to the intermediate state to trigger the IO state opening. Subsequent movement of the S4 helix from the intermediate state to the activated state then triggers conformational change of the pore from the IO state to the AO state. These VSD-pore conformations can be isolated by the mutation that arrests the VSD at the intermediate state, E160R/R231E (E1R/R2E), which results in the constitutive IO state, and the mutation that arrests the VSD at the activated state, E160R/R237E (E1R/R4E), which results in the constitutive AO state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Restier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>). Functionally, the two open states have different gating properties and are differentially modulated by the auxiliary subunit KCNE1, allowing us to experimentally distinguish them. These differences include (1) the AO state shows slower current kinetics and more positive voltage-dependent activation than that of the IO state, (2) KCNQ1 channels show lower open probability when the VSD moves from the intermediate state to the fully activated state, resulting in inactivation phenotypes under certain voltage stimulations, (3) the AO state shows lower Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratio than the IO state, (4) different E-M coupling mechanisms such that the two open states can be isolated by single mutations that ablate respective E-M couplings, and (5) KCNE1 suppresses the IO state but enhances the AO state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In cardiomyocytes, KCNQ1 associates with KCNE1 to generate the slow delayed rectifier current (I<sub>Ks</sub>) important for terminating cardiac action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiamvimonvat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keating and Sanguinetti, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>). Clinically, more than 300 loss-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 have been found to induce functional defects to the I<sub>Ks</sub> current, causing long QT syndrome (LQTS) that predisposes patients to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1996</xref>). KCNE1 specifically suppresses the IO state but enhances the AO state, rendering the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel with only AO state openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the AO state is physiologically more important in the heart. Enhancing AO state currents to specifically rescue the functional defects of the mutant I<sub>Ks</sub> currents presents a potential strategy for anti-LQTS therapy.</p><p>Different activators have been found to enhance KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> currents. Zinc pyrithione (ZnPy), L-364,373 (R-L3), 4,4â²âdiisothiocyanatostilbeneâ2,2â²âdisulfonic acid (DIDS), and mefenamic acid (MFA) activate either homomeric KCNQ1 or KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seebohm et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiong et al., 2007</xref>), while phenylboronic acid (PBA), Hexachlorophene (HCP), mallotoxin (MTX), and 3-ethyl-2-hydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one (CPT1) potentiate both KCNQ1 and KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mruk and Kobertz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Although some of these activators are capable of shortening the action potential duration (APD) in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>), none of them was found to only enhance the AO state of KCNQ1 or I<sub>Ks</sub> channels. Besides KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels, all these activators also strongly modulate other ion channels that are key to cardiac electrophysiology, such as hERG, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 in the heart and neuronal KCNQ channels (KCNQ2-KCNQ5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruickshank et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill and Sitsapesan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mruk and Kobertz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). The low specificity may cause severe side effects to LQTS patients, limiting the potential for further development into anti-LQTS drugs.</p><p>On the other hand, a recently identified KCNQ1 activator ML277 shows potent effect to KCNQ1 channel, while demonstrating little effects on other important cardiac ion channels including hERG, Nav1.5, and Cav1.2 channels, and other KCNQ isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, ML277 shortens the APD of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and guinea pig cardiomyocytes, via activating the I<sub>Ks</sub> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). The high specificity and potent potentiation in native I<sub>Ks</sub> currents make ML277 a promising anti-LQTS drug candidate. Although computational and experimental studies have been performed to probe the binding and potentiation of ML277 on KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), the mechanism underlying this potentiation on the two open states of KCNQ1 channels remains largely unclear.</p><p>In this study, we find that ML277 changes KCNQ1 channel current kinetics, alters voltage dependence of activation, inactivation property, and ion permeation. All these modifications are consistent with the mechanism that ML277 specifically enhances the current of the AO state. Supporting this mechanism, ML277 selectively enhances the currents of mutant KCNQ1 channels that open only at the AO state but not the mutant channels that open only at the IO state. These results and recordings of VSD activation using voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF) suggest that ML277 specifically promotes the E-M coupling when the VSD is at the activated state to increase the AO state current. KCNQ1 is the first ion channel that shows well resolved two open states when the VSD is at different activation states. This study sets the first example that a small molecule compound can specifically modulate only one of the two open states via enhancing the specific E-M coupling. Our study not only proposes an effective tool to investigate the gating mechanism of KCNQ1 channel with two open states, but also paves the way to new strategies, enhancing the AO state of native I<sub>Ks</sub> currents, for treating LQTS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ML277 specifically enhances currents of the AO state</title><p>Previous studies have shown that, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, ML277 potentiates both KCNQ1 channels and KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 channels with unsaturated KCNE1 association. Progressive increase of KCNE1 expression reduces efficacy of ML277 and eventually abolishes its effect on KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 channels with saturated KCNE1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). We tested the ML277 effects on KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and found that 1 ÂµM ML277 increased the KCNQ1 current amplitudes, such that the same depolarizing voltage elicited larger currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while with 1 ÂµM ML277 less current increase was shown in KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 channels with injected mRNA weight ratio of KCNQ1:KCNE1Â =Â 300:1, which may induce unsaturated KCNE1 binding, and no current increase was shown in KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 channels with injected mRNA weight ratio of 4:1, which may saturate the KCNE1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakajo et al., 2010</xref>).

The loss of ML277 effects on KCNQ1Â +KCNE1 channels with saturating KCNE1 association was suggested to result from a competition between ML277 and KCNE1 in binding to KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). ML277 may bind at the interface between the VSD and the pore from two neighboring subunits, where KCNE1 is also found to bind with KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakajo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramasubramanian and Rudy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu and Rudy, 2018</xref>).

This selective change on the Ï<sub>s</sub> was observed in different voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also analyzed the increased currents (Î currents) by subtracting control currents from currents in the presence of ML277 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It is clear that the Î currents have no fast current component any more and show different delays at different voltages, following the onset of the IO state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,E</xref>). A change only in time constant and amplitude of the slow component is quantitatively consistent with the mechanism that ML277 selectively alters the AO state without affecting the IO state.</p><p>Our previous studies showed that the IO and AO states have different time- and voltage-dependence: the AO state appears only when the KCNQ1 channel is activated by voltages above â40 mV and for a sufficient time duration (â¥100 ms atÂ +40 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). To verify that ML277 selectively increases the currents of the AO state, we tested the effect of 1 Î¼M ML277 on KCNQ1 current when we activated KCNQ1 channels either at low voltage (â50 mV) or at high voltage with a short time duration (+40 mV for only 100 ms). These voltage protocol effectively restricts KCNQ1 channel activation to the IO state. In both cases, ML277 did not increase current amplitudes or alter current kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). These data support that ML277 specifically modifies the current of the AO state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ML277 right shifts the GâV relationship of KCNQ1 channels</title><p>We analyzed ML277-induced changes in the voltage-dependent activation of KCNQ1 channels.

This curious result can be explained by properties of the KCNQ1 voltage-dependent activation process. The KCNQ1 currents are composed of currents of both the IO and AO states, therefore, the GâV relation of KCNQ1 channels is the sum of the GâV relations of both the IO and AO states. The G-V relationship of the AO state is at more positive voltages compared to the IO state, reflecting the fact that the activated VSD state requires more positive voltages than the intermediate VSD state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>).

This property is also manifested in the kinetics of current activation, in which the slow component (primarily through the AO state) accounts for only a small portion of the total current as compared to the fast component (primarily through the IO state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The GâV relation of KCNQ1 channels thus tracks closely to the GâV relation of the IO state, and contains a small portion of the GâV relation of the AO state. By contrast, the I<sub>Ks</sub> (KCNQ1Â +KCNE1) channel conducts predominantly with AO-state current, because KCNE1 suppresses pore conductance of the IO state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>). The G-V curve of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel is thus dominated by the G-V relationship of the AO state, and is significantly right-shifted compared to the KCNQ1 G-V relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). The contrasting G-V relations of the KCNQ1 (IO-dominant) and I<sub>Ks</sub> (AO-dominant) are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>. In this study, we utilized a single Boltzmann function, which assumes one closed state and one open state, to approximate the complex KCNQ1 G-V relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Accordingly, if ML277 increases the contribution of the AO state to the overall current, then a right-shift in the G-V relationship is expected, as the AO state is right-shifted compared to the IO state. We indeed observed a small right-shift in the KCNQ1 G-V relationship upon ML277 application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The right shift of the GâV relation by ML277 is consistent with the mechanism that ML277 selectively increases the AO state currents and thereby increases contribution of the AO state G-V relation to the overall G-V curve.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48576.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ML277 right shifts the GâV relationship of KCNQ1 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GâV relationships of KCNQ1 channels before (black) and after (blue) adding 1 ÂµM ML277.

To model ML277âs mechanism of enhancing E-M coupling of the AO states, we reduced the rates of exiting from the AO state (k<sub>2</sub> and Î²<sub>3</sub>) by half, which corresponds to ML277 stabilizing the conformational energy of the AO state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Strikingly, reducing these rates can recapitulate the ML277 effects on KCNQ1 channel, including the enhanced AO currents and the right-shifted G-V relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâD</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48576.008</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model simulations of ML277 effects on KCNQ1 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model simulations of KCNQ1 activation currents before (black) and after (blue) adding ML277.

Such a large reserve of unopened KCNQ1 channels was also observed in single channel recordings, in which most traces were silent with no channel openings, and in those few traces that show KCNQ1 channel activity, only very short openings were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). The large reserved occupancy of closed states provides a considerable potential to open KCNQ1 channels by activators like ML277.</p><p>Taken together, our experimental and simulation results reveal that ML277 increases KCNQ1 current by promoting the AO state E-M coupling. This is a novel gating modification mechanism that may help understand the fundamental gating processes of KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels, and develop new strategies for treating LQTS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we systematically studied the functional properties of KCNQ1 channels that are modulated by ML277, including current amplitudes and kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), voltage dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and ion permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). All these modulations are consistent with the mechanism that ML277 specifically enhances the AO state E-M coupling to increase the AO state current.</p><p>KCNQ1 has two different open states, IO and AO. Based on recent single channel studies, there are several different levels of single channel conductance of KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels. These levels are dependent on whether the KCNQ1 channel is associated with KCNE1 subunit and how many voltage sensors are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Westhoff et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that when the AO state is modulated by ML277, not only the gating (VSD-pore coupling) is potentiated, but also the single channel conductance associated with the AO state is increased, and both could contribute to the increase of the AO-state-specific current.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support that ML277 changes the KCNQ1 channel gating instead of simply increasing KCNQ1 single channel conductance: (1) The current kinetics are changed upon ML277 application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). (2) Previous study showed that the ML277 binding site is located away from the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), making it hard to directly affect single channel conductance. (3) ML277 selectively enhances the current of the AO state but not that of the IO state. This is consistent with our previous finding of distinctive VSD-pore coupling mechanisms when VSD is at the intermediate and activated states, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>), such that ML277 could modulate one mechanism without affecting the other. On the other hand, there is no known mechanism to explain how ML277 simply increases single channel conductance to selectively enhance the current amplitude of the AO state. (4) In a separate study, we found a series of residues that are critical for the VSD-pore coupling when the VSD is at the fully activated state, and ML277 interacts with these residues (data not shown). These results support that ML277 may specifically modulate VSD-pore coupling when the VSD is at the fully activated state.</p><p>Different compounds and toxins have been found as state-dependent modulators for ion channels. For instance, mexiletine preferentially blocks the Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 sodium channel when the DIII-VSD is activated, and protoxin-II shows higher affinity to resting VSD states of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 sodium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakagawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), while roscovitine facilitates the inactivation and shows less effect on activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yarotskyy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yazawa et al., 2011</xref>). We previously found that the IO state is more sensitive to the blocker XE991 than the AO state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>). These modulators preferentially modulate one of the states of certain ion channels but still show considerable modulations at other states. In this study, we show a clean example of state-dependent modulation in which only the AO state of KCNQ1 channel is exclusively enhanced by ML277, leaving the IO state unaltered. This unique mechanism of gating modification reveals an interesting mechanistic feature of the KCNQ1 channel. Since only the AO state is exclusively modulated, this strongly suggests that there are structural and functional modules in KCNQ1 channels that engage in interactions exclusive for the AO state E-M coupling. Moreover, these interactions can be specifically altered, when the VSD is at the activated state, to yield higher open probability. This is consistent with our previous finding that single mutations can selectively disrupt the E-M couplings for the IO and AO states, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>). In a previous study, Xu and colleagues proposed that ML277 intracellularly binds at the inter-subunit interface between intracellular loops (S2-S3 loop and S4-S5 linker) and the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). It will be interesting to further study if this putative ML277 binding site is important in the E-M coupling for the AO state.</p><p>We studied 1 ÂµM ML277-induced functional changes to KCNQ1 channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Some previous publications reported different observations under other experimental conditions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al. (2013)</xref> found that in CHO cells, 0.3 ÂµM ML277 strongly increases KCNQ1 currents, left-shifts the GâV relationship, and abolishes inactivation. However, Xu et al. reported a much less effect of ML277 on KCNQ1 activation expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes than in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Xu et al. also found that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, 25 ÂµM ML277 strongly decreases the Rb<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> permeability ratio to the level even lower than I<sub>Ks</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The high concentrations of ML277 used by Xu and colleagues may enhance the AO state more than KCNE1 does to the channel, or the specificity of ML277 at this high concentration might have changed.</p><p>Activators of KCNQ1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels may be effective for treating LQTS. Although several KCNQ1 activators have been identified, their low specificity may limit further drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruickshank et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill and Sitsapesan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mruk and Kobertz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Several features of ML277 make it an interesting KCNQ1 modulator. First, ML277 specifically activates KCNQ1 channel with little activity on other ion channels that are key to cardiac electrophysiology or neuronal KCNQ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Second, ML277 activates KCNQ1 channels expressed in mammalian cells with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 260 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), lower than any other known KCNQ1/I<sub>Ks</sub> activators. Finally, studies have confirmed that ML277 effectively shortens the APD in human iPSCderived cardiomyocytes (including LQTS conditions) and guinea pig cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, ML277 was found to increase only the current of KCNQ1 channels but not the I<sub>Ks</sub> channels with saturated KCNE1 association in exogenous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). The sensitivity of I<sub>Ks</sub> currents to ML277 in cardiomyocytes suggests that native I<sub>Ks</sub> channels are not always saturated with KCNE1 association, and these native I<sub>Ks</sub> channels may be a novel target for compounds such as ML277 to treat LQTS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and mutagenesis</title><p>Overlap extension and high-fidelity PCR were used for making KCNQ1 channel point mutations.

The upper row RC, IC, AC stand for the VSD states at resting, intermediate, and activated when the pore is closed, and the lower row IO and AO stand for pore opening at intermediate and activated states. The voltage independent opening state âresting openâ (RO) was deleted from the six-state model based on the rare transition from RC to RO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). This simplified five-state model is capable to recapitulate the main characteristics of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 two open states gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). We use the same Markov process to model the transition between each state, where Î±<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>*exp(v/m), Î²<sub>1</sub> = c<sub>1</sub>*exp(-v/n), Î±<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub>*exp(v/b) and Î²<sub>i</sub> = c<sub>i</sub>*exp(-v/d) (iÂ =Â 2 and 3) are the voltage-dependent rates of transitions. k<sub>1-4</sub> are the E-M coupling rates (constant), where k<sub>2</sub>, thatÂ is the E-M coupling rate from the AO state to the AC state, can be set to different values to simulate the control and after ML277 results.

Mutations of these channels cause LQT syndrome and this channel is a target for the development of anti-arrhythmic drugs. Previously, Cui and colleagues have shown that the KCNQ channel contributes to two distinct open states depending on the presence or absence of the KCNE subunit. In presence of KCNE the AO state is stabilized whereas the channel prefers to open to IO state in absence of this accessory subunit. In this study, Hou et al. use a combination of electrophysiology, kinetic analysis, mutagenesis, and voltage clamp fluorometry to show that ML277 enhances current by specifically modulating the AO state of KCNQ channels. Kinetic analysis of KCNQ activation in the presence of ML277 shows that this compound selectively enhances the slow component of activation. This effect is obscured when KCNQ is co-expressed with saturating levels of the accessory subunit KCNE1 suggesting that the drug has the same effect on the channel as KCNE1. The authors go on to show that ML277 influences the inactivation and permeability of KCNQ in a manner consistent with selective action on the AO state. Next, they use several mutants which specifically stabilize the IO (E1R/R2E and S338F) or AO (E1R/R4E and F351A) states to more directly probe the influence of this compound on the distinct open states. Finally, VCF and kinetic modeling are provided as support to their model in which ML277 binding enhances conductance by binding to the AO state and enhancing coupling.

However, an alternative explanation for this data is that ML277 increases the unitary conductance of the AO state, and no experiments are provided to rule this out. The overall effect of ML277 on KCNQ channels both resembles the effect of KCNE subunit and is abrogated by KCNE.

We follow the suggestion of the reviewers to make a more thorough discussion on this issue in the revised manuscript. The discussion is focused on the following aspects.</p><p>KCNQ1 has two open states, IO and AO. Based on Dr. David Fedidaâs recent single channel results, there are several different levels of single channel conductance of KCNQ1 and IKs channels. These levels are dependent on whether the KCNQ1 channel is associated with KCNE1 subunit, and how many voltage sensors are activated (Murray et al., 2016; Westhoff et al., 2019). It is possible that when the AO state is modulated by ML277, not only the gating (VSD-pore coupling) is potentiated, but also the single channel conductance associated with the AO state is increased, and both could contribute to the increase of the AO state specific current.</p><p>We appreciate the recognition by the reviewers that distinguishing between an influence on open probability and single channel conductance may be beyond the scope of this work. To substantiate this concern, we would like to point out that, first of all, it is technically difficult to record KCNQ1 single channel currents. Even for Dr. David Fedidaâs lab, which is the best on this kind of studies, it may take a long time to get some data from our experience in collaborating with him (Hou et al., 2017). On the other hand, single channel current amplitude may increase once AO is potentiated, as discussed above. Therefore, single channel recordings may not resolve the contribution of gating and conductance to the increased currents by ML277.</p><p>We have also thought about using noise analysis to get the KCNQ1 single channel conductance before and after ML277 (Yang and Sigworth, JGP 1998; Sesti and Goldstein, JGP 1998). However, this method assumes that the channel has open-close two states. Since KCNQ1 channels not only have two open states but also have different sub-conductance levels, this approach is not a feasible solution. In addition, previous studies show that the KCNQ1 channel single channel openings are very short, which will also compromise the noise analysis.</p><p>On the other hand, we think that the following evidences support that ML277 changes the KCNQ1 channel gating: 1) The current kinetics are changed upon ML277 application (Figure 1); 2) Previous study showed that the ML277 binding site is located away from the pore (Xu et al., 2015), making it hard to directly affect single channel conductance; 3) ML277 selectively enhances the current of the AO state but not that of the IO state. This is consistent with the previous finding of distinctive VSD-pore coupling mechanisms when VSD is at the intermediate and activated states, respectively (Hou et al., 2017), such that ML277 could modulate one mechanism without affecting the other. On the other hand, there is no known mechanism to explain how ML277 simply increases single channel conductance to selectively enhance the current amplitude of the AO state; 4) In a separate study, we found a series of residues that are critical for the VSD-pore coupling when the VSD is at the fully activated state, and ML277 interacts with these residues. These results support that ML277 may specifically modulate VSD-pore coupling when the VSD is at the fully activated state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I wonder why ML277 is not effective on KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel current (Figure 1B), if it changes the AO state E-M coupling. In F351A mutant (Figure 5B) which opens only in the AO state, similarly to the case of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel, a clear effect of ML277 is observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on other experimental and simulation studies (Xu et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2013) and our unpublished data, ML277 may bind at the interface between the VSD and pore formed by two neighboring subunits, where KCNE1 is also found to bind with KCNQ1 (Chan et al., 2012; Nakajo et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2017; Ramasubramanian and Rudy, 2018; Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011; Xu and Rudy, 2018). As a result, KCNE1 binding may block the ML277 binding site. Therefore, ML277 shows no effect on KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels with saturated KCNE1 binding.</p><p>In the case of F351A mutant, it opens only in the AO state but leaves the ML277 binding site intact. Therefore, a clear current increase is observed when adding ML277. We have added some sentences to clarify this point more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The study would benefit from a clearer description of the model outcomes (what is the state occupancy before and after ML277 in the model). The model parameters suggest there is large reserve of unopened channels that are then recruited by ML277, leading to the significant current increase in ML277. Is this a justifiable feature of the model?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. In the model there is a large reserve of unopened probability that is recruited by ML277, leading to the significant current increase. We prepared all-state occupancy before (black) and after (blue) adding ML277, and it shows clearly that by reducing the rates of exiting from the AO state (k<sub>2</sub> and Î²<sub>3</sub>) by half, ML277 specifically increases the AO state occupancy (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1). From the model, the reserve is determined by the VSD-pore coupling, i.e., the vertical transitions (k factors). With these parameters (k<sub>1</sub>= 0.89, k<sub>2</sub>= 853.08, k<sub>3</sub>= 0.96, k<sub>4</sub>= 103.82), the majority of the channels are at the AC and IC states even at high voltages, leaving a considerable room for IO and AO states to be modified.</p><p>Such a large reserve of unopened KCNQ1 channels was observed in single channel recordings, in which most traces were silent with no channel openings, and in those few traces that show KCNQ1 channel activity, only very short openings were observed (Hou et al., 2017). Our previous studies suggest that the reserved occupancy can be altered. We found that PIP2 is important for the VSD-pore coupling (Zaydman et al., 2013), and the IO state has less PIP2 sensitivity than the AO state (Li et al. PNAS 2013; Zaydman et al., 2013). In the case of KCNQ1 alone, which primarily opens at the IO state with low PIP2 sensitivity, native PIP2 in oocytes is not sufficient to fully activate the channel. The total current increases dramatically when high concentration PIP2 is applied from the intracellular side of the membrane (Li et al. PNAS 2013). This is a good point raised by the reviewers. We have added the occupancy of the states with and without ML277 as a new Figure 7âfigure supplement 1, and discussed this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âKinetic modeling of ML277 effectsâ and Figure 7 legend: It is written that the model c<sub>3</sub> (Î²<sub>3</sub>) was reduced to half to balance the model.

This other rate constant does not have to be c<sub>3</sub> (Î²<sub>3</sub>). For instance, Â½ k<sub>2</sub> and Â½ k<sub>4</sub> also would maintain detailed balance. However, we chose to reduce Î²<sub>3</sub> because this rate is for exiting the AO state (to reserve more of the AO state). We did not do a good job in the original manuscript to explain this. We have explained it in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p><p>For the requirement of detailed balance, we quote Zhang et al., 2016: âA hidden Markov model with detailed balance is crucial to modeling transitions at equilibrium. Detailed balance is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for any system in thermal equilibrium. Detailed balance requires the probability flux from state <italic>i</italic> to state <italic>j</italic> to be equal to the flux in a reverse direction, or <italic>p<sub>i</sub>q<sub>ij</sub> = p<sub>j</sub>q<sub>ji</sub></italic>, for any pair of states, where <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> is the probability being in state <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>q<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the rate constant of the transition from state <italic>i</italic> to state <italic>j</italic>.

To mimic the ML277 effects, enhancing the AO state coupling, we reduced the AOâAC rate k<sub>2</sub> by half (reduce exiting rate to reserve more of the AO state). To balance the model, we also reduced the AOâIO rate Î²<sub>3</sub> by half. These changes can recapitulate the ML277 effects on KCNQ1 channel, including the enhanced AO currents and the right-shifted G-V relationship (Figure 7A-D).</p><p>Alternatively, we can do 2X of k<sub>1</sub> (to facilitate entering the AO state) and 1/2 of Î²<sub>3</sub> (to balance the model) to mimic the ML277 effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).
