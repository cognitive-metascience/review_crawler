We found that Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, which is present in higher levels in the systemic environment, promotes oligodendrocyte maturation. Oligodendrocyte maturation was enhanced by adult mouse serum treatment via TGF-β type I receptor. Decrease in circulating TGF-β1 level prevented remyelination in the spinal cord after toxin-induced demyelination.

Improved remyelination is of potential interest in driving therapeutic manipulation, but drugs which mediate a fundamental cure for CNS demyelination diseases are not clinically available and are greatly needed. Remyelination is mediated by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are distributed throughout the adult mammalian CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dawson et al., 2003</xref>). Successful remyelination requires OPC proliferation, migration, differentiation to oligodendrocytes, and finally, maturation into myelinating oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2017</xref>). The last of these processes is essential for the structural repair and functional integrity of neuronal networks in the CNS.</p><p>Remyelination occurs as a spontaneous and efficient process in experimental models and many clinical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franklin, 2002</xref>). Because remyelination is controlled by environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clemente et al., 2013</xref>), OPCs and oligodendrocytes around demyelinated lesions are thought to receive the signals which promote maturation. With respect to the molecular mechanism, it is believed that oligodendrocyte maturation is controlled by the CNS-cell-derived factors, such as axonal F3-mediated Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2003</xref>), and astrocyte-derived leukemia inhibitory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, demyelination often occurs simultaneously with vascular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruckh et al., 2012</xref>) and vascular damage leads to leakage of circulating factors into the CNS, suggesting that oligodendrocytes around the demyelinating lesion are exposed to circulating factors. In support of this idea, circulating FGF21 leaks into the CNS after injury and promotes OPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuroda et al., 2017</xref>), a first step in remyelination. Although previous findings established the concept that successful remyelination requires oligodendrocyte maturation, the mechanism by which the circulating factors regulates oligodendrocyte maturation remains unknown.</p><p>TGF-βs are members of a superfamily of multifunctional cytokines with key functions in development, patterning, and immune responses. In CNS pathology, TGF-βs have implications in inflammatory responses through the activation of microglia in a number of animal models of diseases including stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iadecola and Anrather, 2011</xref>), Alzheimer disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wyss-Coray, 2006</xref>), and multiple sclerosis (MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benveniste, 1997</xref>). These observations are in line with the concept that TGF-βs are produced by the CNS and effect physiological reactions in neighboring cells, resulting in the progress of disease severity. However, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), systemic administration of TGF-β1 prevents disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuruvilla et al., 1991</xref>). Moreover, the levels of TGF-β1 in serum obtained from the patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment is low when compared with control patients, and this change is positively correlated with cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Because TGF-β is known to control the timing of remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palazuelos et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that circulating TGF-β1 may have a protective role in the CNS and may specifically promote remyelination.</p><p>In this study, we showed that TGF-β1, which is largely expressed in the peripheral environments, promoted oligodendrocyte maturation in mice spinal cord which were subjected to toxin-induced demyelination. Decrease in circulating TGF-β1 levels prevented spontaneous remyelination. Systemic administration of TGF-β1 promoted remyelination and decreased disease severity in EAE. TGF-β1 treatment promoted expression of myelin-associated gene in human oligodendrocyte in culture. These data suggest that the administration of systemic TGF-β1 may provide a therapeutic avenue for demyelinating diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TGF-β1 in adult mouse serum facilities oligodendrocyte maturation in vitro</title><p>We first investigated the possibility that circulating factors promote oligodendrocyte maturation.

We first selected drugs that did not inhibit cell survival by counting the number of Olig2-positive cells. Of 160 drugs, 107 drugs did not decrease of the abundance of Olig2-positive cells (0.5 times lower than control) in the culture after each treatment. Next, we excluded the drugs that decreased MBP expression (0.5 times lower than control) in the cells by drugs treatment with or without serum, and identified 17 drugs that caused downregulation of MBP area (two times lower than control) relative to serum treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Because we hypothesized that a circulating molecule drives oligodendrocyte maturation directly, we focused on the TGF-β receptor type I inhibitor (TGF-βRI), the only drug we tested that specifically targets a receptor-type protein. To investigate the role of TGF-βRI in serum-mediated oligodendrocyte maturation, we used LY-364947, a TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-βRI) kinase inhibitor and found that it blocked serum-promoted oligodendrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). We also confirmed that transfection of oligodendrocytes with TGF-βRI siRNA diminished serum-mediated maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since TGF-β is known as heat stable protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saita et al., 1994</xref>), we wondered whether TGF-β in serum binds oligodendrocytes directly, resulting in the promotion of oligodendrocyte maturation. We observed that oligodendrocyte treated with recombinant mouse TGF-β1 showed increased maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-labeled cells in the oligodendrocyte culture expressed TGF-βRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with TGF-β enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation in the oligodendrocyte culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). These data suggest that TGF-β in adult mouse enhances oligodendrocyte maturation directly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Circulating TGF-β1 contributes to remyelination in the CNS</title><p>To determine the effect of TGF-β1 in vivo, we investigated the expression pattern of TGF-β1 in adult mice. Quantitative protein analysis revealed that there was appreciable TGF-β1 expression in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is correlated with the high concentration of circulating TGF-β1 compared with concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Serum, 143361.3 ± 18715.5 pg/ml; CSF, 33.4 ± 10.1 pg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To investigate the contribution of peripheral TGF-β1 in CNS remyelination, we used a lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced demyelination model which accompanied by a vascular barrier disruption around the lesion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muramatsu et al., 2015</xref>). In this model, we detected high levels of TGF-β1 around the LPC lesion in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) without any change in levels of circulating TGF-β1 after LPC injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To analyze the role of circulating TGF-β1 on CNS remyelination, we depleted platelets by injecting anti-CD41 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nocito et al., 2007</xref>), as circulating TGF-β1 is transported by platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grainger et al., 2000</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Platelet depletion reduced the TGF-β1 level in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the fluorescence intensity of TGF-β1 at the LPC lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We then asked whether a decrease in circulating TGF-β1 level prevents remyelination after LPC injection. Mice, which had registered demyelination immediately after LPC injection, exhibited significant remyelination within 2 weeks post-injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 1999</xref>); therefore, the decrease in the area lacking MBP expression in the spinal cord 2 weeks after LPC injection indicates the success of remyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuroda et al., 2017</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that mice that had received anti-CD41 mAb had a larger MBP-negative area than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), indicating that platelet depletion inhibited remyelination. Myelin formation in the intact spinal cord was not changed after anti-CD41 mAb administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Electron microscopic analysis revealed that the thickness of myelin sheaths was significantly lower in mice treated with anti-CD41 mAb than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), indicating that our immunohistological observations were consistent with the promotion of structural remyelination. We then asked whether TGF-β1 makes a major contribution to circulating factor-mediated remyelination.

Because disruption of the vascular barrier leads to hypoperfusion and causes excessive inflammatory response in acute CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zlokovic, 2008</xref>), vascular impairment is increasingly thought to be associated with disturbances in CNS homeostasis. In contrast, chronic demyelinating lesions are characterized by less damage of blood brain barrier (BBB) when compared with the damage caused by an active lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lassmann et al., 1994</xref>). Consistent with this, an area of chronic demyelination that fails to undergo remyelination is considered to arise due to the decline of maturation activity in oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wolswijk, 1998</xref>). Although it is not clear why remyelination fails to occur in chronic demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franklin, 2002</xref>), the relative kinetics of vascular barrier disruption and remyelination suggest that it is possible that peripheral tissue–derived factors play an important supportive role during remyelination when the integrity of the BBB is impaired, such as during the remission phase of MS.</p><p>In this context, we identified circulating TGF-β1 as a candidate factor that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation. TGF-β1 does not cross the intact BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kasten et al., 2003</xref>) and TGF-β1 concentration in the CSF is maintained at a lower level than that which is in the plasma of a healthy subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tarkowski et al., 2002</xref>). However, it is important to note that TGF-β1 is also expressed in CNS cells, including astrocytes. In MS, TGF-β1 expression is detected in the lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Groot et al., 1999</xref>), and TGF-β1 mRNA expression in the spinal cord increased in advance of remission of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Issazadeh et al., 1995</xref>). Since astrocyte-derived TGF-β1 regulates the local inflammatory response which contributes to the initiation of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2007</xref>), CNS-cell-mediated TGF-β1 signaling may be involved in remyelination. However, TGF-β1 promotes Jagged1 expression in demyelinated lesions, and this upregulation inhibits oligodendrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">John et al., 2002</xref>), opposing the pro-remyelination effect of circulating TGF-β1. In addition, we found that oligodendrocyte maturation was detected in cells that were cultured in the presence of TGF-β1 at a concentration 29-fold higher than that of the CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). These data support our hypothesis that circulating TGF-β1 enters the CNS, and potentially contributes to remyelination.</p><p>This study resolves a long-standing debate about the therapeutic mechanism by which systemic TGF-β1 acts in the treatment of EAE and reveals the capacity of circulating TGF-β1 to contribute to the regeneration of neuronal networks after injury. Our study is currently limited to remyelination in MS. However, CNS regeneration is essential for efficient functional recovery after inflammation and injury in general. Therefore, our study predicts a new direction in CNS regeneration research with respect to the contribution of circulating factor in regeneration, which is supported by the previous findings that plastic changes of neuronal networks depend upon the systemic milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruckh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Villeda et al., 2014</xref>). In other contextual studies, it has been suggested that levels of circulating Growth differentiation factor 11, which belongs to the TGF-β family, decline with age and is linked to age-related systemic impairments such as cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loffredo et al., 2013</xref>), skeletal muscle dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>), and decline of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>). These studies emphasize that circulating factors should be regarded as important molecular regulators of mammalian aging and have potentially broad-reaching implications.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (no. 2018042R5). C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Charles River Japan or Japan SLC. Plp-CreERT mice (C57BL/6 background) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. TGF-βRI (ALK5) floxed mice (C57BL/6 background) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larsson et al., 2003</xref>) were kindly provided by Prof. Stefan Karlsson (Lund University). Mice were born and held in the specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions.

The authors demonstrate that serum stimulation facilitates the maturation of oligodendrocytes, and TGF-β1 signaling, in particular, is required for serum-induced maturation. The authors report that both circulating TGF-β1 and TGF-βRI in oligodendrocyte lineage cells are required for normal spontaneous remyelination following LPC-induced demyelination. Additionally, TGF-β1 administration, by both cerebroventricular and intravenous injection, was demonstrated to promote remyelination in two complementary models of demyelination. The authors also report that human oligodendrocytes express TGF-βRI and stimulation of human oligodendrocyte cultures with recombinant TGF-β1 promotes the expression of myelin-associated genes. Hamaguchi et al. conclude that the administration of systemic TGF-β1 may hold therapeutic potential for treating demyelinating diseases by entering the CNS in conditions of increased blood brain barrier permeabilization. While the authors provide strong support for a role of TGF-β1 signaling in remyelination, their current evidence does not directly show that the therapeutic effect of circulating TGF-β1 requires entry into the CNS for the promotion of oligodendrocyte maturation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study builds upon previous evidence for the therapeutic potential of TGF-β1 in demyelinating diseases, but it does not fully resolve the long-standing debate about the therapeutic mechanism of TGF-β1 in demyelinating diseases as it claims. The authors provide strong evidence for TGF-β1 signaling promoting oligodendrocyte maturation, but the authors do not account for the influence of TGF-β1 on regulatory T cells in recovery from demyelination. To determine the therapeutic mechanism of circulating TGF-β1, authors should provide a direct link between the therapeutic effect of systemic administration of TGF-β1 and oligodendrocyte expressed TGF-βRI. To establish the therapeutic mechanisms of circulating TGF-β1, authors likely need to systemically administer TGF-β1 to mice with conditional deletion of TGF-βRI in oligodendrocytes following LPC-induced demyelination. Provided systemic administration of TGF-β1 has no therapeutic effect in mice lacking TGF-βRI in oligodendrocytes, authors may conclude that CNS entry of circulating TGF-β1 is required to promote remyelination.</p><p>2) A weakness of the present study is the use of anti-CD41-induced platelet depletion as the sole method for reducing circulating TGF-β1. The authors determine that depletion of platelets reduces circulating TGF-β1, but they do not account for altering other platelet-dependent effects on remyelination. An additional tool to reduce circulating TGF-β1 is required prior to concluding that circulating TGF-β1 is critical in remyelination.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Circulating transforming growth factor-β 1 facilitates remyelination in the adult central nervous system&quot;, Hamaguchi et al. describe the role of TGFbeta 1 on promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. The role of TGFbeta1 in these processes have previously been established, and the authors present data that indeed confirms the role of TGF-beta1 on oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination. The authors suggest that circulating TGF-beta1 is important in remyelination, which would be a very interesting observation. Unfortunately, I don't consider that the data on the current manuscript is conclusive and the authors would need to provide much further substantiation for this hypothesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors embark in a pharmacological screen, but the screen is barely mentioned in the results or methods. The authors need to describe the screen in much more detail. Also, it is not clear what is the rationale for focusing on TGF-beta1 rather than other pathways that appear to have a much more robust effect.

The authors provide strong evidence for TGF-β1 signaling promoting oligodendrocyte maturation, but the authors do not account for the influence of TGF-β1 on regulatory T cells in recovery from demyelination. To determine the therapeutic mechanism of circulating TGF-β1, authors should provide a direct link between the therapeutic effect of systemic administration of TGF-β1 and oligodendrocyte expressed TGF-βRI. To establish the therapeutic mechanisms of circulating TGF-β1, authors likely need to systemically administer TGF-β1 to mice with conditional deletion of TGF-βRI in oligodendrocytes following LPC-induced demyelination. Provided systemic administration of TGF-β1 has no therapeutic effect in mice lacking TGF-βRI in oligodendrocytes, authors may conclude that CNS entry of circulating TGF-β1 is required to promote remyelination.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we injected LPC into the spinal cords of oligodendrocyte (OL)-specific TGF-βRI knockout mice (PLP-Cre::TGF-βRI flox) and treated the mice with recombinant mouse TGF-β1. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TGF-β1 treatment did not change the MBP-negative area in the spinal cord 2 weeks after LPC injection (Figure 4E,F), indicating that CNS entry of circulating TGF-β1 is required to promote remyelination. We added these results to subsection “TGF-βRI in oligodendrocytes is involved in spontaneous remyelination”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A weakness of the present study is the use of anti-CD41-induced platelet depletion as the sole method for reducing circulating TGF-β1. The authors determine that depletion of platelets reduces circulating TGF-β1, but they do not account for altering other platelet-dependent effects on remyelination. An additional tool to reduce circulating TGF-β1 is required prior to concluding that circulating TGF-β1 is critical in remyelination.</p></disp-quote><p>We treated wild-type mice with TGF-β neutralizing antibodies and injected LPC into the mice spinal cords. We evaluated the demyelinated area by measuring the MBPnegative area in spinal cord sections. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that mice treated with TGF-β neutralizing antibodies had a larger MBP-negative area than controls (i.e., mice subjected to control IgG treatment, Figure 3F,G), consistent with the results of the platelet depletion experiments (Figure 3B,C). We added the results in subsection “Circulating TGFβ-1 contributes to remyelination in the CNS”.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors embark in a pharmacological screen, but the screen is barely mentioned in the results or methods. The authors need to describe the screen in much more detail. Also, it is not clear what is the rationale for focusing on TGF-beta1 rather than other pathways that appear to have a much more robust effect. Finally, the supplement table 1 is very poorly described, it is not clear what which column refers to, the authors need to explain properly this table.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We screened 160 drugs and found 107 drugs (blue area Panel 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) that did not decrease the abundance of Olig2positive cells (0.5 times lower than control) in the culture after each treatment. We next excluded the drugs that decreased MBP expression (0.5 times lower than control) in the cells by drug treatment or serum treatment (without drug), and identified 17 drugs (please see orange area Panel 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) that downregulated MBP area (2 times lower than control) relative to cells subjected to serum treatment. In this experiment, we searched for a circulating molecule that drives oligodendrocyte maturation directly; therefore, we focused on the TGF-β receptor type I inhibitor (TGF-βRI), the only drug we tested that specifically targets a receptor-type protein. We added this description to the Results section. We also revised Figure 1—source data 1 and the figure legend of source data 1.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41869-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors deplete platelets using anti-CD41 antibodies and observe a reduction of MBP staining 14 days after LPC injection:</p><p>- Depletion of the platelets will most likely not only affect the transport of TGF-beta1, but also of other factors as VEGF, among others.

We believe that the reviewer is asking us whether other platelet-derived factors are involved in remyelination. To answer this question, we must evaluate whether platelet-specific TGF-β1 depletion decreases remyelination efficiency after LPC injection. However, platelet-specific depletion is technically difficult because plateletspecific Cre mice are not available. Hence, as an alternative, we used neutralizing TGF-β1 antibodies. We found that TGF-β1 neutralization prevented remyelination after LPC injection (Figure 3F,G). In addition, we compared the inhibitory ratio of remyelination between TGF-β1 neutralization and platelet depletion, and found that they were comparable (<italic>Pint</italic> = 0.6126, single regression analysis), indicating that TGF-β1 makes a major contribution to remyelination mediated by circulating factors.

As reviewer #2 might have expected, we did not focus on demyelination in this study.

To this end, we collected lymphocytes and splenocytes from EAE mice and re-stimulated the cells with MOG<sub>35-55</sub>peptides in vitro. Evaluation of cytokine expression and cell proliferation activity revealed that TGF-β1 did not change the inflammatory response in our experimental contexts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D).

We investigated the expression of TGF-β1 receptor in the mouse oligodendrocyte culture. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that APClabeled oligodendrocytes express TGF-β1 receptor. We provided a representative image in Figure 1J and revised the Results section accordingly. To determine whether TGFβ1 activates signaling pathway in oligodendrocytes, we stimulated mouse oligodendrocytes with recombinant TGF-β1 and evaluated phosphorylation of the Smad2 protein. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in Smad2 phosphorylation 30 mins after TGF-β1 treatment of oligodendrocytes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G).
