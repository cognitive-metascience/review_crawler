protein expression to specific cell cycle phases. Here, we present an advanced toolbox of cell cycle tag constructs in budding yeast with defined and compatible peak expression that allow comparison of protein functionality at different cell cycle phases. We apply this technology to the question of how and when Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1 nucleases act on DNA replication or recombination structures. Restriction of Mus81-Mms4 to M phase but not S phase allows a <italic>wildtype</italic> response to various forms of replication perturbation and DNA damage in S phase, suggesting it acts as a post-replicative resolvase. Moreover, we use cell cycle tags to reinstall cell cycle control to a deregulated version of Yen1, showing that its premature activation interferes with the response to perturbed replication. Curbing resolvase activity and establishing a hierarchy of resolution mechanisms are therefore the principal reasons underlying resolvase cell cycle regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>joint molecule resolution</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>genome stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matos</surname><given-names>Joao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matos</surname><given-names>Joao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfander</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF794/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfander</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>213249687 – SFB 1064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfander</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The development of an advanced cell cycle tag toolbox will enable a wide variety of cell cycle studies and shows post-replicative function of nucleases resolving replication/recombination structures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic chromosomes undergo dramatic structural changes during the cell cycle often referred to as the chromosome cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blow and Tanaka, 2005</xref>). In order to maintain the integrity of genetic information cells need to adjust their DNA repair and genome integrity pathways to the different requirements within this chromosome cycle. Accordingly, many DNA repair enzymes are regulated by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms or otherwise adjusted to act at specific stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hustedt and Durocher, 2017</xref>). While our knowledge of regulatory mechanisms has grown over the past years, a question that often arises is whether a certain enzyme or protein has a function, or not, at a specific cell cycle stage.</p><p>Answering this question usually involves cell cycle synchronization and sophisticated tools to induce/deplete protein expression at specific time points. Moreover, not all phenotypes can be investigated in single cell cycle experiments. A simple system that promises to overcome these limitations utilizes so called ‘cell cycle tags’. The cell cycle tag methodology was initially developed for budding yeast by the Jentsch group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Karras and Jentsch, 2010</xref>) and expanded by Kolodner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hombauer et al., 2011</xref>) and Kubota and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Cell cycle tagging involves both the replacement of the endogenous promoter of a gene of interest by a cell cycle-regulated promoter as well as the addition of a protein-coding sequence containing a cell cycle-regulated degradation signal (degron), restricting the expression of the fusion protein to a specific phase of the cell cycle. So far, three cell cycle tags have been developed based on the S phase cyclin Clb6, the M phase cyclin Clb2 and the G1 regulator Sic1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Karras and Jentsch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hombauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). These tags constrain protein expression to S phase, early M phase and late M to G1 phase, respectively. Single constructs, and also combinations have been used in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Karras and Jentsch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hombauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Karras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">González-Prieto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gonzalez-Huici et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Menolfi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Renaud-Young et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Siler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kahli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lockhart et al., 2019</xref>). Notwithstanding, the current three-construct-system has major limitations: (i) peak expression levels from the three constructs are vastly different (Sic1 &gt; Clb2 &gt; Clb6, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and (ii) expression levels cannot be adjusted, which can lead to under- or overexpression of the protein of interest. Collectively, these limitations may confound the interpretation of cell cycle tag experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An advanced toolbox of cell cycle tag constructs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the applied strategies for improved cell cycle tag methodology.

To achieve these variations in expression, we have used additional promoters/degrons from cyclins Clb5 and Clb1 and introduced chimeric constructs with new promoter/degron combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, in order to cripple expression from specific promoters, we introduced 5’UTR truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Merrick and Pavitt, 2018</xref>) and upstream out of frame ATGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araujo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dvir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This construct toolbox will allow comparable and, within a certain range, titratable expression of the protein of interest.</p><p>As a proof of principle, we applied the advanced cell cycle tag toolbox to study the regulation of two structure-selective endonucleases (SSEs), Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1. SSEs are involved in many DNA repair pathways and defined by their ability to recognize and cleave branched DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ciccia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schwartz and Heyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dehé and Gaillard, 2017</xref>). While required for the corresponding repair mechanisms, it is obvious that cells must also tightly control SSEs, as unscheduled activation of nucleolytic activities might lead to genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dehé and Gaillard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pfander and Matos, 2017</xref>). A number of SSEs have the ability to cleave Holliday junction (HJ) structures and are therefore involved in processing DNA intermediates arising during homologous recombination (HR) and/or as consequence of replication stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kaliraman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastin-Shanower et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciccia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fricke and Brill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gaillard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehmsen and Heyer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jessop and Lichten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Oh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Muñoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rass et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wechsler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Saugar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Saugar et al., 2017</xref>).

This phosphorylation is mediated by the budding yeast cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) Cdk1/Cdc28 and by a complex consisting of two kinases – polo-like kinase Cdc5 and Dbf4-dependent kinase DDK (Cdc7+Dbf4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gallo-Fernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szakal and Branzei, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Princz et al., 2017</xref>), whereby the timing of Cdc5 expression determines the M phase restriction of Mms4 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Princz et al., 2017</xref>). Cell cycle regulation impinges on Mus81-Mms4 by two mechanisms. While phosphorylation of Mus81-Mms4 directly stimulates its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gallo-Fernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2013</xref>), a second layer of cell cycle regulation requires the engagement of Mus81-Mms4 in a phosphorylation-dependent multi-protein complex comprising several scaffold proteins such as Slx4, Dpb11 and Rtt107 (referred to as Mus81 complex hereafter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gritenaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Princz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Princz et al., 2017</xref>). The Mus81 complex forms exclusively during M phase and is likely involved in targeting Mus81-Mms4 to its substrates or controlling its action by other means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gritenaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Princz et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, phosphorylation of Mus81-Mms4 and formation of the Mus81 complex displays features commonly associated with switch-like activation (positive feedback, multi-site phosphorylation), suggesting that with the transition to M phase cells might enter a state of increased Mus81-Mms4 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pfander and Matos, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Princz et al., 2017</xref>) (note that function in vivo will not only be determined by enzymatic activity, but also by targeting of the enzyme to its substrate, etc). Notably, however, <italic>mus81</italic> mutant phenotypes suggest that the main function of Mus81-Mms4 can be attributed to the response to replication perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Xiao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Interthal and Heyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mullen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastin-Shanower et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kai et al., 2005</xref>). This raises the question, whether (i) Mus81-Mms4 may be acting in S phase directly on stalled replication forks or repair intermediates, despite a non-matching temporal regulation, or whether (ii) Mus81-Mms4 acts in M phase as post-replicative resolvase.</p><p>A second SSE with the propensity to cleave HJ structures is called Yen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ip et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanco et al., 2010</xref>). Yen1 is also tightly cell cycle-controlled and becomes dephosphorylated in late M phase, specifically at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, when CDK becomes inactivated and phosphorylation marks on Yen1 are removed by Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kosugi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eissler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">García-Luis et al., 2014</xref>). Yen1 regulation consists of several layers and involves phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of its catalytic activity as well as phosphorylation-dependent regulation of its sub-cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eissler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">García-Luis et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, at the G1/S transition a degradation mechanism is in place to clear Yen1 from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Talhaoui et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, a picture emerges whereby Yen1 is inhibited by CDK phosphorylation and becomes stimulated or activated from late M phase to the end of G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eissler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">García-Luis et al., 2014</xref>). The temporal windows of high Mus81-Mms4 activity and high Yen1 activity therefore appear non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>). Experimental removal of the inhibitory phosphorylation sites on Yen1 generated an allele (<italic>YEN1-ON)</italic>, where Yen1 was found to be uncoupled from cell cycle regulation and constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>). This allele allowed to study the consequences of unrestricted activation of an SSE and showed that ectopic nuclease activity has adverse consequences in presence of replication stalling agents, suggesting that unscheduled cleavage of replication intermediates by this SSE interferes with the response to replication stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The control of SSEs in human cells involves additional features, such as the presence of two mutually exclusive MUS81 regulators (called EME1 and EME2), but the principal mechanisms of control appear to be evolutionary conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan and West, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duda et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that cell cycle control of SSEs is an intrinsic necessity. In this study, we take advantage of the genetic tractability of budding yeast to expand, improve and apply cell cycle tag technology with an advanced toolbox of cell cycle tag constructs to investigate the relevance of Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1 cell cycle regulation. We show that several survival and genome instability phenotypes induced by chronic or acute exposure to DNA damaging agents or other genotoxic agents are rescued by M phase restricted Mus81-Mms4, but not by a version that is confined to S phase. This suggests that for the conditions tested, the essential function of Mus81-Mms4 is as a post-replicative resolvase. Yen1 can compensate for this function, if present in constitutively active form in early M phase. We also employ cell cycle tags to reintroduce cell cycle regulation and find that premature activation of Yen1 in S phase, but also in early M phase interferes with the response to replication fork stalling, suggesting that a temporal hierarchy of HJ-cleaving nucleases is required for optimal DNA repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An advanced toolbox of cell cycle tags</title><p>When we started this study, three cell cycle tag constructs were available to restrict target protein expression to G1, S or M phase. The S-tag uses promoter and N-terminal degron (aa 1–195) of the S phase cyclin Clb6 and restricts expression to S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hombauer et al., 2011</xref>). The M-tag (originally referred to as G2-tag; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Karras and Jentsch, 2010</xref>) uses promoter and N-terminal degron sequence (aa 1–180) of the M phase cyclin Clb2 and restricts expression to M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Karras and Jentsch, 2010</xref>). The G1-tag uses promoter and N-terminal degron of the G1 regulator Sic1 (aa 1–105) and restricts protein expression to G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). In order to overcome the limitations of these specific constructs and allow for modulation of expression levels we generated a toolbox of 46 cell cycle tag constructs. Specifically, we used a three-pronged approach to create constructs that at the same time allow varied peak expression levels and retained cell cycle restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): (i) we used additional promoters and N-terminal degron sequences from S phase cyclin Clb5 (aa 1–202) and from M phase cyclin Clb1 (aa 1–120); (ii) we generated chimeric S-tag and M-tag constructs (containing Clb5 promoter and Clb6 degron (Clb6<sup>pClb5</sup>-tag) or Clb1 promoter and Clb2 degron (Clb2<sup>pClb1</sup>-tag), respectively); (iii) in order to cripple expression from some promoters, we either truncated 5’UTRs or introduced out-of-frame ATGs, which have been shown to reduce protein expression levels by reduced mRNA stability and reduced translation rates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araujo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dvir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Merrick and Pavitt, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We constructed 46 plasmids based on the pYM-N vector series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Janke et al., 2004</xref>) that allow the introduction of all variants of cell cycle tags by a well-established recombination-based strategy using a single pair of oligonucleotide primers and the natNT2 resistance cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, see supplementary methods for detailed protocol). As test substrate, we subjected the GFP ORF, which was integrated in the yeast genome, to the cell cycle tagging approach and the resulting yeast strains were verified for genomic integration and expression. Next, we tested whether all constructs restricted protein expression to the desired cell cycle phases. Therefore, we arrested cells in G1 using α-factor, synchronously released them into the cell cycle and followed them to the next G1. Notably, all constructs restricted GFP-expression to the target cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When comparing the different S-tag constructs, we noticed that constructs containing the Clb6 degron sequence imposed a much sharper restriction of expression to S phase consistent with the differential regulation of Clb5 and Clb6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kühne and Linder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schwob and Nasmyth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that these constructs should be the preferred choice for an S-tag experiment.</p><p>We then took S, M and G1 phase samples (20, 50 and 100 min, respectively) from our cell cycle release experiments in order to measure peak expression levels for the individual constructs. This analysis showed that within different G1-, S- and M-tag constructs expression varied by up to 10-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, none of the S-tag constructs tested gave peak expression levels in the same range as those of the previously used Clb2 M-tag and Sic1 G1-tag constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), emphasizing the need for new M- and G1-tag constructs. Satisfyingly, we found that M-tag constructs containing the pClb1 promoter or the 5’UTR-truncated pClb2 promoter showed much weaker peak expression levels and tighter temporal restriction of expression at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Similarly, for the G1-tag we found that upstream out-of-frame ATGs reduced protein expression from pSic1 constructs and also led to tighter temporal restriction of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, these constructs from our advanced cell cycle tag toolbox will allow to titrate peak expression levels within a certain range and offer at the same time superior restriction of target protein expression to the cell cycle phase of interest. We also note that by introducing cell cycle-restricted expression, one will usually change expression of the protein of interest from a continuous, often constant expression regime to a dynamically, cell cycle phase-restricted expression regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Due to this dynamic expression it may sometimes be difficult to directly compare cell cycle-tagged constructs with endogenous proteins, as well as the arising phenotypes. To mitigate this problem, we therefore developed a strategy where we conducted experiments with two sets of G1-, S- and M-tag constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The first set (called ‘low’ hereafter) can be chosen to yield peak expression similar to the protein of interest but may show ‘under-expression’ at cell cycle transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The second set (called ‘high’ hereafter) can be chosen to yield peak expression higher to the protein of interest (overexpression) but will avoid under-expression at cell cycle transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Most importantly, with the presented toolbox it will be possible to use constructs, which give highly similar peak expression levels in different cell cycle phases and the respective strains are therefore phenotypically comparable. Protein expression should be tested for any new cell cycle-tagged protein, even though we observed similar trends for different proteins tested. For example, we found that S phase levels of Clb6<sup>pClb6</sup>-tagged proteins were very similar to levels of Clb2<sup>pClb1</sup>-tagged proteins in five (Xrs2, Rad52, Fun30, Sgs1, Yen1-ON) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) out of six cases (Mus81-Mms4 being the exception). Overall, our advanced cell cycle tag toolbox therefore offers titratable expression levels, which allows for the first time a direct comparison of phenotypes arising from cell cycle restriction of a protein of interest to G1, S or M phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell cycle-restricted expression of Mus81-Mms4</title><p>To showcase the cell cycle tag toolbox, we applied it to Mus81-Mms4.

In contrast, Mus81-Mms4 function is specifically upregulated once cells enter M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gallo-Fernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Saugar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szakal and Branzei, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gritenaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Princz et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore decided to employ our toolbox to discriminate between potential S phase- and M phase-specific functions of Mus81-Mms4. In addition to the strategy outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we constructed cell cycle tags for both subunits of the Mus81-Mms4 heterodimer, as we reasoned that this would result in even tighter cell cycle restriction of the complex. Specifically, we found that Clb6<sup>pClb6 -80bp</sup>-tagged and Clb2<sup>pClb1 -150bp</sup>-tagged versions of Mus81-Mms4 restricted Mus81-Mms4 expression to S and M phase and resulted in very similar peak expression levels between 0.9 and 1.2-fold of the endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). We therefore refer to these versions as S<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 (Clb6<sup>pClb6 -80bp</sup>-tag) and M<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 (Clb2<sup>pClb1 -150bp</sup>-tag), respectively. While peak expression levels are comparable to endogenous Mus81-Mms4, we observed reduced expression levels at cell cycle transitions. For example, we observed that expression of M<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 was below endogenous levels in early M phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 37.5 and 45 min time points). The same trend was also observed for the nuclear fraction of Mus81-Mms4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistently, the window of time during which we could observe the M phase specific, hyperphosphorylated form of Mms4 was shorter for M<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 compared to endogenous Mus81-Mms4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, M<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 peak expression is comparable to endogenous Mus81-Mms4, but expression and hyperphosphorylation appears reduced in early and late M phase. To complement S<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 and M<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4, we therefore also used the Clb5<sup>pClb6</sup>-tagged S phase-restricted S<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4, as well as Clb2<sup>pClb1</sup>-tagged M phase-restricted M<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of peak expression levels in S and M phase suggests that S<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 and M<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 are expressed to very similar levels, but 2 to 5-fold overexpressed compared to endogenous Mus81-Mms4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Both constructs showed expected restriction of expression to S and M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and when we compared M<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 to M<sup>low</sup>-Mus81-Mms4, we noticed that the M<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 did neither show underexpression in early M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), nor a shortened window of M phase-specific Mms4 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, S<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 and M<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 constructs are expressed to similar levels, avoid under-expression at cell cycle transitions, but show overexpression compared to endogenous expression levels. The two sets of S- and M-tag constructs are therefore complementary and enable us to follow the high/low expression strategy outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> to investigate Mus81-Mms4 phenotypes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cell cycle-restricted expression of Mus81-Mms4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Restriction of Mus81-Mms4 expression to S or M phase of matched pairs of ‘low’ and ‘high’ expressing cell cycle tag constructs. (Left) Western blot and DNA content analysis of strains expressing WT, S phase-restricted (S<sup>low</sup> (Clb6<sup>pClb6 -80bp</sup>)-/S<sup>high</sup> (Clb6<sup>pClb5</sup>)-Mus81-Mms4) and M phase-restricted (M<sup>low</sup> (Clb2<sup>pClb1 -150bp</sup>)-/M<sup>high</sup> (Clb2<sup>pClb1</sup>)-Mus81-Mms4) alleles of Mus81 (9MYC-tagged)-Mms4 (3FLAG-tagged) during a single cell cycle as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for quantification of peak expression levels of the S<sup>low</sup>-/M<sup>low</sup> -Mus81-Mms4 and S<sup>high</sup>-/M<sup>high</sup>-Mus81-Mms4 constructs).

Deregulated Yen1-ON is able to complement phenotypes of the <italic>MUS81</italic> deletion mutant such as MMS hypersensitivity, suggesting that both resolvases display a degree of functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>).

We therefore tested the cell cycle-restricted versions of Yen1-ON for MMS hypersensitivity and found that restriction of Yen1-ON expression to late M and G1 using the G1<sup>high</sup>-Yen1-ON or G1<sup>low</sup>-Yen1-ON construct did not yield hypersensitivity, no matter whether cells were chronically exposed to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or treated with a pulse of MMS during S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that restricting Yen1-ON expression to those cell cycle phases where the protein would normally be in its dephosphorylated form is sufficient to suppress the MMS hypersensitivity phenotype. In contrast, Yen1-ON expression in S or M phase caused MMS hypersensitivity that was similar to what was observed with unrestricted expression of Yen1-ON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Notably, Yen1-ON phenotypes depend strongly and in a dose-dependent manner on its expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; MG Blanco, personal communication). Consistently, we saw slightly increased MMS hypersensitivity in S<sup>high</sup>-Yen1-ON and M<sup>high</sup>-Yen1-ON compared to S<sup>low</sup>-Yen1-ON and M<sup>low</sup>-Yen1-ON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that (i) the presence of deregulated Yen1 in S phase is detrimental to the cellular response to replication stalling and that (ii) deregulated Yen1 in M phase is detrimental as well but can at the same time partially compensate for the absence of Mus81-Mms4. Overall, the cell cycle tag approach therefore demonstrated that the dominant functions of Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1 manifest in those cell cycle phases – M phase and late M/G1 phase, respectively – where the proteins also become stimulated by PTM modification/demodification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>An advanced toolbox of cell cycle tags</title><p>Cell cycle tags are a straightforward method to restrict protein expression to specific cell cycle phases. The toolbox of constructs presented here allows straightforward introduction of cell cycle tags at the locus of interest within the budding yeast genome using standard recombination-based techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Knop et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Janke et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, with constructs that vary in peak expression, our cell cycle tag toolbox allows for the first time to restrict protein expression to different cell cycle phases and at similar peak expression levels. Similar peak expression levels are necessary, if one wants to compare phenotypes arising from restricting protein expression to different cell cycle phases or tries to unravel at which cell cycle phase a protein exhibits its essential function. To allow titration of expression levels, our cell cycle tag toolbox currently contains a total of 46 cell cycle tag constructs, with the upper expression limit being determined by cyclin promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). So far, we have used these constructs to restrict expression of 13 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; JB and BP unpublished data). Based on this experience, we suggest the following experimental workflow: (i) Compare peak expression levels of cell cycle-restricted constructs to endogenously expressed protein. Here, a western blot against 3FLAG-tagged protein might be used (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref> for pYM-3FLAG tagging constructs). (ii) Due to the dynamic expression regime, a given cell cycle-tagged construct is unlikely to give endogenous expression levels throughout the cell cycle phase of interest. This problem is further aggravated if experimental conditions are varied (for example: growth on liquid vs solid media, cell cycle arrest, or drug treatment activating cell cycle checkpoints). Therefore, we suggest finding triples of S-, M- and G1-tag constructs (or sometimes pairs) with similar peak expression levels. Furthermore, we advise to select two sets of triples/pairs (called ‘low’ and ‘high’ throughout the manuscript), which vary in peak expression levels and thereby allow to separate phenotypes arising from under- or overexpression from those arising from cell cycle restriction. Although expression may vary for individual proteins, combinations of constructs that regularly gave us similar peak expression levels are Clb6<sup>pClb6</sup> (or Clb6<sup>pClb5</sup>), Clb2<sup>pClb1</sup>, Sic1<sup>pSic1 -20bp</sup> for the high expressing set and Clb6<sup>pClb6 -80bp</sup>, Clb2<sup>pClb2-60bp</sup> (or Clb2<sup>pClb1 -150bp</sup>), Sic1<sup>pSic1 u(ATA)ATG</sup> for the low set. (iii) Genetics will often indicate whether N-terminal tagging is compatible with protein function as such, but an additional control for the functionality of the tagged constructs is desirable. For Mus81-Mms4 we used cleavage of DNA junctions in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Collectively these considerations are expected to allow interpretation of the cell cycle restriction experiment and reveal cell cycle stage-specific functionality of the protein of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The essential function of the structure-selective nuclease Mus81-Mms4 manifests in M phase</title><p>Phenotypic analysis suggests that Mus81-Mms4 plays a major role in the response to replication stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Xiao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Interthal and Heyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mullen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastin-Shanower et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Saugar et al., 2013</xref>).

For example, it is possible that Mus81-Mms4 might act on replication forks that persist until M phase, similar to what has been shown for MUS81 in human cells, which acts in the MIDAS pathway to process replication forks at sites of under-replicated DNA and to thereby initiate repair by BIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duda et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, Mus81-Mms4 may also act at a later step in BIR to switch from an extending D-loop mechanism of DNA synthesis to a type of DNA synthesis that is more similar to canonical DNA replication, a model that has been suggested by a study in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we observed using the same experimental set-up as Mayle et al. that M phase-restricted Mus81-Mms4 is entirely sufficient for survival after induction of the Flp-nickase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), suggesting that a possible function of Mus81-Mms4 in BIR takes place in M phase thus bearing a similar cell cycle profile as MIDAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>). In line with our conclusions, and while this manuscript was in preparation, the Pasero and Aguilera labs published a preprint showing by several approaches a post-replicative function of Mus81-Mms4 in response to replication blockage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pardo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We emphasize that our study can by no means rule out that Mus81-Mms4 also functions in S phase. However, at least in budding yeast we are not aware of any data in the current literature that would necessitate to evoke such an S phase function for Mus81-Mms4. This raises the question of whether budding yeast Mus81-Mms4 can serve as a paradigm for other species. The fact that human MUS81 complexes are cell cycle regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wyatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duda et al., 2016</xref>) suggests that Mus81-Mms4 with its essential M phase function may indeed be a good model for the Mus81 biology in other organisms. However, we caution that additional regulatory mechanisms exist in other systems. Fission yeast Mus81-Eme1 harbours for example an additional layer of control by the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boddy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Froget et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehé et al., 2013</xref>). Human MUS81 has two accessory subunits (EME1 and EME2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciccia et al., 2003</xref>), which are likely differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duda et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, there is overwhelming genetic data showing that in human cells MUS81 is required for the cellular response to replication perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Regairaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fugger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Naim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Ying et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pepe and West, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Xing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lemaçon et al., 2017</xref>). While some of these data could be explained by a role for MUS81 as a post-replicative resolvase – similar to what is shown here for the budding yeast protein – an earlier role at stalled replication forks in S phase cannot be excluded. Perhaps the strongest case for an S phase function of human MUS81 is made by several genetic studies showing that cells depleted for MUS81 display perturbed DNA replication, a constitutive DNA damage response and defects in the response to replication perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Regairaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buisson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). These phenotypes could arise from a direct function at replication forks in S phase (perhaps in processing/cleavage of stalled replication forks), which would then be absent from the budding yeast system (or so far elusive). Since at this stage a possible indirect effect upon MUS81 deletion or depletion can also not be excluded, we suggest that methodologies analogous to the cell cycle tag system described here might be useful to ascertain the relative contribution of M and S phase functions in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Premature resolvase activation is detrimental to the response to replication stalling</title><p>A second and so far under-utilized application of cell cycle tags is to install de novo cell cycle regulation on a deregulated mutant protein. We demonstrated this strategy using the deregulated <italic>YEN1-ON</italic> allele of the Yen1 resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, we showed that the previously described MMS hypersensitivity phenotype of <italic>YEN1-ON</italic> cells is generated by premature activation of Yen1 in S and early M phase. These data corroborate the importance of restricting post-translational activation of Yen1 specifically to late M and G1 phase. They also argue against Yen1 having a function in S phase and raise the question about what detrimental effects premature resolvase activation might be causing.</p><p>Interestingly, these data suggest that differences between the Mus81-Mms4- and Yen1-dependent mechanisms exist and fit to both enzymes having distinct temporal activation profiles.

Furthermore, temporal activation establishes hierarchy in the corresponding resolution/dissolution mechanisms. In particular, we favour a three-tiered hierarchy for enzymes that process recombination intermediates: first, STR-dependent dissolution is fully active in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Versini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bizard and Hickson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grigaitis et al., 2020</xref>), second, Mus81-Mms4 gets stimulated in early M and third, Yen1 would become activated only in late M and as a measure of last resort. Such a hierarchy could be a means to counteract cross-overs and loss-of-heterozygosity in mitotically dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Matos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szakal and Branzei, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>), but it may simply reflect differential efficiency of competing molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, it is possible that the three mechanisms are directed towards distinct substrates. In order to identify the exact nature of these substrates, molecular genetic assays will be necessary and we suggest they be carried out with very precise genetic perturbation provided by cell cycle tag methodology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pierre-Henri Gaillard (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper by Bittmann et al., an advanced cell cycle tag toolbox reveals principles underlying temporal control of structure-selective nucleases, and a powerful strategy is developed to analyze the requirement of structure selective endonucleases, in particular, Mus81-Mms4 during the cell cycle in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This is achieved by inducing the expression of these genes by cell cycle-dependent promoters and by inactivating the proteins by cell cycle-dependent degradation (degrons). By combining the use of various cyclin promoters, N-terminal cyclin degrons and truncations of the 5'-UTR of their constructs, they have generated a set of 42 cell cycle tags that not only often allow for a tighter restraint of the production of a protein to G1, S or M-phase than previously developed cell-cycle tag strategies, but also allow for some degree of control on protein expression levels.</p><p>The authors conclude that the expression of Mus81-Mms4 in M-phase but not in S phase is required for function (resolution of DNA damage). This is mainly a confirmation, with several functional assays, of previous studies showing the stimulation of Mus81-Mms4 in late G2/M. Mus81-Mms4 activity is thus concluded to be post-replicative and not to be required during S phase.</p><p>This is an impressive piece of work and the manuscript is overall clearly written with data that are, for the most part, robust and rather convincing.</p><p>However, several aspects of the paper have to be revised and improved in order to provide convincing interpretations and conclusions, and thus to present data going beyond the confirmation and validation of previously established cell-cycle regulation of these activities.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have used constructs with high and low expression levels for Mus81-Mms4. As they discuss in the paper (subsection “An advanced toolbox of cell cycle tags”), having an endogenous expression level is important. As shown in Figure 2 S<sub>high</sub> and M<sub>high</sub> constructs have expression levels higher than endogenous whereas S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> have expression levels closer to endogenous. Therefore, all results should be based on S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> constructs. Experiments with these constructs should be presented in the main figures (including the assays presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4) and should be the core of the discussion for phenotype analysis and comparison with the <italic>mus81Δ</italic> strain. S<sub>high</sub> and M<sub>high</sub> could be included in supplementary material.</p><p>Note that in subsection “Cell cycle-restriction of Mus81-Mms4 reveals its essential function during M phase”, with 4-5 fold for Mus81 and 2-3 fold for Mms4 higher expression levels, use of &quot;highly&quot; and &quot;moderately&quot;, respectively, would be more appropriate than &quot;slightly&quot;. How was this quantified? No explanation is provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>In relation to this issue, how is phosphorylated Mms4 quantified? The 2-3 fold higher expression level seems by eye may be under-estimated, compared to the 4-5 fold higher expression level of Mus81. It would be worth loading gels of phosphatase treated samples to facilitate the quantification of single bands rather than of smears.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors write about the &quot;activation&quot; of Mus81-Mms4 in late G2 and M-phase. This is misleading since it suggests that the enzyme is inactive in other phases of the cell-cycle. The use of &quot;up-regulation&quot; would seem more appropriate.</p><p>3) The question of the role of Mus81-Mms4 in S phase is a central issue in this paper, several revisions should be made: In a few experiments, the M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 construct does not fully rescue the phenotype of a Mus81-deletion. This suggests that M phase restriction is limiting the function of this complex. Other interpretation could be the effect of the tags. In addition, some phenotypes are partially suppressed by S<sub>high</sub> constructs. Here, again at least two alternative interpretations: either Mus81-Mms4 has an S phase function, or its expression after S, explains the phenotype. This question is expected to be solved with the use of S<sub>low</sub> constructs however.</p><p>If the expression of S<sub>low</sub> construct still partially suppresses phenotypes, the authors should test the expression of an S phase restricted construct of Mms4(8A). An S phase function would not be expected to be sensitive to the alteration of phospho-sites.</p><p>The authors should test lower concentrations of CPT and MMS with the S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> constructs as this might allow revealing an S-phase contribution of Mus81-Mms4.</p><p>In relation to these questions, the author should explain and provide experimental interpretation for the lack of suppression by M<sub>low</sub> at high MMS and CPT concentration (Figure 2D).</p><p>4) In terms of presenting the data and presenting conclusions, some revisions should be made.</p><p>First for data presentation:</p><p>– In the text, the authors oversimplify in a biased manner the results of the data of some of the experiments and the text does not match the data on the figures:</p><p>– Subsection “Cell cycle-restriction of Mus81-Mms4 reveals its essential function during M phase”, &quot;<italic>mus81Δ</italic> were hypersensitive to all agents&quot;: this does not really show for HU.</p><p>– Subsection “Cell cycle-restriction of Mus81-Mms4 reveals its essential function during M phase”, &quot;Restricting Mus81-Mms4 to S phase generated hypersensitivity that was similar to what we observed in <italic>mus81Δ&quot;</italic>: this is not correct.</p><p>– Please check other figures and text for the description of data.</p><p>For interpretations:</p><p>– The authors do acknowledge that an S phase function of Mus81-Mms4 cannot be excluded, but the overall tone leaves the reader with the idea that it only acts in M-phase. This also applies to the Abstract, where the Mus81-Mms4 is concluded to act as a post-replicative resolvase. There are a couple of studies (Fu et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2015) that show that MUS81 is required for optimal replication dynamics in human cells (assessed by fiber analysis). It is difficult to imagine how MUS81 could contribute to replication fork progression measured in DNA combing experiments if it only acts in mitosis. The authors should discuss this to leave the door open for possible functions of Mus81-Mms4 in S-phase that they have not identified with their experimental setup. The implication in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in BIR (Mayle et al., 2014) also suggests activity on replicating chromatids. If the authors want to conclude definitively on this issue, they have to provide a molecular assay for Mus81-Mms4 activity with a kinetic study to follow in parallel cell cycle progression.</p><p>5) A major issue is that although the authors show very clearly how the proteins of interest are expressed under the various cell-specific constructs (Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B), they do not show the expression in the conditions used for functional assays, i.e. after MMS and CPT treatment. The authors have to show that expression is as expected after MMS and CPT, for S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> constructs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An advanced cell cycle tag toolbox reveals principles underlying temporal control of structure-selective nucleases&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>We thank the authors for the extensive revisions and additional work. The result is an impressive, convincing and high-quality paper.</p><p>We agree with the removal of Cdc5 experiments which as the authors note appears to add additional unknown to the analysis. The presentation is quite clear, and we understand the interest of providing both High and Low constructs for assaying the various phenotypes.</p><p>One slight modification seems to be important:</p><p>The molecular assays in Figure 4B and C are an important step in the analysis. Visually, one can see differences in band intensities, but it is really impossible to evaluate the significance without the quantification that measures the ratio of the two bands.

As they discuss in the paper (subsection “An advanced toolbox of cell cycle tags”), having an endogenous expression level is important. As shown in Figure 2 S<sub>high</sub> and M<sub>high</sub> constructs have expression levels higher than endogenous whereas S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> have expression levels closer to endogenous. Therefore, all results should be based on S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> constructs. Experiments with these constructs should be presented in the main figures (including the assays presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4) and should be the core of the discussion for phenotype analysis and comparison with the mus81Δ strain. S<sub>high</sub> and M<sub>high</sub> could be included in supplementary material.</p><p>Note that in subsection “Cell cycle-restriction of Mus81-Mms4 reveals its essential function during M phase”, with 4-5 fold for Mus81 and 2-3 fold for Mms4 higher expression levels, use of &quot;highly&quot; and &quot;moderately&quot;, respectively, would be more appropriate than &quot;slightly&quot;.</p><p>How was this quantified? No explanation is provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>In relation to this issue, how is phosphorylated Mms4 quantified? The 2-3 fold higher expression level seems by eye may be under-estimated, compared to the 4-5 fold higher expression level of Mus81. It would be worth loading gels of phosphatase treated samples to facilitate the quantification of single bands rather than of smears.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting the issue of expression levels. Indeed, the major technological aim of our study was to improve the cell cycle tag methodology by developing a toolbox of cell cycle tag constructs that allows titrating expression levels. Moreover, we aimed to not only give researchers experimental tools at hand, but also a workflow they can apply when studying the function of their protein of interest. Expression levels and their influence on phenotypes have been largely disregarded in previous studies and this may have led to misinterpretation. We therefore hope that our paper will establish a new gold standard for future cell cycle tag studies.</p><p>Specifically, we would like to point out that it is important to consider two aspects when “replacing” a continuously (constantly) expressed protein with a dynamically expressed, cell cycle-restricted protein. The first is – as the reviewers point out – the peak expression level, the second aspect is the dynamicity of expression (“How quickly does protein expression rise?”). We fear that the initial presentation of our manuscript has led the reviewers to focus very much on peak expression levels, while the dynamic aspect has received less attention. We apologize for this misunderstanding and have therefore included an additional theoretical paragraph (subsection “An advanced toolbox of cell cycle tags”) on our strategy for cell cycle-tag experiments (Combination of “High” and “Low” expressing tags (see below and Figure 1D)) and additional data to validate our approach (Figure 2B-C).</p><p>Essentially, our strategy is based on the assumption that with current tools it is impossible to generate a version of your protein of interest that altogether (a) is tightly cell cycle restricted, (b) has a peak expression similar to endogenous levels and (c) is constantly expressed throughout a specific cell cycle phase. This assumption was verified by the following experimental observations (see also our response to point #3).</p><p>i) We observed that constructs with peak expression levels comparable to that of the endogenous protein (we call those “Low” constructs throughout the manuscript) showed underexpression at cell cycle transitions. For example, M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 which peaks in expression in mid M phase (50-60 min after G1 release, Figure 2A), is underexpressed in early M phase (35-45 min after G1 release, new Figure 2B) and this results in a shortened window during which we can detect hyperphosphorylated Mus81-Mms4 in M phase (new Figure 2C).</p><p>ii) We conduct additional experiments (as detailed below in the response to point #3) to verify that the small DNA damage hypersensitivity of M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 expressing cells (which is not observed in M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 expressing cells) is due to underexpression in M phase. Conversely, we show that the small difference in DNA damage sensitivity of S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 expressing cells and <italic>mus81Δ</italic> cells (which is not observed in S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 expressing cells) comes from slight leakage of expression of this construct into M phase.</p><p>To mitigate this deficit, we suggest a strategy that involves two sets of cell cycle tagged constructs (as shown in Figure 1D, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2) at different expression levels. The first set (we call it “Low” throughout the manuscript) will give peak expression levels similar to endogenous expression levels and is tightly restricted, but suffers from potential “underexpression” at cell cycle transitions. The second set (we call it “High” throughout the manuscript) will give peak expression levels higher than endogenous protein levels (“overexpression”) and likely less tight restriction, but avoids “underexpression” at cell cycle transitions. Conclusions should then be based on the collective results of the two datasets, which allows to implement the influence of both peak expression levels and expression dynamics.</p><p>For this reason, and in this specific case, we do not follow the reviewers’ suggestion to base our conclusion exclusively on the “Low” set of tags. Indeed, we have undergone a major effort to be able to present all experiments side-by-side in the “High” and “Low” background for both Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1, including new genetic experiments in Figure 4A, B, D, E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and Figure 5B-D.</p><p>Regarding the technical sub-points:</p><p>i) We fully agree with the reviewers that the phrase “slightly overexpressed” was badly chosen, particularly as it contrasts with our “High”/“Low” nomenclature and we corrected usage throughout the manuscript.</p><p>ii) We quantified protein levels at individual timepoints using ImageJ. First, protein levels of Mus81 or Mms4 were normalized to the Pgk1 loading control. Normalized protein levels of Mus81 or Mms4 were then expressed as fold difference to the corresponding WT sample and the two analysed timepoints were averaged. We have now included a detailed description in the figure legends. In case of Mms4, we have quantified the signal over the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein species.</p><p>iii) We appreciate the reviewers’ concern that the presence of several bands (or even a smear) may complicate quantification. It would be indeed problematic, if we compared Mms4 levels from M phase (two bands) with Mms4 from G1 or S phase (one band). Comparing Mms4 levels between different M phase samples appears not to be associated with large inaccuracies and we verified this under gel conditions were phosphorylated and unphosphorylated species collapsed to one band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Lastly, we would like to mention that we observed roughly similar trends for Mus81 and Mms4 constructs, supporting our conclusion (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of Mus81 and Mms4 levels after resolving and non-resolving gel running conditions.</title><p>Expression levels were quantified using Image-J and signals at the individual timepoints were divided by the corresponding Pgk1 sample to normalize to overall protein levels. Normalized protein levels were compared to WT expression at the corresponding timepoint (fold difference) and the resulting fold difference is depicted in the graphs below the western blots. For the mitotic Mms4 samples (M<sub>low</sub>-Mms4 and M<sub>high</sub>-Mms4) the analysis was done both after resolving (4-12% gel, 90min) and after non-resolving (12% gel, 25 min) gel conditions to show the validity of quantifying phosphorylated Mms4 signals. The Mus81 and S phase Mms4 samples were run with resolving gel conditions only. A, Quantification of peak expression levels from Figure 2—figure supplement 1, extended by an analysis with non-resolving gel conditions for the mitotic Mms4 samples.

This is misleading since it suggests that the enzyme is inactive in other phases of the cell-cycle. The use of &quot;up-regulation&quot; would seem more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is important to use correct wording in order to express what happens to Mus81-Mms4 in M phase. “Activation” could be misleading if interpreted in terms of a digital on/off model. “Upregulation” is, however, also misleading as in the life sciences it is usually interpreted as increased expression (we verified that up-regulation would lead to misconception with several “test readers” that were unfamiliar with the story). We think that “enhanced/increased/upregulated Mus81 function” would be better and we have now used this term throughout the manuscript. We define Mus81 function as its “ability to find, recognize and cleave DNA joint molecule structures” (subsection “Cell cycle-restricted expression of Mus81-Mms4”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The question of the role of Mus81-Mms4 in S phase is a central issue in this paper, several revisions should be made: In a few experiments, the M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 construct does not fully rescue the phenotype of a Mus81-deletion. This suggests that M phase restriction is limiting the function of this complex. Other interpretation could be the effect of the tags. In addition, some phenotypes are partially suppressed by S<sub>high</sub> constructs. Here, again at least two alternative interpretations: either Mus81-Mms4 has an S phase function, or its expression after S, explains the phenotype. This question is expected to be solved with the use of S<sub>low</sub> constructs however.</p><p>If the expression of S<sub>low</sub> construct still partially suppresses phenotypes, the authors should test the expression of an S phase restricted construct of Mms4(8A). An S phase function would not be expected to be sensitive to the alteration of phospho-sites.</p><p>The authors should test lower concentrations of CPT and MMS with the S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> constructs as this might allow revealing an S-phase contribution of Mus81-Mms4.</p><p>In relation to these questions, the author should explain and provide experimental interpretation for the lack of suppression by M<sub>low</sub> at high MMS and CPT concentration (Figure 2D).</p></disp-quote><p>To summarize, this point of criticism basically asks: does our data exclude a function of Mus81-Mms4 during S phase? During the revision we have undergone significant experimental effort to scrutinize this question. Collectively, our data does not lend support for an S phase function of Mus81-Mms4 as summarized in the following points:</p><p>i) Is M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 able to fully complement Mus81-Mms4 functions?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this good observation, but the very slight survival defect in M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells treated with 0.033% MMS (Figure 3A of the previous version) could only be sporadically observed. Indeed, our survival assays (for unrelated reasons now consistently in W303 <italic>RAD5</italic>+ background) do not show any difference to WT (Figure 3B, Figure 4A) This is consistent with all other experiments, where M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells phenotypically behave like WT cells. (Figure 3B, D, F, Figure 4C-E)</p><p>ii) Is M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 able to fully complement Mus81-Mms4 functions?</p><p>A very related question to (i). Indeed, we observed in several experiments that M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 expressing cells showed reduced Mus81 function compared to WT cells (Figure 3A, Figure 4B, 4E), while in other experiments no significant defect could be observed (Figure 3C, 3E, Figure 4A, 4D). This could be for one of two reasons: (a) M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 is in some form under-expressed (see also our response to point #1, and our results with M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4) or (b) having Mus81-Mms4 in M phase is not sufficient for full Mus81-Mms4 functionality, because of a putative, then missing S phase function. To address this important point, we generated a strain that harbors both M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 and S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4. If the M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 survival defect was due to an S phase function of Mus81-Mms4, we would expect that this would be cured by the additional presence of Mus81-Mms4 during S phase. This, however, was not the case. The M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 + S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells showed the same sensitivity as M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E), suggesting that the phenotype is rather caused by underexpression of functional M phase Mus81-Mms4 in M<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells.</p><p>iii) Does S-phase restricted Mus81-Mms4 show residual function?</p><p>Indeed, we fully agree with the reviewers that S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells (but not S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 cells) show some residual Mus81-Mms4 function and do not phenocopy the <italic>mus81Δ</italic> knock-out in all experiments (see Figure 3B, lowest concentration of MMS, CPT or HU). This could be for one of two reasons: (a) there is an S phase function of Mus81-Mms4; (b) the S phase restriction of Mus81-Mms4 is imperfect in the S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 (basically too high a fraction of Mus81-Mms4 remains after S phase and then gets phosphorylated and hyperactivated in M). We favor (b) for several reasons. First, the S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 constructs phenocopy the <italic>mus81Δ</italic> knock-out in all experiments (also at lower MMS and CPT concentrations, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), which we think is inconsistent with a significant contribution of S phase Mus81-Mms4 to the tested functions (Figure 3A, 3C, 3E, Figure 4A, 4B, 4D, 4E). Second, as the reviewers suggested we have now mutated all M phase-specific Mms4 phosphorylation sites (<italic>mms4 14A</italic>) in the S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 construct. If the residual function of the S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 construct was due to an S phase function it should not be influenced by the M phase-specific phosphorylation sites. In contrast, if the residual function was due to imperfect restriction of S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 (bleeding into M Phase), this residual function should be killed by the <italic>mms4 14A</italic> mutation. Indeed, S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-mms4 14A phenocopied <italic>mus81Δ</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C). We therefore do not think that we should take the residual functionality observed in S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-<italic>Mms4</italic> (but not S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4) cells as an indication of an S phase function of Mus81-<italic>Mms4</italic>.</p><p>We therefore thank the reviewers for the suggestion to scrutinize our experiments and to explore the possibility of a Mus81-Mms4 S phase function. Our data does not provide support for such an S phase function in the phenotypes tested. This does obviously not rule out any kind of S phase function, and we hope that our discussion provides a balanced view on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In terms of presenting the data and presenting conclusions, some revisions should be made.</p><p>First for data presentation:</p><p>– In the text, the authors oversimplify in a biased manner the results of the data of some of the experiments and the text does not match the data on the figures:</p><p>– Subsection “Cell cycle-restriction of Mus81-Mms4 reveals its essential function during M phase”, &quot;mus81Δ were hypersensitive to all agents&quot;: this does not really show for HU.</p><p>– Subsection “Cell cycle-restriction of Mus81-Mms4 reveals its essential function during M phase”, &quot;Restricting Mus81-Mms4 to S phase generated hypersensitivity that was similar to what we observed in mus81Δ&quot;: this is not correct.</p><p>– Please check other figures and text for the description of data.</p><p>For interpretations:</p><p>– The authors do acknowledge that an S phase function of Mus81-Mms4 cannot be excluded, but the overall tone leaves the reader with the idea that it only acts in M-phase. This also applies to the Abstract, where the Mus81-Mms4 is concluded to act as a post-replicative resolvase. There are a couple of studies (Fu et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2015) that show that MUS81 is required for optimal replication dynamics in human cells (assessed by fiber analysis). It is difficult to imagine how MUS81 could contribute to replication fork progression measured in DNA combing experiments if it only acts in mitosis. The authors should discuss this to leave the door open for possible functions of Mus81-Mms4 in S-phase that they have not identified with their experimental setup. The implication in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in BIR (Mayle et al., 2014) also suggests activity on replicating chromatids. If the authors want to conclude definitively on this issue, they have to provide a molecular assay for Mus81-Mms4 activity with a kinetic study to follow in parallel cell cycle progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out parts of the text, which may have been imprecise. We think these have been isolated cases and hope the reviewers agree with us that our manuscript has not been oversimplified in a biased manner.</p><p>Regarding data presentation:</p><p>– We changed the statement to: “<italic>mus81Δ</italic> cells were hypersensitive to MMS and CPT and showed reduced growth on HU containing medium (Figure 3A-B).” (subsection “Mus81-Mms4 restricted to M phase, but not S phase is sufficient for the response to genotoxic insults”).</p><p>– The statement to “S<sub>low</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 expressing cells showed similar phenotypes as <italic>mus81Δ</italic> (Figure 3A, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).<italic>”</italic> (subsection “Mus81-Mms4 restricted to M phase, but not S phase is sufficient for the response to genotoxic insults”).</p><p>Regarding interpretations:</p><p>– We agree with the reviewers that it is impossible to exclude that Mus81-Mms4 could have functions outside of M phase, even though we failed to find evidence for such a function. We explicitly mention this possibility in the Discussion section and the findings regarding an S phase function in other organisms (subsection “Synchronization of cells, cell cycle release, viability”) and we have carefully revisited the manuscript text to make sure there is no misunderstanding regarding the interpretation of our data. Therefore, while we do not want to propose that Mus81-Mms4 <italic>only</italic> acts in M phase, what we do like to put forward, however, is that Mus81-Mms4 functions, which manifest in the well characterized phenotypes of <italic>mus81Δ</italic> mutants, can be explained from its activity (or lack thereof) during M phase.</p><p>Conversely, we do not know of any experimental evidence in the literature that would indicate an S phase function for budding yeast Mus81-Mms4. The BIR phenotype (shown for example in Mayle et al., 2014) can not necessarily be taken as support for an S phase function, since BIR has been shown to occur post-replicatively (discussed for example in Saada et al., 2018, see also in particular Pardo et al., 2019 (a recent preprint from the Pasero lab)).</p><p>We are of course aware of data obtained in other organisms that can be interpreted in favor of an S phase function for Mus81 orthologues. In our discussion we try to provide a balanced view of whether and in how far lessons learned from budding yeast research on Mus81-Mms4 including the present study should be extrapolated to other organisms and make the case that advanced experimental tools such as our cell cycle tag methodology are needed in other models, too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A major issue is that although the authors show very clearly how the proteins of interest are expressed under the various cell-specific constructs (Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B), they do not show the expression in the conditions used for functional assays, i.e. after MMS and CPT treatment. The authors have to show that expression is as expected after MMS and CPT, for S<sub>low</sub> and M<sub>low</sub> constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and indeed, even though several (most!) previous studies used cell cycle tags in the context of DNA repair, it had not been verified that the presence of DNA damage might not fundamentally change the behavior of the cell cycle tags. Theoretical considerations suggest that cell cycle tags should work also in the presence of DNA damage, as in budding yeast (in contrast to metazoans) DNA damage signaling does not target cyclin-CDK.</p><p>To confirm this hypothesis, we now show that cells treated with a high dose MMS pulse during synchronous progression through S phase show functional restriction of S<sub>low</sub>-/ S<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 to S phase and of M<sub>low</sub>/M<sub>high</sub>-Mus81-Mms4 to G2/M (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, see DNA content measurement by FACS and anti-Clb2 western blots as indicators of cell cycle progression).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One slight modification seems to be important:</p><p>The molecular assays in Figure 4B and C are an important step in the analysis. Visually, one can see differences in band intensities, but it is really impossible to evaluate the significance without the quantification that measures the ratio of the two bands. This quantification should not be as Figure 4—figure supplement 2 but should be inserted in the main Figure 4. Because space is limited, one option is to crop the southern blot to allow for space for the graph (and to put the full size southern in a figure supplement). It is also possible to show the quantified data in Figure 4 for High constructs only.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the quantification graphs in Figure 4 and removed it from Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Additional Information<bold>”</bold>: should be Figure 5—source data 1 (instead of Figure 4—source data 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have introduced the change.</p></body></sub-article></article>
