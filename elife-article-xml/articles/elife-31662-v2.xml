pilus, to cause UTI and colonize the gut. The pilus rod, comprised of repeating FimA subunits, provides a structural scaffold for displaying the tip adhesin, FimH. We solved the 4.2 Å resolution structure of the type 1 pilus rod using cryo-electron microscopy. Residues forming the interactive surfaces that determine the mechanical properties of the rod were maintained by selection based on a global alignment of <italic>fimA</italic> sequences. We identified mutations that did not alter pilus production in vitro but reduced the force required to unwind the rod. UPEC expressing these mutant pili were significantly attenuated in bladder infection and intestinal colonization in mice. This study elucidates an unappreciated functional role for the molecular spring-like property of type 1 pilus rods in host-pathogen interactions and carries important implications for other pilus-mediated diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31662.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, or <italic>E. coli</italic> for short, is a type of bacteria commonly found in the guts of people and animals. Certain types of <italic>E. coli</italic> can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs): they travel from the digestive tract up to the bladder (and sometimes to the kidneys) where they provoke painful symptoms. To cause the infection, the bacteria must become solidly attached to the lining of the bladder; otherwise they will get flushed out whenever urine is expelled.</p><p>Pili are hair-like structures that cover a bacterium and allow it to attach to surfaces. <italic>E. coli</italic> has many different types of pili, but one seems particularly important in UTIs: type 1 pili. These pili are formed of subunits that assemble into a long coil-shaped rod, which is tipped by adhesive molecules that can stick to body surfaces. The current hypothesis is that the pili act as shock absorbers: when the bladder empties, the pili’s coil-like structure can unwind into a flexible straight fiber. This would take some of the forces off the adhesive molecules that are attached to the bladder, and help the bacteria to remain in place when urine flows out. However, the exact structure of type 1 pili is still unclear, and the essential role of their coil-like shape unconfirmed.</p><p>Here, Spaulding, Schreiber, Zheng et al. use a microscopy method called cryo-EM to reveal the structure of the type 1 pili at near atomic-level, and identify the key units necessary for their coiling properties. The experiments show that pili with certain mutations in these units unwind much more easily when the bacteria carrying them are ‘tugged on’ with molecular tweezers. The bacteria with mutant pili are also less able to cause UTIs in mice. The coiling ability of the type 1 pili is therefore essential for <italic>E. coli</italic> to invade and colonize the bladder.</p><p>Every year, over 150 million people worldwide experience a UTI; for 25% of women, the infection regularly returns. Antibiotics usually treat the problem but bacteria are becoming resistant to these drugs. New treatments could be designed if scientists understand what roles pili play in the infection mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chaperone-usher pathway pili</kwd><kwd>CUP pili</kwd><kwd>type 1 pili</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>UPEC</kwd><kwd>UTI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM122510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Egelman</surname><given-names>Edward H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI048689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hultgren</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK064540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hultgren</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31DK107057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spaulding</surname><given-names>Caitlin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK101171-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conover</surname><given-names>Matt S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>621-2013-5379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Magnus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14-CE09-0004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francetic</surname><given-names>Olivera</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paris Pasteur University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luna-Rico</surname><given-names>Areli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011912</institution-id><institution>Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lucille P.

Notably, CUP pili are critical virulence factors in a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, including <italic>Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Yersiniae</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nuccio and Bäumler, 2007</xref>). To date, 38 distinct CUP pilus types have been identified in <italic>Escherichia</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> genomes and plasmids, each of which is hypothesized to promote bacterial colonization of a distinct habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nuccio and Bäumler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wurpel et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, single <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genomes carry up to 16 distinct CUP operons, suggesting that the retention of an assortment of CUP pilus types by a single strain may be necessary to accommodate the complex lifecycle of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wurpel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Arguably, the best-studied CUP pili are those encoded by uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPEC), which is the causative agent of the majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect 150 million people annually worldwide and are associated with significant morbidity and economic impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foxman, 2014</xref>). UTI treatment failure is common, with ~25% of woman suffering from recurrent UTI (rUTI), and is due, in part, to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant UPEC strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scholes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zowawi et al., 2015</xref>). UPEC that infect the urinary tract often originate from the host gastrointestinal tract. After being shed from the gut in the feces, UPEC can colonize peri-urethral or vaginal areas and subsequently ascend through the urethra to the bladder and/or kidneys, instigating UTI. In mice, type 1 pili, which promote binding to mannosylated proteins, play critical roles in both the gut and urinary tract. Recent work has revealed that type 1 pili help mediate UPEC intestinal colonization, thus promoting the establishment and/or maintenance of the UPEC reservoir in the gut that can eventually seed UTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spaulding et al., 2017</xref>). Upon entering the bladder, type 1 pili facilitate bacterial colonization and subsequent invasion into epithelial cells lining the bladder lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mulvey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinez et al., 2000</xref>). Bladder invasion is a critical step in UPEC pathogenesis, allowing the bacteria to replicate in a niche protected from innate immune defense mechanisms, antibiotics, and expulsion during urination. UPEC that cannot invade the urothelium, like those lacking type 1 pili or its associated adhesin, FimH, are quickly cleared from the bladder, emphasizing the importance of type 1 pili mediated host-pathogen interactions on the fitness of UPEC during cystitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wright et al., 2005</xref>). After invading into a bladder cell, UPEC escape into the host cell cytoplasm and replicate to form biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Justice et al., 2004</xref>) comprised of ~10<sup>4</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). Mouse models of UTI have revealed that while some mice are capable of self-resolving acute UPEC infection, others progress to chronic cystitis, which is characterized by persistent high titer bacteriuria (&gt;10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml) and high bacterial bladder burdens (&gt;10<sup>4</sup> CFU) two or more weeks after inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hannan et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of antibiotic treatment, chronic cystitis can also be observed in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mabeck, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferry et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains, including UPEC, are grouped into distinct clades (e.g., clades A, B1, B2, D, and E) based on their genetic relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tenaillon et al., 2010</xref>). While UPEC strains tend to be genetically heterogeneous the majority of UPEC strains isolated from women with UTI in the USA reside in the B2 clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreiber et al., 2017</xref>). While the types of CUP pilus operons encoded in <italic>E. coli</italic> genomes varies between different clades and individual strains, the vast majority of sequenced <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, including nearly all sequenced UPEC clinical isolates, carry an intact copy of the type 1 pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wurpel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreiber et al., 2017</xref>). Type 1 pili are encoded by the <italic>fim</italic> operon which, like the gene clusters encoding other CUP pili, encodes all the dedicated proteins necessary to assemble a mature pilus onto the bacterial surface, including: an outer-membrane pore-forming usher protein, a periplasmic chaperone protein, pilus subunits, and the tip adhesin protein. Most pilus tip adhesins, including the FimH adhesin, are made up of two domains, an N-terminal lectin domain, which is responsible for recognition and attachment to a ligand(s), and a C-terminal pilin domain, which connects the adhesin to the bulk of the pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 1992</xref>). Pilus subunits, including the pilin domain of the adhesin, are comprised of an incomplete immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold, which lacks the C-terminal β-strand and require the action of the dedicated periplasmic chaperone for proper folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauer et al., 2002</xref>). In a process known as donor strand complementation (DSC), a periplasmic chaperone templates subunit folding by transiently providing one of its β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sauer et al., 1999</xref>). Chaperone-subunit complexes are then delivered to the outer membrane usher, which catalyzes pilus assembly <italic>via</italic> a reaction known as donor strand exchange (DSE). In DSE, the strand donated to a nascent subunit by the chaperone is replaced by the N-terminal extension (Nte) of an incoming subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Following this pattern, the type 1 pilus usher (FimD) and chaperone (FimC) help type 1 pili assemble into a composite pilus structure consisting of a short tip fibrillum made up of the adhesin protein (FimH) and two minor subunits (FimG and FimF) that is joined to the pilus rod, a homopolymer of ~1000 FimA subunits. Once extruded to the extracellular surface, the type 1 pilus coils into a rigid right-handed helical structure that is capable of unwinding into a flexible linear fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saulino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Aprikian et al., 2011</xref>). This ability to transition between a coiled, helical rod and a linear fiber has been proposed to allow the type 1 pilus to act as a ‘molecular spring’ to maintain adherence in the face of fluid shear forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zakrisson et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, we hypothesize that in the absence of urine voiding, the type 1 pilus rod is maintained in the coiled helical state that permits subsequent contact and invasion into bound epithelial cells. However, upon encountering the shear forces associated with micturition, the pilus extends to the linear form, absorbing the shear force and thus preventing the expulsion of the bacteria from the bladder.</p><p>Here, using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we solved the structure of the type 1 pilus rod. Residues involved in critical FimA-FimA interactions were identified that when mutated reduced the force required to unwind the helix, despite not altering the ability of the FimA protein to be incorporated into the pilus rod. When introduced into the chromosome of UTI89, a human UPEC clinical cystitis isolate, these point mutations dramatically reduced the ability of UTI89 to establish an intestinal reservoir and cause acute and chronic cystitis. In contrast, these point mutant strains did not result in large scale differences in levels of piliation or ability to agglutinate mannose-expressing guinea pig red blood cells in vitro. Taken together our results show that the identity of residues within the FimA rod, are critical for the type 1 pili mediated virulence of UPEC in the urinary tract and suggest that the helical pilus rod has an important functional role, beyond serving as a platform to present FimH, in promoting colonization in the gut and infection of the bladder.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of the type 1 pilus rod structure</title><p>To characterize FimA polymers that form the type 1 pilus rod, we solved the cryo-EM structure of native type 1 pili appearing in a preparation of recombinantly expressed Type IV pili (T4P) from the <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain BW25113.

After filtering to remove protein sequences that are expected to be non-functional and trimming of the signal sequence, the remaining 1,828 protein sequences were aligned. Here, we found that many of the FimA sequences were comprised of 159 residues, including BW25113, while other FimA sequences, such as the one from UTI89, a prototypical UPEC isolate, contained an additional two amino acid residues at the N-terminus of the mature protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Global alignment revealed a consensus sequence of 161 residues where half of the FimA residues in the mature protein are invariant (79/161 residues) and that 83.9% are highly conserved (139/161 residues with &gt;95% sequence identity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found the FimA sequences to be significantly more variable than other parts of the type 1 pilus machinery. For example, the mature forms of the FimC chaperone and FimH adhesin (n = 1,760 and n = 1,943, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) obtained from the same database contain 97.6% and 97.5% highly conserved residues, respectively, as compared to 83.9% in FimA. In general, most <italic>E. coli</italic> genes evolve slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), so the degree of divergence between alleles of FimA is abnormally high. This suggests that the selection forces acting on the FimA protein are different from the forces acting on the rest of the <italic>fim</italic> operon. Interestingly, the non-conserved residues within the FimA sequences are all located on the exterior surface of the solved cryo-EM model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which is likely indicative of immune pressures selecting for antigenic diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wildschutte et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, the first few amino acids of the N-terminus of the mature protein, disordered in our reconstruction, have some of the highest variability throughout the entire protein, suggesting that these amino acids do not play a functional role in the dynamics of unwinding in the type one pilus rod.

This includes every residue lining the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The conservation of residues lining the lumen might be due to the transport of some product through this opening that is ~15 Å across (the height of the triangular lumen that rotates as one travels along the pilus). More likely, however, every residue in the lumen is either involved in making a subunit-subunit contact (including the DSE contacts with the Nte from an adjacent subunit) or packed tightly between residues that are making such contacts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31662.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>FimA conservation and variability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conservation, consensus amino acid identity, and selection pressures on residues within the mature form of the FimA protein measured by alignment of 1,828 sequences.

These sequences encoding the mature protein were examined for evidence of recombination, which can result from horizontal transfer of genetic sequences between distinct strains and confound evolutionary analyses that assume all sequences were vertically inherited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Anisimova et al., 2003</xref>). Phylogenetic trees were thus corrected for use in subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006</xref>).

The remaining 63 codons showed no evidence of statistically significant selection in either direction. All of the positively selected sites, N64, A109, T117, S120 and F138, encode residues located on the exterior surface of the FimA rod and away from any subunit-subunit interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This suggests that these mutations, which are located in areas of high conservation throughout the FimA monomer, may disrupt critical interactions with FimC or FimD or may not be able to correctly fold, thus preventing the assembly of the pilus. Notably, each of these residues was either under strong purifying selection pressure (A25, V85 and P145) or was too conserved for evolutionary analysis (codons for V32 and V65 displayed no synonymous mutations and extremely limited non-synonymous mutation rates), which emphasizes their importance in assembly of the type 1 pilus rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Expression of some mutant <italic>fimA</italic> genes, particularly V5R, E45R, E121R and A142R, resulted in a bacterial clumping phenotype when grown in static culture. D62R and D114R also instigated bacterial clumping, but to a lesser extent. Three of these substitutions, E45R, E121R and A142R, are found in residues with relatively high variability in our analysis of FimA sequences, with just 33.9%, 62.3%, and 52.1% sequence identity, respectively. Further, we found that two of these residues (V5 and D114) showed statistically significant evidence of strong purifying selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>To measure the impact of FimA<sub>BW25113</sub> variants produced by the UTI89-LON∆<italic>fimA</italic> strain on pili force-extension responses, we chose six FimA mutant strains that did not disrupt pilus formation or produce severe bacterial clumping in vitro (A22R, A92R, D114R, D62R, K155R and P132R) and applied optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since type 1 pili are assembled from FimA subunits into a helical coil, they normally extend in three force phases: linearly increasing, constant force, linearly increasing – where the characteristic constant force originates from sequential unwinding of subunits (region between the dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The characteristic constant force extension enables the clear identification of instances where multiple pili are attached to a single microsphere, thus enabling us to determine the unwinding force of a single pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The unwinding force directly relates to the strength of layer-to-layer interactions (e.g., between subunits N<sub>0</sub> and N<sub>+3</sub>), thus any changes in these interactions caused by mutations would shift the magnitude of the force plateau. To investigate this, we first measured unwinding force of single pili in the strain expressing WT FimA and subsequently examined the force response for each <italic>fimA</italic> mutant. The unwinding force of WT pili was 30.3 ± 0.2 pN (mean ±standard error (SE)) whereas all mutants showed a reduction in the force required for pilus unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The unwinding force measured for WT type 1 pili in this study is similar to what has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, the A22R variant showed the largest reduction in the unwinding force, 11.2 ± 0.2 pN. We can explain this by the fact that Ala22 in our rod model is tightly packed against Ala93 from another subunit and Val37 from a third subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, replacing a small alanine with a long arginine side chain is expected to disrupt this interface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31662.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mutations to FimA alter the force required to unwind the pilus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Force response of a single type 1 pilus.

However, the D114R and D62R mutant strains had reduced rates of chronic cystitis of 20% and 10%, respectively. Interestingly, 100% of mice infected with the A22R variant resolved their infections over the 4 week experiment, with half of the mice (10/20) exhibiting sterile urines by 10 dpi compared to just 15% (3/20) of mice infected with the WT strain at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The defect in chronic infection caused by <italic>fimA</italic> variants is likely due to pathogenic deficiencies during acute UTI.

Even more strikingly, 70% of mice infected with the A22R variant formed no IBCs at 6 hpi and the other 30% formed three or less. This is in stark contrast to WT and P132R strains, which formed between 50–100 IBCs on average by 6hpi. Interestingly, the A22R mutant was severely attenuated in its ability to invade into bladder cells starting as early as 1 hr post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The D62R variant was defective in chronic cystitis in both the competitive and single bladder infections, but no acute fitness defects were observed. Further, mice infected with D62R formed a similar number of IBCs as the WT strain at 6 hpi, suggesting that the defect occurs at a later time-point.

Deletion of the operon encoding the type 1 pilus or the FimH adhesin impedes intestinal colonization by UTI89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spaulding et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we tested the impact of each of our four chromosomal FimA genetic variants on UPEC intestinal colonization levels.

In particular, it is exceedingly difficult to crystallize most helical polymers, as unless such a polymer has exactly two, three, four or six subunits per turn, it cannot be packed in any crystal space group so that all subunits are in equivalent environments. The type 1 pilin, FimA, has been extensively studied by x-ray crystallography and solution NMR, while the type 1 pilus has only been studied at high resolution by solid-state NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Habenstein et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that type 1 filaments, present as a background in a preparation of T4P, allow us to reach a near-atomic level of resolution and build an atomic model for the FimA rod. The ability of cryo-EM to separate out multiple conformations among particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vonck and Mills, 2017</xref>) or even of subunits within the same particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roh et al., 2017</xref>) has been one of the greatest strengths of cryo-EM, allowing for multiple states to be solved from the same micrographs. Biochemically heterogeneous preparations, such as when virions are a mixture of empty particles and those containing DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2017</xref>) are now routinely sorted out into homogeneous structural classes. We have taken advantage of that strength here to show that filament images which might otherwise have been discarded as a background contaminant can actually be used to build an atomic model.

However, here we have uncovered a more complex and previously unappreciated role for FimA and the type 1 pilus rod in host-pathogen interactions. We identified three mutations in FimA<sub>UTI89</sub> (A22R, D114R, and D62R) that expressed adhesive pili in vitro but reduced the ability of UTI89 to colonize the bladder, acutely and chronically. One of these mutants, FimA<sub>UTI89</sub> A22R, was severely attenuated during acute infection, forming almost no IBCs and thus was unable to chronically infect the mouse bladder.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The impact of FimA mutants on the ‘molecular-spring’ function of the pilus rod</title><p>We hypothesize that the identified FimA point mutants handicap UPEC pathogenicity in vivo by altering the properties of the pilus rod. The pilus rod is hypothesized to act as a ‘molecular spring’ transitioning between a flexible, linear fiber and a coiled helix. This spring-like property is thought to prevent the pilus from breaking or detaching from the host surface by temporarily expanding to a linear form after encountering shear forces, which can occur in the bladder during urine voiding or in the gut during fecal or mucus shedding. Such a transition between the helical and unwound form of the FimA homopolymer has been predicted to significantly dampen the force experienced by the adhesion-receptor complex at the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zakrisson et al., 2012</xref>). Since FimA-FimA interactions create the bulk of the pilus rod, mutations that reduce the stability of these protein-protein interactions can alter the ability of the pilus rod to withstand shear forces, which we discovered has detrimental effects on pilus function and pathogenesis. This is consistent with ~50% of the residues in the mature FimA protein (79/161) being invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which includes almost every residue involved in a subunit-subunit interface in the rod. Pili formed with the WT FimA<sub>BW25113</sub> protein require more than twice the force to unwind than the pili formed by the FimA <sub>BW25113</sub> variant with an A22R mutation (~30 pN vs. 11pN), likely due to steric clashes caused by this substitution affecting the tightly packed interface between subunits. Thus, we hypothesize that the pilus formed by the FimA A22R mutant variant may not have the strength to absorb and withstand the shear forces experienced during urination and thus allow the bacteria to be swept out of the bladder, preventing infection. In the gut, the pilus rod may play a similar role during mucus shedding. A recent study suggests that type 1 pili may promote UPEC colonization of the upper crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spaulding et al., 2017</xref>). These bacteria would likely experience constant, low levels of shear force during mucus turnover and thus need the pilus to withstand some force to enable the bacteria to maintain their intestinal niche. Accordingly, three of the <italic>fimA<sub>UTI89</sub></italic> mutants (A22R, D114R, and D62R) that were attenuated in bladder colonization also displayed significantly reduced intestinal colonization. However, in general, the phenotypes of the <italic>fimA<sub>UTI89</sub></italic> mutants in gut colonization were not as severe as in the bladder.</p><p>Two mutations in FimA<sub>UTI89</sub> (D62R and D114R) resulted in a mild clumping phenotype when bacteria were grown in vitro. This clumping phenotype was also seen in the equivalent mutants in FimA<sub>BW25113</sub> (D62R, D114R). These residues are located on the exterior surface of the rod structure and do not have as strong an effect on the force needed for unwinding as FimA<sub>BW2511</sub> A22R. However, the clumping phenotype suggests that these mutations may alter side-to-side interactions between different pilus rods promoting pilus-pilus interactions within and between bacteria, thus inhibiting the pilus mediated interactions needed in vivo for attachment, invasion and/or IBC formation. Interestingly, we do not observe a defect in bladder colonization in mice infected with FimA<sub>UTI89</sub> D62R until 10dpi, suggesting that normal rod function is needed during both chronic and acute infection.</p><p>Together, our data suggest that the type 1 pilus rod may mediate colonization phenotypes through damping of shear forces or through other mechanism(s) outside of scaffold support for FimH-binding. A possibility that we cannot exclude at the moment is that the lower uncoiling force of the A22R mutant exposes parts of the rod that would be largely buried in the wt filament to host proteases. This would still suggest that the mechanical properties of these rods have been ‘tuned’ to optimize for particular environments, as a wt rod that could never uncoil would be susceptible to breakage by the shear forces, while a rod that uncoils too easily would be unnecessarily exposed to digestion by proteases.</p><p>Our analyses indicate that FimA is undergoing selection pressures due to as-yet undefined host-pathogen interactions, which may explain some colonization defects seen here. FimA displays patterns of episodic, divergent selection on surface exposed amino acids in a pattern that is similar, though much less robust, to what is seen in the flagellin protein in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 1994</xref>). In <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the flagellin subunits are split into several domains where the domains responsible for subunit-subunit assembly are highly conserved while the more external domains of the protein show high rates of variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen-Nissen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galkin et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagellin protein is immunogenic, but the regions that induce inflammatory response are found in the conserved domains of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wildschutte et al., 2004</xref>). While it is known that flagellin are bound by Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) resulting in the induction of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith and Ozinsky, 2002</xref>) and that this recognition is targeted towards conserved features of flagellin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen-Nissen et al., 2005</xref>), it is currently unknown which, if any, host immune receptor are capable of recognizing the FimA rod or subunits or which structural features are targeted by the host immune system. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the host pressures and responses that are influencing the evolution of the FimA rod structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The evolution of the type 1 pilus rod</title><p>Evolutionary and structural analysis of FimA, in combination with our in vitro and in vivo phenotyping, yielded several important insights into the selection pressures faced by UPEC as well as the evolutionary trajectories that pathogens follow to enhance their colonization of different host niches. Notably, we saw that different phenotypes caused by mutations in the FimA protein were associated with different classes of selection pressure. For example, the bacterial clumping phenotype is associated with mutation of three codons under purifying selection, but an equal number of the mutations that resulted in clumping are in codons with little to no evidence of selective pressure. In contrast, all mutations that failed to complement a <italic>fimA</italic> gene deletion were made in codons that are under very strong purifying selection or are too conserved for analysis. Together, the difference in selection pressure suggests that the mis-assembly of the pilus is much more harmful and/or toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic> than bacterial clumping. Further, the integration of evolutionary analysis with in vivo and in vitro functional analysis allowed us to decouple the selection pressures acting to preserve amino acid sites necessary for pilus assembly (such as P145in FimA<sub>UTI89</sub>) from the selection pressure maintaining the codons that were necessary for pilus function (such as A22 in FimA<sub>UTI89</sub>). Given the intricacy of pilus assembly, one could expect that most of the codons under purifying selection would be related to pilus construction. Instead, we found that many codons under purifying selection are involved in keeping the force needed to unwind the type 1 rod within a narrow range. This leads to reasoning that a ‘weak’ or ‘loose’ FimA rod may be just as detrimental for <italic>E. coli</italic> as having no rod at all, at least in the eyes of evolution.</p><p>In summary, by combining structural studies, force spectroscopy, genetic analysis, and relevant mouse models of UTI and gut colonization, we conclude that the mechanical properties of the type 1 pilus rod are essential for its functional role in mediating <italic>E. coli</italic> pathogenesis and persistence and appear to have been carefully ‘tuned’ by evolution. Further studies of the hundreds of CUP pili encoded in Gram-negative bacteria are needed to further understand the unique and general aspects of the evolution of CUP pilus fibers. In addition, other bacterial pili, such as T4P, which have arisen independently of CUP pili but can play similar roles in pathogenesis, can also elongate under force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biais et al., 2010</xref>) and thus it remains an interesting question as to how the physical properties of other pili have been selected for particular environments and how these properties impact bacterial pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Washington University Animal Studies Committee approved all procedures used for the mouse experiments described in the present study.

The optical tweezers (OT) setup is built around an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71, Olympus, Japan) equipped with a high numerical aperture oil immersion objective (model: UplanFl 100X N.A. = 1.35; Olympus, Japan) and a 1292 × 964 pixel camera with a cell size of 3.75 × 3.75 μm (model: StingRay F-125, Allied Vision) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mortezaei et al., 2013</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The OT stands in a temperature controlled room with computers and controllers isolated from the room to reduce noise and vibrations. We use a continuous wave Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> laser (Millennia IR, Spectra Physics, Santa Clara, CA) operating at 1064 nm for trapping a single bacterium or microspheres. A probe laser (low power HeNe-laser operating at 632.8 nm) is merged with the trapping laser using a polarizing beam splitter cube (PBSC). The light from the probe laser is refracted by the trapped object and collected by the condenser and thereafter imaged onto a 2D position sensitive detector (PSD, L20 SU9, Sitek Electro Optics, Sweden). The PSD convert the incoming light to a photocurrent and thereafter to a voltage that is sent to a programmable low pass filter (SR640, Stanford research systems), later collected by a computer and processed with an in-house LabVIEW program. We minimized the amount of noise in the setup and optimized the measured time series using the Allan variance method described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To prepare a sample we suspended bacteria in 1xPBS to a concentration (1:1000 of OD<sub>600</sub> = 1) suitable for single cell analysis using optical tweezers (OT). Surfactant-free 2.5 µm amidine polystyrene microspheres (product no. 3–2600, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were similarly suspended in Milli-Q water, these microspheres were trapped and used as force probes. To mount bacteria and reduce the influence of surface interactions we prepared a 1:500 suspension of 9.5 mm carboxylate-modified latex microspheres (product no.2–10000, Interfacial Dynamics, Portland, OR) in Milli-Q. We dropped ten microliters of the microsphere-water suspension onto 24 × 60 mm coverslips (no.1, Knittel Glass, Braunschweig, Germany) and placed these in an oven for 60 min at 60°C to immobilize the microspheres to the surface. To firmly adhere bacteria to the microspheres, we added a solution of 20 mL of 0.01% poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P4832, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to the coverslips, which, after 45 min incubation at 60°C, were stored until use. A free-floating bacterium was trapped by the optical tweezers run at low power to avoid cell damage. The bacterium was thereafter mounted on a large 9.5 µm microsphere coated with poly-L-lysine. We trapped a small free-floating 2.5 µm microsphere by the optical tweezers with normal power (a few hundreds of mW) and brought it close to (within tens of µm) but not in direct contact with, the bacterium. To calibrate the trap stiffness we used the Power spectrum method by sampling the microspheres position at 131,072 Hz and average 32 consecutive data sets acquired for 0.25 s each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tolić-Nørrelykke et al., 2006</xref>). Typically, the trap constant was found to be ~140 pN/µm for an output laser power of 800 mW. After calibration, the small microsphere was gently brought close to the bacterium in order to attach a pilus with the microsphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To extend a single pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) the piezo stage was moved at a constant speed of 10 nm/s and the sampling frequency was set to 10,000 Hz that was downsampled by 800. Occasionally, we measured the responses of multiple pili attached to the bead resulting in a force-extension response as the sum of all attached pili. This was, however, not a problem in general since the shorter pili detached from the bead in a sequential order, leaving only the single, longest pili attached to the bead for measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we controlled the piezo-stage and sampled the data using an in-house LabView program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andersson, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ot-control">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ot-control</ext-link>).</p><p>To make a flow chamber, we added a ring of vacuum grease (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) around the area containing the poly-L-lysine-coated microspheres on one of the coverslips. Carefully, we dropped a 3 mL suspension of bacteria and a 3 mL suspension of probe microspheres (surfactant-free 2.5 mm white amidine polystyrene latex microsphere, product no. 3–2600, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) onto the area and sealed the flow chamber by placing a 20 × 20 mm coverslip (no.1, Knittel Glass) on top. Thereafter, we mounted the sample in a sample holder that is fixed to a piezo-stage (Physik Instrument, P-561.3CD stage) in the OT instrumentation. To get a reliable OT calibration parameter values we measured the temperature using a thermocouple in the sample chamber, 23.0 ± 0.1°C and the suspension viscosity was assumed to only vary with temperature, thus, the viscosity was set to 0.932 mPas ± 0.002 mPas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pilus preparation for structural determination</title><p>To prepare the pilus extracts, bacteria of the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BW25113 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref>) were inoculated by dense streaking on eight M9 minimal agar plates containing 0.5% glycerol (vol/vol).

A total of 6803 images, each of which was from a total exposure of 2 s dose-fractionated into seven chunks, were collected at a range of underfocus between 0.5 ~ 3 μm. Images were motion corrected using MotionCorr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and the program CTFFIND3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</xref>) was used for determining the defocus and astigmatism. Images with poor CTF estimation as well as defocus &gt;3 μm were discarded.

The CTF was corrected by multiplying the images from the first two-chunk sums with the theoretical CTF, which is a Wiener filter in the limit of a very poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This both corrects the phases which need to be flipped and improves the SNR. The e2helixboxer routine within EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) was used for boxing the filaments from the images.

With a featureless cylinder as a starting reference, 72,627 segments were used in IHRSR cycles until the helical parameters (axial rise and rotation per subunit) converged. Analysis of the population suggested that the axial rise was fairly fixed, but that the twist was variable. Using a reference-based sorting with models having a fixed rise but a variable twist, approximately 55% of the segments were excluded, having a twist outside of the range 114.4° to 115.6°. A sub-set of 32,726 segments were used for a few more cycles of IHRSR.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael Gilmore as Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>We have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-written structural biology study that employs state-of-the art cryo EM to solve the structure of the assembled type 1 pilus rod of <italic>E. coli</italic>. This pilus is a major colonization factor for <italic>E. coli</italic> and other gram-negative microbes, in the gut and in the bladder, with a well-established role in urinary tract infection. Prior to this study, substantial knowledge of the type 1 pilus structure derived from multiple approaches to solve the structure of the FimA monomer, and NMR data on polymerized FimA. The data obtained here extends and modifies the understanding of its structure in several specific aspects. Moreover, force measurements of mutant variants of the pilus are consistent with a model that proposes that specific extension forces are functionally important, and the tension of its spring-like quality is critical for causing disease. Additionally, useful insights are made into the evolution of variants of this structure, and selective forces that may influence that. All of the elements of the study appear to be well designed and executed, and reflect both a deep understanding of the subject of study, and advanced technologies for its exploration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two major points to be addressed:</p><p>1) Determination of unwinding force and correlation between unwinding force and in vivo observations are not convincing yet and need to be substantiated.</p><p>2) When correlating the in vitro and in vivo results, there are several uncontrolled variables that need to be addressed including proteases, bacterial clumping, number of pili versus structure of pili for fimA mutants.</p><p>Further detail can be found in the separate reviews below. If you have any questions about the revisions, please let us know.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The only concern of this reviewer is that some leaps are made to correlate observations in vitro, with those in vivo. The suggestion that the spring-like qualities of the pilus rod are critical for pathogenesis is entirely possible, but is far from proven. Moreover, few specifics are provided that relate the actual shear forces of urine at various distances from the mucosal boundary to the forces measured for variations in the protein. A number of uncontrolled variables could explain why mutant variants of the protein are less effective in vivo, including increased susceptibility to tissue resident proteases, altered interactions with various elements of the mucosa, altered physical states imposed (such as the clumping that was observed), etc. While an interesting prospect, the mechanical properties proposed could be explored further for proof, or the discussion of this prospect modified in the text (although the latter arguably could affect the perceived impact of the study in altering existing paradigms). Aside from that concern, this reviewer found the paper to be of considerable interest and well done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors determined the Type I pilus structure by cryo electron microscopy. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are stunning. The determine force required to unwind a single FimA rod, and then introduce mutations that would be predicted to destabilize the wound pilus structure. These mutant pili require less force to unwind. Interestingly, UPEC expressing these mutant pili were significantly attenuated in bladder infection and intestinal colonization in mice, despite being able to agglutinate red blood cells in vitro. The authors have not identified the specific host immune response which contribute to pathogenic deficiencies, but clearly the sequence of the FimA major subunit are critical for pilus function in the bladder and gut and thus has a major impact on the outcome of UTI. Below are some comments and suggestions that could be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The A22R mutant has a significant defect at 6 hours in the mouse. Does this mutant affect the ability of bacteria to invade the superficial facet cells?</p><p>2) A few of the mutants were tested in vivo, but not in vitro. For example, E123R was tested in the mouse and displayed a defect in acute and chronic UTI (and a slight defect in gut colonization), but the force measurements for unwinding this pili were not determined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Caitlin Spaulding et al. reports on the relation between atomic structure, evolutionary conservation, biophysical properties, and host pathogen interactions of bacterial type I pili. Using electron microscopy, they solve the structure of the type I pilus at atomic resolution. Next, by genomic comparison of the T1P genes between different species, they find that the gene encoding of the major subunit of the pilus, fimA, shows a higher variability compared to other parts of the T1P machinery. In particular, residues at the exterior are prone to adaptive selection. Based on their positions in the atomic model, the authors investigate the effects of point mutations on pilus expression and agglutination. They state that the unwinding force of the pilus strongly depends on these mutations while functionality is unaffected. Finally, they investigate the effect of point mutations on the competitive fitness within the bladder of a mouse model, on their ability cause chronic infections, and on their ability to colonize the intestine. The authors conclude that reducing the unwinding force of T1P affects host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>The idea to test the relevance of elastic properties of pili for host-pathogen interactions and in particular of bladder infections is wonderful. The general approach of starting with an atomic model of the pilus to identify promising candidates for amino acid substitutions is highly convincing. I have three major problems with this study and I will describe them in detail below. I would like to state that I don't have enough expertise in structural biology to assess the quality of the structural data.</p><p>1) Measurement of the unwinding force.a) The authors state in the Materials and methods part they expect &quot;attachment a few pili with the microsphere&quot;. Determination of the unwinding force, however, is only possible it the authors can make sure that only a single pilus is attached at the time.</p><p>b) I haven't found any information about how the mutations analysed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> affect the number of pili per cell. If more than a pilus is bound during a force measurement, then the level of piliation can affect the measured uncoiling force.</p><p>c) Only technical replicates from a single sample are inacceptable. Data should be acquired on biological replicates on at least three different days.</p><p>2) Expression levels and functionality of pili with point mutations.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;FimA mutant strain produced minimal changes to the levels of type 1 piliation […] and to the function of the type 1 pilus&quot;. The experimental data supporting this statement is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. I cannot understand this statement based on the data. The percentage of &quot;bald&quot; bacteria is about 3x higher for the D116R strain compared to wt. The mannose-inhibitable HA-titre is about 10x higher in the E123R and D116R strains compared to wt. We can expect that the pilus density affects host-pathogen interactions. One way of showing that the 3x increase of pilus density does not affect the conclusion, would be to generate strains with wt fimA sequence but decreased pilus levels.</p><p>3) Comparison between different strains.a) The authors explain that they used different bacterial strains with different fimA sequences. This is probably fine, but the way the data is presented now, I get confused with the different notations of the point mutations. For example, is the A22R mutation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> comparable to A24R in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>? Same for D114R and D116R etc.? Can the authors come up with a smart way of indicating these connections within the figures?</p><p>b) The authors look at the effects of amino acid substitutions at different levels of complexity (which is great) but I currently get lost in the details. Please explain the criteria for analysing specific mutations better within the individual parts of the Results section. Also, please explain the connections between the conclusions drawn from mutant analysis of conservation, unwinding, and host-pathogen interactions related to the structure in an explicit way.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31662.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two major points to be addressed:</p><p>1) Determination of unwinding force and correlation between unwinding force and in vivo observations are not convincing yet and need to be substantiated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point. Determination of the unwinding force of the WT type 1 pili in this study correlates well with previously published studies (Andersson et al., 2007; Jass et al., 2004; Whitfield et al., 2014). There have been numerous parallel-plate flow chamber studies mimicking the fluid conditions exposing bacteria attaching to host cells. These studies show indeed the need of pili for cell attachment (works by Wendy Thomas group). In such in vitro studies, it has been observed that pili do in fact unwind when the cell is exposed to fluid flow (Rangel et al., 2013).</p><p>Correspondingly, in this study we find that the unwinding force is significantly different for the WT and the A22R mutant and this mutant is severely attenuated in bladder and gut colonization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When correlating the in vitro and in vivo results, there are several uncontrolled variables that need to be addressed including proteases, bacterial clumping, number of pili versus structure of pili for fimA mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that there are uncontrolled variables in our in vitro and in vivo experiments. in vitro bacterial clumping and pilus expression are variable between FimA mutants, however, we show via hemagglutination assays that this does not impact the function of these pili in vitro. We do find differences between WT and mutant FimA expressing strains in both two different niches within the urinary tract (the bladder and the kidney) and within the gut. In allin vivo mouse experiments, there are numerous uncontrolled variables present, including host and bacterial proteases. While we do not control for these proteins in our studies, we note that we use the same strain of mice for each experiment and biological replicates for experiments are performed in mice that are the same age, from the same vendor and batch, and have been exposed to the same conditions and diet in our vivarium. While host proteases might alter pathogenesis, our WT and mutant mice should be exposed to the same protease conditions. We have now added the possibility to the Discussion that the uncoiling of the A22R mutant might make sites accessible to host proteases that would not be available in the coiled wt rod. As we note, this does not change the conclusion of our paper that the mechanical properties of the rod have been “tuned” over evolution as an adaptation to specific environments. Further, while we feel that the appearance of phenotypes such as clumping or alterations in pilus expression highlights the role of residues in interactions within type 1 pili, the in vitro measured phenotype that correlates best with in vivo virulence is the optical tweezer experiments. Note, that we have now removed results of the mutant E121R, which had the most clumping phenotype (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further detail can be found in the separate reviews below. If you have any questions about the revisions, please let us know.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The only concern of this reviewer is that some leaps are made to correlate observations in vitro, with those in vivo.

In addition, peristaltic motion creates shear forces that include reversal wall shear forces and normal forces. Bacteria need to attach and adhere in these conditions, which implies that they are not more than a “coiled-pili-length” away from the surface. Therefore, the shear forces, which increase more-or-less linearly with height for small displacement, will not be significantly different at various distances from the mucosal boundary. This implies also for flow chamber experiments.</p><p>Several flow chamber experiments generating shear stress of similar magnitude as physiological conditions (Busscher and van der Mei, 2006) have been performed (Aprikian et al., 2011; Rangel et al., 2013)). Interestingly, these experiments exposed cells from low to high forces, that is, from 10 – 140 pN (Aprikian et al., 2011), which is in the range of WT type 1 pili uncoiling. Pili uncoiling for WT bacteria, leading to bacterial displacement of the order of a few micrometers, have also been demonstrated in flow chamber experiments. Thus experiments support that shear forces exposing bacteria within physiological conditions are sufficiently to uncoil WT pili (Rangel et al., 2013). Since we measured lower uncoiling force for the mutants, we expect that these “softer-spring” pili attaching bacteria to cells will not be able to modulate and dampen the fluid forces as good as WT pili. This reduced damping capability will therefore make it harder for bacteria to attach and adhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A number of uncontrolled variables could explain why mutant variants of the protein are less effective in vivo, including increased susceptibility to tissue resident proteases, altered interactions with various elements of the mucosa, altered physical states imposed (such as the clumping that was observed), etc. While an interesting prospect, the mechanical properties proposed could be explored further for proof, or the discussion of this prospect modified in the text (although the latter arguably could affect the perceived impact of the study in altering existing paradigms).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to essential revisions 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aside from that concern, this reviewer found the paper to be of considerable interest and well done.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The A22R mutant has a significant defect at 6 hours in the mouse.

To address this question we now include data regarding the ability of the A22R mutant to invade into bladder tissue at 1, 3, and 6 hours. This was done via gentamycin protection assays. We found that the A22R mutant does indeed have an invasion defect compared to WT starting at 1 hpi. This ability of this strain to persist in the lumen of the bladder is also attenuated compared to WT. We have added this invasion data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> as panel G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A few of the mutants were tested in vivo, but not in vitro.

The E123R mutant was not included in the optical tweezer data due to difficulty in obtaining reading with single pili attached the beads. The attachment of a single pilus to a bead is essential for us to calculate an accurate unwinding force measurement. After multiple additional failed attempts to acquire this data for this FimA mutant, we have decided to remove all analysis of this mutant from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Measurement of the unwinding force.a) The authors state in the Materials and methods part they expect &quot;attachment a few pili with the microsphere&quot;.

Based on this comment, it is clear that our description of the molecular tweezers experiment in the Materials and methods section did not clearly explain how the force-spectroscopy measurements were taken.

Further, we have included an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) that better explains how we assessed the data when multi-pili interactions to the bead occur.

One way of showing that the 3x increase of pilus density does not affect the conclusion, would be to generate strains with wt fimA sequence but decreased pilus levels.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to better characterize the variability that we observe in pilus expression with each mutant, we have altered the text in the manuscript to more explicitly reflect the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. However, we feel that our overall statement that indicated FimA mutants do not prevent the expression or function of type 1 pili in vitrois demonstrated.</p><p>This text now reads:</p><p>“When compared to a strain with the reintegrated WT UTI89 fimA sequence, we found that all reintegrated FimA mutant strains demonstrated similar levels of GP-RBC agglutination, in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>),despite some variability in the level of piliation between FimA mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).[…] Overall, these findings indicate that the identified FimA mutations do not prevent the expression or function of type 1 pili in vitro.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Comparison between different strains.a) The authors explain that they used different bacterial strains with different fimA sequences. This is probably fine, but the way the data is presented now, I get confused with the different notations of the point mutations. For example, is the A22R mutation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> comparable to A24R in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>? Same for D114R and D116R etc.? Can the authors come up with a smart way of indicating these connections within the figures?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that was made by multiple reviewers. In order to prevent confusion, we have chosen to refer to all residues from both strains using the BW25113 number system.</p><p>We have also addressed this change in the text:</p><p>“Thus, we do note that FimA<sub>UTI89</sub> differs from our cryo-EM rod FimA<sub>BW25113</sub> sequence in 16 residues, with all of the differences lying within highly variable residues located on the exterior of the pilus rod, including two additional amino acids at the N-terminus. […] To avoid confusion herein all residues are discussed using the BW25113 numbering system.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
