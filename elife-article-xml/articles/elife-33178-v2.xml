To date, most proteins involved in NMD have been identified by genetic screens in model organisms; however, the increased complexity of gene expression regulation in human cells suggests that additional proteins may participate in the human NMD pathway. To identify proteins required for NMD, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen against &gt;21,000 genes. Canonical members of the NMD pathway were highly enriched as top hits in the siRNA screen, along with numerous candidate NMD factors, including the conserved ICE1/KIAA0947 protein. RNAseq studies reveal that depletion of ICE1 globally enhances accumulation and stability of NMD-target mRNAs. Further, our data suggest that ICE1 uses a putative MIF4G domain to interact with exon junction complex (EJC) proteins and promotes the association of the NMD protein UPF3B with the EJC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33178.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in our cells contains the hereditary information that makes each of us unique. Molecules called mRNAs are copies of this information and are used as templates for making proteins. When a strand of incorrectly copied mRNA, or one including errors from the original DNA template, is recognized, our cells destroy the mRNA to prevent it from producing a damaged protein. Organisms from yeast to humans have evolved a mechanism for finding and destroying faulty mRNAs, called mRNA surveillance. Animals are particularly reliant on mRNA surveillance, as their proteins are often made from cutting and pasting together mRNA from different portions of DNA, in a process known as splicing. Despite being a vital process, we still lack a good understanding of how mRNA surveillance works.</p><p>Now, Baird et al. used human kidney cells that produced an error-containing mRNA that could be tracked. To investigate how efficient RNA surveillance is under different conditions, the levels of individual proteins were reduced one at a time. By tracking the amount of faulty mRNA, it was possible to find out if a single protein plays a role in human mRNA surveillance. If the number of faulty mRNAs is high when a protein is reduced, it suggests that this protein may be involved in mRNA surveillance.</p><p>Baird et al. screened more than 21,000 proteins, the majority of proteins made in human cells. Many of the proteins that stood out as important in mRNA surveillance were the ones already known to be relevant in yeast and worm cells. But the experiments also identified new proteins that appear to play a role specifically in human RNA surveillance. One of the proteins, ICE1, is essential for the relationship between mRNA splicing and mRNA surveillance. Without ICE1, the mRNA surveillance machinery can no longer find and destroy faulty mRNAs.</p><p>Nearly one-third of genetic diseases are caused by mutations that result in faulty mRNAs, which can be detected by mRNA surveillance pathways. Depending on the disease, destroying these error-containing mRNAs can either improve or worsen disease symptoms. A better understanding of the factors that control human RNA surveillance could one day help to develop treatments that affect mRNA surveillance to improve disease outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nonsense-mediated mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>siRNA screen</kwd><kwd>exon junction complex</kwd><kwd>RNA quality control</kwd><kwd>ICE1</kwd><kwd>UPF3B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baird</surname><given-names>Thomas D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hogg</surname><given-names>J Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Ken Chih-Chien</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yu-Chi</given-names></name><name><surname>Buehler</surname><given-names>Eugen</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name><name><surname>Inglese</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A whole-genome siRNA screen identifies ICE1 as a factor required for accurate sensing and quality control of mRNAs containing premature stop codons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>mRNA decay pathways have evolved to both maintain mRNA quality control and to regulate gene expression. For example, the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway was initially described for its role in targeting the destruction of messages harboring premature termination codons (PTCs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maquat et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peltz et al., 1993</xref>]). The introduction of a PTC can result from genetic mutations or errors in gene expression, ultimately generating a message encoding a potentially deleterious truncated protein. As such, the NMD pathway protects the integrity of the proteome by detecting and destroying PTC-containing messages. In addition to this well-characterized role in quality control surveillance, NMD regulates the expression of ~5–10% of the mammalian transcriptome, highlighting its importance in determining levels of non-aberrant mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mendell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rehwinkel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weischenfeldt et al., 2008</xref>). These apparently normal mRNAs often contain NMD-triggering features such as upstream open-reading frames (uORFs) in the 5’-UTR, the presence of a long 3’-UTR, or a 3’-UTR that harbors an intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karousis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rebbapragada and Lykke-Andersen, 2009</xref>).</p><p>NMD is conducted by a conserved set of factors primarily identified via genetic screens in model organisms. The UPF1, 2, and 3 proteins (<underline>up-f</underline>rameshift), discovered in budding yeast, are required for NMD throughout eukaryotes, while the SMG (<underline>s</underline>uppressor with <underline>m</underline>orphogenetic effects on <underline>g</underline>enitalia) proteins were originally identified in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and provide additional enzymatic and regulatory activities required for NMD in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leeds et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pulak and Anderson, 1993</xref>); for a recent comprehensive review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karousis et al. (2016)</xref>. UPF1, the central hub of the NMD pathway, is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that acts at multiple steps in target discrimination and decay. UPF1’s ATPase activity and phosphorylation is enhanced by UPF2 binding, promoting decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chamieh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kashima et al., 2006</xref>). UPF1 phosphorylation by the PI3K-related kinase SMG1 in the context of translation termination promotes the recruitment of the NMD-specific endonuclease SMG6, as well as the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex via the SMG5-SMG7 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gatfield and Izaurralde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huntzinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kashima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loh et al., 2013</xref>). UPF1-dependent RNA degradation can thus proceed through a combination of exo- and endonucleolytic pathways.</p><p>A second major elaboration of the NMD pathway in vertebrates is the use of the exon junction complex (EJC) to identify potential targets of NMD. The EJC is a tetrameric complex comprising the RNA helicase eIF4AIII, the MAGOH-Y14 heterodimer, and CASC3 (also known as MLN51 and Barentz) and is deposited 20–24 nt upstream of exon-exon junctions during splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le Hir et al., 2000</xref>). The stable core participates in multiple stages of mRNA function by engaging in dynamic interactions with ‘peripheral’ EJC factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Hir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Singh et al., 2012</xref>), including UPF3B, which binds EJCs consisting of at least eIF4AIII and MAGOH-Y14 through a conserved motif in its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchwald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gehring et al., 2003</xref>). Once bound in the nucleus, the EJC is believed to escort UPF3B into the cytoplasm, where the complex marks most splice sites prior to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saulière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). During translation, scanning and elongating ribosomes displace EJCs in the 5’-leader and coding sequence, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gehring et al., 2009a</xref>), leaving only EJC-UPF3B complexes &gt; 50 nts downstream of the termination codon bound to the mRNA. UPF3B thus provides a link between nuclear mRNA biogenesis and the cytoplasmic NMD machinery, as the N-terminal region of UPF3B binds UPF2, which in turn promotes UPF1 activity and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chamieh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kashima et al., 2006</xref>). Such mRNAs harboring an EJC sufficiently downstream of a stop codon are subject to ‘EJC-enhanced’ NMD, the branch of the NMD pathway responsible for the most prominent UPF1-dependent decay activities observed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bühler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Metze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the primary genetic screens responsible for NMD factor identification were conducted in organisms that do not use the EJC to demarcate targets of decay. Further indicating a potential need for an expanded machinery, the human NMD pathway surveils a transcriptome more complex than that found in yeast and worms and has adopted regulatory roles in development and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Medghalchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wittkopp et al., 2009</xref>). To search for potential novel human NMD proteins, including those involved in ‘EJC-enhanced’ decay, we used a luciferase reporter to develop a gain-of-signal assay designed based on a well-characterized mRNA β-globin nonsense allele and performed a whole genome RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maquat et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thorne et al., 2010</xref>). By depleting &gt;21,000 genes with three siRNAs/gene, we recovered core NMD and EJC factors as top hits, as well as a large cohort of potential NMD factors. From the latter, we used biochemical, genetic, and genomic approaches to validate ICE1 (<underline>i</underline>nteractor of little elongation <underline>c</underline>omplex <underline>E</underline>LL subunit 1, also known as KIAA0947) as a novel peripheral EJC factor essential for EJC-enhanced NMD. We show that ICE1 depletion leads to enhanced expression of many NMD targets, including those containing PTCs. Further, our data suggest that ICE1 uses a putative MIF4G domain to interact with mature EJCs and is required for proper association of UPF3B with the EJC core proteins. Importantly, overexpressing UPF3B to restore EJC-UPF3B assembly rescues the effects of ICE1 depletion on NMD, consistent with a model in which ICE1 serves an unanticipated role in linking nuclear EJC assembly to cytoplasmic detection of NMD substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>RNAi screens suffer from high rates of false positives arising from sequence-based off-target effects and false negatives due to incomplete protein depletion. Beyond these issues, multiple sources of experimental variance can complicate the identification of true positives. To limit confounding factors inherent to siRNA screens, we designed a bioluminescent gain-of-signal output to identify NMD-associated genes. We chose a luminescence-based reporter system over other assay formats such as fluorescence because luminescence-based assays have superior sensitivity with little or no non-basal background, a significant concern for high-throughput screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan and Wood, 2007</xref>). In addition, similar assays using <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase have proven to be sensitive and reliable for mechanistic studies of NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boelz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holbrook et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woeller et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, our assay strategy results in an increase in bioluminescence with NMD inhibition, thus removing from consideration silenced genes affecting cell viability or gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaelin, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To develop the assay used for high-throughput RNAi screening, we constructed a pair of CMV promoter-driven reporters, a control construct encoding 3XFLAG-tagged firefly luciferase fused in-frame with the wild-type β-globin ORF and an NMD-sensitive construct in which a premature termination codon was introduced at β-globin position 39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Silencing of critical NMD components by siRNA was expected to inhibit decay of the PTC-containing mRNA, boosting luciferase expression. To confirm that this construct is indeed controlled by the NMD machinery, we co-transfected the plasmids with three UPF1 siRNAs into HEK-293 cells. After a 72 hr incubation, luciferase substrate was added and the luminescence signal was detected. As expected, UPF1 depletion caused a 2- to 3.5-fold increase in luciferase activity from the NMD reporter, relative to the non-silencing siRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This NMD construct expressed a significant basal level of luciferase activity, potentially allowing identification of factors that inhibit the NMD pathway as well as those required for its proper function. Clonal HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing this construct were prepared and used in subsequent characterization and siRNA library screening. To verify the proper functioning of the assay in this context, an siRNA targeting UPF1 was used as a positive control, exhibiting assay dynamic range suitable for high-throughput screening (z’-factors of &gt;0.5).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33178.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FLuc NMD-targeted assay for high-throughput RNAi screening.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fusion construct design of the NMD loss-of-function (lof) gain-of-signal (gos) reporter system (3XFLAG-FLuc-βglobinUGA) where a premature termination codon (PTC) within the second exon of the β-globin gene targets the mRNA for rapid NMD (FLuc, firefly luciferase).

Following CSA, we ranked genes by median seed-corrected Z-score of the corresponding siRNAs and subjected the top ranked hits (seed corrected Z-score &gt;1.5, 76 genes) to pathway analysis using STRING (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Szklarczyk et al., 2017</xref>]). Several canonical members of the NMD pathway were identified with seed-corrected Z-scores &gt; 1.5, including UPF1, SMG1, SMG5, SMG6, and SMG7. All four members of the core EJC also met this stringent cutoff (RBM8A, EIF4A3, MAGOH, and CASC3), along with DHX8/PRP22 and Aquarius (AQR), proteins implicated in EJC deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ideue et al., 2007</xref>). NMD pathway components UPF2 and UPF3B also exhibited a positive response in the screen, with seed corrected Z-scores of 0.98 and 0.72, respectively. In addition to proteins known to directly participate in NMD, spliceosomal proteins were highly enriched among genes whose depletion caused elevated luciferase expression, with particular over-representation of proteins from the PRP19-related, Sm, and U2 snRNP sub-complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Overall, the strong enrichment of genes involved in mRNA processing and NMD indicates that the expected biology was identified by the screen and that other high-scoring genes are likely to be members of the same processes. Moreover, the performance of the screen compares favorably to a recent CRISPR-based screen for NMD factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), particularly with respect to identification of EJC and related proteins. Despite the fact that both screens successfully enriched for proteins known to be involved in NMD, only 13 genes were shared as significant hits between the two screens, five of which were CASC3, SMG5, SMG6, SMG7, and UPF1.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33178.008</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Known NMD factors are enriched among top hits of siRNA screen.</title><p>Whole-genome siRNA screen median seed corrected Z-scores.

Of these, 27 exhibited seed-corrected Z-scores greater than 1, including known pathway components SMG1, SMG6, SMG7, EIF4A3, RBM8A, MAGOH, CASC3, CWC22, and AQR. Among the genes whose depletion caused reproducible effects on luciferase expression using multiple siRNAs, we manually curated candidates for downstream analysis, focusing on those with features suggestive of a possible role in NMD. Two promising examples were known interacting partners ICE1/KIAA0947 and the SUMO isopeptidase USPL1 (primary screen seed-corrected Z-scores of 2.91 and 3.01, respectively). These proteins are known to associate with the little elongation complex, a protein assembly that interacts with and promotes RNA polymerase II association and elongation at snRNA promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). ICE1 is a ~ 250 kDa nuclear protein proposed to have a scaffolding role in little elongation complex assembly but has not been structurally characterized or previously implicated in NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hutten et al., 2014</xref>). To gain insight into possible functions of ICE1 in NMD, we performed protein structure prediction using the Phyre2 web portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). This analysis identified a putative MIF4G domain with high confidence at the C-terminus of the protein, a region highly conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We began by evaluating the effect of ICE1 depletion on classes of transcripts with known NMD-inducing features. As the luciferase-β-globin reporter used to identify ICE1 undergoes EJC-stimulated decay, we first examined the impact of ICE1 depletion on transcript isoforms containing stop codons at least 50 nt upstream of the final exon-exon junction (PTCs). For these analyses, we focused on genes for which at least one alternative PTC-containing isoform and one normal isoform were represented in our RNAseq data, finding that ICE1 depletion specifically increased the abundance of the PTC-containing isoforms relative to the normal isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

SRSF2 represents a classic example of NMD-based autoregulation of proteins involved in alternative splicing. Accumulation of SRSF2 protein leads to excision of two introns from its own 3’UTR, generating an NMD target mRNA referred to here as SRSF2(NMD+) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sureau et al., 2001</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top schematic). Using previously characterized primers in the SRSF2 3’-UTR to distinguish SRSF2 transcript isoforms ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauer et al., 2016</xref>]; arrows denote region of amplification), our results recapitulate previous findings that SRSF2(NMD+) is a potent NMD substrate, as depletion of UPF1 resulted in a seven-fold increase in the NMD+ isoform compared to non-targeting controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom right bar graph). Consistent with our RNAseq studies, depletion of ICE1 resulted in a four-fold increase in the abundance of this NMD target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom right graph), while levels of the unspliced 3’UTR isoform SRSF2(NMD-) were not increased. These findings indicate that increases in the SRSF2(NMD+) isoform are due to disruption of EJC-stimulated NMD rather than increased transcription from the SRSF2 locus.</p><p>Transcripts containing uORFs represent a second prominent class of NMD targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>). If uORFs are efficiently used relative to the major transcript ORF, the uORF TC can be recognized as a premature termination codon and degraded by NMD. We examined genes represented in a translation initiation site (TIS) database based on ribosome profiling data from HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wan and Qian, 2014</xref>). Of the 4310 genes expressed in our RNAseq data that also met ribosome profiling read coverage cutoffs for inclusion in the TIS database, 1578 showed evidence of uORF translation. As expected of a putative NMD factor, depletion of ICE1 systematically led to increased abundance of mRNAs with empirically identified uORFs, compared to those lacking evidence of uORF translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The extent of up-regulation among uORF-containing mRNAs was less than that observed for PTC-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), possibly because leaky scanning or efficient re-initiation at downstream ORFs is sufficient to stabilize many mRNAs undergoing some degree of uORF translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neu-Yilik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang and Maquat, 1997</xref>). Because ICE1 participates in snRNA biogenesis as part of the little elongation complex, we asked whether the observed increases in uORF-containing mRNAs could be attributed to alterations in splicing. We detected alternative splicing events using two independent software packages, Majiq and Leafcutter, and excluded any genes found to undergo of splicing changes upon ICE1 depletion by either algorithm, using permissive cutoffs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; see Materials and methods for details; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>]). Removing these genes from the analysis of uORF-containing mRNAs had no apparent impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Likewise, removing the genes for which evidence of a PTC-containing isoform was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) had no effect on the relationship between ICE1 depletion and uORF mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Despite advances in uORF identification, there remain few human transcripts in which relative translation efficiencies of uORFs and primary ORFs are well characterized. For this reason, we chose to validate ICE1’s role in uORF-directed decay by studying key regulators of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) known to be subject to translational regulation through uORFs that are inhibitory to translation of the downstream codon sequence (CDS). Under normal conditions, expression of both the transcription factor CHOP/DDIT3 and the phosphatase regulatory subunit GADD34/PPP1R15A are impaired by a mechanism involving translation of an inhibitory uORF that prevents downstream reinitiation at the CDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Young and Wek, 2016</xref>). The inability of the ribosome to translate the CDS and displace UPF1 and/or EJCs predisposes these transcripts for NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weischenfeldt et al., 2008</xref>). To investigate the effect of ICE1 depletion on transcript abundance of the ISR members CHOP/DDIT3 and GADD34/PPP1R15A, we performed RT-qPCR on RNA from cells treated with siICE1 or a non-targeting control siRNA. During ICE1 depletion, there was a 2–2.5 fold increase in the abundance of these uORF-containing transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To ensure that this was not an artifact of ICE1 depletion potentially inducing the ISR, we also measured levels of the downstream ISR member ASNS, which is transcriptionally induced during the ISR but not under translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbosa-Tessmann et al., 2000</xref>). ICE1 depletion did not increase ASNS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and we did not observe alterations in mRNA processing of these and other genes induced by ICE1 depletion (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the increase in CHOP/DDIT3 and GADD34/PPP1R15A levels was the product of reduced NMD activity.</p><p>Due to the large number of human NMD targets made susceptible to decay via long 3’UTRs, we also examined the impact of ICE1 depletion on abundance of transcripts with varying 3’UTR lengths. We stratified genes into quartiles on the basis of the 3’UTR length of their most highly expressed isoforms in siNT-treated cells. The responses of genes with 3’UTRs in the shortest two quartiles (&lt;354 nt and 355–961 nt) were indistinguishable, but ICE1 depletion resulted in significantly increased abundance of genes with 3’UTRs in the longest two quartiles (962–2158 nt and &gt;2158 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The failure of ICE1 depletion to enhance abundance of mRNAs with 3’UTRs of moderate length (355–961 nt) differs from the significantly enhanced accumulation of such mRNAs in UPF1-depleted cells, but further work will be required to determine whether this is due to biological or technical differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As with the uORF-containing mRNAs, exclusion of mRNAs exhibiting ICE1-dependent splicing changes or expression of PTC-containing isoforms had no effect on the analysis of ICE1 depletion and 3’UTR-dependent changes in mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In subsequent qRT-PCR studies, ICE1 knockdown led to increased abundance of some long 3’UTR-containing mRNAs sensitive to UPF1 depletion, including ZNF667 (1855 nt 3’UTR), CDK6 (10,235 nt), and SETD7 (5461 nt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To begin to explore the role of ICE1 in regulating EJC-UPF3B interactions, we examined the localization of stably expressed GFP-tagged UPF3B in cells treated with control or ICE1 siRNAs. Following siRNA transfection, we marked nuclei with Hoechst stain and subjected cells to imaging flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This approach allowed quantitative determination of the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of GFP-UPF3B in thousands of cells. In control cells, GFP-UPF3B was predominantly nuclear, but prominent diffuse cytoplasmic signal could also be observed, resulting in a median nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of 2.89 ± 0.85 S.E.M. In contrast, ICE1 depletion caused UPF3B to accumulate in nuclei and be depleted from the cytoplasm. In knockdown cells, the median nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio shifted significantly to 5.59 ± 2.65 S.E.M. (Mann Whitney test, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>), presumably decreasing UPF3B’s capacity to interact with mRNA targets of decay. It is thought that UPF3B is exported from the nucleus in association with mRNA-bound EJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gehring et al., 2009b</xref>).

Our data suggest that ICE1 promotes association of UPF3B with the EJC, raising the possibility that ICE1 depletion may be overcome by boosting UPF3B levels. To test this hypothesis, we depleted ICE1 from parental HEK-293 cells or a cell line stably over-expressing 3XFLAG-UPF3B and assessed the ability of CASC3 to co-purify tagged and endogenous UPF3B. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), ICE1 depletion from parental cells caused a decrease in UPF3B recovery with CASC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 2 and 4).

To determine whether restoration of the EJC-UPF3B interaction could also enhance NMD, we assayed the effect of ICE1 depletion on several NMD target mRNAs in parental and UPF3B-overexpression lines. As above, ICE1 depletion caused an increase in levels of ATF3, GADD45B, GAS5, and ANXA1 mRNAs. Importantly, over-expressing exogenous UPF3B partially rescued the NMD phenotype, causing significant reductions in the abundance of the EJC-mediated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

This discovery was enabled by the CSA approach, which minimizes the impact of off-target effects mediated by siRNA seed sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marine et al., 2012</xref>). Indicative of the potential to identify novel NMD factors, this strategy resulted in high levels of enrichment of proteins known to be involved in NMD. The screen was particularly well suited to identification of factors involved in EJC-enhanced NMD, with all four core EJC components and two previously known assembly factors exhibiting high median seed-corrected Z-scores, in addition to the newly identified EJC-interacting factor ICE1. We focus on the role of ICE1 in this study, but we expect that the screen data, particularly when combined with a recent CRISPR-based screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2017</xref>), will provide a valuable resource for further investigation of novel NMD factors.</p><p>ICE1 depletion results in increased abundance of mRNAs selected for NMD on the basis of stop codons that violate the 50–55 nt rule, uORFs, and 3’UTR length. While decay of the former class is clearly stimulated by the presence of EJCs, the uORF class likely comprises a mix of transcripts that undergo EJC-dependent and EJC-independent decay, depending on transcript architecture, uORF translation frequency, and other factors. In our RNAseq studies, the largest effects of ICE1 loss appear to be on EJC-enhanced NMD, but our data also suggest a role for the protein in promoting decay of transcripts with longer than normal 3’UTRs. Even among the core NMD factors UPF2 and UPF3B, differential substrate preferences have been observed, leading to the proposal that there are multiple ‘branches’ of the NMD pathway, each with distinct cofactor requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gehring et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Metze et al., 2013</xref>). As yet, however, the RNA features underlying susceptibility to the various proposed NMD sub-pathways are not understood.</p><p>Biochemical and functional assays suggest that ICE1 functions in NMD by promoting the proper association of UPF3B with EJCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). UPF2 association with EJCs is also decreased in ICE1 knockdown cells, presumably due to the inability of UPF3B to act as a bridging factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chamieh et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to the defect in UPF3B-EJC association, we also observed reduced accumulation of UPF3B in the cytoplasm of cells depleted of ICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Since UPF3B assembly with EJCs is thought to occur in the nucleus, enhanced UPF3B nuclear localization is unlikely to account for the observed defect in EJC binding. Instead, our data indicate that reduced export of UPF3B may be in part a consequence of decreased association with EJCs in the nucleus, preventing export of UPF3B with mRNPs. Alternatively, decreased stability of the UPF3B-EJC association could result in more rapid re-import of UPF3B. In turn, the reduced abundance of UPF3B in the cytoplasm may have the side-effect of impairing long 3’UTR-mediated NMD, explaining the apparent protection of such targets upon ICE1 depletion. Promotion of efficient UPF3B nuclear export by the EJC could also be necessary for its newly identified function in translation termination and help to explain why depletion of EJC factors has been observed to affect the decay of well-characterized 3’UTR length-dependent NMD targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neu-Yilik et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Together, our data are consistent with a model in which ICE1 helps to prepare newly assembled EJCs for association with UPF3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We find that ICE1 interacts with EJC components at endogenous levels, but have not observed an interaction between the endogenous ICE1 and UPF3B proteins. As these experiments were carried out under native conditions, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is in part due to dissociation during isolation. Arguing against this scenario, we readily observe UPF3B co-immunoprecipitation with the EJC under the same purification conditions and can detect co-purification of UPF3B with ICE1 when either UPF3B or the ICE1 C-terminus is overexpressed. Overexpressed UPF3B lacking the ability to bind EJCs also fails to associate with ICE1, leading us to propose that ICE1 and UPF3B can concurrently interact with the EJC but that this complex is scarce or absent under normal cellular conditions. Together, our data suggest that ICE1 transiently interacts with fully assembled EJCs to promote UPF3B-EJC association. Possible effects of ICE1 binding to EJCs could be increased efficiency of EJC maturation or altered post-translational modification of EJC proteins, each of which could have the effect of increasing UPF3B recruitment or the stability of the complex. Alternatively, transient interactions between ICE1 and UPF3B could enhance UPF3B recruitment to EJCs.</p><p>With increasing organismal complexity, the NMD pathway has evolved to use the exon junction complex to more efficiently discriminate between aberrant and normal mRNAs. The addition of components to the pathway in turn presents new opportunities for regulatory fine-tuning of decay. Interestingly, duplication of the ancestral UPF3 gene to yield UPF3A and UPF3B proteins has recently been shown to enable cell-type-specific control of NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shum et al., 2016</xref>). UPF3A has a reduced capacity to interact with EJCs but retains important UPF2-interacting residues, allowing it to disrupt UPF3B activity by competing for UPF2 binding. Our observations suggest that the association of UPF3B with the EJC is also a potential target for regulatory control of NMD. In this case, interference with ICE1 function appears to leave the UPF2-UPF3B interaction intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), while reducing the ability of UPF3B to associate with EJCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since UPF3A and ICE1 affect distinct UPF3B interactions, they could be independently or concurrently used for cell-type- or condition-specific regulation of NMD. Further work will be required to understand whether ICE1 is subject to regulation, but our findings clearly point to an opportunity for cells and/or therapeutic interventions to manipulate ICE1 to decouple the EJC’s role in NMD from its contributions to pre-mRNA splicing, export, localization, and translation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>ICE1</td><td>Addgene plasmid # 49428</td><td valign="bottom">NM_015325</td><td>Originally KIAA0947</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pKC-4.06</td><td>This study</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>HEK-293 cell line stably expressing pCMV-3XFLAG-Fluc-B-globin (39PTC)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Flp-In T-Rex-293 cells</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat.

Pilot screens were performed by transfecting HEK-293 cells with pCMV-3XFLAG-FLuc-β-globin (39PTC) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). 24 hr after transfection, selection for stable genomic integration was performed with 800 µg/mL Geneticin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 96-well plates at three cells/well density. Two weeks following the geneticin selection, 33 monoclonal cell colonies were isolated and expanded. The colony that showed the best response to the UPF1 siRNAs (denoted pKC-4.06) was selected and expanded for use in the global assay. Whole-genome RNAi screening was conducted using the facilities of the Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation at NCATS (Rockville, MD). Considerations for design, optimization, analysis and hit selection criteria of the RNAi assay were taken according to the extensive guidelines previously outlined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auld and Inglese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 2012</xref>).

Gene-specific depletions for ICE1 and a non-targeting control siRNA were performed as described above. At the time of transfection, eGFP-fusion protein expression was induced by the addition of doxycycline to a final concentration of 200 ng/mL. Prior to harvesting the samples, Hoechst dye was added directly to the media to a final concentration of 10 µg/mL for 45 min at 37°C. At the end of the incubation period, cells were trypsinized, rinsed with 1X PBS, and resuspended in 50 μL of 1X PBS with 2% FBS in low protein binding tubes. Spectral compensation controls including non-fluorescent parentals, GFP-only, and Hoechst-only labeled cells were processed in parallel to allow for subsequent data acquisition and analysis. Data were collected and analyzed on an ImageStream imaging flow cytometer (Amnis, Millipore Sigma, Seattle, WA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, data were collected using INSPIRE software (Amnis) and 405 nm and 488 nm lasers were used to excite Hoechst and eGFP, respectively. Laser powers were chosen in order to prevent pixel saturation, and 10,000 single and focused events were captured per experimental condition. Single color compensation controls were merged to generate a compensation matrix and all sample files were analyzed with this matrix applied. Data analysis was performed with IDEAS software (version 6.2, Amnis), with eGFP expression levels or ‘intensity’ calculated by the software as the sum of pixel values minus the background pixel values. To determine nuclear localization of the eGFP signal, a morphology mask was created to conform to the shape of the nuclear Hoechst imagery. For determining the cytoplasmic area, a combined mask that subtracted the nuclear Hoechst imagery from an erode mask of the brightfield image of the total cell area was made. The intensity of GFP was then calculated by the ratio of GFP expression in the nucleus to the cytoplasmic region.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Lynne Maquat of the University of Rochester for kindly providing the β-globin plasmids used to construct the NMD luciferase fusion reporter.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ICE1 promotes the link between splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have received comments from three experts in the field all of whom found the manuscript to present new and important information about the protein ICE1 revealed in the high throughput screen for factors critical for degradation of NMD substrates. Despite broad enthusiasm, the reviewers agree that several issues need to be addressed experimentally, in addition to changes in the text to rephrase the conclusions drawn from the experiments more cautiously. In case of modest effects, softer wordings such as &quot;the data indicate/are consistent with/support the view&quot; seem more appropriate than &quot;demonstrate&quot;. Most critically, while it is clear that ICE1 impacts the amount of NMD-target mRNAs in the cell disproportionately relative to non-NMD-target mRNAs, the mechanism for this effect is not wholly clear. The reviewers recommend that the authors establish that ICE1 depletion does not alter splicing or block export from the nucleus, thus stabilizing the mRNA, and that mRNA stability is impacted and not simply overall levels (i.e. a decay experiment needs to be performed).</p><p>All reviewers had issues with Figure 4A (see detailed reviews). Finally, the reviewers had concerns about the magnitude and correlation of effects on mRNAs in UPF1 and ICE1 depletes. It seems likely that if the proposed mechanism is true (that ICE1 is involved in deposition of the EJC complex) then the RNA-seq data of the ICE1-delete should be even better correlated with that of the UPF3B-deplete than with the UPF1-deplete.</p><p>We hope these comments are helpful in revising your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the current work, Baird et al. present the results of a shRNA-based genetic screen for genes involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of a luciferase reporter. While a number of their top hits are the same as those found in a previous CRISPR based screen using a fluorescent reporter, most of the hits are non-overlapping. Among the novel candidate NMD factors that they identify is ICE1, which they go on to characterize further. Depletion of ICE1 clearly leads to stabilization of NMD targets making it an exciting novel player in NMD. Further experiments suggest that ICE1 may act by aiding recruitment of the NMD factor UPF3B to the exon junction complex. While the authors make some headway in determining ICE1's mechanistic role in NMD (interactions with UPF3B in part through the MIF4G domain), it is still not clear that ICE's role in the process is direct. This work is an important advance, but some of the experiments require additional controls, and the evaluation of their mechanistic claims will likely hinge on these additional experiments.</p><p>1) Where are the UPF proteins in Figure 1C?</p><p>2) I found Figure 4A nearly impossible to interpret. What are the bands in the anti-flag panel blot in the anti-flag IP? Non-specific bands should be indicated as well as specific ones in both sides of the panel. It looks like the mock and 3XF-MIF4GICE1 lanes are identical, meaning that there's no evidence that the pulldown worked (or else this is a non-specific band which is lower in the 3XF-UPF3B lane). This is the only evidence for sufficiency of the MIF4G domain for interaction with eIF4AIII, so this figure needs to be clarified – and if these are the main data, the interaction is quite weak.

For 3 arrays generated from a normal distribution (A, B, C), log(A/C) and log(B/C) will be highly correlated most of the time.</p><p>5) The last paragraph of the subsection “ICE1 depletion increases abundance of transcripts with NMD-inducing features” overinterprets the data in Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C. I think the simplest explanation for the differences in siICE and siUPF1 would be differences in knockdown efficiency, or perhaps differences in concentration requirements for activity. I don't think that these data represent evidence for a UTR-length dependent activity difference.</p><p>6) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1, it seems that there is some residual IP of UPF3B with ICE when UPF3B lacks the EJC-binding domain. Do these mutants display residual EJC binding? Some additional controls, perhaps with EJC factors or interacting proteins are required.</p><p>7) The authors argue that the activity of ICE1 is entirely through recruitment of UP3B to the EJC. The ideal experiment to test this would be an epistasis experiment, which may not be possible given the essentiality of the NMD machinery. However, it might be a start to check by RNA-seq that the genome-wide effects of UPF3B knockdown on NMD are similar to the effects of ICE1 on NMD. As it is, all of the genome-wide analysis presented is with comparisons of ICE to UPF1 knockdown.</p><p>8) In the Discussion: &quot;interference with ICE1 function leaves the UPF2-UPF3B interaction intact&quot;. It is not clear to me from Figure 5A that this statement is true. The UPF3B/UPF2 interaction was not tested upon ICE1 depletion (or not presented). It seems like UPF2 may be more depleted at the EJC than UPF3b upon ICE1 depletion, but this was not quantified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) detects and promotes the degradation of transcripts containing premature termination codons and other NMD-inducing features (i.e. long 3' UTRs, uORF translation). In metazoans, the efficiency of NMD is significantly enhanced by the presence of an exon junction complex (EJC) downstream of the terminating ribosome. The association of NMD protein UPF3 with EJCs is thought to underlie enhanced NMD by promoting recruitment of UPF2, which together stimulate UPF1 activity on the upstream terminating ribosome.</p><p>In this work, the authors perform a genome-wide RNAi screen in HEK-293 cells to identify novel factors required for degradation of NMD substrates, and identify ICE1, a protein previously characterized in promoting snRNA transcription. Notably, RNA-Seq analysis of cells depleted for ICE1 revealed a small increase in abundance of PTC-containing RNAs (over normal mRNA) and a modest elevation of transcripts harboring uORFs and particularly long 3' UTRs. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that ICE1 can interact with EJC core components in an RNA-independent manner, and that this interaction is mediated through a putative MIF4G domain within the C-terminus of the protein.</p><p>The authors propose that ICE1 depletion impairs the nuclear assembly of UPF3B into EJCs, resulting in impaired EJC-enhanced degradation of NMD substrates in the cytoplasm. Three pieces of evidence support this model. First, depletion of ICE1 results in the reduced association between UPF3B and EJC-core protein CASC3 by CoIP. Second, in ICE1 knock-down cells, there is an increased accumulation of UPF3B in the nucleus. Third, NMD activity in ICE1-depleted cells is partially rescued by overexpression of UPF3B.</p><p>This work proposes a novel function for ICE1 in promoting UPF3 assembly into EJCs and the downstream EJC-enhanced degradation of NMD substrates. While the model is consistent with experimental evidence, is not robustly supported by the data or directly tested. Moreover, additional interpretations could account for the experimental observations.</p><p>1) There are a number of pieces of data to suggest that ICE1 may have an independent or additional function in mRNA metabolism outside of promoting UPF3B association with EJCs.</p><p>a) While depletion of ICE1 appears to cause a reproducible reduction (but not elimination) in UPF3B association with core EJC components, its depletion increases the abundance of two characterized NMD substrates 4-fold greater than depletion of the core NMD factor, UPF1 (Figure 4B). This is completely unexpected if ICE1 function on these transcripts is through NMD.</p><p>b) While over-expression of UPF3B completely restores its ability to associate with EJCs (as measured by CASC3 CoIP; Figure 6A), the abundance of several NMD-sensitive mRNAs is only partially restored (~50%; Figure 6B) – indicating that abrogation of NMD in ICE1-depleted cells is not caused entirely by impaired interaction between UPF3B and the EJC.</p><p>c) A function for ICE1 in EJC assembly/remodeling is unexpected given its absence from past biochemical characterizations of EJC components.</p><p>2) It is never tested whether ICE1 function on NMD-substrate abundance is directly mediated through the NMD pathway. For example, ICE1 depletion should not alter mRNA levels in cells also inhibited for NMD (e.g. depleted also for UPF1).</p><p>3) The authors present evidence that the putative MIF4G domain of ICE1 is itself sufficient for mediating an interaction with EJC proteins and that over-expression of this domain can partially inhibit NMD (Figure 4). To further demonstrate of the importance and requirement of this domain and to help preclude an independent role for ICE1 in mRNA metabolism (through its activity in snRNA transcription, for example), the authors should examine the requirement of ICE1 lacking its putative MIF4G domain for interaction with EJCs and the observed reduction in NMD activity.</p><p>4) Experiments directly assessing a role for ICE1 in EJC assembly should be provided to support the main conclusion of this work. For example, the ability of UPF3B to assemble into EJCs in vitro should be evaluated in the presence and absence of ICE1 (with and without its MIF4G domain).</p><p>5) Given that the EJC composition is altered and that UPF3B is retained in the nucleus upon ICE1 depletion, the authors should provide evidence that NMD inhibition is not due to retention of mRNA in the nucleus or inhibition of translation in the cytoplasm.</p><p>6) Depletion efficiencies for the various factors are generally not reported (Figure 2D and 5A are notable exceptions) and controls are often lacking. Note that depletion of ICE1 in Figure 5A is quite poor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In a genome-wide siRNA screen using a Luciferase-based NMD reporter, Baird and colleagues identified – apart from some of the well-known NMD factors and the EJC core components – ICE1 as a new NMD factor. While the identification only one new NMD factor from such a &quot;tour de force&quot; approach may be somewhat disappointing, the authors did a nice job in investigating the role of ICE1 in NMD. So far, very little was known about ICE1 apart from an involvement in the assembly of the small elongation complex, which plays a role in snRNA transcription. Using a combination of knockdowns, overexpressions, RNA-seq, NMD reporter assays and IPs, the authors provide compelling evidence that ICE1 facilitates the assembly of UPF3B with the EJC core and thereby promotes EJC-enhanced NMD.</p><p>Before publication, the following two points should be addressed:</p><p>1) Figure 4A: It seems that the FLAG antibody failed to pull down the 3XF-MIF4G ICE1 construct. Instead you have a strong unspecific band (also present in the mock) that is detected with the FLAG antibody. Nevertheless, eIF4AIII is only detected in the IP of the cells expressing the ICE1 MIF4G but not in the mock. Something is not kosher with this IP; please explain.</p><p>2) Discussion: The authors state that ICE1 may be involved in degradation of a subset of 3'UTR-mediated decay targets. I wonder if this subset might be 3'UTRs that contain a spliced intron, and by inference an EJC, and thus belong to the EJC-enhanced class of NMD targets. Were the 3' UTR transcripts used for the analysis in Figure 2E filtered for transcripts lacking annotated introns in the 3' UTRs or could the observed effect originate from such &quot;EJC-enhanced&quot; NMD targets with 3' UTR introns? Consistent with my suggestion, the long 3' UTR of SMG5 mRNA is a NMD-inducing feature and contains no annotated intron, and this transcript was not affected by ICE1 knockdown (Figure 6B). Re-analyzing the RNA-seq data could perhaps solve this important question.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33178.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Where are the UPF proteins in Figure 1C?</p></disp-quote><p>The rank seed-corrected Z-scores of the siRNAs targeting ICE1 and UPF proteins among the 64,753 siRNAs in the screen are as follows:</p><p>UPF1: 218, 745, 1367</p><p>UPF2: 219, 2800, 37181</p><p>UPF3B: 1948, 5062, 9257</p><p>ICE1: 239, 342, 30797</p><p>Since it is difficult to represent all of these siRNAs in the plot in Figure 1C, we chose SMG1 and SMG6 as two well-characterized NMD factors with strong responses in the screen.

As referenced in the previous figure legend, the high levels of UPF3B and IgG present on the immunoblot and inefficient detection due to probing of the membrane with multiple antibodies made the lower levels of recovery of the putative MIF4G domain difficult to visualize. We have resolved this issue in the revised version by focusing on the putative MIF4G domain and using exposures that more clearly show the association. We have also added Figure 5—figure supplement 1, in which we performed FLAG purifications of transiently expressed full-length ICE1 protein, a version lacking the C-terminus, and the C-terminus alone, finding that the C-terminus preferentially recovered EJC proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5B, the total amount of GFP-UPF3B is not presented, only the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.

In addition to the reason cited by the reviewer, the involvement of both ICE1 and UPF1 in multiple cellular processes complicates the analysis. We have taken several approaches in the revised manuscript to further analyze the relationship between ICE1 and NMD. Using a recently developed approach to infer relative transcript stability from steady-state RNAseq, we find that mRNAs with uORFs or long 3’UTRs are systematically stabilized by ICE1 knockdown (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F). We also show that transcripts that exhibit increases in steady state levels upon UPF1 or ICE1 depletion are preferentially stabilized in ICE1 knockdown cells (Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C, and D). Further, we have performed a second RNAseq study involving UPF3B depletion, from which we find that mRNAs that are stabilized in both UPF1 and UPF3B depletion show larger increases in relative stability upon ICE1 depletion than those stabilized in only one knockdown condition (Figure 3B). We have also corroborated these findings by using metabolic labeling to show that ICE1 depletion increases half-lives of endogenous NMD targets (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The last paragraph of the subsection “ICE1 depletion increases abundance of transcripts with NMD-inducing features” overinterprets the data in Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.

Instead, our data suggest that this is a role of ICE1 in NMD, but we cannot (and do not claim to) rule out the possibility of additional functions of ICE1 in NMD or indirect effects of ICE1 depletion on some targets of NMD. Further, we have revised the text to more precisely state that our model does not specify that ICE1 acts through recruitment of UPF3B to the EJC. We instead say that it promotes the UPF3B-EJC association and more clearly explain that this could either be by increased recruitment or increased stability of the assembled complex.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that loss of cell viability upon knockout of either core NMD factors or ICE1 precludes epistasis experiments. As suggested, we have instead performed RNAseq on UPF3B knockdown cells, finding that ICE1 knockdown stabilizes RNAs stabilized in UPF1 and UPF3B knockdowns to a similar extent and that the population of RNAs stabilized in both UPF1 and UPF3B knockdowns show an even greater response to ICE1 knockdown (Figure 3B).

The lower levels of UPF2 recovered in the CASC3 IPs precluded accurate quantification, so we cannot draw conclusions about possible additional effects on UPF2-EJC association.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) There are a number of pieces of data to suggest that ICE1 may have an independent or additional function in mRNA metabolism outside of promoting UPF3B association with EJCs.</p><p>a) While depletion of ICE1 appears to cause a reproducible reduction (but not elimination) in UPF3B association with core EJC components, its depletion increases the abundance of two characterized NMD substrates 4-fold greater than depletion of the core NMD factor, UPF1 (Figure 4B). This is completely unexpected if ICE1 function on these transcripts is through NMD.</p></disp-quote><p>Because these experiments involve partial gene depletion, not gene knockouts (the NMD proteins and ICE1 are essential for cell viability), it is difficult to base conclusions on the relative magnitudes of the effects observed with different gene knockdowns. It is well established that some proteins require a greater extent of depletion to manifest a phenotype than others. As UPF1 is an abundant protein, others and we have observed that it is relatively insensitive to changes in dosage. On the other hand, ICE1 is less abundant and appears to work at a specific interval in mRNP maturation, making it plausible that it would be more sensitive to changes in protein levels. Illustrating this point, several NMD-related proteins produced higher Z-scores in the screen than UPF1, including SMG1, SMG5, SMG6, SMG7, and all of the core members of the EJC. Further, it is also well established that the NMD pathway is subject to extensive feedback regulation, in part through decay of NMD factor mRNAs with long 3’UTRs. In our experiments, we see a preferential impact of ICE1 depletion on EJC-stimulated decay, with little or no effect on the NMD factor mRNAs with long 3’UTRs. This may mean that the pathway is less able to compensate for the loss of ICE1 by increasing the expression of the core NMD proteins, resulting in larger changes in steady state abundance of some targets.</p><p>Also, we wish to clarify that we do not claim or believe that ICE1 does not have a role in mRNA metabolism outside of its function in promoting EJC-UPF3B interactions. The evidence in the literature is clear that it is involved in snRNA transcription as part of the little elongation complex, and we also observe alterations in splicing of some genes (Supplementary file 5 of the revised manuscript). We have extended our analysis of the RNAseq data to test whether alternative splicing of mRNAs with NMD-inducing features could explain our results. As part of this effort, we repeated our analysis of the effect of ICE1 depletion on uORFs and long 3’UTRs after removing all genes for which there was an indication of alternative splicing in response to ICE1 depletion, using two independent programs and highly permissive cutoffs, but this had no effect on our findings (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We also provide RNAseq traces for several validated targets (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), which indicate that the changes in abundance cannot be explained by altered processing. Together, our data suggest that ICE1 is important for promoting proper association of UPF3B with EJCs and that NMD is inhibited when this function is abrogated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) While over-expression of UPF3B completely restores its ability to associate with EJCs (as measured by CASC3 CoIP; Figure 6A), the abundance of several NMD-sensitive mRNAs is only partially restored (~50%; Figure 6B) – indicating that abrogation of NMD in ICE1-depleted cells is not caused entirely by impaired interaction between UPF3B and the EJC.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we do not claim that ICE1 does not have additional functions to those uncovered here, but instead present evidence that this is a mechanism by which it can affect NMD. Further, this comment over-interprets our findings. Because knockdowns and overexpression are by nature heterogenous from cell-to-cell, some cells may exhibit enhanced UPF3B-EJC association in response to overexpression, while others will exhibit partial or no rescue. Thus, it is not unexpected that a bulk biochemical assay would indicate complete rescue on average while a functional assay would indicate incomplete rescue. This is particularly true if the defect in UPF3B-EJC interactions is due to reduced stability of the complex. In this scenario, the association would appear to be fully rescued at steady state, but the complexes may not persist long enough to fulfill their cytoplasmic function in NMD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) A function for ICE1 in EJC assembly/remodeling is unexpected given its absence from past biochemical characterizations of EJC components.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of two major unbiased biochemical efforts to identify EJC components via mass spectrometry (Tange et al., <italic>RNA</italic>, 2005, and Singh et al., 2012). While it is true that these studies did not identify ICE1 as an EJC-interacting protein, they also failed to identify UPF3B in association with EJCs, clearly indicating that they were not exhaustive analyses of EJC-interacting proteins. Partially explaining the earlier lack of identification, we have observed that Flag-tagged eIF4A3 (as used in the Singh et al., study) is incapable of efficiently co-purifying either UPF3B or ICE1, whereas antibodies against endogenous ICE1 or eIF4A3 allow reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is never tested whether ICE1 function on NMD-substrate abundance is directly mediated through the NMD pathway. For example, ICE1 depletion should not alter mRNA levels in cells also inhibited for NMD (e.g. depleted also for UPF1).</p></disp-quote><p>As above, this type of experiment is not possible using gene knockdowns, due to the complicating factor that only partial protein depletion can be observed. Because we can only incompletely deplete these essential proteins, we would in fact predict that concurrent depletion of ICE1 and UPF1 would cause a greater defect than depletion of either protein alone. For example, Huang et al., 2011 showed that simultaneous depletion of UPF1 and SMG1 increased levels of NMD target mRNAs above those observed upon independent depletion of UPF1 or SMG1. This finding illustrates that this is not a valid criterion for evaluating the involvement of a protein in NMD. Instead, we have bolstered our analysis of the effect of ICE1 depletion on well-characterized NMD targets and other mRNAs with known NMD-inducing features. Please see the response to reviewer 1, point 4, for details. These data all indicate that ICE1 depletion affects NMD, and our biochemical studies suggest that this is at least in part due to ICE1’s ability to interact with EJCs and promote UPF3B-EJC interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors present evidence that the putative MIF4G domain of ICE1 is itself sufficient for mediating an interaction with EJC proteins and that over-expression of this domain can partially inhibit NMD (Figure 4).

Consistent with my suggestion, the long 3' UTR of SMG5 mRNA is a NMD-inducing feature and contains no annotated intron, and this transcript was not affected by ICE1 knockdown (Figure 6B).

Further, manual examination of RNAseq reads arising from the long 3’UTR-containing mRNAs studied in Figure 2F (and others) revealed no evidence for downstream splicing events.
