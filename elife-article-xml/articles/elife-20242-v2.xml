If we can understand how insect scent detection works at the molecular and cellular level, we may be able to devise new ways of manipulating the insects’ sense of smell and prevent them from finding us.</p><p>Insects contain a family of proteins called odorant binding proteins that are intriguing in several ways. They are numerous (there are 52 kinds in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>), they are diverse and some are made in remarkably large amounts in the antennae. Fine hair-like structures known as olfactory sensilla protrude from the surface of the antennae. Odorant binding proteins are widely believed to carry odorant molecules through the fluid inside the sensilla to olfactory neurons, which then send signals that trigger the insect’s response to the scent.</p><p>Larter et al. have now mapped the most abundant odorant binding proteins to the various olfactory sensilla of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This revealed that a type of sensillum known as ab8 contained only one abundant odorant binding protein, called Obp28a. Unexpectedly, Larter et al. found that ab8 sensilla that are deprived of this protein respond strongly to odorant molecules. This result suggests that Obp28a is not required to transport odorants to the neurons in ab8; indeed, it appears that these neurons do not require an abundant odorant binding protein in order to respond to a scent. Instead, Obp28a helps to moderate the effects of sudden changes in the level of an odorant in the environment, so that concentrated odors do not trigger too large a response from the olfactory neurons.</p><p>The details of the role that Obp28a plays in olfactory sensilla remain to be investigated in future studies, and the map created by Larter et al. also lays a foundation for studying the roles of other odorant binding proteins. The discovery that Obp28a is not needed to transport odorant molecules also raises questions about how insects are able to detect smells. Many odorant molecules repel water, so how do these molecules travel through the fluid in the sensilla if odorant binding proteins are not needed to transport them?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20242.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20242.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>odorants</kwd><kwd>odorant binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larter</surname><given-names>Nikki K</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jennifer S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jennifer S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dwight N. and Noyes D.

The <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna is covered with olfactory sensilla that fall into three main morphological classes: basiconic, trichoid and coeloconic sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>). Basiconic sensilla detect many fruit odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>); trichoid sensilla sense pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clyne et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ha and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>); coeloconic sensilla detect organic acids and amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao et al., 2005</xref>). Each class can in turn be divided into functional types. For example, 10 types of basiconic sensilla, designated ab1 (antennal basiconic 1) through ab10, detect different subsets of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elmore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marshall et al., 2010</xref>). Olfactory sensilla are perforated by pores or channels through which odorants can pass, and they contain an aqueous lymph in which the dendrites of up to four olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are bathed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Many sensilla contain two ORNs, designated A and B based on their spike amplitudes. Sensilla also contain a thecogen (sheath) cell, a trichogen (shaft) cell, and one or two tormogen (socket) cells. These cells produce the lymph and wrap around the ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shanbhag et al., 2000</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20242.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Organization of the antenna and expression of <italic>Obps.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scanning electron micrograph of antennae (arrowheads) on a <italic>Drosophila</italic> head.

One class, the odor receptors, have been mapped to specific types of sensilla and to individual neurons within those sensilla, and their functional specificities have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). The other class, called odorant binding proteins (Obps), have been the subject of much investigation in many insects but remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelosi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vogt and Riddiford, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Obps are remarkable in three ways: they are numerous, being encoded by a family of 52 genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; they are abundant, with some encoded by the most abundant mRNAs in the antenna; they are diverse, with members sharing only 20% amino acid identity on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hekmat-Scafe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>). They are small proteins, on the order of 14 kDa, and despite their high sequence divergence they are believed to have a common structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham and Davies, 2002</xref>). Many are found in the lymph of olfactory sensilla, where ORN dendrites are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shanbhag et al., 2001a</xref>). They bind odorants, with different degrees of affinity and selectivity reported for different Obps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leal et al., 2005</xref>). Within a species, different Obps are expressed in different antennal sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKenna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pikielny et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultze et al., 2013</xref>), and some are expressed in the taste system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galindo and Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pikielny et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shanbhag et al., 2001b</xref>) or in larval chemosensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galindo and Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Despite numerous studies of Obps, much remains to be learned about their function. They are widely believed to bind, solubilize, and transport hydrophobic odorants across the aqueous sensillum lymph to receptors in the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gomez-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vogt et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wojtasek and Leal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Obps have also been proposed to accelerate the termination of odor response, by removing odorants from receptors or from the sensillar lymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vogt and Riddiford, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ziegelberger, 1995</xref>). A variety of studies support a role for Obps in olfactory perception in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biessmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelletier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swarup et al., 2011</xref>). However, to date, the physiological role of only one Obp, Obp76a, has been thoroughly investigated in the olfactory system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gomez-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laughlin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Obp76a, also called LUSH, is required in trichoid sensilla for normal response of the odor receptor Or67d to the pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), although responses of Or67d to cVA have been detected in the absence of Obp76a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gomez-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van der Goes van Naters and Carlson, 2007</xref>). LUSH has been found to bind cVA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kruse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laughlin et al., 2008</xref>), but also binds other insect pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katti et al., 2013</xref>), short-chain alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thode et al., 2008</xref>), and phthalates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>One reason the role of Obps has remained unclear is that their molecular organization has not been established. Previous work has not defined which Obps are expressed in individual sensilla, nor in which sensilla individual Obps are expressed. Thus it has been difficult to carry out well-defined manipulations of Obp content. Here we take advantage of a recent RNA-Seq analysis that quantified <italic>Obp</italic> expression in the antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>). We examine the expression of the abundant <italic>Obps</italic> at the level of sensillum morphology, sensillum functional type, and cell type. The results illustrate basic principles of olfactory system organization, and they allow construction of an Obp-to-sensillum map. The map identifies a sensillum type that contains only one highly expressed <italic>Obp, Obp28a</italic>. We delete this <italic>Obp</italic> gene and analyze the effects physiologically. Surprisingly, we find that deletion of the only abundant <italic>Obp</italic> in this sensillum type does not reduce the magnitude of its ORN responses. Additionally, we find evidence suggesting that this Obp plays a role not previously demonstrated for Obps, in buffering sudden increases in odorant levels. This Obp could provide a molecular mechanism of gain control that acts prior to receptor activation. Together, this work provides a foundation for incisive studies of Obp function, suggests that some sensilla do not require an abundant Obp for odorant transport, and encourages a broader view of the functions performed by the large and diverse family of Obps.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diverse expression patterns of abundant <italic>Obps</italic></title><p>We systematically analyzed the expression patterns of the 10 <italic>Obps</italic> that are expressed most abundantly in the antenna.

The 10 abundant <italic>Obps</italic> are expressed in diverse antennal regions and in different morphological classes of sensilla. Within a morphological class, they are expressed in distinct functional types, and within different cell types. The diversity of these genes in expression pattern and amino acid sequence, together with their remarkably high abundance, provokes questions about their roles in olfactory function. The Obp-to-sensillum map lays a foundation for addressing these questions.</p><p>Most of these <italic>Obps</italic> are expressed in only one morphological class of sensillum. It seems likely that many Obps have evolved to fill specialized needs of particular sensilla. For example, coeloconic sensilla express a subset of <italic>Obps</italic> that does not overlap with those expressed by other sensilla. This pattern of mutually exclusive expression may reflect the ancient origin of the coeloconic sensilla, their unique double-walled architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>), their response to many polar odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>), or their expression of a different family of receptors, IRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croset et al., 2010</xref>).

These results are consistent with the concept that Obps are essential to the coding of olfactory information within sensilla.</p><p>The map reveals that some functionally distinct basiconic sensilla, such as ab1 and ab2, contain the same subset of abundant <italic>Obps</italic>. This finding supports the notion that Obps do not dictate the response profile of ORNs; rather, it is consistent with the conclusion from ‘empty neuron’ and heterologous expression analysis that the odor response profile of an ORN is conferred by the odor receptor that it expresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>).

Many sensilla of widely diverse insects contain tubular structures called pore tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinbrecht, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). These structures, which can be up to 1 μm long and 15–20 nm in diameter, extend from the wall pores of the sensilla into the interior of the sensillum, often making contact with dendritic membranes. The number of pore tubules per pore ranges up to 20, and the estimated number of pore tubules per sensillum ranges as high as 83,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinbrecht, 1997</xref>).

Thus an odorant would follow a three-dimensional trajectory through the air to the antenna, a two-dimensional path in the hydrophobic antennal surface cuticle to a wall pore, and then a one-dimensional trajectory toward the dendritic membrane via a pore tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam and Delbruck, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaissling et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steinbrecht, 1997</xref>).

The mutant also showed an accelerated decline in the firing level following the termination of a prolonged odor stimulus. The overall response profile to a panel of diverse odorants, however, was similar between the mutant and control. These results are interesting because they argue against some alternative models of Obp28a function. Specifically, in addition to transporting odorants, Obps have been proposed to protect odorants from degradative enzymes, to inactivate odorants following stimulus termination, or to filter them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaissling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pelosi and Maida, 1995</xref>). If Obp28a protected odorants in ab8 we would expect a greater initial response in the control than in <italic>Obp28a</italic> mutants. If Obp28a inactivated odorants at the end of the odor response, we would expect a faster decline in the control at the end of odor stimulation. If Obp28a selectively filtered certain odorants, we would expect differences in the response profiles of mutant and control. We note moreover that the similarity in response profiles is consistent with results from the empty neuron system. If Obp28a selectively filtered certain odorants, we would expect the Or35a receptor to confer a different odor response profile in basiconic sensilla, which express <italic>Obp28a</italic>, and in coeloconic sensilla, which do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, the response profiles of Or35a in the two sensillum types are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We do not claim that the role of Obp28a in ab8 can be extrapolated to all Obps and all olfactory sensilla. Obp28a is expressed in all basiconic sensilla, and could play a broader role than Obps expressed in only a subset of sensilla. One of the most intriguing aspects of Obps and sensilla is their diversity. Different Obps are likely to have different functions: there is evidence for reduction in olfactory function following reduction in the levels of certain Obps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biessmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pelletier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swarup et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2005</xref>), and another Obp has been found to contribute to the inhibition of neurons in the taste system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>). In this regard, we found that the most abundant Obp transcript in the antenna, <italic>Obp19d</italic>, is expressed in epidermal cells and not accessory cells, consistent with the findings of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2000</xref>), and is thus unlikely to be secreted into sensillar lymph. It seems plausible that Obp19a binds ligands other than odorants, as may other Obps that are expressed outside the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pitts et al., 2014</xref>). Not only are Obps highly diverse, but sensilla also are diverse in structure and function, as illustrated by the lack of visible pore tubules in trichoid sensilla of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shanbhag et al., 1999</xref>). We have focused on a single Obp and a single sensillum type because the map constructed in this study allowed us to manipulate them with unparalleled definition.</p><p>How does the presence of Obp28a reduce the initial response to odorant and prolong the response following termination of a long, intense stimulus? It is possible that following the sudden influx of an odor stimulus, some of the odorant binds to Obp28a, thereby reducing the amount available for receptor activation. After the termination of a prolonged stimulus, odorant released from the Obp-odorant complex might increase the level available for receptor binding. In both cases the Obp would buffer the system against sudden changes in odor level.</p><p>The olfactory circuit has evolved a cellular mechanism of gain control, in which local interneurons inhibit ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Root et al., 2008</xref>). This gain control is believed to play a critical role in preventing network saturation and in improving odorant discrimination. It is possible that Obp28a provides an additional mechanism of gain control, which acts at the molecular level as opposed to the cellular level. This molecular form of gain control would precede the cellular form, occurring even before the odor receptor or the neuron were activated.</p><p>We note finally that even small effects on ORN firing rate can have large effects on odor perception and behavior. ORNs form synapses with second-order neurons called projection neurons (PNs), and the relationship between the firing rates of ORNs and PNs is non-linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>). Moreover, PNs also appear to respond most vigorously to odor onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilson, 2013</xref>). Thus, even a modest alteration in the firing rate during the initial phase of response could have an important effect on the way olfactory information is represented in the CNS and on the behavior that it drives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p><italic>Or-GAL4</italic> drivers were from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (NIH P40OD018537). <italic>nompA-GAL4</italic> and <italic>ASE5-GAL4</italic> were provided by C.

Digoxigenin (DIG) and Fluorescein (FITC) labeled probes were created using DIG RNA Labeling Kit SP6/T7 and Fluorescein-labeled UTP (Roche, Branford, CT), and purified with the RNEasy Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry</title><p>We used seven day-old flies in all staining experiments except that we used flies less than 1-day-old, many within a few hours of eclosion, when labeling with <italic>ASE5-Gal4</italic> and <italic>nompA-Gal4</italic> because these markers are developmentally regulated and staining was weak in older flies. Male and female flies were anesthetized, placed in a collar, covered with OCT (Tissue-Tek, VWR, Radnor, PA), and frozen on dry ice. 14 µm antennal cryosections were collected on slides and stained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, sections were fixed and acetylated at room temperature, pre-hybridized, and then incubated with DIG and/or FITC probes at 65°C overnight. Detection of probes was carried out with anti-DIG-POD or anti-FITC-POD in 1% Blocking Reagent (Roche) and amplified with Cy3 or Cy5 TSA (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). GFP was detected with mouse-anti-GFP (Roche) and Alexa-fluor-488 donkey-anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen). All microscopy was performed using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and images were processed with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>We used 6–8 day old female flies for single-sensillum recordings essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>). Filtered AC signals (50–2000 Hz) were recorded and digitized with a Digidata 1440 digitizer and Axoscope 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). Action potentials were detected and counted using custom Matlab (MathWorks) scripts written by Carlotta Martelli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martelli et al., 2013</xref>), with few if any modifications. All spikes were counted due to difficulty in reliably sorting A and B neurons in ab8 sensilla. Impulse responses are defined as the firing rate during the stimulus period minus the baseline firing rate. Odors typically take 100 ms to reach the antenna, due to the length of the odor delivery tube, so the stimulus period is considered to start 100 ms after the opening of the odor delivery valve and persists for the length of the pulse, which in nearly all cases was 500 ms. The baseline firing rate was calculated by counting the number of spikes during the 500 ms period prior to odorant release. To generate dose response curves, each sensillum was tested with all concentrations of odor in ascending order of dose, and no more than 3 sensilla were analyzed per fly. ab8 sensilla were identified by their location and physical attributes and confirmed by their strong response to 10<sup>−3</sup> 2,3-butanediol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>). Spikes for peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were binned in 50 ms intervals except that in the 30s stimulus paradigm they were binned in 1s intervals. Statistical significance was assessed using Prism’s (GraphPad) two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. Values shown are the mean +/− SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Odor stimuli</title><p>Odor stimuli were prepared and delivered essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>). 1-octanol, butyric acid, 3-methylthio-1-propanol, γ-hexalactone, furfural, 2-pentanone, 2-pentanol, ethyl-3-hydroxybutyrate, and were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), methyl benzoate and linalool oxide were purchased from Fluka (St. Louis, MO), and ethyl acetate was purchased from J.T. Baker (Center Valley, PA). Odorants of the highest grade available were used and were then diluted in paraffin oil (Fluka). For 500 ms pulses, 50 μl of diluted odorant was applied to a 13 mm filter paper disc inside a Pasteur pipette and capped with a 1 ml pipette tip to create an odor cartridge. Cartridges were allowed to equilibrate for 20 min before use. Each cartridge was used no more than three times and with more than 10 min between uses, to allow the odor to re-equilibrate. Mutant and control flies were tested in parallel, on the same day, and in the same manner. Stimuli were presented by placing the tip of the cartridge into a glass tube delivering a humidified air stream (~2000 ml/min) to the fly, and administering a 500 ms pulse of air (~200 ml/min) through the cartridge. For experiments with a 30 s odor stimulus, 25 ml pipettes were used in place of Pasteur pipettes, with three filter papers, each 55 mm in diameter, and 1 ml of odor dilution. These large cartridges were used up to eight times, since independent PID measurements showed no substantial decrease in odor concentration after more than 10 uses. For experiments with a background odor, a 125 ml flask with 5 ml of odor dilution was inserted between the main airstream and the odor delivery tube. Flies were exposed to the background odor for more than 5 min before beginning the experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Harrison, K O’Connor-Giles, and J Wildonger for plasmids pDsRed-attP (Addgene plasmid 51019; unpublished) and pU6-BbsI-chiRNA (Addgene plasmid 45946; Gratz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>As you note below, both reviewers consider the work significant and data of high quality. Both wish that the findings can be more generalized, with somewhat overlapping suggestions. After discussions between the reviewers, we agree that you should try your best in your revised manuscript to satisfy both reviewers' critiques (in particular reviewer #2, who has more substantial suggestions), which can be achieved in several months of time frame.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Larter and colleagues provided a comprehensive characterization of 10 most abundantly expressed odorant binding proteins (obps), a large family of proteins expressed in insect olfactory systems previously hypothesized to function in carrying odors to the dendritic surface of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). They found that each is expressed in a specific type(s) of sensilla, in specific subtypes within the basiconic sensilla, and in specific cell types associated with ORNs (but not in ORNs themselves). By analyzing loss of function phenotypes of Obp28a that is uniquely expressed in ab8 basiconic sensillum, they provide strong evidence against the prevailing hypotheses about obp function: transporting odorants to ORNs or removing odorants efficiently after the stimulus period. Rather, their data suggest a new function for obp: gain control to buffer sudden changes in odorant concentrations.</p><p>This paper is well written and technical quality of the data is high. I recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after revisions that address the following (relatively minor) points.</p><p>1) Although the authors were careful in qualifying their statements in Discussion based on detailed findings of a single ORN class, they should be more circumspect in their Abstract about the limitations of extrapolating the generality of their findings.</p><p>2) In point iii) of the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Responses of a sensillum in vivo in the absence of an abundant Obp”: the authors describe additional analysis for ab4 as data not shown. These should be shown as a supplement. It would have been stronger if the authors examined ab9, which only expresses Obp28a as an abundant Obp.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript by Larter, Sun, and Carlson, the authors investigate the function of odorant binding proteins (OBPs), which are among the most widely expressed, yet poorly understood, proteins found in olfactory organs (but also found elsewhere). The authors generate a detailed anatomical map for the top 10 antennal expressed (by RNA-seq) OBPs, finding that OBPs differ in which sensilla they are expressed, and also in which cells they are expressed within that sensilla. They identify Obp28a as being the main OBP expressed in ab8 sensilla, generate an <italic>obp28a</italic> mutant, and characterize odor response properties of the neurons within ab8. Surprisingly, they find that <italic>obp28a</italic> mutants exhibited increased responses, especially at higher odor concentrations, and often exhibited sustained activity after the odor pulse. This suggests that this OBP may function to sequester odorants, perhaps as a form of gain control. This highlights an unexpected role for OBPs in olfactory signaling.</p><p>The characterization of OBPs is important as they underlie a long-lasting puzzle- what is the function of these highly expressed olfactory proteins in odor responses? The anatomical descriptions of OBP expressions will be useful for future investigations. The manuscript is clearly written, and the data is high quality, well presented and described.</p><p>However, the manuscript does not go far enough in addressing the biological puzzle regarding OBPs. It helps clarify more about what an Obp does not do, but we are still left with questions on what they could do. The other most well characterized OBP, LUSH (Obp76a) has a very different function in at1 sensilla- that is to enhance signaling by the cVA pheromone. In the current work, the authors found Obp28a functions to reduce signaling by odorants. This is indeed interesting, as it suggests the roles for Obps will be many and various. But we are left wondering if Obp28a represents a single exception, or part of the varied landscape of Obp functions. As such, it would be greatly informative if the authors had examined the role of at least one additional Obp on odorant-induced activities. Detailed below is a possible experimental strategy, but other examples to address this would be acceptable.</p><p>The authors chose mutating Obp28a and examining ab8 as Obp28a is the only Obp expressed in ab8. This is a reasonable approach, but could be extended using methods routine to the group. This would yield greater insights into Obp functions that would fit well into the scope and aims of this manuscript. For example, ab4/ab5/ab6 sensilla express only Obp28a and Obp19a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, by mutating (preferable) or using RNAi against Obp19a (available from Bloomington; could use tormogen-GAL4 or even tubulin-GAL4), the authors could extend their analyses to ab4/ab5/ab6 sensilla response profiles when experiments are performed in the <italic>obp28a</italic> mutant background. ab4 contains Or7a and Or56a neurons whose response profiles are well characterized, and could be very informative regarding Obp functions. For example, Or7a responds to a number of different odorants (for example E2-hexenal and benzaldehyde) whereas Or56a is the sole responder to geosmin. Does high activation of Or56a by geosmin require Obp functions, as seen with cVA and LUSH/Obp76a? This offers many opportunities to examine the role of a different Obp on neuronal firing properties. The authors may even have started these experiments, as suggested by data not shown in point iii) of the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Responses of a sensillum in vivo in the absence of an abundant Obp. Nonetheless, ab5 or ab6 sensilla could be targeted for analyses at the author's discretion in an <italic>obp19a, obp28s</italic> double mutant. It would also be informative to compare the odor-responses in ab4/ab5/ab6 when Obp19a is removed in a wild-type background (instead of <italic>obp28a</italic> mutant background), which might give insights into additional/different roles Obp28a may play in different sensilla and with a different set of odorants.</p><p>Alternative suggested experiments to more fully address function of Obps:</p><p>The authors could examine the odor response profile of ab9 neurons in the <italic>Obp28a</italic> mutant.</p><p>The authors could examine the effects on odor responses when Obps are ectopically expressed. For example, using the <italic>obp28a</italic> mutant background, Obps not expressed in ab8/ab9 could be introduced (e.g., Obp19a, Obp83b).

The results show that in ab4, as in ab8, Obp28a function is not required for a robust odorant response to geosmin or other odorants.
