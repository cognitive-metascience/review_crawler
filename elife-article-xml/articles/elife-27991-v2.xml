alterations have long been associated with carcinogenesis, but it was unknown whether aneuploidy could disrupt the epigenetic states required for cellular differentiation. In this study, we found that ~3% of random aneuploid karyotypes in yeast disrupt the stable inheritance of silenced chromatin during cell proliferation. Karyotype analysis revealed that this phenotype was significantly correlated with gains of chromosomes III and X. Chromosome X disomy alone was sufficient to disrupt chromatin silencing and yeast mating-type identity as indicated by a lack of growth response to pheromone. The silencing defect was not limited to cryptic mating type loci and was associated with broad changes in histone modifications and chromatin localization of Sir2 histone deacetylase. The chromatin-silencing defect of disome X can be partially recapitulated by an extra copy of several genes on chromosome X. These results suggest that aneuploidy can directly cause epigenetic instability and disrupt cellular differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>epigenetic instability</kwd><kwd>chromatin silencing</kwd><kwd>cellular differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM118172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15PRE25090204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulla</surname><given-names>Wahid A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000892</institution-id><institution>Prostate Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16YOUN21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Hung-Ji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic analyses reveal that purely quantitative changes in the relative copy number of chromosomes can be sufficient to disrupt the epigenetic mechanisms that define the cells' differentiated state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The histone modification landscape and the associated open or closed (silenced) chromatin conformations regulate access to the genetic information byÂ the transcriptional machinery and provide a mechanism for the establishment and maintenance of stable epigenetic states in well-differentiated cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</xref>). Alterations in epigenetic modifications have been recognized as a key step in the initiation and progression of cancer whereby quiescent or slowly-dividing somatic cells escape their normal differentiated state and undergo precocious proliferation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Timp and Feinberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morgan and Shilatifard, 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying changes in the epigenetic-state associated with neoplastic transformation have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>Cancer progression is also associated with a wide range of genetic abnormalities, from mutations of single genes to structural or copy number alterations on the chromosomal level. Aneuploidy, an unbalanced genomic state in which the number of chromosomes deviates from a multiple of the haploid complement, is found in over 90% of human solid tumors and 50% of hematopoietic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitelman et al., 2012</xref>). Although the association of aneuploidy with cancer was noted more than a century ago, its contribution to cancer progression has only been actively explored in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boveri, 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holland and Cleveland, 2012</xref>). Aneuploidy is correlated with complex patterns of altered gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Upender et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ried et al., 2012</xref>), but its potential impact on the epigenetic state of cancer cells remains unclear due to the co-existence of the other genetic alterations in highly complex and unstable cancer genomes.</p><p>Studies in unicellular eukaryotes, such as the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, have provided valuable insights into the effects of aneuploidy on gene expression and corresponding cellular phenotypes because diverse aneuploid strains that differ only in chromosome stoichiometry, but not in DNA sequence, can be readily generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pfau and Amon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mulla et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, chromosome copy number variation leads to scaled changes in the transcriptome and proteome for most of the genes carried on the aneuploid chromosome, as well as expression level changes that vary significantly more than the scaled amount for 5â10% of total genes distributed throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rancati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>). The widespread but mostly moderate gene expression changes caused by aneuploidy lead to quantitative alterations in cell growth under a wide range of environmental conditions. However, the existing yeast studies have not addressed whether aneuploidy has the potential to alter the stable epigenetic states correlated with cellular differentiation. This is in part because yeast cells lack complex developmental fates and yeast genome comprises mostly open chromatin accessible to the transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millar and Grunstein, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Yeast cells, however, do have a few well-established regions of silenced chromatin, including the cryptic mating type loci <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> on chromosome III, the <italic>rDNA</italic> repeats on chromosome XII, and subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BÃ¼hler and Gasser, 2009</xref>). In particular, chromatin silencing at <italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR</italic> is critical for the specification of the sexual identity of yeast, in the form of <italic>a</italic> or <italic>Î±</italic> mating type, which is stably inherited from generation to generation. The underlying epigenetic mechanism of mating type specification depends on the recruitment of the Sir2 NAD-dependent histone deacetylase to <italic>HM</italic> loci through interactions with other Sir proteins (Sir1, 3, and 4) and several other accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kueng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrouzi et al., 2016</xref>). Spreading of the Sir protein complex across this region of DNA leads to hypoacetylated histones and establishes stably silenced chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rusche et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we took advantage of the genetic tools available in yeast and used <italic>HML</italic> silencing as the primary readout to test whether aneuploidy can affect cell identity by disrupting heterochromatin chromatin assembly and maintenance. By inducing meiosis in triploid cells, we generated thousands of aneuploid colonies and screened them using an imaging-based assay to determine the frequency at which aneuploid karyotypes disrupted transcriptional silencing at <italic>HML</italic>. Using a battery of genomic, transcriptomic and cell biological analyses, we investigated the mechanisms by which aneuploidy caused defects in chromatin silencing and epigenetic inheritance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diverse aneuploid karyotypes can cause chromatin desilencing</title><p>To investigate whether and at what frequency random chromosome stoichiometries could disrupt chromatin silencing, we started with a haploid yeast strain containing a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with a nuclear localization sequence under the <italic>URA3</italic> promoter, which was inserted into the silent <italic>HML</italic> locus. This <italic>HML::YFP</italic> reporter was shown previously to respond to transcriptional silencing in a Sir2, and 3-dependent manner, like the genes that normally reside at the silent mating type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). We converted the haploid strain carrying <italic>HML::YFP</italic> to a fully isogenic and homozygous triploid strain by cycles of mating-type switching and mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>). The resulting triploid strain, which exhibited complete silencing at the <italic>HML</italic> locus as indicated by the lack of YFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), were then sporulated and viable meiotic progenies were isolated through tetrad dissection. Previous studies showed thatÂ ~100% of the resulting colonies were aneuploid with random combinations of chromosome numbers, due to the segregation of 3 sets of homologous chromosomes during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">St Charles et al., 2010</xref>). Using fluorescence microscopy, we examined and identified individual colonies with defects in the silencing of YFP at the <italic>HML</italic> locus. Roughly 3% (98 out of 3418) of viable aneuploid spore colonies exhibited varying degrees of silencing defects. In contrast, we did not observe silencing defects in haploid meiotic progenies (nÂ =Â 100) obtained through sporulation of a diploid strain carrying the <italic>HML::YFP</italic> reporter as a control (data not shown).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27991.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aneuploid yeast strains show defective silencing at <italic>HML</italic>, subtelomeric, and <italic>rDNA</italic> chromatin regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The design of a microscopy-based screen to isolate karyotypically stable aneuploid strains, generated by inducing triploid meiosis, that exhibit defective silencing of the <italic>HML</italic> locus.

Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and qPCR karyotyping analyses, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>), we identified 24 aneuploid strains with unique and stable karyotypes, each with gain or loss of multiple chromosomes compared to the basal ploidy â defined as the copy number possessed by most chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

In particular, Chr III and Chr X were significantly enriched as chromosomes in gained aneuploid numbers in the desilenced aneuploid strains compared with a set of stable aneuploid strains of the same genetic background (S288c) that were isolated through triploid meiosis but not selected for silencing phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We subsequently focused on the four aneuploid strains showing the most prominent defects in <italic>HML</italic> silencing for more in-depth analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the silencing defect was caused by spontaneously arising mutations rather than aneuploidy, all four aneuploid strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing to compare with the parental euploid strains.

To ensure the heterogeneous expression pattern of YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>-</sup> signals within the population was not due to the karyotypic variations, cells with 2x Chr III and 1x Chr X gain were sorted into two distinct subpopulations based on YFP fluorescent signal for further analysis, and qPCR karyotyping showed that both sub-populations retained the expected karyotype with gain of Chr III and X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>). To determine if this heterogeneity was due to the instability of the chromatin silencing state, we performed time-lapse imaging of YFP expression over several cell divisions in aneuploid strains.

We identified specific karyotypic features associated with the silencing defect, with the simplest being gain of Chr X, which is sufficient to destabilize the epigenetic state and alter cellular responses to a relevant physiological factor (Î±-factor). Furthermore, the loss of silencing at the <italic>HM</italic> loci on Chr III and transcriptional derepression at subtelomeric regions on different chromosomes induced by Chr X disomy correlated with changes in the histone modification landscape, including increased H4K16 acetylation, and H3K4 and H3K79 trimethylation. Moreover, the silencing defect of disome X cells was associated with perturbed chromatin localization within the nucleus. The genetic basis of disome X-induced desilencing is complex, requiring at least four Chr X genes. Taken together, our results provide the evidence that aneuploidy can be a direct genetic cause of epigenetic dysregulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Loss of chromatin silencing is associated with specific karyotypic features</title><p>Our unbiased approach to identify chromosome stoichiometries associated with disrupted chromatin silencing revealed that Chr III and Chr X were frequently gained in cells lacking stable silencing at the <italic>HML</italic> locus. Notably, this pattern of chromosome enrichment was significantly different from that found in viable, karyotypically-stable aneuploid strains obtained through triploid meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that chromatin desilencing is not an obligatory outcome of abnormal chromosome numbers, but rather, is caused by specific chromosome imbalance. We expected that Chr III and Chr XII would be enriched in our screen since extra copies of these chromosomes would increase the copy number of heterochromatic DNA, which could potentially titrate silencing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dodson and Rine, 2015</xref>). However, only chromosome III gain was enriched and contributes to desilencing, but it was insufficient on its own for significant desilencing. Chr X, by contrast, lacks any known regions of silenced chromatin other than the subtelomeric DNA, and so the effect of extra copies of this chromosome was unlikely to be related to the titration of silencing factors. Our functional analysis suggests that the mechanisms underlying disome X-associated desilencing are complex (discussed further below).</p><p>It is important to point out that the aneuploid karyotypes that we identified did not appear to lead to a single state of chromatin silencing or desilencing but instead resulted in heterogeneous populations of cells with respect to gene expression from the normally silenced chromatin regions. Although the different levels of YFP expression in individual YFP<sup>+</sup> cells might be due to the natural gene expression noise, the co-existence of considerable fractions of both YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>-</sup> cells in each of the aneuploid populations suggests that these karyotypes lead to instability of the epigenetic state that is stably inherited in normal haploid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The impact of chr X disomy on histone modifications at silenced and non-silenced loci</title><p>H3K4 trimethylation is considered to be a mark of active transcription, given that its occupancy is generally high at the promoters of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillemette et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting this notion, our studies show a positive correlation between enrichment of this histone mark and transcriptional activity in both haploid and aneuploid strains. In yeast, H3K4 trimethylation is carried out by the Set1 complex and transcriptional outcomes related to changes in this mark are partially dependent on the location of genes in active or silent chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krogan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santos-Rosa et al., 2002</xref>). Although H3K4 is generally hypermethylated within regions of euchromatin and hypomethylated within heterochromatin, loss of H3K4me3 due to deletion of <italic>SET1</italic> had little effect on coding gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margaritis et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, our transcriptome analysis in disome X strains does not show a correlation between H3K4me3 and global transcriptional activation. However, in the case of silent domains, such as subtelomeric genes, we indeed found that both H3K4me3 modifications and gene expression were increased in disome X cells compared with the haploid control strain. The significant changes in histone modification patterns, combined with transcriptional derepression at many loci in regions of silent chromatin (mating-type loci, <italic>rDNA,</italic> and subtelomeric DNA) in disome X demonstrated that aneuploidy has the capacity to alter the histone-modification profile. It should be noted, however, that RNA-seq data showed that most of the subtelomeric genes are not strongly affected by Chr X disomy, suggesting that this aneuploidy does not have a general effect on silencing at subtelomeres. However, this is consistent with the previous observation that expression of subtelomeric genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is largely uninfluenced by mutations in Sir proteins and Sir-based silencing is not a widespread phenomenon at telomeres despite strong enrichment of Sir proteins at telomeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellahi et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential mechanisms by which chr X disomy disrupts stable epigenetic inheritance</title><p>We investigated several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms by which gain of Chr X could disrupt stable chromatin silencing. First, the defect in silencing could be due to a moderately reduced Sir2 level in Disome X compared to haploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). However, this is unlikely because previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dodson and Rine, 2015</xref>) and our own experiments showed that <italic>SIR2</italic> is not haploinsufficient for silencing: heterozygous <italic>SIR2</italic> diploid strain (<italic>Îsir2/SIR2</italic>), in which Sir2 level was reduced by an extent similar to that in disome X, did not compromise <italic>HML</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Second, we explored the possibility that NAD biosynthesis could be compromised because three genes (<italic>BNA1, BNA2, BNA4</italic>) involved in this pathway are located on Chr X, and low NAD levels have been linked to defective silencing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grozinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandmeier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedalov et al., 2003</xref>). However, supplementing disome X strains with NAD did not rescue the desilencing phenotype (data not shown). Third, our comprehensive screen for Chr X genes showed that a combination of four genes partially recapitulated the desilencing phenotype of disome X when each is increased by only a single copy. The known functions of these four genes are diverse, ranging from ribosomal components to a histone chaperone and a DNA polymerase subunit, suggesting that chromatin desilencing in disome X results from the combinatorial effects of multiple pathways that may each contribute to the establishmentÂ orÂ maintenance of the silenced chromatin. This is consistent with previous studies showing that aneuploidy confers complex or significant phenotypic changes by multigenic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rancati et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Selmecki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2015</xref>).</p><p>Another possible mechanism by which aneuploidy could impact silencing is by affecting the defined chromosome organization within the nucleus, whereby heterochromatin-like regions are tethered to the nuclear periphery and form a specialized structural compartment, which is required for Sir proteins to establish silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrulis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mekhail et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bystricky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruault et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, our results show reduced attachment of the <italic>HML</italic> locus to the nuclear envelope in disome X cells. The diffused Sir2 distribution, particularly in cells with desilenced <italic>HML</italic> gene expression, is consistent with previous reports that the silencing function of this protein requires its concentration to perinuclear pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taddei et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is presently unclear whether the insufficient tethering of chromosome regions to be silenced to the nuclear periphery or failed concentration of Sir2 to this area of the nucleus is directly caused by the increased copy number of the relevant genes on Chr X. Studies of the transcriptome in trisomy 21 human fibroblasts show that, although the overall nuclear organization defined by lamin-associated domains (LADs) is intact in these cells, alterations in H3K4me3 correlate with specialized gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Letourneau et al., 2014</xref>). This finding together with our results suggests that a perturbed nuclear compartmentalization, which causes changes in gene expression, may be an emergent outcome of gene copy number imbalance associated with certain chromosome aneuploidy. However, our data do not clarify whether the altered chromatin positioning or <italic>HML</italic> perinuclear localization in disome X strain was a cause or consequence of chromatin desilencing.</p><p>Epigenetic states are acquired through a precise balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin and are an essential mechanism to control proper cellular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</xref>). Here, we have shown that numerical alterations in chromosomes can derepress heterochromatin to break this delicate balance, relax epigenetic inheritance, and cause stochastic variation in cell identity that impairs the responsiveness to regulatory factors. Our findings provide the causal evidence that aneuploidy is a source of epigenetic instability. It may thus be worth exploring a potential linkage between epigenetic dysregulation and chromosome copy number alterations observed in cancer. The aneuploidy-induced changes in heterochromatin inheritance and histone-modification landscape may be an important mechanism by which chromosomal instability drives large-scale phenotypic variability during tumor evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study were generated in the S288c background and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

Three consecutive phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extractions, followed by a final chloroform extraction, were performed to reduce protein and phenol contamination, respectively. The gDNA samples were then treated with 50 ng/Î¼l affinity-purified RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 60 min at 37Â°C to remove contaminating RNA. Final gDNA yields were quantified with a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Genomic libraries were prepared according to Illuminaâs recommendations, except that sonication was used instead of nebulization. Cluster generation and read sequencing were performed according to Illuminaâs recommendations. 150 bp paired-end reads were collected using the Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) and aligned to the UCSC sacCer3 reference sequence using the BWA package; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010910">SCR_010910</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>), set at a maximum edit distance of 2 per read and allowing for gapped alignment with a maximum of 5 gap opens and â5 gap extensions.

Variants were annotated using SnpEff (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snpeff.sourceforge.net">http://snpeff.sourceforge.net</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005191">SCR_005191</ext-link>). We then excluded SNPs found across all sequenced strains to eliminate mutations already present in the euploid background. All potential mutations were then manually inspected in IGV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv">http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011793">SCR_011793</ext-link>), and SNPs called in repetitive regions, in long poly-A or poly-T stretches, or in regions of low alignment quality were discarded. All remaining SNPs were verified by reanalyzing each strain using Sanger sequencing. This analysis revealed that there were no mutations in coding regions that were not already present in the parental euploid strains.

Briefly, yeast cells were grown in 500 ml of SC medium to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8â0.9 and were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) for 20 min before the chromatin was extracted. The chromatin was sonicated using Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) at the high setting for ten cycles of 30 s on/off to yield an average DNA fragment size of 500 bp. Chromatin extracts were diluted in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer and centrifuged to pellet debris; the resulting supernatant, containing the chromatin solution, was aliquoted for immunoprecipitation as follows. Chromatin was first incubated overnight with antibody at 4Â°C, then with Dynabeads protein G beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Beads were washed several times, and DNA was recovered in elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Crosslinking was reversed by incubating samples at 65Â°C overnight, followed by protease treatment, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation of the recovered DNA. Sequence libraries were constructed and validated using the Illumina library protocol and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system as 50 bp single-end reads. Reads were mapped to the sacCer3 reference genome using Bowtie software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005476">SCR_005476</ext-link>) with parameters: --best âstrata -v2 -m 1. Peaks were called by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS2) using default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), mapped to the closest gene, and kept only if they occurred within 600 bases of the transcription start site. Peak scores, defined as the -log10 transformed q-values, normalized to chromosome copy number, were converted to Z-scores for comparison across strains and plotted as the difference between disome X and WT haploid strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâB</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Aneuploidy as a cause of epigenetic instability and cell identity disorder&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Marc Gartenberg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>This manuscript describes an interesting approach to investigate the hypothesis that aneuploidies affect chromatin status and identified specific aneuploid chromosomes and genes on those chromosomes that do so. The authors find that alterations in chromosome dosage that have the potential to disrupt gene silencing in a model organism and suggest that this resembles events that occur during the development of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that high copies of some genes affect telomere length and/or telomeric silencing. For example, the first telomerase RNA gene was identified in a classic screen for high-copy disruptors of telomeric heterochromatin (Singer Gottschling, 1994). Nonetheless, the observation that a single extra copy of several genes on a single chromosome can alter chromatin-mediated silencing is novel. The work is thorough and represents an interesting conceptual advance, albeit one that might have been expected by the earlier high-copy disruptor studies mentioned above.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) In a screen of isolates carrying randomly generated aneuploidies, 3% were accompanied by derepression of all three major heterochromatin domains: the silenced mating-type loci, sub-telomeric regions and the rDNA.</p><p>2) An extra copy of a single chromosome X was sufficient to derepress silencing at the mating locus and this was attributed to four genes on that chromosome.</p><p>3) This aneuploidy caused loss of several characteristic features of heterochromatin: a) H4K16ac, H3K4me and H3K79me levels were elevated,b) one of the heterochromatin proteins (Sir2) was mislocalized, andc) heterochromatin domains were no longer perinuclear.</p><p>4) The aneuploid strains yielded semi-heritable defects, due to mixed populations of expression states.</p><p>The work is interesting, but a bit over-sold and the connection to cancer is rather general. Given that it was known that overexpression of some genes influence silencing, and since chromosome amplification is one mechanism of gene over-expression, the interesting advance is that only specific chromosomes and specific genes on those chromosomes have an effect when present in a single extra copy.</p><p>How most of the genes identified contribute to silencing is not clear. Furthermore, whether the defects in heterochromatin were the cause or consequence of the silencing phenotype was left unresolved.</p><p>The title of the manuscript should be modified and &quot;cell identity disorder&quot; should be removed. We think the emphasis is better placed on the idea that aneuploidy is a single-step event that can over-express a suite of genes that affect MAT silencing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of important concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques, but they should be quite straight-forward.</p><p>1) For all of the RT-qPCR experiments, the authors plot the standard error of the mean, which is not appropriate â the standard deviation must be shown and the data may not be statistically significant if the SEM is that big. The authors cannot say that silencing [at loci beyond the MAT locus] is affected based on the current data analysis. Other qPCR figures, including Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, should also plot the average and standard deviation instead of SEM. Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> the authors plot mean and SEM instead of the appropriate SD.</p><p>2) In the RNA-seq it doesn't appear that silenced genes come up as differentially expressed (certainly most of the subtelomeric genes aren't strongly affected). Thus, it appears that this aneuploidy does not have an obvious effect on silencing at the telomeres. This should be acknowledged.</p><p>3) The heterogeneity in YFP/silencing recapitulates the <italic>sir1</italic> effect, but given the instability of chromosome amplification cited, the authors should show that the heterogeneity in silencing is not due to heterogeneity in chromosome content in the aneuploid strains. This can be performed by picking individual colonies or FACS sorting based on YFP fluorescence and measuring DNA content for the extra chromosomes (by qPCR for the affected chromosome).</p><p>4) Subsection âChromosome X disomy alone alters chromatin silencingâ, last paragraph: â We suggest removing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> as it does not go into sufficient depth and has raised concerns because: 1) the half-life of YFP maturation is 40 minutes (Gordon Brent 2007) and the obligatory lag between derepression and detection could mean that derepression occurs earlier than bud emergence; 2) only 9 cells were examined; 3) the threshold at which YFP can be detected should be determined (It is clearly present at 30 minutes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> but not recorded quantitatively until 60 minutes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); and 4), there is neither definitive evidence that silencing is transiently lost during passage through S phase nor is there a strict requirement for S phase in silencing establishment (see the review by Gartenberg Smith 2016).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>: if the x-axis is the same in both plots, then why are the red 'subtelomeric' genes at different points along the x-axis? Is the data in this figure significant? This should be stated in the text and clearly shown with mean and SD in the figures.</p><p>6) Subsection âPotential mechanisms by which Chr X disomy disrupts stable epigenetic inheritanceâ, second paragraph â - concentrated Sir proteins and perinuclear localization of heterochromatin are read-outs for intact heterochromatin and loss of either might impair heterochromatin. However, their loss might simply accompany the disruption of heterochromatin by some other mechanism (i.e. they are not necessarily causative events). Improper assembly of chromatin genome-wide can affect heterochromatin function by an anti-silencing mechanism (Gartenberg Smith 2016). This is an additional possibility that should be considered, particularly given that genome-wide acting factors like ASF1 and DPB11 were included in the set of chromosome X genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27991.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] The title of the manuscript should be modified and &quot;cell identity disorder&quot; should be removed.

We have modified the title as âAneuploidy as a cause of impaired chromatin silencing and mating-type specification in budding yeastâ.

Because we have observed that aneuploidy with chromosome loss could also affect silencing, we cannot generally conclude gene overexpression underlies the aneuploidyâs effect.

We point out that this is consistent with the previous observation that expression of subtelomeric genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is largely uninfluenced by Sir proteins and Sir-based silencing was not a widespread phenomenon at telomeres despite strong enrichment of Sir proteins at telomeric regions (Takahashi, Schulze et al. 2011, Ellahi, Thurtle et al. 2015) (subsection âThe impact of Chr X disomy on histone modifications at silenced and non-silenced lociâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The heterogeneity in YFP/silencing recapitulates the sir1 effect, but given the instability of chromosome amplification cited, the authors should show that the heterogeneity in silencing is not due to heterogeneity in chromosome content in the aneuploid strains. This can be performed by picking individual colonies or FACS sorting based on YFP fluorescence and measuring DNA content for the extra chromosomes (by qPCR for the affected chromosome).</p> </disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for pointing this out and we were fully aware of the potential karyotype instability of aneuploid strains in our analysis. Because of this awareness, aneuploid strains used in the current study were carefully chosen for their karyotypic stability and homogeneity (explained in the second paragraph of the subsection âDiverse aneuploid karyotypes can cause chromatin desilencingâ, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, DNA content was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for eight randomly picked colonies derived from each of the original spore colonies showing silencing defect. Strains were only selected for further analysis if the DNA contents of the eight colonies were identical and the FACS profile showed a level of variability (CV) similar to that of the wild-type haploid control strain, consistent with uniform ploidy. For these strains, DNA content was reassessed in cultures that were revived from frozen stocks and this was repeated three times. Strains that continued to show stable and homogeneous ploidy after repeated rounds of FACS analysis were then karyotyped by qPCR, where three colonies from the same plate were analyzed separately to show consistent karyotypes. Moreover, karyotypes were tested before and after every single experiment and no deviation was observed. This procedure for isolating inherently stable aneuploid strains was used in our previous study (Pavelka, Rancati et al. 2010). In our 2012 paper (Zhu et al. 2012) where karyotype instability was studied in-depth, we showed that not all aneuploid strains exhibit karyotypes instability, and some can be quite stable. Because YFP<sup>-</sup> andYFP<sup>+</sup> cells represented considerable portions of each population, if these correspond to different karyotypes, our FACS and karyotyping assays would not have shown a distinct ploidy and karyotype, respectively. Furthermore, if YFP<sup>+</sup> signal in each population had resulted from random karyotype changes due to karyotype instability, the frequency of desilencing karyotypes would have been much higher than the observed 3% in our initial screen.</p><p>We did attempt to FACS sort as reviewers suggested, but sorting only worked for the strain with Chr III, III, X gain, which had the highest YFP<sup>+</sup> population. Karyotyping of YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>-</sup> cells showed that both retained the expected karyotype. This result has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-D</xref> and described in the third paragraph of the subsection âDiverse aneuploid karyotypes can cause chromatin desilencingâ. FACS sorting for the other aneuploid strains did not work out, due to two reasons: 1) YFP signal in these strains was overall weaker; and 2) not enough cells with fluorescence sufficiently high for sorting could be obtained for qPCR karyotyping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection âChromosome X disomy alone alters chromatin silencingâ, last paragraph: â We suggest removing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> as it does not go into sufficient depth and has raised concerns because: 1) the half-life of YFP maturation is 40 minutes (Gordon Brent 2007) and the obligatory lag between derepression and detection could mean that derepression occurs earlier than bud emergence; 2) only 9 cells were examined; 3) the threshold at which YFP can be detected should be determined (It is clearly present at 30 minutes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> but not recorded quantitatively until 60 minutes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); and 4), there is neither definitive evidence that silencing is transiently lost during passage through S phase nor is there a strict requirement for S phase in silencing establishment (see the review by Gartenberg Smith 2016).</p> </disp-quote><p>We have removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> as reviewers suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>: if the x-axis is the same in both plots, then why are the red 'subtelomeric' genes at different points along the x-axis?

Identities of subtelomeric genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref> were different because the genes with occupancy of each of the histone markers (K4me and K79me) were not the same (see Table 2) and hence locate to different points along the x-axis of A and B. We have added this explanation in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We performed Fisherâs exact test to compare two groups- subtelomeric (red) and genome-wide (gray) genes falling in the first quadrant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, vs. the other three quadrants. The difference is significant, and test statistics are now clearly stated in the second paragraph of the subsection âGain of Chromosome X alters subtelomeric gene expression through changes in H3K4me3 and 3K79me3â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection âPotential mechanisms by which Chr X disomy disrupts stable epigenetic inheritanceâ, second paragraph â concentrated Sir proteins and perinuclear localization of heterochromatin are read-outs for intact heterochromatin and loss of either might impair heterochromatin. However, their loss might simply accompany the disruption of heterochromatin by some other mechanism (i.e. they are not necessarily causative events). Improper assembly of chromatin genome-wide can affect heterochromatin function by an anti-silencing mechanism (Gartenberg Smith 2016). This is an additional possibility that should be considered, particularly given that genome-wide acting factors like ASF1 and DPB11 were included in the set of chromosome X genes.</p> </disp-quote><p>We fully agree with reviewers that it is unclear whether loss of Sir2 concentration and <italic>HML</italic> perinuclear localization were the cause or consequence of desilencing. We, in fact, did not want to imply that they were the cause. We have made a clearer discussion about this in the second paragraph of the subsection âPotential mechanisms by which Chr X disomy disrupts stable epigenetic inheritanceâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
