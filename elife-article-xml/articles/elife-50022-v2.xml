nanoparticles through coral tissues are poorly documented. Here, we followed the flow of various tracers from the external seawater to within the cells of all tissues in living animals. After entering the general coelenteric cavity, we show that nanoparticles disperse throughout the tissues via the paracellular pathway. Then, the ubiquitous entry gate to within the cells’ cytoplasm is macropinocytosis. Most cells form large vesicles of 350–600 nm in diameter at their apical side, continuously internalizing their surrounding medium. Macropinocytosis was confirmed using specific inhibitors of PI3K and actin polymerization. Nanoparticle internalization dynamics is size dependent and differs between tissues. Furthermore, we reveal that macropinocytosis is likely a major endocytic pathway in other anthozoan species. The fact that nearly all cells of an animal are continuously soaking in the environment challenges many aspects of the classical physiology viewpoints acquired from the study of bilaterians.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cnidarian</kwd><kwd>coral</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>dextran</kwd><kwd>vesicle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Government of the Principality of Monaco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganot</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><name><surname>Tambutté</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Caminiti-Segonds</surname><given-names>Natacha</given-names></name><name><surname>Toullec</surname><given-names>Gaëlle</given-names></name><name><surname>Allemand</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name><name><surname>Tambutté</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Centre Scientifique de Monaco research program, funded by the Government of the Principality of Monaco.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Macropinocytosis, the process of non-specific endocytosis, is a major gateway for large volumes of surrounding medium and nanoparticles to coral cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Unicellular eukaryotes use endocytosis, in particular phagocytosis, to probe their surrounding medium and obtain their next meal. In higher metazoans, that is bilaterians, phagocytic cells mostly represent an essential branch of the immune system, whereas feeding is mediated by digestive organs which degrade complex molecules into nutrients further absorbed by individual cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Desjardins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cosson and Soldati, 2008</xref>). In early branching metazoans such as sponges or anthozoans (corals and sea anemones), comparatively little is known in regard to the cellular processes by which the surrounding medium with its nutritive, signaling or infectious contents, is processed.</p><p>From a histological and anatomical point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allemand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tambutté et al., 2011</xref>), anthozoans (included in the phylum Cnidaria) are simple organisms: their mouth is surrounded by a crown of tentacles and serves both for feeding and excreting waste, their body cavity hosts digestive and reproductive organs. The tissues are made up of two cell layers, the ectoderm and the endoderm separated by an acellular layer of mesoglea. Stony corals (scleractinians) represent the branch of anthozoans that synthetize a skeleton. They are colonial, meaning that the individuals called polyps are linked together by the cœnosarc, a portion of continuous tissue that connects polyps together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Their tissues are qualified as oral or aboral depending on whether their ectoderm is facing seawater or the skeleton, respectively. Between the oral and aboral tissues lies the common central cavity of the colony, called the coelenteric cavity. Most reef-building corals are symbiotic, hosting in their endodermal cells photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) from which they derive a large part of their organic nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Muscatine and Porter, 1977</xref>). At the interface between the calcifying ectodermal layer (also called the calicoblastic epithelium) and the skeleton lies the extracellular calcifying medium (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tambutté et al., 2011</xref>). Despite their relatively simple tissular organization, many questions remain concerning the biology/physiology of corals. Firstly, the process of cell to cell communication and exchange is unknown; secondly, these animals depend on both heterotrophic and autotrophic feeding but the cellular pathways involved in these two feeding modes are unknown; thirdly, these animals build a calcareous skeleton but the path by which ions and organic molecules are supplied to the site of calcification remains debated. Importantly, although cell-cell communication, feeding and calcification seem to refer to different aspects of biology, these processes all involve the properties of the coral’s epithelial cell layers. Indeed, as is the case for any multicellular organism, the coral epithelial cell layers (i) serve as functional barriers, forming selectively permeable interfaces between compartments of different chemical composition and regulating the transport of ions and molecules, (ii) act as sensors of the extracellular environment, triggering the cellular response to extracellular variations and (iii) are involved in cell-cell communication.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Coenosarc anatomy.</title><p>The tissue connecting individual polyps is composed of two tissues. The oral tissue is composed of the oral ectoderm (in contact with the sea water) and the oral endoderm (which contains Symbiodiniaceae in most cells) separated by the acellular mesoglea. The aboral tissue is composed of the aboral endoderm (which contains Symbiodiniaceae in some cells) and the calicoblastic ectoderm (responsible for the formation of the skeleton) separated by the mesoglea. Tissue layers have their basal side contacting the mesoglea whereas motile cilia and septate junctions mark their apical side. In between the two endodermal layers lies the coelenteric cavity which carries most of the internal fluids.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50022-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Transport of ions/molecules from one cell layer to another cell layer and between the two tissues has been shown to occur through two different pathways: a paracellular and a transcellular pathway. The paracellular pathway (i.e. passing in between cells) occurs through septate junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tambutté et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barott et al., 2015</xref>), the properties of which reflect the cell layer permeability. This paracellular pathway is selective and depends on the size and charge of each transported entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tambutté et al., 2012</xref>). Based on physiological experiments, it has been shown that the permeability to ions is different between the oral and aboral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bénazet-Tambutté et al., 1996b</xref>). Based on ultrastructural and molecular data, this could be due to constituent differences between the septate junctions of the oral and the aboral cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ganot et al., 2015</xref>). In regard to coral anatomy and fluid circulation, it must be noted that 1) only the oral ectoderm is covered by a layer of mucus which can affect the velocity of ion/molecule/fluid direct uptake from seawater; 2) both oral and aboral endoderms are bathed by the coelenteric fluid the renewal rate of which depends on mouth closure/aperture and on fluid diffusion through the paracellular pathway; 3) the calcifying aboral ectoderm is neither in direct contact with seawater nor with the coelenteric fluid. Therefore, both paracellular diffusion and internal fluid renewal should be considered when studying the transport of fluid/molecules/ions through coral epithelial cell layers. The supply of ions to the ECM involves a transcellular pathway with channel/carriers located on the apical and basal membranes of the polarized calicoblastic cells. For example, bicarbonate and calcium have been proposed to be transcellularly transported through these carriers/channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zoccola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zoccola et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zoccola et al., 1999</xref>). Transcellular and paracellular transport can only help explain how ions and specific molecules are transported from seawater to the different cell layers and to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allemand et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, molecules and fluids presumably also enter and exit coral cells through endocytosis and exocytosis, respectively. These processes have been poorly characterized in corals but some authors suggest that trans-cellular transport of vesicles occurs during the calcification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mass et al., 2017</xref>). In these models, it has been proposed that seawater is endocytosed into vesicles and enriched in carbonate ions in the calcifying cells. These vesicles would then be transported and their content exocytosed in the ECM.</p><p>Endocytosis includes different cellular pathways which can be classified according to vesicle size. Clathrin- and caveolin- dependent/independent internalization are endocytic processes using small (less than 100 nm) vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, endocytic processes operating via large vesicles (200 nm – 5 µm) are typical of phagocytosis and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloomfield and Kay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kerr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>). Macropinocytosis is a highly conserved process found from unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans, similar to that of phagocytosis, although direct contact with the internalized material is not required as for phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McNeil, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>). Macropinocytosis is an actin-driven process: plasma membrane ruffling and closing takes up surrounding extracellular fluids and its content into large vesicles, which may further fuse intracellularly with endosomal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swanson, 2008</xref>). In humans, macropinocytosis can be constitutive or induced and has been involved in various cellular functions including antigen presentation, cell metabolism, as well as in cancer (increased nutrient uptake), pathogen entries (from viruses to protozoans), and therapeutics (drug entry gate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bloomfield and Kay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Recouvreux and Commisso, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lim and Gleeson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, macropinocytosis can be considered as the endocytic pathway allowing non-specific endocytosis of large nanoparticles, up to 5 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swanson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In anthozoans (which include sea anemones, gorgonians and corals), macropinocytosis has never been characterized despite its potential role in fluid uptake. Of note, pioneering studies concerning the uptake of India ink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olano and Bigger, 2000</xref>) or dissolved organic matter (DOM) by epithelial cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apte et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schlichter, 1982</xref>) might be worth being revisited with regard to more recent macropinocytosis data. In the present study, we used several type/size of nanoparticles, that is gold nanoparticles, latex beads and dextrans to characterize the transport of fluids and associated molecules/nanoparticles in the coral <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic> for which many physiological, biochemical and molecular data are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tambutté et al., 2011</xref>). Using mostly confocal microscopy approaches, we followed nanoparticle movement from the surrounding seawater to the coelenteron, then to the different tissue layers via the paracellular pathway and further into the cells’ cytoplasm. We show that the large majority of cells continuously take up large volumes of their surrounding medium using macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis was confirmed both with transmission electronic microscopy and specific inhibitor experiments. In addition, we show that macropinocytosis is polarized from the apical to the basal side of cells in all tissues. Thus, the oral ectoderm facing the seawater directly absorbs the media, more precisely what is trapped in the mucus covering the animal; the two endoderms lining the coelenteron directly absorb the coelenteric fluid, whereas the calicoblastic ectoderm samples the ECM. In terms of dynamics, the mucus apparently represents a mesh slowing down large particles from being immediately taken up by the oral ectoderm. The coelenteric cavity is filled up within ca. 5 min, whereas only nanoparticles below 20 nm width reach the ECM with an additional ca. 10 min delay, likely due to the passage through the septate junctions filtering the paracellular diffusion to the ECM. Finally, we also described macropinocytosis in the sea anemone <italic>Anemonia viridis</italic> and in the octocorallian <italic>Corallium rubrum</italic>, thereby revealing macropinocytosis as a major endocytic process in anthozoans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dextran uptake by <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic> occurs through vesicles</title><p>To investigate the endocytic route in the coral <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic>, we first analysed tracer molecule uptake within the whole organism down to the cell level by incubating microcolonies in sea water containing gold dextran-coated nanoparticles of two sizes (3 nm and 10 nm). Using transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) we detected gold nanoparticles within large intracellular vesicles bigger than 200 nm in diameter, in both the ectodermal and the endodermal layers. Dextran particles were never observed free in the cytoplasm. This result shows that nanoparticles follow an endocytotic pathway with the aspect of vesicles varying from simple to multivesicular body endosomes. Such large vesicles could be characteristic of phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, or even late endosomes resulting from the intracellular fusion of smaller early endosomes. However, when osmium post-fixation was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), electron micrographs showed large vesicle formation right below the apical membrane of both ectodermal and endodermal cells which is typical of macropinocytotic processes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Endocytosis of gold dextran-coated nanoparticle by large vesicles.</title><p>Microcolonies were incubated in sea water complemented with Gold dextran coated nanoparticles of 3 nm (<bold>a,b,d,e</bold>) or 10 nm (<bold>c</bold>) in diameter and imaged with transmission electron microscopy in the ectoderm (<bold>a–b</bold>) or the endoderm (<bold>c–e</bold>). Samples here were not contrasted with OsO<sub>4</sub>.

Furthermore, we asked whether dextran uptake by the different cell layers was particle size dependent. Therefore, we performed a time course experiment using two sizes of dextrans, 3 kDa and 10 kDa (D3K and D10K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). The control at T0 shows no fluorescent labeling (ie. no autofluorescence) whatever the epithelial layer analyzed. After 5 min, dextran molecules were visible at the apical surface of all epithelial layers except for the aboral calicoblastic ectoderm where the labeling appeared 10–20 min later. With incremental pulse duration (from 10 to 240 min incubations), dextran labeling increasingly invaded every cell layer in an apparent apical to basal manner. Importantly, the pattern of dextran uptake in the oral ectoderm appeared to be size-dependent, with preferential internalization of D3K versus D10K. This was not the case within both endoderms where dextran fluorescence in the cells was similar whatever the size of the dextran (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Of note, D3K and D10K appeared to co-localize only in a few vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, close inspection of the separate dextran confocal emission channels revealed that both dextrans co-localized in most vesicles in all cell layers, albeit with seemingly variable relative concentrations (ratio). Altogether, this data suggests that the dynamics of molecule internalization is tissue specific and size-dependent and suggests that internalization occurs at the apical membrane in all tissues. To test whether the uptake of dextatran into large vesicles could be extend to other distant anthozoans, we incubated the octocorallian <italic>Corallium rubrum</italic> in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Representative images of dextran labeling within the different cell layers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. As aforementioned, the absence of color merging reflects the ratio variability in terms of dextran concentrations within vesicles, whichever the tissue. In the oral ectoderm, most vesicles were 350 to 800 nm in width, with or without the chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As previously observed, the number of vesicles was greater with smaller dextran. In the oral endoderm, D3K was rapidly endocytosed (P15C0), the diameter of the first observable vesicles being in the 350–800 nm range. However, after 4 hr of chasing, the size distribution shifted towards much larger vesicles (up to 1.5 µm in width), which possibly implies vesicle fusion with time and/or cytoplasm progression. The same holds true for the aboral endoderm except that the number of vesicles was significantly higher (maybe due to lower steric hindrance since Symbiodiniaceae are much less numerous than in the oral endoderm) and that there was no preference for dextran size at 15 min pulse. Finally, in the calicoblastic aboral ectoderm, only a few vesicles were counted after the 15 min pulse, likely because of the delay inherent to the passage via the paracellular pathway (D3K passing faster than D10K). After 4 hr of chasing, the vesicle number was higher although vesicle size remained in the 350–800 nm diameter range regardless of dextran particle size. Hence, vesicle quantification reflects what was observed previously, i.e. 1) the vesicles in the ectodermal cells are smaller than those in the endodermal cells (350–800 nm <italic>versus</italic> 350–1500 nm), potentially due to vesicular fusion; 2) the oral ectoderm shows dextran uptake size dependence; 3) the calicoblastic cells have a delayed kinetic of dextran uptake as compared to the other cell layers.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of the dextran endocytic vesicles.</title><p>High magnification Z stack sections encompassing the different individual tissue layers (from top to bottom: oral ectoderm, oral endoderm, aboral endoderm, calicoblastic ectoderm) were acquired after the same pulse-chase experiments than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) Representative Z projections for each tissue after D3K/D10K 15 min pulse/4 hr chase (legends as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Such a ubiquitous use of macropinocytosis was largely unexpected as this process is restricted to specialized cells in the sister group of Bilateria.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Characterization of macropinocytosis in anthozoans</title><p>Macropinocytosis is one of the endocytotic pathways that exists in eukaryotic cells, along with others such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis (for more details see reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kerr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lim and Gleeson, 2011</xref>). A budding structure from the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for any endocytotic pathway. In the case of macropinocytosis, it usually occurs from highly ruffled regions of the plasma membrane (flat sheet-like protrusions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swanson, 2008</xref>) that extend from the cell surface, constrict and close, with membrane fusion producing a large intracellular vesicle containing a droplet of medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>). Using transmission electron microscopy, we could not show outward extensions of the plasma membrane. However, we could clearly picture the vesicles as part of the apical plasma membrane, with apparent subsequent internalization of the extracellular medium, which is typical of macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Macropinocytosis requires a dynamic actin skeleton essential for contractile motility. In corals, the forming vesicles were associated with what appears as an inward actin ‘cap’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). Furthermore, dextran uptake was reversibly inhibited by latrunculin, a potent actin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Macropinocytosis differs from other types of endocytosis by its unique susceptibility to Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cosson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koivusalo et al., 2010</xref>). Here we show that EIPA, a specific blocker of this exchanger blocks macropinosome formation. Macropinocytosis is also a Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent process in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Araki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Williams and Kay, 2018</xref>), and blocking PI3K with wortmannin inhibited macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, although the initial shape of the macropinosome-forming membrane may differ in corals versus vertebrate cells or <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, the pharmacological approach used here suggests that the molecular processes leading to macropinocytosis are likely to be conserved throughout evolution. On the other hand, although macropinocytosis strongly supports our observations of nanoparticle uptake, we cannot rule out the existence of other types of Clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferreira and Boucrot, 2018</xref>). Among CIE, the CLIC/GEEC (Clathrin-independent carrier/GPI anchored protein enriched endosomal compartments) pathway rapidly uptakes bulk fluid into early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howes et al., 2010</xref>). The CLIC/GEEC pathway is driven by actin and is PI3K-dependent like macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hemalatha et al., 2016</xref>), however it forms small tubular intermediates that we did not observe.</p><p>The size of the vesicles that we observed with the fluorescent fluid phase marker dextran is between 350 and 1500 nm, which is typical of macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swanson, 2008</xref>). This large vesicle size, orders of magnitude larger than the molecules they capture, enables the uptake of solutes that are excluded from other endocytotic processes. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that macropinocytosis can be induced in a variety of cell types by growth factors and other stimuli whereas dendritic cells and macrophages perform macropinocytosis constitutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canton, 2018</xref>). Currently, from our observations, we cannot conclude whether macropinocytosis in corals is induced or constitutive and no data is available in the literature. However, we never performed an experiment without observing macropinocytosis in all cells, suggesting that the process occurs at all times.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Particle diffusion and cell progression of macropinosomes</title><p>In corals, particles from the seawater medium are ingested into the coelenteric cavity via the mouth and can diffuse between the cells via the paracellular pathway (gated by 20 nm wide septate junctions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tambutté et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Our time course study shows that within 5 min, particles are detectable in the coelenteric cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Then to reach the calicoblastic layer, particles follow the paracellular pathway down to the ECM through the endodermal septate junctions, the mesoglea and the calicoblastic septate junctions, separating the coelenteron from the ECM. On the other side of the animal, particles can reach the oral ectodermal cells directly from the seawater medium. However, in this particular tissue layer, we observed a size dependent particle uptake. The oral ectoderm is covered by mucus which forms a diffusion barrier at the apical side of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and Bythell, 2005</xref>). This mucus layer is a gel-forming layer composed of polysaccharides that are constantly released by all coral species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bythell and Wild, 2011</xref>). One possibility to explain the preferential endocytosis of smaller particles is that bigger particles would be trapped or delayed by this mucus layer. This is supported by the Transmission Electron Microscope observation of the content of the ectodermal versus endodermal macropinosomes (TEM observations): the former contain a heterogeneous medium with a fibrillary network (mucus-like) and the latter a homogeneous medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alternatively, other micropinocytic processes could ensure fluid phase uptake in addition to macropinocytosis. In the slime mold <italic>Dyctiostelium</italic>, concurrently to macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis is also able to capture Dextran fluorescent tracers into small vesicles that further fuse into large late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neuhaus et al., 2002</xref>). Multiple endocytotic pathways presumably exist in anthozoans. Endocytosis of small size dextrans (e.g. D3K vs D70K) in small vesicles which would later fuse as larger endosomes may account for some selective aspects of fluid phase uptake. However, the endocytotic process in the different tissue layers is rapid. In <italic>A. viridis</italic>, macropinosome formation in the aboral endoderm takes 1 to 4 min. In <italic>S. pistillata</italic>, given the time necessary for the dextran to reach the cellular apical membrane, whichever the cell layer we can estimate to less than 5 min the formation of macropinosomes. Hence, given the kinetics of vesicle formation as well as their size and number, macropinocytosis likely accounts for most of the fluid phase uptake in coral tissues, including the oral ectoderm.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Fluids/particles flow from the sea water to the cell cytoplasm.</title><p>Schematic representation of the movement of particles in the different tissue layers of a coral (see text).

Particles are engulfed into large vesicles originating from the apical membrane of the cells. These macropinosomes then move towards the inner part of the cells, down to the basal side. Macropinosomes in the endodermal cells are notably bigger than those of the ectodermal cells. A likely explanation is that in the endodermal cells, macropinosomes fuse during their progression. In vertebrate models, macropinosome fate after internalization varies depending on the cell type, as they can be recycled to the cell membrane or they can adopt degradative properties by fusing with lysosomes and undergoing a lysosome-dependent acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Recouvreux and Commisso, 2017</xref>). Further investigation would be required to decipher the fate of macropinosomes after internalization in anthozoans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Macropinocytosis and coral physiology</title><p>Macropinocytosis has general implications for coral physiology. With regard to feeding, symbiotic corals not only feed on autotrophic nutrition (symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae) but also rely on two modes of heterotrophic nutrition, predation and assimilation of DOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houlbrèque and Ferrier-Pagès, 2009</xref>). The observation that in corals, diverse particles ranging in size from 1 to 200 nm are engulfed by most cell types suggests that exogenous particles such as DOM or particulate organic matter may enter these cells by macropinocytosis. The oral ectodermal cell layer was shown to directly absorb DOM sources from the surrounding sea water by its apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schlichter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorokin, 1973</xref>), which corresponds to the side of macropinocytosis, and thus corroborates the fact that macropinocytosis could be the DOM feeding pathway in the oral ectoderm. Yet, nutrition in corals involves the production of photosynthates by the Symbiodiniceae which is mostly hosted in the oral endodermal cells. How these photosynthates are further transported to the other tissues remains largely unknown. Bulk fluid absorption via macropinocytocis could form part of the mechanism for the uptake of photosynthates released in the coelenteric cavity. Hence, individual coral cells, and more generally anthozoan cells, would have the capacity to use macropinocytosis for both auto-and heterotrophic feeding.</p><p>With regard to calcification, recently Mass and collaborators observed mineral particles within the calicoblastic cells, with sizes varying from 400 nm to 9.4 μm in diameter, 400 nm being the most frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mass et al., 2017</xref>). There was no direct evidence that these particles were localized inside vesicles but by analogy between the size of the mineral particles and the vesicles (380 nm) observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clode and Marshall (2002)</xref>, they deduced that the particles and the vesicles referred to the same object. In the present study, sizes of the macropinosomes in the calicoblastic cells were in the same size range as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clode and Marshall (2002)</xref>, that is 350 to 800 nm. However, we cannot conclude whether the macropinosomes that we observed correspond to the same particles observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mass et al. (2017)</xref> and whether or not they contain mineral matter. Of major interest, apical to basal macropinocytosis is commonly observed during endocytotic events including micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shivas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apodaca, 2001</xref>) and is the prevalent endocytic pathway in all coral tissues, including calicoblastic cells. Thus, calicoblastic cells capture the extracellular medium that is present at the interface between the cells and the skeleton (i.e. the ECM). Taking this into account and the studies showing that the composition of the ECM is different from seawater (higher pH, Ca and carbonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sevilgen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2016</xref>]), it is clear that ‘calicoblastic’ macropinosomes do not capture seawater from the medium but rather modified seawater. This brings novel insight into the recent model of calcification/biomineralization that implies transcytosis across the different cell layers where vesicular transport of ions occurs from the surrounding sea water down to the site of calcification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mass et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, we never observed dextran labeled vesicles within the mesoglea, suggesting that vesicle passage from one tissue layer to the other does not occur. Overall, the role of macropinocytosis in the calicoblastic cells and its potential link with calcification awaits deeper investigations.</p><p>Finally with regard to corals and environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>), pollution by plastics is of primary concern for the global marine environment. Plastics do not dissolve in seawater but gradually fragment into microparticulate matter due to continuous physical, mechanical and chemical attack. With time, microsized plastics become nanosized particles that accumulate in the marine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cole et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Law, 2017</xref>). In the present study, we show that latex beads as large as 200 nm are able to enter the general coelenteric cavity, likely via the polyps’ mouth, as we observed their accumulation at the oral opening (not shown). Then, they are found within the cells, although large latex beads were apparently internalized with less efficiency than smaller nanoparticles such as dextrans (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that the size of plastic fragments (micrometer <italic>vs</italic> nanometer) also affects their internalization efficiency both at the coelenteric entry level and within the cells. However, current studies on corals have so far only addressed the toxicological impact of micrometer sized (entry inside the organism) and not nanometer sized (entry into the cells) plastics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reichert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hankins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rotjan et al., 2019</xref>), as it has been done in other organisms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Della Torre et al., 2014</xref>). Since macropinocytosis allows internalization of nanoparticles of different sorts in all coral cells, this endocytic pathway should now certainly be taken into account in future eco-toxicology studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture of corals and microcolonies</title><p><italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic> mother colonies were grown in the culture facilities at the Centre Scientifique de Monaco where aquaria were supplied with flowing seawater from the Mediterranean sea (exchange rate 2% h<sup>−1</sup>), at a salinity of 38, under an irradiance of 175 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (400–700 nm) on a 12 hr light: dark cycle.

Z-stacks were projected along the y axis (3D projection with X viewing set to 90°) resulting in a pseudo transversal cross section of the tissues (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). For FluoSpheres, only high resolution z-stacks were acquired.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Dye detection.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Fluo</th><th valign="top">Laser ex (nm)</th><th valign="top">Em max (nm)</th><th valign="top">Detection range (nm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">DAPI</td><td valign="top">405</td><td valign="top">461</td><td valign="top">430–470</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Symbiodiniaceae*</td><td valign="top">405</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">680–740</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">GFP*</td><td valign="top">488</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">500–530</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Alexa 488</td><td valign="top">488</td><td valign="top">495</td><td valign="top">500–530</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TRITC</td><td valign="top">543</td><td valign="top">577</td><td valign="top">557–585</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">TexRed</td><td valign="top">543</td><td valign="top">613</td><td valign="top">607–630</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FluoSphere</td><td valign="top">543</td><td valign="top">605</td><td valign="top">600–640</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>autofluorescence.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Imaging of phalloidin and dextran</title><p>Laterally grown microcolonies were incubated for 15 min in S-SFSW supplemented D3K-TRITC. Fixation and decalcification were as before except that decalcification was stopped after 16 hr. Then, the microcolonies grown on their coverslip were rinsed in PBS 3 times and incubated in PBS/3%BSA with Phalloidin-Alexa488 (ThermoFisher A12379) for 4 hr before rinsing in PBS (counterstained with DAPI) and imaged using TCS SP8 inverted microscope with hybrid detectors. Individual channels were acquired sequentially. Three dimensional reconstruction images were computed using the 3D application included in the Leica LasX (Leica) software platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Automated counting of fluorescent nanoparticles containing vesicles</title><p>For the dextran D3K/D10K/D70K pulse chase experiment, high resolution imaging of the different tissues layers were processed with imageJ using the methods developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al.

Briefly, the microcolony was set in an incubation chamber and analyzed by inverted confocal microscopy from beneath, at the edge of the microcolony where there are gaps in between the growing crystals. Time laps imaging was recorded (one image every 5 s) using appropriate channels. After 3 min 30 s of recording, texasRed-D3K was added to the medium. Videos correspond to screencasts of the LasAM program graphical interface (Leica) displaying the timelaps acquisition (xzyt) in the video mode.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dominique Desgré for assistance with coral culture.

This work supports the view that the major pinocytic process in anthozoans might be macopinocytosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Massive ubiquitous macropinocytosis in anthozoans&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Even though the manuscript is descriptive, two reviewers with experience in anthozoans agreed that this is a careful study, showing for the first time that basal methazoans take up fluids mainly from the apical side of the oral and aboral cell layers by macropinocytosis. Further, these reviewers felt that this information is of general interest and importance to understand the physiology of this ecologically relevant group and to learn on how they are facing ocean acidification. Based on these comments, it is my pleasure to inform you that the manuscript could be accepted in <italic>eLife</italic> provided you are able to address some of the major concerns to better characterize the endocytic pathway used by corals.</p><p>We summarize here the most important issues to be addressed (and at the bottom include the detailed reviews) but we ask that you focus on these summarized comments to guide your next steps.</p><p>1) One of the criteria to state that anthozoans take up fluid mainly by macropinocytosis is the use of &quot;specific&quot; inhibitors. There is a general concern related to the claimed specificity of such inhibitors, because, first, their action has not been properly characterized or reported in these organisms, and second, inhibition of their supposed targets might have many other effects besides inhibiting macropinocytosis. In this context, it would be essential to show that the drugs do not compromise the viability of the corals under the experimental conditions used, by showing that their effects are reversible. Further, it would be important to demonstrate that the drugs act on their expected targets. This should not be difficult for inhibitors of actin and tubulin polymerization, where reversible disruption of the cytoskeleton could be demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. On the other hand, the inhibition with Latrunculin A and EIAPA might affect many other cellular processes, which indirectly impact on endocytic traffic. One of the reviewers, who is an expert in macropinocytosis, suggested the use of PI3K inhibitors to convincingly show that corals use macropinocytosis for fluid uptake. Finally, I think that it would be important to show that the primary endocytic profiles transiently acquired the machinery involved in macropinosome formation (at least actin).</p><p>2) A second important criteria used to conclude that anthozoans use macropinocytosis is the size of vesicles accumulating dextran. Besides the technical and conceptual issues raised by two of the reviewers, which strongly suggest to use vesicle volumes and not areas to describe their size, the measures are taken by confocal microscopy earliest upon 15 minutes exposure to the dextran, plus 15 minutes chase. Within this time window, most Transferrin taken up by clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammals would be found in sorting and recycling endosomes (not in clathrin coated vesicles) and therefore, the timing is not really suitable to define the primary endocytic profiles. Also, as the authors mention, piling up of small vesicles would be scored as big vacuoles with the technique used. Ideally, if the authors want to identify the primary endocytic vesicles derived from the plasma membrane, the experiment should be performed by electron microscopy upon much shorter (5-10 minutes max) exposure to the dextran, followed by a wash out step to remove the surface-exposed dextran. Otherwise, the authors could use a membrane dye such as FM4-64 combined with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>3) In the context of defining whether corals macropinocytose constitutively, it would be important to define or clarify if they do so in the absence of rotifer extract. Also, there seems to be an agreement on the lack of conclusion regarding the dextran size sorting issue. I would suggest that you discuss the results in light of the article (Neuhaus et al., 2002); addressing the issue experimentally seems difficult at this point and probably out of the scope of the manuscript. In this context thought, you claim that the delay in the uptake in the D10K and D70K as compared to the D3K in the oral ectoderm is due to the mucus. If you can enzymatically remove the mucus to directly test this hypothesis, the point could be made. Otherwise, please discuss other possibilities such as the existence of different uptake pathways in different cell types.</p><p>4) In general terms, all reviewers agreed that the text needs extensive editing (I attach specific comments bellow) and I would certainly encourage you to shorten the Discussion and reduce speculation. The evidence for the existence of other endocytic pathways should be discussed and properly referenced (see specific comments below). The word massive should be removed from the title.</p><p>Specific comments from the reviewers:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) The amount of Materials and methods-like sentences has to be reduced in the Results section. For example, in the subsections “Dynamics of dextran uptake differs between cell layers and size of dextran”, and “Endocytosis occurs at the apical side of the cells”, and many other places.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) Introduction: Wording a little hard to follow. Thorough editing needed for verb tenses and singular vs. plural.</p><p>2) Introduction: second paragraph needs citations throughout.</p><p>3) Introduction, third paragraph: should cite primary literature by these authors and others showing coral septate jxn, the Davy review only presupposes their existence (e.g. Barott et al., 2015).</p><p>4) Introduction, third paragraph: Barott et al., 2015 also shows evidence of bicarbonate transporters, as well as Na and K ions.</p><p>5) Important to mention in the Introduction that the anthozoans studied here have endosymbiotic algae they derive organic nutrients from. These should be referred to as &quot;Symbiodiniaceae&quot; and not zooxanthellae (a nonspecific term that includes many different families of unrelated algae).</p><p>6) Just because macropinocytosis is shown here to be utilized by anthozoans for the first time, the phrase 'at the forefront' seems like an overstatement. We know anthozoans do phagocytosis, that's how they take up their symbionts. It also seems safe to assume that have clathrin and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, as many researchers have seen small vesicles that would be consistent with these modes of uptake. Either clarify what macropinocytosis as forefront of or remove.</p><p>7) Results should be in past tense.</p><p>8) Subsection “Dextran uptake by <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic> occurs through vesicles”: change 'shows' to 'suggests'.</p><p>9) Discussion needs to introduce how closely related these different anthozoans are for readers unfamiliar with cnidaria.</p><p>10) Subsection “Macropinosomes and coral calcifying cells”: Other examples of more recent studies showing vesicles in the CE: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209734 and Barott et al., 2015.</p><p>11) Subsection “Macropinocytosis and coral health”: wild corals injest plastic microparticles: Rotjan et al., 2019.</p><p>12) Subsection “Macropinocytosis and coral health”, second to last sentence: confusingly worded.</p><p>13) &quot;fixed on ice&quot; – with what? For how long?</p><p>14) Subsection “Incubation of microcolonies with nanoparticles”, last sentence: fixed how? Was it decalcified?</p><p>15) It would be helpful to refer to different sized corals with different names. Microcolonies seems more appropriate for the corals growing on coverslips (size not indicated but certainly &lt;2cm) than the 2-3 cm coral fragments hanging from a thread. The coral literature typically refers to corals this size as fragments or nubbins. Minicolonies would be fine as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This article reveals some interesting aspects of the massively understudied cell biology of early metazoans. Most of the studies on anthozoans have focused on their symbiotic/mutualistic association with dinoflagellates, but despite their essential place in the Earth ecosystem, little is known about how they communicate with and extract food from their environment. This article is an elegant and thorough, though a bit preliminary, dissection of the major pinocytic process in anthozoans, which appear to be of macropinocytic nature. Overall, the article is very well written and reads like a detective novel, but some parts are overly detailed, with un-necessary technical presentations of otherwise relatively standard procedures (except in the field of anthozoans).</p><p>1) The methods used to visualise and describe the endocytic mechanisms and compartments are standard, but applied with extreme care and thoroughness. What is missing is a form of quantification of the progression of the tracers in the various cells and layers. It is likely possible to monitor, quantitate and represent the (differential, see point 2 below) advance of the tracers in the form of a &quot;gradient&quot; through the tissue, similarly as is performed when researchers measure and model the gradients of morphogens progressing through a tissue such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disk.</p><p>2) The authors present some interesting data about &quot;size selection&quot; of two different dextran molecules used as fluid-phase tracer. First, such a phenomenon has been reported earlier (for example in Neuhaus et al., 2002) and the authors could compare/contrast their findings with those. Second, because the &quot;molecular sieving&quot; probably does not occur during the ingestion, subsequent macropinosome fragmentation, tubulation and cargo sorting, or other size-discriminating phenomena have to take place. The authors could try to visualise such subsequent phenomena by live microscopy, measuring the fluorescence ratio as a read-out of the selection.</p><p>3) Again, the manuscript is well written, but the amount of Materials and methods-like sentences has to be reduced in the Results section. For example, in the subsections “Dynamics of dextran uptake differs between cell layers and size of dextran” and “Endocytosis occurs at the apical side of the cells”, and many other places.</p><p>4) The macropinocytic process revealed in this study, as well as the progression through tissue layers are well documented (but see point 1-). Now, in terms of mechanistic insight, beside the size of the compartments, which classify plausibly the process as macropinocytic, the authors should relativise their conclusions based on the use of &quot;specific&quot; drugs to block the pathway, because this is based on experiments performed in evolutionarily distant organisms and the molecular targets and mechanisms of action of the drugs might not be conserved.</p><p>5) The authors speculate about the fact that fluid-phase tracers are taken up in a &quot;constant&quot; manner and might become concentrated during the uptake process (subsection “Macropinocytosis and signaling”). The former sounds plausible, but there is no real proof of that. The latter can be substantiated by an experiment (it is easy to measure the intensity of fluorescence per volume units during the process), or the authors have to cut short their speculations, especially &quot;It is thus tantalizing to extrapolate a role for macropinocytosis in cell to cell signaling pathways&quot;. Keep this to write a review once the article is published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper potentially adds any interesting piece of biology to the macropinocytosis field, although a lot of it is also very descriptive for <italic>eLife</italic>. The core is the observation that particles that are too big to be taken up through transporters are being endocytosed via macropinocytosis. That point is clearly made and may be very important for the field. The finding that the macropinocytosis comes from a particular surface seems clear and may be important – a reviewer with expertise in anthozoa will have to comment.</p><p>Others are less sound, for one reason or another:</p><p>- The focus on the different sizes of dextrans is currently unfocused – there are no conclusions drawn, and &quot;the reason for this is unknown&quot;. This party of the story is not ready for <italic>eLife</italic> yet – it's a set of results that don't yet lead to understanding. Interestingly, the authors may find some clues in the work of Thierry Soldati, who has published on the differential sorting of different dextran sizes. I think the relevant paper was about eight years ago, but can't remember precisely.</p><p>I would like to see this work led to a justified scientific conclusion.</p><p>- The inhibitors are called &quot;specific&quot; in the Abstract (it is incidentally odd to say that without saying what they're specific for) – but they aren't. Blocking Nhe1 for 45' could really harm cells; the authors need to show that the rest of cellular physiology is unaffected and that the organisms can recover. The latrunculin is possibly worse – single cells that have been incubated that long in high concentrations are slaughtered; it blocks single-cell macropinocytosis assays within minutes, but also blocks other vesicle traffic, makes the membranes go floppy and blebby, and more generally breaks down cell architecture over tens of minutes. It's conceivable that it takes that long for the drug to diffuse in to the cells of interest (have the authors tested this?) but in any case they should consider secondary effects from actin disruption, including but not only changes to cell viability.</p><p>I would like to see careful controls that these inhibitors were behaving specifically, and the appropriate part of the Abstract rewritten. Also, why not examine π 3-kinase inhibitors? Those are (somewhat) less likely to kill the cells.</p><p>Measuring vesicles and expressing the size as an &quot;area&quot; is not sensible. Vesicles are spherical; the images presumably slice through them at different parts; this needs to be considered and turned into an informed estimate of a volume. And saying &quot; size of the vesicles that we have observed.… is between 350 to 1500 nm&quot; is also unclear – does it mean &quot;the diameter of the slices in EM&quot; or &quot;the diameter of slices in the confocal&quot; or is it a measure of the true diameter like widefield?</p><p>The references for dextran in imaging are very late and miss the real innovators – suggest citing for example Clarke et al., 2002.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study describes for the first time a mechanism, macropinocytosis, for the uptake and intracellular transport of dissolved compounds and nanoparticles within corals and two other anthozoans. The use of fluorescence and electron microscopy, coupled with pharmacological inhibitors of macropinocytosis, provide convincing support for this mechanism. It would be nice to see F-actin staining of the tissues across the pulse/chase time series to help confirm macropinocytosis (and that the 'ruffles' are not just cilia and/or microvilli), something that given the experience of these authors would not be hard to do. Directional transport from the apical side of both endo- and ectodermal cells is convincingly demonstrated for the oral tissues, however I am not convinced they have shown this pattern of uptake in the calicoblastic epithelium. Instead, it looks like the dextrans are moving through the aboral endodermal cells (taken up apically as indicated) and then transported throughout those cells and across via the basolateral side of the CE cells. I was also surprised to read in the Materials and methods that the corals are given a rotifer extract (feeding stimulant) during all of the incubations, but this is never mentioned in the Discussion. This is an important point to bring up and I would like to know if the authors first tried their experiments without the extract and saw no/less macropinocytosis activity.</p><p>Overall this study is an important step forward in our understanding of coral biology that has important implications for cnidarian physiology, particularly as it relates to coral exposure to water soluble pollutants but also for regulation of coral uptake of inorganic and organic nutrients. The authors also argue that corals may be a useful model system for the study of macropinocytosis as it relates to human health and drug delivery, a valuable point that was not articulated as clearly as it should be. Overall, it does not seem surprising that anthozoans use macropinocytosis given that this mechanism is conserved with the most basal eukaryotes, and the authors overstate this novelty. That said, to have described this mechanism for the first time in a class of basal metazoans is an important and interesting advance in our understanding of the physiology of this ecologically and evolutionarily significant group of taxa. It also is a step towards describing the mechanisms of intra- and inter-cellular transport necessary for coral calcification, a timely topic of study for understanding how corals facing ocean acidification may fare.</p><p>The text of the manuscript needs to be thoroughly edited for flow and clarity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Ubiquitous macropinocytosis in anthozoans&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, before full acceptance you would need to address a few points by rewriting some sections:</p><p>This article reveals some interesting aspects of the massively understudied cell biology of early metazoans and supports the view that the major pinocytic process in anthozoans might be macopinocytosis. There is a general agreement that you have done a major effort:</p><p>1) To demonstrate that the Latrunculin A effect is reversible;</p><p>2) To image actin in association with the dextran loaded structures;</p><p>3) To demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K inhibit dextran uptake; and,</p><p>4) To more properly quantify the vesicle-vacuole size.</p><p>The reviewers also agree though that the new results further support the view that macropinocytosis might be the prevalent endocytic pathway in corals but they do not conclusively prove it because:</p><p>1) The actin associated with the dextran vesicles-vacuoles might still correspond to endosomal actin rather than actin structures associated with forming macropinosomes; and,</p><p>2) Because other endocytic mechanisms such as the GEEC pathway are also sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, EIPA and Latrunculin A. In any case, since precise dissection of the endocytic pathways in corals is out of the scope of the manuscript and experimentally very challenging, we are willing to accept the manuscript with no further experimental work, but we ask you to please discuss the fact that other endocytic mechanisms such as the GEEC pathway cannot be excluded.</p><p>Some other points need to be addressed in addition:</p><p>1) The reviewers accept that you did not really probe that the drugs target the expected proteins, but discuss instead the likelihood that this is the case in evolutionary terms. This is fine for the experiments where you observe an effect of the drug. However, it would be important to show that colchicine indeed depolymerizes the microtubules in your system, since you claim that microtubule depolymerization does not affect dextran uptake. If you cannot do this, this negative result should be omitted.</p><p>2) All reviewers also agree that the Discussion is still too long and re-describes some of the results in more detail than needed. The comparison to early TEM work in corals showing the presence of vesicles seems particularly long, as is the discussion of the possible importance of coral macropinocytosis with regard to microplastics. Those last three sections could be combined and condensed into a 'Macropinocytosis and coral physiology' section. Please condense the Discussion to no more than 5 pages double spaced in your draft manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50022.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Several very important concerns were raised and complementary experiments were required in order to improve our demonstration of macropinocytosis in the anthozoan coral <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic> (Cnidaria). These major points included i) the use of more specific inhibitors such as PI3K inhibitors, ii) showing that the effect of the inhibitors were reversible, and iii) trying to visualize the interplay between the movement of the plasma membrane and/or iv) the cortical actin network associated with macropinocytosis. Indeed, in other eukaryotic models such as vertebrate cells or the unicellular protist <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> where the mechanisms of macropinocytosis have been carefully studied, plasma membrane ruffling guided by F-actin reorganization was demonstrated and could be inhibited.</p><p>We have tried our best to comply with these very justified demands using different experimental set-ups and we believe that we managed to fill many of the gaps raised by our initial submission. However, working with a whole organism, moreover a coral, is certainly not as straightforward as working on cells (or even other organisms), and some of our experimental attempts were unsuccessful, likely due to the complexity associated with coral biology.</p><p>A) General answers and major modifications</p><p>1) Membrane visualization: we tried to visualize the cellular membranes of the different tissues using 3 different membrane dyes, i.e. FM4-64 (thermofisher), lipilight (idylle) and Vybrant DiO (thermofisher), without success. Whether using live or fixed samples, we never managed to label any plasma or intracellular membrane. The reason of this is unknown, and would probably require further investigation that falls outside the frame of our present manuscript. We will explore this intriguing “non-result” in the future.</p><p>2) Actin visualization: on the one hand, Sir-actin probes (Cytoskeleton) on live animals did not work. On the other hand, we used fluorescent-conjugated Phalloidin on fixed samples to visualize the F-actin network after a short pulse (15 minutes) of dextran, and obtained pretty good results. We had to modify the experimental set-up in the sense that we used laterally grown coral colonies instead of coral fragments: laterally grown coral colonies are grown on coverslips producing a rather thin layer of skeleton. After fixation, they can be (partially) decalcified in a relatively short period of time, i.e. over-night instead of 3-5 days in the regular protocol. Hence, we experienced a much better preservation of the F-Actin network. Also, we moved to a more sensitive confocal equipped with hybrid detectors (Leica SP8). <italic>In fine</italic>, we were able to clearly image the actin sheet associated with the forming macropinosome (Dextran labeling). Using 3D reconstructions (Leica LasX), we were able to visualize a strong signal of actin (which we called a “cap”) associated with the majority of dextran vesicles. This is now Figure 10 and Videos 3-5 of the manuscript.</p><p>3) PI3K inhibitors: we first used LY294002 (cayman chemical) as it is a reversible PI3K inhibitor. However, this drug was inadequate as it had another very strong and unexpected side effect on the general autofluorescence of the cells. We had never observed such a phenotype previously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows an example of imaging after LY294002 treatment. We also included a phylogenetic analysis the PI3K family in <italic>Stylophora</italic>, showing that there is only one PI3K homolog, against 4 in human.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>LY294002 treatment triggers unexpected secondary effect and phylogenetic comparison of the PI3K family in Stylophora pistillata vs human.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Confocal Z-stack of <italic>Stylophora</italic> incubated in LY294002. Red=Dapi; Green=dextra; gray=Zoox, and Cyan is the GFP chanel. A and B correspond to the oral ectoderm and the aboral endoderm, respectively. Note that in the oral ectoderm, the cell layer is filled with GFP-like signal that is never seen under other conditions. In B, the GFP-like signal is less strong (although different than controls), and the vesicles of dextran are abnormally large (4-5 μm in diameter). However, based on the side effect of LY294002, this assay was not validated. (<bold>C</bold>) PhyML phylogeny of the PI3K families in human (names in black) and in <italic>Stylophora</italic> (names in blue). In <italic>Stylophora</italic>, there is only one cognate PI3K homolog (4 in human). The other sequences are PI3K-related members (i.e. PI3K-C2, PI3K-type3 and PI4K).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50022-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>On the other hand, we successfully used Wortmannin (Selleckchem) another PI3K inhibitor, although irreversible. Like EIPA, Wortmannin blocked Dextran uptake, showing that macropinocytosis in anthozoans is PI3K dependent as in other eukaryotes. This is now Figure 8.</p><p>4) Inhibitor reversibility: in the first version of our manuscript, we had shown that the actin inhibitor Latrunculin inhibited dextran uptake at 500 nM (not effective on the aboral endoderm) and 1000 nM (effective on the aboral endoderm). In order to verify that latrunculin (LatA) was not destroying the cellular integrity of the animals’ tissues (which would also end up as an apparent inhibition), we tested reversibility. Corals are colonial organisms. This means that a fragment (corresponding to approx. 100 individuals or polyps) can be cut into 2 pieces without much harm to the colony. In order to assess the reversibility of the drug, we used a similar set-up than in the first version, albeit this time, after the LatA inhibition and dextran pulse, we sampled only one half of the colony. The second half was then submitted to a second step with another dextran pulse after a 4 hour wash without the drug. At 500 nM LatA, we again experienced a strong impairment of the dextran uptake (30 minutes pulse), except in the aboral endoderm (step1). However, after a 4 hours wash in regular seawater, the same colony had recovered the ability to uptake dextran (step2). Concurrently, in the aboral endoderm (as well as in the oral cell layers), inhibition of dextran uptake was achieved at 1000 nM, and was reversibly restored after washing. However, at this concentration, we experienced that the cells composing the thin calicoblastic cell layer were rounded and not forming a true epithelium. Nevertheless, we conclusively showed that latrunculin specifically (since reversible) blocked actin in the process of macropinocytosis, with tissue layers responding differently depending on drug dosage. The 500 nM experiment is now Figure 8 (and figure supplements).</p><p>We believe that within the frame of a technically challenging investigation of cell biology in corals, this novel set of experiments should provide sufficient additional proof to conclude that macropinocytosis is indeed the process that we show in the present manuscript. We have developed several innovative imaging approaches for the field of coral biology that we hope should satisfy the general and specific demands of the reviewers, as summed up by the editor.</p><p>Other figure changes:</p><p>i) Figure supplements have to complement a main text figure. We created a new Figure 1 (which was previously in our supplementary data) to schematize the anatomy and histology of the coral. This helps the comprehension of the following figures for scientist non-familiar to scleractinian corals. Consequently, all previous figures have their number incremented by +1 (ex-Figure 1 is now Figure 2 etc.)</p><p>ii) We totally agree that describing vesicles with surface areas in µm<sup>2</sup> was inappropriate. We went back to the measurement files and converted every area (which corresponds to Z-stack projections) into diameters (A=πr<sup>2</sup>). We then reconstructed the distributions of the different diameter ranges, using 200 nm steps. Figure 7 shows vesicles diameters in nm. There was no change to the conclusions of this part.</p><p>iii) We changed one picture in the Figure 2—figure supplement 1C which was showing transmission electronic microscope picture of the aboral endoderm. The previous picture was misleading with regard to extracellular microvilli versus intracellular macropinosomes. The new picture clearly shows that endodermal cells contain (forming) macropinosomes (mp) as part of the apical plasma membrane, like in the ectoderm (b). Microvilli (Mv) are now indicated with arrows to avoid confusion. To our understanding, the positioning of these vesicles is not likely to represent large late endosomes resulting from the fusion of smaller early endosomes. The text describing the macropinosome formation as part of the apical membrane has been changed accordingly.</p><p>B) Detailed answers to the issues summarized by the editors</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] We summarize here the most important issues to be addressed (and at the bottom include the detailed reviews) but we ask that you focus on these summarized comments to guide your next steps.</p><p>1) One of the criteria to state that anthozoans take up fluid mainly by macropinocytosis is the use of &quot;specific&quot; inhibitors. There is a general concern related to the claimed specificity of such inhibitors, because, first, their action has not been properly characterized or reported in these organisms, and second, inhibition of their supposed targets might have many other effects besides inhibiting macropinocytosis. In this context, it would be essential to show that the drugs do not compromise the viability of the corals under the experimental conditions used, by showing that their effects are reversible. Further, it would be important to demonstrate that the drugs act on their expected targets. This should not be difficult for inhibitors of actin and tubulin polymerization, where reversible disruption of the cytoskeleton could be demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. On the other hand, the inhibition with Latrunculin A and EIAPA might affect many other cellular processes, which indirectly impact on endocytic traffic. One of the reviewers, who is an expert in macropinocytosis, suggested the use of PI3K inhibitors to convincingly show that corals use macropinocytosis for fluid uptake. Finally, I think that it would be important to show that the primary endocytic profiles transiently acquired the machinery involved in macropinosome formation (at least actin).</p></disp-quote><p>See answers in A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second important criteria used to conclude that anthozoans use macropinocytosis is the size of vesicles accumulating dextran. Besides the technical and conceptual issues raised by two of the reviewers, which strongly suggest to use vesicle volumes and not areas to describe their size, the measures are taken by confocal microscopy earliest upon 15 minutes exposure to the dextran, plus 15 minutes chase. Within this time window, most Transferrin taken up by clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammals would be found in sorting and recycling endosomes (not in clathrin coated vesicles) and therefore, the timing is not really suitable to define the primary endocytic profiles. Also, as the authors mention, piling up of small vesicles would be scored as big vacuoles with the technique used. Ideally, if the authors want to identify the primary endocytic vesicles derived from the plasma membrane, the experiment should be performed by electron microscopy upon much shorter (5-10 minutes max) exposure to the dextran, followed by a wash out step to remove the surface-exposed dextran. Otherwise, the authors could use a membrane dye such as FM4-64 combined with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that there was a misunderstanding with the timing of our dextran incubations (pulses). With the coral <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic>, we have been incubating (without chase/wash) the fragments for as short as 5 minutes, as shown in the Figure 3—figure supplement 3 (even shorter pulses were tested; not shown). However, it is only after 10 minutes that the first vesicles were apparent in the aboral endoderm (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) or 15 minutes that they became apparent in most cells (Figures 4A, 5B, 10). Several parameters have to be considered for the dextran to arrive from the surrounding seawater to the 4 cell layers: for the oral ectoderm (in contact with the seawater), the mucus layer is a barrier. For the oral and aboral endoderms, the time for the renewal of the coelenteric cavity, which is the time for the dextran to first arrive in contact with the cellular membranes, is within the 5 minute range (discussed in the Discussion paragraph “Particle diffusion and cell progression of macropinosomes”). Of note, detection of a forming macropinosome requires a sufficient concentration of Dextran to have a detectable signal. Importantly, when we injected Dextran directly into the coelenteric cavity of the sea anemone <italic>Anemonia viridis</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), the first vesicles could be seen after only 1 minute, and were definitively evident after 4 minutes. Finally, in the calicoblastic ectoderm facing the skeleton, the dextran present in the coelenteric cavity needs to cross two septate junctions and the mesoglea before reaching the cells’ apical membranes, an additional time lag that we estimate to represent approx. 5 minutes. Thus, the time required for forming large (Diam. &gt;350 nm) vesicles can be estimated to be less than 4 minutes. This is in agreement with experiments demonstrating macropinocytosis on cell lines (in direct contact with their media) from other organisms. It is less compatible with the accumulation of dextran in late endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the context of defining whether corals macropinocytose constitutively, it would be important to define or clarify if they do so in the absence of rotifer extract. Also, there seems to be an agreement on the lack of conclusion regarding the dextran size sorting issue. I would suggest that you discuss the results in light of the article (Neuhaus et al., 2002); addressing the issue experimentally seems difficult at this point and probably out of the scope of the manuscript. In this context thought, you claim that the delay in the uptake in the D10K and D70K as compared to the D3K in the oral ectoderm is due to the mucus. If you can enzymatically remove the mucus to directly test this hypothesis, the point could be made. Otherwise, please discuss other possibilities such as the existence of different uptake pathways in different cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility of “inducing” macropinocytosis by supplying rotifer extract with the different tracers is a relevant point that we eluded in the first version of the manuscript. In the beginning of our investigation, we were using Sterile Filtered Seawater only to incubate the fragments. And we indeed observed macropinocytosis. Then, in order to avoid potential nutritional stress, we decided to conduct all our experiments with rotifer extracts, as there was no apparent changes in our observations. Thus, although we did not quantify the potential effect of the supplemented extracts, we can rule out the possibility that macropinocytosis is induced by rotifers. We added a comment in the relevant Materials and methods section.</p><p>With regard to the “selectivity” of the dextran size in the different tissues, we would rather prefer to avoid drawing definitive conclusions. It is an intriguing phenomenon that we observed (Figures 3 and 4) and measured (Figure 7) especially in the oral ectoderm. Several hypotheses could be drawn. The first and most easily accepted is size selectivity due to the mucus layer. A clear stack of Dextran is visible accumulating only after 5 min on the apical side of the oral ectoderm, where the mucus layer lies (see figures). This Surface Mucopolysaccharide Layer (mucus) is particularly abundant, representing a biological mesh and is part of the mechanisms for heterotrophic feeding from Dissolved Organic Material (DOM) to trapped bacteria (see review by Brown and Bythell, 2005 for extensive descriptions). Another possibility for nanoparticles selectivity could be the net charge of the particles (Table 2). The combination of a mucopolysaccharidic mesh layer with differently charged particles should also be taken into account. However, we certainly cannot exclude additional endocytic mechanisms that would contribute to the selective uptake of nanoparticles as was nicely demonstrated in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (Neuhaus et al., 2002). In this latter scenario, a “classical” endocytic pathway (e.g. clathrin-mediated) would selectively endocytose D3K in small vesicles that would later fuse as large late endosomes or with macropinosomes. This could explain why, after 15 minutes pulse and 4 hours chase (wash), there are still discrepancies between the different dextran size uptakes. However, short pulse experiments (e.g. Figure 4A) always show a rapid preferential uptake of D3K versus D10K, which would be better explained by mucus selective retention. Since we have yet no experimental evidence to conclude on the matter, we have modified the text to leave the field open and discussed the aforementioned hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general terms, all reviewers agreed that the text needs extensive editing (I attach specific comments bellow) and I would certainly encourage you to shorten the Discussion and reduce speculation. The evidence for the existence of other endocytic pathways should be discussed and properly referenced (see specific comments below). The word massive should be removed from the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the Discussion and removed the speculative part on cell-cell signaling via macropinocytosis. The 15 following points (see below) were modified as requested. The entire manuscript has been revised by a professional text editor. We hope that this new version, which includes multiple text changes, will now be eligible for publication.</p><p>C) Specific answers to the reviewers</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) The methods used to visualise and describe the endocytic mechanisms and compartments are standard, but applied with extreme care and thoroughness. What is missing is a form of quantification of the progression of the tracers in the various cells and layers. It is likely possible to monitor, quantitate and represent the (differential, see point 2 below) advance of the tracers in the form of a &quot;gradient&quot; through the tissue, similarly as is performed when researchers measure and model the gradients of morphogens progressing through a tissue such as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disk.</p><p>2) The authors present some interesting data about &quot;size selection&quot; of two different dextran molecules used as fluid-phase tracer. First, such a phenomenon has been reported earlier (for example in Neuhaus et al., 2002) and the authors could compare/contrast their findings with those. Second, because the &quot;molecular sieving&quot; probably does not occur during the ingestion, subsequent macropinosome fragmentation, tubulation and cargo sorting, or other size-discriminating phenomena have to take place. The authors could try to visualise such subsequent phenomena by live microscopy, measuring the fluorescence ratio as a read-out of the selection.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these two very constructive comments. We have the feeling however that they fall beyond the scope of the present study which is the journey of nanoparticles from the seawater to the cell uptake. Nevertheless, the actual study shall be continued; with the use of more advanced imaging facilities as well as combination of other tracers, in order to tentatively decipher the nanoparticle selectivity (size/charge/composition) as well as the cellular fate of the macropinosomes inside the cell. And live imaging using laterally grown micro-colonies is, among others, some of the tools we are currently developing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Again, the manuscript is well written, but the amount of Materials and methods-like sentences has to be reduced in the Results section. For example, in the subsections “Dynamics of dextran uptake differs between cell layers and size of dextran” and “Endocytosis occurs at the apical side of the cells”, and many other places.</p></disp-quote><p>See section B for answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The macropinocytic process revealed in this study, as well as the progression through tissue layers are well documented (but see point 1-). Now, in terms of mechanistic insight, beside the size of the compartments, which classify plausibly the process as macropinocytic, the authors should relativise their conclusions based on the use of &quot;specific&quot; drugs to block the pathway, because this is based on experiments performed in evolutionarily distant organisms and the molecular targets and mechanisms of action of the drugs might not be conserved.</p></disp-quote><p>Macropinocytosis has been studied in eukaryotes as distant as the amoebae <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and vertebrates using similar inhibitors. Cnidaria is the sister group to Bilateria, part of the Epitheliozoa. Moreover, the genomic sequencing efforts have shown that in most cases, gene sequences similarity was higher between cnidarian and vertebrate than between protostomian (e.g. <italic>Drosophila, C. elegans</italic>) and vertebrates. Actin is such a conserved molecule that there is no doubt about the inhibitory effects of Latrunculin. EIPA has been shown to be specific to NHE in <italic>Stylophora</italic> (Laurent et al., 2014). Although LY294002 had unexpected side effects that made its use invalid, we now show the effect of Wortmannin: the phylogenetic tree of the PI3K shows that the <italic>Stylophora</italic> homolog is positioned between the human homologs, which reflect the high level of sequence homology between the human and cnidarian sequences. Hence, we are confident that the action of the drugs used in our study is specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors speculate about the fact that fluid-phase tracers are taken up in a &quot;constant&quot; manner and might become concentrated during the uptake process (subsection “Macropinocytosis and signaling”). The former sounds plausible, but there is no real proof of that. The latter can be substantiated by an experiment (it is easy to measure the intensity of fluorescence per volume units during the process), or the authors have to cut short their speculations, especially &quot;It is thus tantalizing to extrapolate a role for macropinocytosis in cell to cell signaling pathways&quot;. Keep this to write a review once the article is published.</p><p>We have removed this paragraph as it was too speculative.</p><p>Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3</p></disp-quote><p>See sections A and B for responses.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Some other points need to be addressed in addition:</p><p>1) The reviewers accept that you did not really probe that the drugs target the expected proteins, but discuss instead the likelihood that this is the case in evolutionary terms. This is fine for the experiments where you observe an effect of the drug. However, it would be important to show that colchicine indeed depolymerizes the microtubules in your system, since you claim that microtubule depolymerization does not affect dextran uptake. If you cannot do this, this negative result should be omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the (negative) results from the colchicine experiment, i.e. the corresponding Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and related sentences in the Materials and methods, Results and figure legends sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All reviewers also agree that the Discussion is still way too long and re-describes some of the results in more detail than needed. The comparison to early TEM work in corals showing the presence of vesicles seems particularly long, as is the discussion of the possible importance of coral macropinocytosis with regard to microplastics. Those last three sections could be combined and condensed into a 'Macropinocytosis and coral physiology' section. Please condense the Discussion to no more than 5 pages double spaced in your draft manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the Discussion section:</p><p>– We added a small paragraph on the CLIC/GEEC pathways and its putative participation in the formation of the vesicles that we observed.</p><p>– We shortened the Discussion down to 5 pages, which includes removing detailed re-description of some of the results and merging of the previous last 3 sections into one 'Macropinocytosis and coral physiology' section.</p><p>– We added an acknowledgment paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
