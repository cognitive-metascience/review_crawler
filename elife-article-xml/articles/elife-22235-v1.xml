There are a number of ways that cells can achieve this particular arrangement. In one mechanism, a small group of cells bud out of a single cell layer to become the end of a new tube or a new branch of an existing tube. Since all the cells are still connected, the first cells bring their neighbouring cells along behind them, rearranging these cells to form the walls of a tube.</p><p>In addition to changing position, the cells must change their shape to form a tube. One crucial change in cell shape is called apical constriction, and involves the side of the cell facing the inside of the tube becoming smaller than the other sides. This creates cells with a wedge-like shape that can fit together to form the curved wall of the tube, similar to shaped bricks in an archway. Apical constriction has been widely studied and is controlled by proteins that act like motors moving along protein-based filaments; however the roles of apical constriction in tube formation have not been fully explained.</p><p>Using the developing salivary glands of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Chung et al. confirmed that the motor protein known as myosin II controls apical constriction during tissue invagination. Further examination showed that proteins (called Fork Head and Fog) activate and localize an enzyme (Rho kinase) to control the localized accumulation of myosin II and thereby control apical constriction. Chung et al. then showed that salivary glands could still form tubes if apical constriction was blocked, indicating that it is not an essential part of tissue invagination in this organ. However, blocking apical constriction led the tube to develop unusual shapes at intermediate stages.</p><p>More work is now needed to better understand the links between apical constriction, cell rearrangement and tissue invagination. These processes are fundamental for organs to form correctly in many organisms and understanding their control could have wide-ranging impacts. A better understanding of these processes may provide insight into how the tubes can form while keeping all the cells adequately supplied with oxygen and nutrients, and into diseases that result if there are defects in the invagination process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22235.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22235.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>salivary gland</kwd><kwd>apical constriction</kwd><kwd>fork head</kwd><kwd>fog</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 DE13899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrew</surname><given-names>Deborah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatially coordinated apical constriction occurs during <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland invagination, but the salivary gland can form fully internalized and elongated tubes even when this process is completely blocked.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organs that transport gases and nutrients, as well as those producing and secreting vital hormones and enzymes, are organized as epithelial tubes, many of which arise from already polarized epithelial sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>). To enter the third dimension, a flat sheet of polarized epithelial cells bends or invaginates using either of two distinct processes–wrapping or budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003</xref>). During wrapping, the entire epithelial sheet folds in until its edges meet and seal to form an elongated tube, as occurs in vertebrate neural tube formation and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Massarwa et al., 2014</xref>). During budding, a subset of cells extend out of the plane of the epithelium in an orthogonal direction to form a tube; this process is observed during branching morphogenesis of many organs, including the mammalian lungs and kidney, and the primary branches of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubarsky and Krasnow, 2003</xref>).</p><p>A limited number of cellular processes are involved in creating three-dimensional structures, which include regulated changes in cell shape, arrangement and position, as well as oriented cell divisions and spatially restricted programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>). One cell shape change associated with such tissue remodeling is apical constriction, wherein the nuclei move to a basal position in the cell and the apical domains constrict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>). In polarized epithelial cells that maintain cell-cell adhesion, apical constriction is linked to tissue folding or invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez and Navascués, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardin and Keller, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kam et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewis, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Non-muscle myosin II-dependent contractility generates the force that drives this cellular process. Particularly, a pulsatile actomyosin complex in the apical medial region of the cell (hereafter referred to as apicomedial myosin) has been described in tissues that undergo apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). Studies in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos have identified the Folded gastrulation (Fog) pathway that regulates apical constriction and apicomedial myosin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning and Rogers, 2014</xref>). During gastrulation, mesodermal cells undergo apical constriction to form the ventral furrow along the anterior/posterior body axis. In those cells, the mesoderm-specific transcription factors Twist and Snail activate G protein-coupled receptor signaling and recruit RhoGEF2 to the apical surface, which, in turn, activates Rho1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manning et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parks and Wieschaus, 1991</xref>). GTP-bound Rho1 then activates Rho-associated kinase (Rok), which phosphorylates and activates non-muscle myosin II, which forms an actomyosin complex at the medial apical cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>). This actomyosin complex causes asynchronous contractions that pull the adherens junctions (AJs) inward. Contractions are maintained between pulses by the actomyosin belt, which serves as a ‘ratchet’ to incrementally reduce apical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although apical constriction and its associated forces are suggested to drive tissue invagination, the exact role of this cell shape change in tube formation remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Llimargas and Casanova, 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea defective for EGF receptor signaling, apical constriction is impaired, but most cells invaginate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos mutant for <italic>twist</italic> or <italic>fog</italic>, mesodermal cells with defective apical constriction still invaginate, although the process is both delayed and aberrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leptin and Grunewald, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>). In these mutants, however, apical constriction is not completely blocked; it is simply less extensive and more random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>), making it difficult to draw any clear conclusions. A recent study, using an optogenetic method to deplete phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and actin from the cell cortex, showed that local inhibition of apical constriction is sufficient to cause global arrest of mesoderm invagination during <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guglielmi et al., 2015</xref>). This finding suggests that apical constriction is essential for the invagination by wrapping that occurs during ventral furrow formation. It remains unclear, however, whether apical constriction is also critical for tissue invagination by budding.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland (SG) is an excellent system to study the role of apical constriction during tissue invagination by budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’’,B,B’,C and C’</xref>). The SG begins as a two-dimensional sheet of cells on the embryo surface that internalizes to form an elongated tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Since neither cell division nor cell death occurs once the SG has been specified, the entire morphogenetic process must be driven by changes in cell shape and rearrangement. Indeed, apical constriction has been observed in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>), and an increase in apical myosin has been reported during SG invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escudero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). More detailed analyses revealed several distinct myosin structures in the forming SG, including a supracellular myosin cable that surrounds the entire tissue and is thought to be involved in tissue invagination, as well as a web-like myosin structure in the apicomedial region of cells that colocalizes with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper, 2012</xref>). The latter shows pulsatile behavior, suggesting that contractile forces by the apicomedial actomyosin complex may drive apical constriction during SG invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Booth et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22235.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clustered apical constriction does not occur in <italic>fkh</italic> mutant SGs.</title><p>(<bold>A–A’’</bold>) Epithelial invagination by budding. 3D reconstruction of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic SGs stained with Crb (green), an apically localized transmembrane protein, and CrebA (magenta), an SG nuclear transcription factor, before (<bold>A</bold>), at the beginning (<bold>A’</bold>) and during (<bold>A’’</bold>) invagination.

We show that the spatial and temporal pattern of apical constriction correlates with apicomedial myosin formation during SG invagination. We uncover the molecular pathway through which the FoxA transcription factor Fork head (Fkh) coordinates apical constriction by regulating Fog signaling in the SGs. Through genetic manipulations to completely block apical constriction and detailed quantitative analysis, we show that apical constriction is not required for SG invagination, but is required for proper tissue geometry. SG cells can internalize even without forming apicomedial myosin, suggesting a role for other additional forces. We provide evidence that the compressing force generated by the tissue-level supracellular myosin cable contributes to invagination in SGs with defective apical constriction.

Using labeling with E-Cadherin (E-Cad), an AJ marker, and CrebA, an SG nuclear marker, we segmented apical cell outlines and calculated the apical area of individual cells. By analyzing &gt;60 WT SGs for apical area and depth of invagination, we classified four distinct stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G, D'–G'</xref>). At early stage 11, all SG cells were on the embryo surface and cells with different apical area were distributed relatively randomly, although cells with small and large apical area tended to be toward the inside and at the periphery of the tissue, respectively (Before invagination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and D’</xref>). Shortly after, subsets of cells clustered in specific regions had smaller apical areas, most notably in a middle region close to the posterior edge of the SG where invagination begins (Clustered apical constriction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and E’</xref>). The less prominent anterior cluster corresponds to a small indentation that can be observed in lateral views of stage 12 SGs (data not shown). When a few cells in the posterior cluster had internalized to form an invagination pit, many cells near the pit were apically constricted (Beginning of invagination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and F’</xref>). At late stage 11, as more cells had invaginated, most cells anterior to the invagination pit were apically constricted (Deep invagination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and G’</xref>). At the same time, cells in the periphery of the SG were apically expanded, especially in the region ventral to the invagination pit. Quantification of the percentage and cumulative percentage of cells of different apical area showed a gradual and significant increase in the number of cells with smaller apical area as invagination progressed. Small increases in the number of cells with larger apical area were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>).</p><p>The SGs of <italic>fkh</italic> null mutants undergo early apoptosis and fail to internalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>). <italic>fkh</italic> mutant SGs rescued from cell death by deletion of the pro-apoptotic genes contained within the <italic>H99</italic> deficiency also fail to internalize. SGs of <italic>H99</italic> deficiency embryos develop completely normally during embryogenesis, indicating that blocking apoptosis does not affect SG morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal images of the late stage 11 <italic>fkh H99</italic> SGs did not reveal invagination pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’’ and C’’</xref>), consistent with a complete failure of invagination. Analysis of apical areas of late stage 11 <italic>fkh H99</italic> SGs revealed that <italic>fkh H99</italic> SG cells had overall smaller apical area than WT cells; both the mean and median values for apical area were lower than those of WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Importantly, cells with the smallest apical areas were not clustered in <italic>fkh H99</italic> mutant SGs and were instead randomly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and H’</xref>). Moreover, the cumulative percentage of late stage 11 <italic>fkh H99</italic> SG cells of different apical areas showed a similar distribution trend to that of WT SG cells before invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Indeed, median scaling normalization of the apical area of <italic>fkh H99</italic> late stage 11 SG cells revealed a very similar distribution to the apical area of WT SGs before invagination. Particularly, the percentages of cells with the lower 70% apical area were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Taken together, our analysis reveals that apical constriction is both temporally and spatially coordinated during SG invagination and does not occur in <italic>fkh H99</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>fkh</italic> is required for apicomedial myosin accumulation</title><p>Apical constriction of both vertebrate and invertebrate tissues is associated with contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</xref>).

Consistent with results from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper, 2012</xref>), several myosin structures were observed, including a supracellular myosin cable that encircles the whole tissue, AJ-associated cortical myosin, as well as an apicomedial myosin web (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Importantly, apicomedial myosin formed in a manner that recapitulates the observed temporal and spatial pattern of apical constriction. Before invagination, myosin predominantly localized at the cortical regions in all SG cells, partially colocalizing with E-Cad and often showing higher intensity at vertices (hereafter referred to as junctional myosin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When invagination began, moderate levels of apicomedial myosin were observed in cells near where invagination initiates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). During deep invagination, apicomedial myosin was quite prominent in the cells anterior to the invagination pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Even during deep invagination, Rok signals were detected only as small- to medium-sized puncta (in Crb-overexpressing SG cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) or as very small puncta (in Dia-CA-overexpressing SG cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>) rather than the huge globular structures detected in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, Crb-overexpressing SGs formed relatively normal pools of apicomedial myosin that are associated with actin and with membrane distortions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>), consistent with our findings that in <italic>fog</italic> mutants even dispersed Rok can still result in some apicomedial myosin formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). These data suggest that in Crb-overexpressing SG cells, the forces of apical expansion overwhelm those of apical constriction despite the actomyosin machinery being in place and functional. Interestingly, in Dia-CA-overexpressing SG cells, most myosin signals were observed in a broad cortical area partially overlapping with actin, but no web-like apicomedial myosin formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A similar increase in cortical myosin was observed in Dia-CA-overexpressing amnioserosa cells, but interestingly, premature apical constriction was observed in those cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Homem and Peifer, 2008</xref>), suggesting possible tissue-specific effects. Moreover, the significant ‘wiggliness’ of the AJs in Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs suggests a decrease of cortical tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, G, H and L</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, since SG invagination occurs despite the failure in apical constriction with overexpression of either Crb or Dia-CA, we conclude that apical constriction is not required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Apical constriction is required for the correct geometry of tissue invagination</title><p>Although invagination pits formed at approximately the right position and at the right time in the SGs with either uncoordinated (in <italic>fog</italic> mutants) or completely blocked apical constriction (in Crb- or Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs), the pits were abnormal. Specifically, both the <italic>fog</italic> mutant and Crb-overexpressing SGs frequently formed a pit that was elongated along the D/V axis, rather than the smaller oval-shaped pit of WT SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C, A'–C'</xref>). Overexpression of Dia-CA resulted in a huge invagination pit, often larger than half the size of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and D'</xref>). We asked how this aberrant invagination and the continuous increases in apical area affected tube structure. 3D reconstruction of invaginating SGs (late stage 11) revealed a wider lumen in <italic>fog</italic> mutant and Crb- and Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs compared to WT, indicating that early tube architecture is affected by defective apical constriction and consequent abnormal invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–6H</xref>). We next analyzed stage 14 embryos, when in WT, all SG cells have fully internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Interestingly, Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs showed a significant delay in cell internalization and migration. All Dia-CA-overexpressing cells eventually internalized, but formed a short gland with increased luminal diameter that remained close to the embryo surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Overproduced Crb not only localized to the apical membranes, but also mislocalized to the basal membranes facing outside of the tube; nonetheless, SG cells still formed a single-layered fully internalized tube at stage 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Although Crb overexpression did not delay SG internalization or migration, partially or completely externalized SGs with no clear internal lumen were occasionally observed at stage 15 and 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Since all SGs were internalized at earlier stages, these findings suggest that the Crb-overexpressing SG cells subsequently evaginated from the inside to the outside of the embryo, likely because of continued apical expansion. Similar invagination-followed-by-evagination phenotypes were observed when a myristoylated, membrane-tethered form of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (Myr-Wasp), an activator of the actin nucleating Arp2/3 complex, was overexpressed in the SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

The circularity of the WT placode is slightly, but significantly increased from early stage 11 to late stage 11, suggesting an increased tension over time (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). At late stage 11, the border of the WT placode where the supracellular cable was observed was very smooth, and circularity of the placode boundary was significantly greater than that of the boundaries shifted outside the placode by one cell (outer boundary) or inside the placode by one cell (inner boundary), suggesting that this big cable is under tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>).

The circularity of the <italic>fkh H99</italic> mutant SG boundary was between that of early and late stage 11 WT, and was also comparable to the <italic>fkh H99</italic> outer boundary, indicating loss of compressive forces on cells at and near the SG boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>Anisotropic Crb distribution at the placode boundary has been suggested to drive supracellular myosin cable formation during SG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper, 2012</xref>).

In these cells, myosin levels were very high at the boundary, where Crb levels were lowest (inset).

Given that loss of <italic>fog</italic> had relatively minor effects on apical constriction compared to overexpression of Crb or Dia-CA, and that <italic>fog</italic> mutants also form the circumferential cable surrounding the tissue, these severe tube internalization defects were unexpected. Therefore, we asked if SG expression of Fog in otherwise <italic>fog</italic> mutant embryos could rescue internalization using the UAS-Gal4 system, which has allowed the rescue of multiple SG mutant phenotypes, including loss of <italic>fkh</italic> and other transcription factors expressed in the early SG (D. Johnson and D.J. Andrew, unpublished data). The range of defects observed with SG expression of Fog in otherwise <italic>fog</italic> mutant embryos was similar to that seen with complete loss of <italic>fog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>), indicating that the Fog requirement for internalization is not SG autonomous. Instead, analysis of early <italic>fog</italic> mutant embryos suggested that the separation of the SG from the surrounding epithelia causes these defects. In stage 11 <italic>fog</italic> mutants, deep ingression furrows often formed between the two tissues, and in more than 60% of embryos with such furrows (24/39), some SG cells at the edge were tilted and even perpendicular to the rest of the cells in the SG epithelium, forming a lip-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–J and F'–J'</xref>). These cells maintained adhesion to their neighbors and were properly polarized, with their AJs connected to those of neighboring SG cells at the edge. Strong myosin signals at the level of AJs along the edge of the lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H’</xref>) suggest that pulling or squeezing forces along the edge of the gland in combination with the pushing forces of the ingression furrow caused the SG cells to slip outside the embryo.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22235.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Invagination decouples internalization of cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–E, A'-E'</bold>) <italic>fog</italic> mutant SGs of late stages, from fully internalized (<bold>A, A'</bold>), partially internalized (<bold>B, B'</bold>) to completely externalized glands, either folded (<bold>C, C'</bold>) or elongated (<bold>D, D', E, E'</bold>).

How tissues/cells undergo apical constriction in a temporally and spatially controlled manner and how much this morphogenetic process contributes to tissue invagination in different developmental contexts have been less clear. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SG as a model allowed us to quantitatively analyze the distribution and magnitude of cell shape changes during invagination and to determine the signaling pathway through which apical constriction is regulated tissue-specifically. Our studies support a model in which apical constriction plays only a minor role in tissues that internalize by budding and that multiple morphogenetic processes contribute to tissue budding.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tissue- and cell-specific regulation of apical constriction</title><p>Fog has been implicated in invagination of several embryonic tissues, including the ventral furrow, the posterior midgut and the SG, and also functions in imaginal disc folding during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning and Rogers, 2014</xref>; this study). In the ventral furrow, Twist and Snail regulate expression of the Fog ligand and its receptor, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manning et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seher et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, Caudal, through activation of additional downstream transcription factors, is required for <italic>fog</italic> expression in the posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu and Lengyel, 1998</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that Fkh regulates SG expression of <italic>fog</italic> to coordinate apical constriction of SG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, at least during embryogenesis, the tissue-specificity of Fog signaling is determined by the tissue-specific transcription factor(s) that activate expression of <italic>fog</italic> (and its receptors). The downstream pathway components are both maternally deposited and widely expressed, and are thus likely to be shared in all cell/tissue types where Fog functions. Indeed, mutations in RhoGEF2, a key component of the Fog signaling pathway in the mesoderm, cause SG invagination defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikolaidou and Barrett, 2004</xref>). Due to their ubiquitous expression, localized activation of the downstream components, rather than their localized expression, is likely to determine their site of action. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrated that the robust apicomedial Rok accumulation in the SG cells requires both Fkh and Fog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>An interesting question is what determines regional specificity for Fog signaling within a tissue. Levels of <italic>fog</italic> transcripts are relatively uniform across the primordia, yet both Rok accumulation and apicomedial myosin accumulation occur only in a temporally and spatially regulated subset of SG cells. We propose that production and apical release of Fog and/or the apical localization of its transmembrane receptors could be regulated post-translationally. Excellent candidate regulators include Huckebein (Hkb), an SP1-like transcription factor, and its key target Klarsicht (Klar), a putative regulator of dynein ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mosley-Bishop et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2002</xref>). The expression of both <italic>hkb</italic> and <italic>klar</italic> is limited to the dorsal posterior domain of the SG, where we observe high Rok, high myosin, and apical constriction. Since Klar is required for the delivery of vesicles to the apical SG surface, which is enriched in minus-end microtubules (MT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>), a possible scenario is that during invagination, Klar-dependent apically-targeted vesicles contain Fog ligand and/or its receptor. Consistent with this model, a recent study has demonstrated a requirement for the MT cytoskeleton in the formation of apicomedial myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, unlike WT, <italic>hkb</italic> mutant SGs invaginate from the center of the SG placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Additional morphogenetic processes take place during SG invagination</title><p>During ventral furrow formation, where apical constriction plays a major role in tissue invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guglielmi et al., 2015</xref>), myosin is absent from the cortex and accumulates in only the apicomedial region. Since AJ-associated cortical myosin has been linked to junctional remodeling and cell rearrangement in the intercalating ectodermal cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>), one might expect that cell rearrangement does not take place during ventral mesoderm formation. Indeed, ventral furrow cells invaginate without changing their position relative to each other; cells constrict predominantly in the ventral/lateral direction, remaining longer along the A/P axis to form a long, narrow furrow along the axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sweeton et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>We show that apical constriction is not required for SG invagination per se, but is needed to acquire proper geometry of the invagination pit and the tube that forms from it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In the SG, where cells sequentially invaginate through a relatively small invagination pit to make a tube, combinatorial forces that drive different morphological changes are expected to contribute to tissue invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). Correspondingly, in tracheal invagination, at least three independent processes have been implicated: EGF-dependent myosin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>), an oriented final cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>), and FGF-mediated migratory forces. Only when all three processes are disrupted, do tracheal cells fail to internalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). However, since no cell divisions occur once the SG has been specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2014</xref>), oriented cell divisions cannot contribute. Similarly, our finding that the non-autonomous functions of <italic>fog</italic> can lead to fully formed external SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) reduces the likelihood that signaling between the SG and neighboring tissues is critical.</p><p>We show at least one additional force contributes to tissue invagination when apical constriction is blocked: the supracellular myosin cable that is under tension and sequentially closes in as SG cells internalize. This circumferential myosin cable forms normally in both <italic>fog</italic> mutant SGs and in Crb-overexpressing SGs, where invagination occurs relatively normally, but fails to form in <italic>fkh</italic> mutant SGs and in Dia-overexpressing SGs, where invagination either fails or is delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings support the idea that tension generated by the myosin cable contributes to and facilitates invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This closing process in the SG is reminiscent of the ‘purse-strings’ observed during wound healing in both flies and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin and Parkhurst, 2004</xref>) and also during <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franke et al., 2005</xref>). It is notable that multiple forces have been suggested to contribute to dorsal closure; dorsal closure fails only when both the forces of apical constriction of amnioserosa cells and of purse strings from surrounding epidermal cells are ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiehart et al., 2000</xref>), although this model of a combinatorial force-component system has been challenged by recent studies showing that the epidermal actin cable tension may not contribute to dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pasakarnis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The difference in invagination defects in Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs (delayed) and <italic>fkh H99</italic> SGs (completely failed), where both apical constriction and the circumferential myosin cable are absent, indicate that additional other forces contribute to SG invagination. We propose that cell rearrangement linked to junctional myosin may also be important. A strong junctional myosin pool is observed throughout SG invagination, with high levels at cell vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Röper, 2012</xref>). We have direct and indirect evidence for cell rearrangement in early WT SGs from live imaging and measurements of cell topology (S. Chung, S. Kim and D.J. Andrew, unpublished data), suggesting that this process is linked to tissue invagination. Since myosin localizes in a broader cortical region in Dia-CA-overexpressing SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it is possible that cell rearrangement of Dia-CA-overexpressing cells is somewhat affected, explaining the delayed invagination and abnormal tissue morphology observed early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and H</xref>). Nonetheless, cell rearrangement must still occur in the Dia-CA overexpressing glands since they form elongated tubes with an approximately WT arrangement of cells at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). The complete failure of invagination in <italic>fkh H99</italic> SGs raises the possibility of failed cell rearrangement. Interestingly, changes in cell topology occur independently of <italic>fkh</italic> function. WT and <italic>fkh H99</italic> mutant SGs show a similar distribution of n-sided cells during early stages of invagination (S. Chung and D.J. Andrew, unpublished data). Consistent with the idea that cortical enrichment of myosin has a role in these topological changes, junctional myosin is intact in <italic>fkh H99</italic> SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In any case, more direct measurements of cell rearrangement in both WT and <italic>fkh</italic> mutants will be necessary to learn how directed cell rearrangement contributes to SG internalization. Overall, our findings suggest that multiple forces are required for SG invagination and that the system is remarkably robust. Importantly, our finding that polarized and fully elongated tubes can form outside the embryo indicates that SG morphogenesis is largely a tissue-autonomous process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p><italic>fkh<sup>6</sup> H99</italic> recombinants (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/DGGR_130500">DGGR_130500</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_1576">BDSC_1576</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>) were used for the analysis of <italic>fkh</italic> mutant SGs. <italic>UAS-Crb</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/DGGR_108289">DGGR_108289</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wodarz et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>UAS-HA-Dia-CA</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_27616">BDSC_27616</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Somogyi and Rørth, 2004</xref>) and UAS-Myr-Wasp-GFP (C-terminal GFP tag added to construct described in FBal0243602) driven by <italic>fkh-Gal4</italic> (FBtp0013253/FBti0027904; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henderson and Andrew, 2000</xref>) were used. <italic>fkh-Gal4</italic> driving <italic>UAS-Tmem-GFP</italic> (Ftp0011013 [aka <italic>UAS-GFP-CAAX</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kakihara et al., 2008</xref>) was used as a control.

Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (Hugo Bellen), and two reviewers. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will notice one reviewer is very positive, while one reviewer is positive, but feels that additional data are required to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I am ambivalent. Can you let me know if you can address the comment: &quot;Given the extensive descriptions in the Roper paper, however, and the limited treatment of the cable in the present paper, a more careful mechanical treatment, including quantification of the cable and cell shapes, couple with biophysical modeling would be required to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let me know if you can and are willing to address this issue, and if so, how. I do not feel that modeling is crucial but the first portion of the comment seems important to me.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The critical role of apical constriction in cell rearrangements from gastrulation onward has been recognized for decades but the mechanisms underlying it have remained more elusive. The last six years have seen a revolution in our thinking about the mechanisms by which apical constriction is driven, based in large part on studies of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> invaginating mesoderm. This has revealed a novel and unexpected role for an apical myosin network created in response to cell-cell signaling and regulated by apical Rok. However, the generality of this model, in particular in invaginating tubular organs, has remained unexamined. Here Chung et al. present a stunning examination of this, using the extremely tractable <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland as a model. In a series of experiments combining sophisticated genetic tools, beautiful imaging and extensive quantitative analysis, they lay out a pathway leading from the transcription factor Fkh through the cell signaling molecule Fog to Rok and myosin. They also find some exceptionally surprising things along the way-most particularly that the system is remarkably robust, such that eliminating apical construction does not block organ invagination. I think these results will be of very broad interested to both cell and developmental biologists.</p><p>I had some questions and suggestions that I think would strengthen the story.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. I found the dual 3D images here very informative, as they give insight into how apical constriction combines with other cell rearrangements. Could the authors add one of an intervening stage as the pit begins to form? Also, would it be possible to create similar images of the <italic>fog</italic>, crb- and Dia-CA expressing embryos?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-G</xref>. I found it intriguing that there seem to be two clusters of invaginating cells, anterior and posterior, only the posterior of which goes into the pit. This might be worth noting.</p><p>Subsection “Blocking apical constriction does not arrest SG invagination”, last paragraph. The authors state that &quot;the significant 'wiggliness' of the AJs suggests a decrease of cortical tension.&quot; I think this is unlikely-in cultured mammalian cells, we and others have found that decreasing cortical tension (e.g., by Rok or myosin inhibition) leads to smoothly rounded cell borders – really wiggly cell borders are likely to reflect actin filaments oriented perpendicular to the membrane.</p><p>Subsection “Blocking apical constriction does not arrest SG invagination”. When during the process of convergent elongation of the organ primordium does Fog expression go off?</p><p>Subsection “Blocking apical constriction does not arrest SG invagination”. In interpreting their Dia-CA experiments the authors might take a look at Homem and Peifer (Development. 2008 Mar;135(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>):1005-18) in which it was observed that Dia-CA increased cortical myosin in the amnioserosa and altered apical constriction.</p><p>The only set of data I found was weak was the attempt to rescue Fog by SG specific Fog re-expression. Given the likelihood that levels and timing were not precisely replicated, I think the speculation about non-autonomous functions was not well supported and I would suggest removing this data.</p><p>Discussion. The authors mention a number of times the incredibly provocative fact that they may have identified a GPCR related to Mist expressed in the SG. This would be very interesting, but the degree of discussion of this unpublished data in the manuscript seemed unwarranted unless they wanted to add this data.</p><p>Subsection “Additional morphogenetic processes take place during SG invagination”, last paragraph. The authors should add the data showing that the tissue level circumferential myosin cable does form in <italic>fog</italic> mutants – this is a key part of their model. More generally, I think a more careful description of the progression of junctional myosin in wildtype and mutants would be beneficial – it appeared, for example, that it was AP planar polarized before the process began.</p><p>The final circuitry diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> is nice but would be better if supplemented with a diagram showing the cell shape changes themselves and how the authors think apical constriction and tissue level constriction work together.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes the cell biology behind the invagination of salivary gland primordia in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. The changes in cell morphology that occur during this process has been published previously, but the present paper incorporates new features (e. g., the pulsatile apical medial myosin networks) that allow comparison to other well characterized morphogenetic movements in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, especially the ventral furrow and posterior midgut. In many respects (e. g., the involvement of RoK and Folded gastrulation) the SC pathway shows a regulation of apical constriction and myosin activity very similar to these other processes.</p><p>Mutations in Fork head disrupt the invagination process, although they allow apparent initial specification of the primordia, given the CrebA marker expression. Some of this has been previously shown, but the authors extend their earlier phenotypic characterizations by blocking the associated apoptosis using the H99 deficiency. Under these conditions, the pulsing medial myosin population observed in the SG of wild type embryos is not observed, nor does Rok-GFP accumulate in the large globular structures observed in the posterior SG of wildtype There is also no Fog expression in mutants, and pattern of apical constriction is randomized. Conclusions based on these phenotypes are difficult, however, given the uncertainty about how normal or unnormal cells blocked in apoptosis are, and where exactly Fork head intervenes in the hierarchy between programming and cell behavior. Fork head's role is more extensive than just apical constriction, given that the mutants apparently fail to form complete actin cables surrounding the primordial (poorly documented, but see below).</p><p>To inhibit all apical constriction, the authors use Crb- or Dia-CA-overexpression. These manipulations are associated with increased apical area (i.e., decreased apical constriction), but surprisingly, even in the most extreme cases, do not block SG invagination. The invaginations are abnormally shaped, however, elongated along the DV axis. The authors attribute these defects to the failure of apical constriction, but overexpression of Crb and Dia may have complex cumulative effects not related to their earlier effects on apical constriction. The most interesting result here, however, as emphasized in the paper's title, is that even in these extreme circumstances, invagination still occurs. The paper would be much stronger if the authors had developed experiments that actually address in a quantitative rigorous way the underlying mechanism that accomplished this invagination.</p><p>One potential mechanism has in fact been proposed earlier by Roper (Developmental Cell 2012) and involves a supracellular myosin cable surrounding the SG primordium. Contraction of this cable could act as a &quot;purse string&quot; that would drive internalization of the primordium. By blocking apical constriction, the present paper provides additional arguments for the importance of this cable. Given the extensive descriptions in the Roper paper, however, and the limited treatment of the cable in the present paper, a more careful mechanical treatment, including quantification of the cable and cell shapes, couple with biophysical modeling would be required to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In the Discussion, the authors mention another mechanism that might also contribute to invagination (myosin accumulation at cell vertices) but these possibilities need to be developed in greater experimental and theoretical detail.</p><p>Overall, I think this paper is a very solid contribution to understanding salivary gland morphogenesis, but does not contain sufficiently new unexpected experimental observations or general concepts. This cannot be improved by simple adding a few additional experiments and in its present form is more suitable to a more specialized journal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22235.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] I had some questions and suggestions that I think would strengthen the story.</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. I found the dual 3D images here very informative, as they give insight into how apical constriction combines with other cell rearrangements. Could the authors add one of an intervening stage as the pit begins to form? Also, would it be possible to create similar images of the fog, crb- and Dia-CA expressing embryos?</italic> </p><p>This was an excellent suggestion.

We have added a comment in the Results on the anterior domain of apical constriction.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Blocking apical constriction does not arrest SG invagination”, last paragraph. The authors state that &quot;the significant 'wiggliness' of the AJs suggests a decrease of cortical tension.&quot; I think this is unlikely-in cultured mammalian cells, we and others have found that decreasing cortical tension (e.g., by Rok or myosin inhibition) leads to smoothly rounded cell borders – really wiggly cell borders are likely to reflect actin filaments oriented perpendicular to the membrane.</italic> </p><p>The paper by Choi et al. (2016), which we now also cite, indicates that increased wiggliness of the AJs in cultured mammalian cells (observed at the level of confocal microscopy of AJ markers as done here) corresponds to a decrease in cortical tension with multiple genetic manipulations, consistent with findings from other groups.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Blocking apical constriction does not arrest SG invagination”.

In interpreting their Dia-CA experiments the authors might take a look at Homem and Peifer (Development. 2008 Mar;135(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>):1005-18) in which it was observed that Dia-CA increased cortical myosin in the amnioserosa and altered apical constriction.</italic> </p><p>We have now included a citation of this paper since similar increases in cortical myosin are observed in both systems, although the consequences are not the same in the two tissues.</p><p><italic>The only set of data I found was weak was the attempt to rescue Fog by SG specific Fog re-expression.

The authors mention a number of times the incredibly provocative fact that they may have identified a GPCR related to Mist expressed in the SG.

The authors should add the data showing that the tissue level circumferential myosin cable does form in fog mutants – this is a key part of their model. More generally, I think a more careful description of the progression of junctional myosin in wildtype and mutants would be beneficial – it appeared, for example, that it was AP planar polarized before the process began.</italic> </p><p>We have now analyzed the tissue level circumferential myosin cable in all of the genotypes used in this study – new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.

These findings are consistent with those of Röper (2012) linking anisotropic Crb distribution to cable formation.</p><p><italic>The final circuitry diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> is nice but would be better if supplemented with a diagram showing the cell shape changes themselves and how the authors think apical constriction and tissue level constriction work together.</italic> </p><p>We have now included such a circuitry diagram in the final panel of the last figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript describes the cell biology behind the invagination of salivary gland primordia in the Drosophila embryo. The changes in cell morphology that occur during this process has been published previously, but the present paper incorporates new features (e. g., the pulsatile apical medial myosin networks) that allow comparison to other well characterized morphogenetic movements in Drosophila, especially the ventral furrow and posterior midgut. In many respects (e. g., the involvement of RoK and Folded gastrulation) the SC pathway shows a regulation of apical constriction and myosin activity very similar to these other processes.</italic> </p><p><italic>Mutations in Fork head disrupt the invagination process, although they allow apparent initial specification of the primordia, given the CrebA marker expression. Some of this has been previously shown, but the authors extend their earlier phenotypic characterizations by blocking the associated apoptosis using the H99 deficiency. Under these conditions, the pulsing medial myosin population observed in the SG of wild type embryos is not observed, nor does Rok-GFP accumulate in the large globular structures observed in the posterior SG of wildtype There is also no Fog expression in mutants, and pattern of apical constriction is randomized. Conclusions based on these phenotypes are difficult, however, given the uncertainty about how normal or unnormal cells blocked in apoptosis are, and where exactly Fork head intervenes in the hierarchy between programming and cell behavior. Fork head's role is more extensive than just apical constriction, given that the mutants apparently fail to form complete actin cables surrounding the primordial (poorly documented, but see below).</italic> </p><p>H99 deficiency SGs develop completely normally. This is now cited in the Results (Myat and Andrew, 2000a).</p><p>We agree that Fkh plays a major role in multiple aspects of SG development and physiology, but, importantly, SGs are specified in <italic>fkh</italic> mutants, based on observing normal SG expression of approximately 40% of known SG genes in <italic>fkh</italic> nulls (from in situ analysis of more than 100 known SG-expressed transcripts, Maruyama et al., 2011).</p><p>The failure to form myosin cables around the SG primordia in <italic>fkh</italic> mutants is now documented (along with an analysis of the myosin cables of all the genotypes analyzed in this paper).</p><p><italic>To inhibit all apical constriction, the authors use Crb- or Dia-CA-overexpression. These manipulations are associated with increased apical area (i.e., decreased apical constriction), but surprisingly, even in the most extreme cases, do not block SG invagination. The invaginations are abnormally shaped, however, elongated along the DV axis. The authors attribute these defects to the failure of apical constriction, but overexpression of Crb and Dia may have complex cumulative effects not related to their earlier effects on apical constriction. The most interesting result here, however, as emphasized in the paper's title, is that even in these extreme circumstances, invagination still occurs.
