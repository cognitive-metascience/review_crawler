For optimal amplification, the outer hair cell-generated force must act on the basilar membrane at an appropriate time at every cycle. However, the temporal relationship between the outer hair cell-driven reticular lamina vibration and the basilar membrane vibration remains unclear. By measuring sub-nanometer vibrations directly from outer hair cells using a custom-built heterodyne low-coherence interferometer, we demonstrate in living gerbil cochleae that the reticular lamina vibration occurs after, not before, the basilar membrane vibration. Both tone- and click-induced responses indicate that the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibrate in opposite directions at the cochlear base and they oscillate in phase near the best-frequency location. Our results suggest that outer hair cells enhance hearing sensitivity through a global hydromechanical mechanism, rather than through a local mechanical feedback as commonly supposed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37625.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>What is the quietest sound the ear can detect? All sounds begin as vibrating air molecules, which enter the ear and cause the eardrum to vibrate. We can detect vibrations that move the eardrum by a distance of less than one picometer. That’s one thousandth of a nanometer, or about 100 times smaller than a hydrogen atom. But how does the ear achieve this level of sensitivity?</p><p>Vibrations of the eardrum cause three small bones within the middle ear to vibrate. The vibrations then spread to the cochlea, a fluid-filled spiral structure in the inner ear. Tiny hair cells lining the cochlea move as a result of the vibrations. There are two types of hair cells: inner and outer. Outer hair cells amplify the vibrations. It is this amplification that enables us to detect such small movements of the eardrum. Inner hair cells then convert the amplified vibrations into electrical signals, which travel via the auditory nerve to the brain.</p><p>The bases of outer hair cells are connected to a structure called the basilar membrane, while their tops are anchored to a structure called the reticular lamina. It was generally assumed that outer hair cells amplify vibrations of the basilar membrane via a local positive feedback mechanism that requires the hair cells to vibrate first. But by comparing the timing of reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibrations in gerbils, He et al. show that this is not the case. Outer hair cells vibrate after the basilar membrane, not before. This indicates that outer hair cells use a mechanism other than commonly assumed local feedback to amplify sounds.</p><p>The results presented by He et al. change our understanding of how the cochlea works, and may help bioengineers to design better hearing aids and cochlea implants.

Therefore, timing of the cochlear feedback has been a central research topic in the field of auditory neuroscience since the cochlear amplifier was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashmore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gold, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gummer et al., 1996</xref>). Because cochlear amplification depends on normal cochlear metabolism and the integrity of cochlear mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cooper and Rhode, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nuttall et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren and Nuttall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rhode, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robles and Ruggero, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruggero and Rich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Heijden and Versteegh, 2015</xref>), the cochlear feedback has to be investigated ultimately in living cochleae. Timing of cochlear feedback was studied in vivo by measuring basilar membrane vibrations at different locations across the width of the basilar membrane in guinea pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nilsen and Russell, 1999</xref>). Based on their observation, the authors suggest that forces generated by the outer hair cells directly drive the region of the basilar membrane beneath the Deiters' cells. The temporal relationship between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration was previously observed in guinea pigs using a time-domain optical coherence tomography system as a homodyne interferometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). It was reported that the phase of the reticular lamina vibration led the phase of the basilar membrane vibration at the best frequency (Figure 5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). This phase lead has been thought to ensure the right timing of the outer hair cell force for cochlear amplification. However, the mouse micromechanical data measured using a heterodyne low-coherence interferometer showed no significant phase difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration at the best frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2016b</xref>). This discrepancy may have been caused by the animal species and technical differences, that is mouse versus guinea pig and homodyne interferometry versus heterodyne interferometry. Although a number of studies have been conducted recently to measure micromechanical responses in living cochleae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramamoorthy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Recio-Spinoso and Oghalai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>) the timing of the cochlear feedback remains unclear. Since the apical end of outer hair cells is directly connected to the reticular lamina, the reticular lamina vibration can reflect the movement of the outer hair cell under physiological conditions. Therefore, the timing of the cochlear feedback was determined in this study by measuring the latency difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration using a custom-built heterodyne low-coherence interferometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong and Freeman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ren et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2016b</xref>). The present data collected from the gerbil, one of the most commonly used animals for auditory research, demonstrate for the first time that the reticular lamina vibrates after, not before, the basilar membrane vibration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibrations in sensitive gerbil cochleae</title><p>A representative data set from one of twenty-three sensitive cochleae is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The displacement of the reticular lamina response to 30 dB SPL tones (0 dB SPL = 20 µPa) increased and then decreased with frequency, forming a sharp peak at ~26 kHz (best frequency, BF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While displacements increased proportionally with sound level at frequencies &lt; 15 kHz, they increased at a much smaller rate near the best frequency. The response peak became broader and shifted toward low frequencies as the sound level increased. In contrast to sharp tuning at 30 dB SPL, the displacement curve at 80 dB SPL showed no response peak. Displacements of the basilar membrane at 30 and 40 dB SPL were ~10 fold smaller than those of the reticular lamina not only near the best frequency but also at lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Basilar membrane response also reached the maximum at ~26 kHz as did the reticular lamina. For ~333 fold sound level increase from 30 to 80 dB SPL, the displacement of the basilar membrane at ~26 kHz increased by ~23 fold compared with only ~3.3 fold increase of the reticular lamina displacement at the same frequency. These differences were confirmed by the displacement ratios of the reticular lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and basilar membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) vibration to the stapes vibration. The reticular lamina showed ~40 dB nonlinear compression near the best frequency, which is ~17 dB greater than that of the basilar membrane (~23 dB). Phase responses of the reticular lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) are similar to those of the basilar membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) except for a slightly steeper phase slope at frequencies &lt; 15 kHz.

Although the basilar membrane vibration at frequencies &lt; 20 kHz did not decrease significantly, the reticular lamina vibration decreased by &gt;10 fold over the same frequency range. This is unexpected since cochlear amplification has been believed to be effective only near the best frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robles and Ruggero, 2001</xref>). The overlapping blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and the equally separated blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> indicate linear growth for postmortem responses.

The displacement ratio of the reticular lamina to basilar membrane vibration decreased dramatically at all frequencies (compare blue to red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The frequency-dependent phase lead (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) was absent under postmortem conditions (blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, postmortem data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> demonstrate that the magnitude and phase differences between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration depend on normal cochlear metabolism. While the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration in the gerbil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are qualitatively similar to those in the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2016b</xref>), there are the following quantitatively differences. Although the measurements were taken from similar longitudinal locations in the basal turn of the cochlea in both species, the best frequencies of the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration in the gerbil are significantly lower than those in the mouse.

For statistical analysis, frequency axes were normalized to the best frequency for each animal. The displacement ratio of the reticular lamina vibration to the basilar membrane vibration was the largest at the low-frequency end and decreased with frequency reaching the lowest level near the best frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C,E,G</xref>). The averaged phase data show that the reticular lamina phase led the basilar membrane phase by &gt;135 degrees at low frequencies. This phase lead decreased with frequency and approached zero near the best frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D,F,H</xref>).

Consequently, the latency differences derived from the slope of the phase difference curves show no significant change across stimulus levels (ANOVA test: F = 0.037, p=0.990). This allows us to calculate the latency difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration across animals and sound levels. The grouped data from seven gerbils at four different sound levels demonstrate that the latency of the reticular lamina vibration is ~17.9 µs greater than that of the basilar membrane (17.9 ± 0.6 µs, n = 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

In the sensitive living cochlea, a 10-µs rarefaction click caused a large displacement of the reticular lamina toward the scala tympani indicated by the first negative peak (red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) at ~0.40 ms, while the basilar membrane moved toward the scala vestibuli (indicated by the first positive peak of blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to the opposite directions, the peak magnitude of the reticular lamina displacement is ~eight fold larger than that of the basilar membrane vibration, which increased proportionally with the sound level. Following the initial opposite movements, both the reticular lamina and basilar membrane oscillated periodically and the vibration magnitudes decreased gradually approaching to their equilibrium positions. To clearly show the temporal relationship, the displacements of the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration at 90 dB-p (0 dB-p = 20 µPa of peak sound pressure) were plotted as a function of time with different magnitude scales in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Since the initial peaks indicate the maximum displacements of the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration, which effectively stimulate the cochlea, the initial peak times <italic>T<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>B</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) are used to present the latencies of the basilar membrane and reticular lamina response respectively, and the latency difference was determined by <italic>T<sub>B</sub>-T<sub>A</sub></italic>. Latency difference measured at 90 dB-p in ten sensitive cochleae (32.6 ± 1.5 µs, n = 10) demonstrates that the outer hair cell-driven reticular lamina vibration occurs after the basilar membrane vibration. This latency difference is greater than that derived from the phase data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, likely due to the stimulus difference, that is tone verse click. Despite their initial opposite movements, the reticular lamina and basilar membrane moved synchronously in the same direction at ~0.51 ms (<italic>T<sub>C</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), because the phase change of the reticular lamina vibration with time is slower than that of the basilar membrane. Similarly, the first period of the reticular lamina (<italic>T<sub>RL</sub></italic>) is greater than that of the basilar membrane (<italic>T<sub>BM</sub></italic>) (the low panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) indicating that the starting frequency of the reticular lamina is lower than that of the basilar membrane vibration. The magnitude of the reticular lamina vibration decreased dramatically under postmortem conditions and became comparable to that of the basilar membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). Moreover, the direction of the first peak of the reticular lamina displacement changed from negative to positive, that is from toward the scala tympani to toward the scala vestibuli, which became consistent with the direction of the basilar membrane vibration. These changes indicate that the reticular lamina moves passively following the basilar membrane vibration under postmortem conditions. The data at sound levels below 70 dB SPL were not shown because the initial peak of the basilar membrane vibration was too small to be reliably detected. Thus, the time-domain data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> confirm that the reticular lamina vibrates after, not before, the basilar membrane vibration.

This result is consistent with the mouse data measured using heterodyne interferometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2016b</xref>) but inconsistent with the guinea pig data, which showed that the phase of the reticular lamina vibration leads the phase of the basilar membrane vibration by ~90° at the best frequency and the phase lead decreases with sound pressure level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).

When the basilar membrane moves upward to the scala vestibuli near the cochlear base (red arrow at 0.8 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), depolarized outer hair cells shorten and induce a large downward reticular lamina displacement (green arrow at 0.8 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). While this movement creates a positive fluid pressure between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane at the cochlear base (0.7–1.2 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>), the reticular lamina at locations ~ 1.2–1.8 mm, however, moves upward (green arrows near 1.6 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), resulting in a negative fluid pressure inside the cochlear partition. This pressure gradient from the base to an apical location likely results in fluid movement in the apical direction inside the cochlear partition (blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>) as demonstrated in vitro by electrically stimulating the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karavitaki and Mountain, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zagadou and Mountain, 2012</xref>). Since the organ of Corti sits on the basilar membrane, the longitudinal fluid movement can travel forward to the best-frequency location as a result of the basilar membrane traveling wave. Thus, a large population of outer hair cells from a broad cochlear area can change the fluid space between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane at the best frequency location on a cycle-by-cycle basis, consequently enhancing the reticular lamina vibration. In addition, in-phase vibrations of the reticular lamina and basilar membrane result in constructive interference near the best-frequency location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F,G</xref>), which further enhances reticular lamina vibration at the apical end of outer hair cells. The magnitude of the resulting constructive interference decreases as phase differences move into destructive interference regimes at frequencies below and above the best frequency. While this frequency dependent interference may consequently enhance the tuning of the reticular lamina vibration, its effects probably is relatively small due to the large magnitude difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration. The interaction between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane at low frequencies may also be involved in two-tone suppression of the auditory nerve or basilar membrane response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delgutte, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruggero et al., 1992</xref>). It has been shown that the proposed global hydromechanical mechansm is consistent with the observation that auditory nerve activities can be suppressed by stimulating medial olivocochlear efferents or by a low-frequency bias tone not only at the best frequency but also at tail (low) frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nam and Guinan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stankovic and Guinan, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Since the stereocilia bundles of both the inner and outer hair cells are anchored in the hair cell cuticular plates which make up a portion of the reticular lamina, the outer hair cell-driven reticular lamina vibration likely results in fluid movement in the subtectorial space and consequently stimulates inner hair cells. It has been shown in vitro that electrical stimulation of outer hair cells of guinea pig cochleae resulted in a counterphasic motion of the tectorial membrane and inner hair cells at frequencies below 3 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nowotny and Gummer, 2006</xref>). This result was believed to indicate direct fluid coupling between outer hair cells and inner hair cells through a pulsatile fluid motion. It has also been demonstrated in vitro that outer hair cell stereocilia not only move sideways but also change length in response to sound stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hakizimana et al., 2012</xref>). The large bundle deflection was observed when the length change was small, indicating that hair cells are maximally stimulated when the stereocilia length change is minimal. Considering the firm connection of the tallest stereocilia to the tectorial membrane, the stereocilia length change also suggests the interaction between the reticular lamina vibration and the tectorial membrane vibration. Thus, outer hair cells may also play a role in the traveling wave on the tectorial membrane, which has been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghaffari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghaffari et al., 2010</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong and Cooper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Recio-Spinoso and Oghalai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rhode and Cooper, 1996</xref>). The interaction between the reticular lamina and tectorial membrane vibration may enhance the stimulus to the inner hair cells and boost hearing sensitivity. Specific mechanisms on how the outer hair cell-driven reticular lamina vibration stimulates inner hair cells, however, remain to be determined experimentally until in vivo micromechanical measurements with cellular spatial resolution become available.</p><p>The observed additional delay of the reticular lamina vibration was likely caused by mechanoelectrical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corey and Hudspeth, 1979</xref>) and electromechanical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brownell et al., 1985</xref>) transduction of outer hair cells and mechanical coupling inside the cochlear partition. Although delays for prestin-associated currents in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Santos-Sacchi and Tan, 2018</xref>) are longer than the latency difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration in vivo, they vary with the membrane voltage of outer hair cells. Voltage excitation away from the resting membrane potential has been shown to have a faster response. Moreover, the depolarized resting potential can minimize the outer hair cell time constant and expanding the bandwidth of the membrane filter by activating voltage-dependent K + conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). Mechanical loads on the outer hair cells, such as in vivo condition, could further improve the cell's frequency response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwasa, 2017</xref>). Since Deiters' cells are located between the outer hair cells and the basilar membrane, the acoustical and cellular forces to and from the outer hair cells have to be transmitted through Deiters' cells. The soft Deiter's cell soma likely induces delays, which can contribute to the delay difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration. This apparently is supported by the postmortem magnitude and phase difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When the outer hair cell-generated force is absent under postmortem conditions, the reticular lamina should move passively following the basilar membrane travelling wave with equal magnitude and phase, if the connection between the two structures is rigid. The larger postmortem magnitude and phase difference in gerbils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) than those in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2016b</xref>) indicate that the mechanical coupling between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane in the gerbil may not be as tight as that in the mouse.</p><p>Compared to a large time period (<italic>T</italic>) at a low frequency (<italic>f</italic>) (<italic>T = 1/f</italic>) (such as <italic>T</italic> = 2,000 µs, where <italic>f</italic> = 500 Hz), a 17.9-µs latency difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) is negligible and results in an insignificant phase difference. Thus, the ~180 degree phase difference between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibration at a low frequency mainly reflects the opposite movements of both ends of outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brownell et al., 1985</xref>). The same latency difference, however, can result in ~180 degree phase difference at the best frequency, due to the small period (such as <italic>T</italic> = 38 µs, where <italic>f</italic> = 26 kHz). This latency-induced phase lag of the reticular lamina vibration, compensating for the ~180 degree phase difference observed at low frequencies, accounts for in-phase vibrations of the reticular lamina and basilar membrane at the best frequency. Therefore, the present in vivo results do not conflict with the in vitro observation that both ends of the cylindrical outer hair cells move in opposite directions at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brownell et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Santos-Sacchi, 1989</xref>).</p><p>In summary, heterodyne low-coherence interferometry demonstrates in vivo that the outer hair cell-driven reticular lamina vibration occurs after, not before, the basilar membrane vibration. The reticular lamina and basilar membrane move in opposite directions at low frequencies and in phase near the best frequency. This experimental finding conflicts with commonly accepted cochlear local feedback theory and suggests that outer hair cells enhance hearing sensitivity through a global hydromechanical mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Twenty-three young healthy Mongolian gerbils of both sexes at age of 4 to 8 weeks (40–80 g) were used in this study.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Heterodyne low-coherence interferometer</title><p>A scanning low-coherence heterodyne interferometer was built based on a scanning laser heterodyne interferometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ren et al., 2011</xref>) by replacing the helium-neon laser with a modified superluminescent diode with related optical and electronic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ren et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2016b</xref>).

Because the first displacement peak of the time waveform indicates the arriving time of the maximum stimulation to the reticular lamina and the basilar membrane, <italic>Δτ</italic> was determined by the time difference between the first peak of the reticular lamina (<italic>T<sub>B</sub></italic>) and that of the basilar membrane (<italic>T<sub>A</sub></italic>), (<italic>Δτ</italic> = <italic>T<sub>B</sub></italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>T<sub>A</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The longitudinal patterns of the reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibrations were presented by plotting displacement and phase as a function of the longitudinal location. The longitudinal location was derived from the stimulus frequency according to the frequency-location function in gerbil cochleae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Müller, 1996</xref>). The grouped results were presented by mean and standard error calculated across animals. Sound level-dependent latency changes were tested at 50, 60, 70, and 80 dB SPL using one-way ANOVA and p&lt;0.05 was considered significantly different.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John V Brigande for critical comments on the manuscript, Alfred L Nuttall and other colleagues at Oregon Hearing Research Center for helpful discussion of the data, Edward Porsov for engineering support, and Santos-Sacchi and William Brownell for their helpful guidance in revising this paper.

Hearing scientists have studied basilar membrane mechanics for more than 70 years and recently, with advances in optical tools, the mechanics of the reticular lamina, which forms the upper surface of the organ of Corti. Previous studies established that outer hair cell electromotility causes these two structures to move in opposite directions and that reticular laminar deflections are an order of magnitude greater than those of the basilar membrane. Using laser interferometry, the authors observed a phase difference between the motion of these two structures at different sound frequencies and inferred from this that the reticular lamina lags the basilar membrane vibration by 20-30 microseconds. A similar delay between the two parts of the organ of Corti was observed by stimulating the cochlea with broad-band clicks. Although comparable phase behavior has previously been reported by the authors in mice, the present study extends the phase analysis to the time domain and reveals the reticular lamina responds between 20-30 microseconds after the basilar membrane. This finding has negative implications for the notion that outer hair cells amplify the response of the basilar membrane by providing local, cycle-by-cycle feedback, and, together, the two studies highlight the possibility that the degree of coupling between outer hair cells and surrounding structures may be critical in determining the mechanical response of the cochlea. The reviewers stated that the data are robust and that this is a significant finding but felt that a more explicit discussion of the insights provided by this work into the nature of cochlear mechanics is needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The current Discussion section addresses the consequences of the phase difference between the reticular lamina and the basilar membrane at low frequencies for longitudinal fluid movement. This has been covered before in the authors' previous paper in which mice were used and should be largely removed. They should instead focus on the implications of the current results for the nature of the mechanical interactions that take place within the cochlea. In doing so, the reviewers recommended the following factors that should be considered.</p><p>1) The present study proposes a &quot;global hydromechanical&quot; mechanism to account for the reticular lamina response delay and broadening of its frequency response. The authors' 2016 paper introduced the mechanism. It posits that outer hair cell length changes result in local changes in the volume of fluid-filled spaces between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane. Fluid movement into or away from the region of interest will introduce delays in the response of the reticular lamina. The mechanism is plausible, particularly for the response to intense stimuli. However, additional hydrodynamic and viscous damping effects may be associated with other structures in the cochlear partition. The manuscript should include a brief discussion of these mechanisms. The stereocilia bundle of both the inner and outer hair cells is anchored in the hair cell cuticular plate that makes up a portion of the reticular lamina. The tallest row of OHC stereocilia are firmly connected to the tectorial membrane. The stereocilia bundle has been shown to undergo length changes in vitro and fluid movement in the subtectorial space has long been postulated to mechanically stimulate inner hair cells. This movement will augment the forces acting on the reticular lamina. In addition, in vitro and in vivo vibrations of the tectorial membrane result in longitudinal and radial traveling wave behavior. Thus, tectorial membrane dynamics may further augment those arising from the mechanism proposed by the authors.</p><p>2) Both the basilar membrane and reticular lamina move in phase near the best frequency. The magnitude of the resulting constructive interference decreases as phase differences move into destructive interference regimes at higher and lower frequencies. The low frequency region may be associated with two-tone suppression regions observed in the response area of single auditory neurons. The implications of this should be discussed briefly.</p><p>3) Further discussion is needed of potential species differences in mechanical coupling within the cochlea and whether the phase data might reflect coupling between the basilar membrane and reticular lamina via the soft Deiters' cell soma.</p><p>At what frequency were the measurements shown in Figure 6? Why is there no phase difference between the basilar membrane and the reticular lamina? It would also be helpful to know which colors correspond to which SPLs.</p><p>Because in vitro and in vivo electrical stimulation experiments have shown that outer hair cells can induce basilar membrane motion, is there an intrinsic error is assuming that the difference between basilar membrane and reticular laminar movements exactly defines outer hair cell contributions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37625.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The current Discussion section addresses the consequences of the phase difference between the reticular lamina and the basilar membrane at low frequencies for longitudinal fluid movement.

[…] The larger postmortem magnitude and phase difference in gerbils (Figure 2) than those in mice (Figure 2G and H, Ren et al., 2016b) indicate that the mechanical coupling between the reticular lamina and basilar membrane in the gerbil may not be as tight as that in the mouse.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At what frequency were the measurements shown in Figure 6?

This information has been included in the text (subsection “Measurement of reticular lamina and basilar membrane vibrations”) and the legend of Figure 6. The reason for no phase difference between the basilar membrane and reticular lamina is that the vibrations were measured at the best frequency. This is consistent with the data shown in Figures 1H and 3J. Line legend has been included in Figure 6D to show responses at different sound pressure levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because in vitro and in vivo electrical stimulation experiments have shown that outer hair cells can induce basilar membrane motion, is there an intrinsic error is assuming that the difference between basilar membrane and reticular laminar movements exactly defines outer hair cell contributions?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that outer hair cells can induce basilar membrane motion in vitro and in vivo. This, however, may not necessarily conflict with the assumption that the outer hair cell contributions can be estimated by the difference between the basilar membrane and reticular lamina vibration, because the two structures move at different times due to the latency difference. We are aware of the limitation of our method for estimating the outer hair cell contribution due to the lack of information on mechanical properties of Deiters' cells. Our statement has been softened by changing &quot;obtained&quot; into &quot;estimated&quot; in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
