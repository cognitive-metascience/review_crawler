mortality. We generated an autochthonous transgenic mouse model whereby conditional expression of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> enables hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to metastasize in &gt;90% of mice. <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> cooperate and their sustained expression is required to elicit a transcriptional program associated with the activation of innate immunity, through secretion of a cytokinome that elicits recruitment and polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Systemic treatment with Ccl2 and Il13 induced <italic>MYC</italic>-HCCs to metastasize; whereas, blockade of Ccl2 and Il13 abrogated <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC metastasis. Further, in 33 human cancers (n = 9502) <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> predict poor survival (p=4.3×10<sup>−10</sup>), CCL2/IL13 expression (p&lt;10<sup>−109</sup>) and TAM infiltration (p&lt;10<sup>−96</sup>). Finally, in the plasma of patients with HCC (n = 25) but not cirrhosis (n = 10), CCL2 and IL13 were increased and IL13 predicted invasive tumors. Therefore, <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> generally appear to cooperate in human cancer to elicit a cytokinome that enables metastasis through crosstalk between cancer and immune microenvironment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer develops when cells in the body gain mutations that allow them to grow and divide rapidly and uncontrollably. As the disease progresses these cancer cells develop the ability to spread around the body. This process of spreading, called metastasis, is responsible for most cancer-related deaths in humans, but no current treatments target it.</p><p>Mutations that increase the levels of two proteins known as MYC and TWIST1 in cells cause many human cancers. In healthy adult cells, normal levels of MYC and TWIST1 act as key regulators that switch thousands of genes on or off. TWIST1 is known to control the movement and spread of cells in the embryo. However, it is not known how MYC and TWIST1 work together to promote the metastasis of cancer cells.</p><p>To address this question, Dhanasekaran, Baylot et al. used mice to investigate the roles of MYC and TWIST1 in the metastasis of cancer cells. The experiments showed that these two proteins work together to reprogram mouse cancer cells to release signal molecules known as cytokines. These molecules convert immune cells known as macrophages to a tumor-friendly state that allows cancers cells to spread around the body. Inhibiting two cytokines known as CCL2 and IL13 prevented the cancer cells from moving.</p><p>Further experiments analyzed tumor samples from around 10,000 human patients with 33 different cancers. This revealed that patients that had higher levels of MYC and TWIST1 proteins in their tumors also had increased levels of CCL2 and IL13, more activated macrophages and were less likely to recover from their cancer.</p><p>The findings of Dhanasekaran, Baylot et al. suggest that MYC and TWIST1 may instigate metastasis in many human cancers, and therapies targeting specific cytokines may prevent these cancers from spreading around the body. Furthermore, screening blood for the levels of cytokines may help to identify the cancer patients who would benefit from such therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>liver cancer</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd><kwd>Twist1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA208735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Felsher</surname><given-names>Dean W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA222676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhanasekaran</surname><given-names>Renumathy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA166348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Phuoc T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01CA212007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Phuoc T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01CA231776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Phuoc T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21CA223403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Phuoc T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baylot</surname><given-names>Virginie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007827</institution-id><institution>American College of Gastroenterology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACG Career Development Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhanasekaran</surname><given-names>Renumathy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> drive metastasis by a novel non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanism of eliciting a cytokinome that mediates the crosstalk between cancer cells and macrophages, and its therapeutic blockade inhibits metastasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumorigenesis is caused by specific oncogenes but tumor progression often involves the acquisition of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Metastasis occur when tumor cells gain the ability to invade, migrate and colonize distant sites, and this accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mehlen and Puisieux, 2006</xref>). Many studies have examined human clinical specimens and/or tumor-derived cell lines to discern mechanisms of metastasis, and identified the role of specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ji et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) and also the role of the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fidler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalluri, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Whitfield and Soucek, 2012</xref>). However, to date, there are very few mouse models that exhibit spontaneous metastasis, and even fewer in vivo models where the stepwise progression from a non-metastatic to metastatic cancer can be studied. Such a model would provide a tractable approach for studying specific mechanisms of metastasis, particularly the role of the immune microenvironment. Innate immune cells, especially tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), are known to contribute to metastasis through multiple mechanisms including effects on angiogenesis, production of specific cytokines, suppression of the immune system, and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qian and Pollard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wan et al., 2014</xref>). The specific discrete events in the cancer cell that modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and enable metastasis are not clear.</p><p>The <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene is a transcription factor that is one of the most commonly activated oncogenes in the pathogenesis of many types of human cancer including HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schaub et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gabay et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, we used the Tet System to generate a conditional transgenic mouse model for <italic>MYC</italic>-induced HCC that we and others have used to study mechanisms of oncogene addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Settleman, 2012</xref>) and identify potential therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dhanasekaran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kapanadze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shachaf et al., 2004</xref>). But murine <italic>MYC</italic>-driven HCC do not metastasize. <italic>Twist1</italic> is a transcription factor that is important during embryogenesis for normal cellular migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thisse et al., 1987</xref>). <italic>Twist1</italic> has been shown to be an important gene product that can enable mouse and human tumor cell lines to acquire the ability to metastasize associated with EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Here we used the Tet System to conditionally express <italic>Twist1</italic> in combination with <italic>MYC</italic> to show that their co-expression leads to widely metastatic and invasive HCC.</p><p>We use this powerful in vivo model to uncover a surprising mechanism by which <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> drive metastasis. Cancer cell-intrinsic properties like proliferation, apoptosis or invasiveness were not different between the non-metastatic <italic>MYC</italic>-HCC and the metastatic <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC. Instead, metastatic progression was dependent on the ability of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> to dramatically reprogram the tumor innate immune microenvironment. Together, <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> induce the cancer cell to secrete cytokines like Ccl2 and Il13 that lead to recruitment and polarization of macrophages respectively, thus causing metastasis.

Moreover, in 33 different human cancers, expression of both <italic>MYC</italic> and TWIST1 predict survival, expression of CCL2/IL13 and M2-like TAM infiltration. In a prospective clinical analysis, human patients with HCC but not cirrhosis had increased plasma levels of CCL2 and IL13 that was associated with invasive and multifocal disease.

Our models enabled us to interrogate tumor and host interactions during malignant progression in an immunocompetent host. Through the Tet system, we were able to elicit inducible combined <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> expression restricted to the hepatocytes. In our model, greater than 90% of the mice predictably developing extrahepatic metastasis. This allowed us to directly compare the non-metastatic <italic>MYC</italic>-HCC and the metastatic <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC, to identify specific mechanisms of metastasis. We believe our model will serve as a useful system for developing new therapies that block cancer metastasis.</p><p>Our work is the first to suggest that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> generally cooperate to drive metastasis. By analyzing ChIP-seq data, we found <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> bind to both the promoters of human and mouse <italic>Ccl2</italic> and <italic>Il13</italic> genes. Our results are consistent with a recent report that <italic>Twist1</italic> promotes the invasion of <italic>MYCN</italic> to enhancer sites thus potentiating its pro-proliferative function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeid et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> may contribute to metastasis through a transcriptional mechanism of inducing a cytokinome that activates macrophages. We note that our observations are consistent with a multitude of reports that innate immunity contributes to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pollard, 2004</xref>) and <italic>Twist1</italic> contributes to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). However, our work is the first to suggest that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> together affect transcription in a manner that modulates innate immunity, thereby driving metastasis.</p><p>We propose as a possible general explanation for our findings that overexpression of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> in a tumor is activating an embryonic program of innate immune cell activation and cellular invasion. <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> have been reported to cooperate during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellmeyer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodrigues et al., 2008</xref>). The two transcription factors also have been shown to transcriptionally modulate inflammation during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hurlin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodrigues et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spicer et al., 1996</xref>). These microenvironment changes are required to enable mesodermal cells to migrate to their destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Šošić et al., 2003</xref>). Both <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> are overexpressed in multiple human cancers, suggesting there is a common embryonic transcriptional program they regulate in the embryonic microenvironment which is hijacked by cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hendrix et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, <italic>MYC</italic> and TWIST1 overexpression in cancer may be eliciting tumor invasion by activating embryonic programs that otherwise physiologically enable mesodermal migration.</p><p>We identified that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> generally elicit a cytokinome that includes Ccl2 and Il13 that we show are necessary and sufficient to drive metastasis. Our work is consistent with a prior report that <italic>Twist1</italic> transcriptionally induces Ccl2 in breast cancer cell lines that leads to macrophage recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Low-Marchelli et al., 2013</xref>). However, our study further demonstrates Ccl2 induced macrophage recruitment alone was not sufficient to cause metastasis in vivo and Il13 induced macrophage polarization plays an essential and complementary role in promoting angiogenesis and metastasis. Further, our results suggest that Ccl2 and Il13 alone can enable a non-metastatic cancer to become metastatic, cell non-autonomously. In this regard, it is notable that there are anecdotal reports suggesting that metastasis can occur during circumstances that would promote inflammation such as surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tohme et al., 2017</xref>) or during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith and Kang, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our findings have general relevance to human cancer. First, in 9502 patients with 33 different types of human cancer, the subset of tumors with <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>TWIST1</italic> predicts poor survival, CCL2/IL13 expression and TAM infiltration. Second, in human patients with HCC, we found that CCL2, and IL13, were elevated in the plasma of patients with HCC and IL13 levels predicted invasive and aggressive HCC. Stratifying patients based on cytokine expression may help direct therapy. Third, the combined inhibition of CCL2 and IL13 profoundly impeded metastasis in our in vivo experimental model of liver cancer. Inhibition of CCL2 alone has not been effective in clinical trials for solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pienta et al., 2013</xref>). We suggest that personalized therapy that combines the inhibition of CCL2 and IL13 is more likely to be effective.</p><p>Our work identifies two transcription factors, <italic>MYC</italic> and TWIST1, are key drivers of metastasis.

Founders were screened by genotyping using PCR. Founders were mated to LAP-tTA mice, and BLI was used to additionally screen for functional <italic>Twist1-tetO7-luc</italic> founders, subsequently termed LAP-tTA/TRE-<italic>Twist1</italic>/Luc. The LAP<italic>-tTA</italic>, <italic>and TetO-MYC</italic> transgenic lines have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Felsher and Bishop, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kistner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shachaf et al., 2004</xref>). LAP-tTA/TRE-<italic>Twist1</italic>/Luc mice were mated to LAP-tTA/TRE-<italic>MYC</italic> mice, and progeny were screened by PCR. The final background of the mouse was FVB/N. Doxycycline (Dox- Sigma) was administered in the drinking water weekly at 0.1 mg/mL during mating and continuing until mice reached 6 weeks of age. Animals were euthanized upon disease morbidity as assessed by tumor burden. Macrometastases were assessed upon necropsy and tissues were collected and stored for further analysis. All procedures were performed in accordance with APLAC protocols and animals were housed in a pathogen-free environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Small animal imaging</title><p>in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was utilized to confirm oncogene activation in transgenic mice beginning one week before, and continuing each week following, Dox removal. BLI was performed on an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). Briefly, mice were injected i.p. with the substrate D-Luciferin (150 mg/kg) and then anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane delivered by the Xenogen XGI-8 5-port Gas Anesthesia System. Animals were then placed into the IVIS Spectrum, and Living Image Software was used to collect, archive, and analyze photon fluxes and transform them into pseudocolor images.</p><p>MRI scans were performed using a 7T small animal MRI scanner (Bruker Inc, Billerica, MA, Stanford Small Animal Imaging Facility, CA) equipped with a 40 mm Millipede RF coil (ExtendMR LLC, Milpitas, CA). Under anesthesia by inhalation of 1–3% isoflurane mixed in with medical-grade oxygen <italic>via</italic> nose-cone, and acquisitions were gated using the respiratory triggering. For tumor detection, a respiration triggered T2-weighted 3D turbo spin echo sequence was used (TR/TE 3000/205 ms, voxel size (0.22 mm<sup>3</sup>). The isotropic voxel size of 0.22 mm in all directions provides a high in plane and across plane resolution. Thereby, the location of one tumor could be defined in all three orientations using specific landmarks, such as major vessels or other tumors. T2-weighted anatomical imaging was performed approximately once weekly. Anatomical and parametric images were analyzed and tumor volumes were measured using Osirix image processing software (Osirix, UCLA, and Los Angeles, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Conditional HCC cell lines were derived from LAP-tTA and TetO-<italic>MYC</italic> or -<italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic> mice.

Genes expression level is quantified by a software package called RSEM. We counted the number of identified expressed genes and calculated its proportion to total gene number in database for each sample RNA sequencing data are deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). DEseq software was used to perform differential expression analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) was used to perform functional pathway analysis.</p><p>Principal-component analysis (PCA; Qlucore Omics Explorer v. 2.2) was used to generate a visually interpretable overview of the transcriptional profile of <italic>MYC</italic>-HCC and <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic> HCC. Qlucore Omics Explorer was used to structure data to verify if tumor subgroups could be identified. Variance filtering was used to reduce the noise, and the projection score to set the filtering threshold. The ‘mean = 0, var = 1’ setting was used to scale the data. PCA was used to visualize the data set in a three-dimensional space, after filtering out variables with low overall variance to reduce the impact of noise, and centering and scaling the remaining variables to zero mean and unit variance. The projection score was used to determine the optimal filtering threshold, retaining N variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Soneson and Fontes, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo treatment mouse models</title><p>For antibody treatment, mice were injected i.p. with isotype control IgG or anti-Ccl2 (BioXcell), -Il13 and –Il4 (Genentech) antibody (10 mg/kg body weight three times per week). For recombinant cytokines treatment, mice were injected i.p. three times per week with PBS or Ccl2 (Peprotech, 500 ng/mouse), Il4 and IL4 (Peprotech, 250 ng/mouse). For clodronate liposomes (CL) treatment, CL or control liposomes were administered i.p. at 6.5 μl/g body weight 3 times per week to NSGs mice. CL and control treatments were administered to NSG mice previously injected i.v. with 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>MYC</italic>/Twist1-HCC cells or orthotopically transplanted with <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC tumors.

Epitope unmasking was performed by steaming in DAKO antigen retrieval solution for 45 min. Paraffin embedded sections were immunostained with <italic>MYC</italic> (1:150, Epitomics), or cleaved caspase 3 (1:100, Cell Signaling technology), phospho histone 3 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), F4/80 (1:50, ThermoFisher), Cd4 (1:1000, Abcam), Neutrophil (1:100, Abcam), overnight at 4°C. The tissue was washed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit, anti-rat or anti-mouse for 30 min at room temperature (1:300 Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Labs). Sections were developed using 3,3'- Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Labs), counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with Permount. Images were obtained on a Philips Ultrafast Scanner. All IF and IHC experiments were conducted using at least three biological replicates per group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of IHC staining analysis</title><p>Images are analyzed in Icy (BioImage Analysis Unit, Paris, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.com">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.com</ext-link>). Areas of immunopositivity are selected for positive values in the Color Picker threshold tool in the support vector machine (SVM) tab. Unstained nuclei and cytoplasm areas are chosen for negative values. Default values are used for the kernel. Immunopositive areas are selected as regions of interest (ROIs). Subsequently, ROIs are separated. Those with interior size &lt;68 pixels are eliminated from the ROI table as they correspond to small specks of non-specific immunopositivity, whereas larger areas corresponded closely to distinct positive cells. Counts were obtained from the ROI tables.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Wound healing assay</title><p>1 × 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>MYC</italic>- or <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC cells per well were seeded in 6-well plate and cultured overnight in culture medium. Thereafter, a scratch (wound) was introduced in the confluent cell layer using a yellow tip. Cells were washed three times to remove detached cells. Cells were then incubated with supernatant of primary macrophages harvested from <italic>MYC</italic>- or <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC primary tumors for 24 hr. Pictures of a defined wound spot were made with a Leica DM16000 microscope at t = 0, 24, 48 and 72 hr. The area of the wound in the microscopic pictures was measured using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, MD). The percentage wound healing after 72 hr was calculated in relative to the total wound area at t = 0 hr of the same wound spot. To isolate tumor associated macrophages from liver tumors, we first cut the tumor into small pieces, digested with collagenase and incubated in a culture dish at 37°C for 1–2 hr. We removed and discarded all detached cells and/or dead cells at 2 hr. Next, we maintained the remaining cells in culture for 24 hr and then removed any adherent tumor cells by fast trypsinization. Macrophages are highly adherent and are the main population that remains adherent beyond this step. We harvested the macrophages and confirmed their phenotype and polarization states by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transwell chamber migration assay</title><p>Cell migration was assessed using a 12 well transwell chamber with 8 μm filter inserts (Corning). Raw macrophages (264.7 macrophage cell line (ATCC)) were seeded in the upper chamber and <italic>MYC</italic>/<italic>Twist1</italic> cells were seeded in the lower chamber. Neutralizing antibody to Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl7, Cxcl1, Il13 or Il4 were added to the lower chamber in triplicates. After 16 hr the migrated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 100% methanol. The non-migrated cells were gently removed with a swab. Cells in the lower surface of the membrane were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 mins. The membranes were imaged and number of macrophages in 10 random fields were counted. The experiment was performed in triplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>3d co-culture system of macrophages and HCC cells</title><p>The 24-well plates were precoated with 10 × 10<sup>3</sup> mouse Raw 264.7 macrophages (ATCC) resuspended in 200 ul of Matrigel growth factor reduced (Corning) for 30 min at 37°C.

Human 62-plex or Mouse 38 plex kits were purchased from eBiosciences/Affymetrix and used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with modifications as described below. Briefly: Beads were added to a 96 well plate and washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. Samples were added to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with shaking. Cold and Room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500–600 rpm. Following the overnight incubation plates were washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer and then biotinylated detection antibody added for 75 min at room temperature with shaking. Plate was washed as above and streptavidin-PE was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature wash was performed as above and reading buffer was added to the wells.

<italic>Twist1</italic> expression in cancer causes macrophage activation that enables metastasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jung-Eun Lee (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers' comments can be addressed without performing extensive new experiments. Most of the points can be ironed out by textual changes or data re-analysis. In this spirit, major point 5 raised by reviewer 3 does not have to be addressed experimentally. It is sufficient to discuss this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>1) The authors generated a transgenic mouse model whereby conditional expression of MYC and <italic>Twist1</italic>1 promotes the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in most mice. Metastatic tumors are reversible upon inactivation of <italic>Twist1</italic>.</p><p>2) They find that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are recruited to HCC in this mouse model.</p><p>3) Treatment with CCL2 and IL13 induced MYC-HCCs to metastasize whereas blockade of CCL2 and IL13 or depletion of macrophages abrogated MYC/<italic>Twist1</italic>-HCC metastasis.</p><p>4) High expression of MYC and <italic>Twist1</italic> predicts poor survival of cancer patients.</p><p>5) The plasma level of IL13 correlates with the vascular invasion in HCC.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>To establish a model that enables the metastasis of murine MYC-driven HCC, the authors introduced <italic>Twist1</italic>, which is known to promote the metastasis of cancer cells, to their previously reported murine MYC-driven HCC model (Tet-off conditional expression system).</p><p>Here they present a mechanism by which MYC and <italic>Twist1</italic> drive the metastasis of HCC. This study represents technically solid work. It is striking that <italic>Twist1</italic> expression increases the probability of the metastasis of MYC-driven HCC by 45 folds.</p><p>However, the conceptual novelty of the suggested mechanism is somewhat limited by a previous publication (Cancer Res. 2013. <italic>Twist1</italic> induces CCL2 and recruits macrophages to promote angiogenesis) that reported the same role of <italic>Twist1</italic> for recruiting macrophages through CCL2 and promoting angiogenesis around carcinoma cells. Given that angiogenesis is required for metastasis, this study confirms the same role of CCL2 in the metastasis of liver cancer while reporting a new role of IL13 in M2 polarization in this process. The authors should discuss this reference in more detail to highlight the novelty of this study.</p><p>An interesting twist of this study is that <italic>Twist1</italic> somehow needs MYC to promote the metastasis of liver cancer. Given that MYC and <italic>Twist1</italic> have been reported to cooperate, if the authors can shed some light on the mechanism underlying this dependency, it will increase the impact of this study. Does MYC increase the transcriptional factor activity of <italic>Twist1</italic>, for example? Is IL13-mediated M2 polarization required for angiogenesis?</p><p>Regardless of this gap of knowledge, this study will be of interest to the liver cancer community now that the authors show that the combined inhibition of CCL2 and IL13 suppress the metastasis in a mouse model of liver cancer and that the plasma level of IL13 correlates with the vascular invasion in HCC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper first describes a model of liver cancer, induced by <italic>MYC+TWIST1</italic> genes. The authors report the important discovery that tumors arising from the combination of the two genes induces metastasis, whereas only <italic>MYC</italic> or <italic>TWIST1</italic> does not. The work shows that the <italic>MYC+TWIST1</italic> tumors express the cytokines CCL2 and IL13, which polarize tumor-associated macrophages of the type M2. Moreover, systemic administration of CCL2 and IL13 was sufficient to induce metastasis. Although it is known that the tumor-associated macrophages promote tumor and metastasis development, the mechanism proposed to explain the higher metastatic potential of the <italic>MYC+TWIST1</italic> tumors is novel and interesting.</p><p>Consistently, analysis of different human cancers shows that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> are strongly associated with poor overall survival. In a prospective study, they show that higher plasmatic levels of CCL2 and IL13 are associated with metastasis. Finally, they also show that metastasis in this model are inhibited by Ccl2+Il13 neutralizing antibodies, which gives clues for anti-metastasis approaches in oncology.</p><p>Altogether, the work shows relevant and novel information, and the technological approach is sound. It is novel and interesting that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> induce metastasis by modulating the immune microenvironment and not by inducing proliferation or invasion. However, the work does not elucidate whether <italic>MYC</italic> activate the transcription of the CCL2 and/or IL13 genes or a different mechanism is in place</p><p>1) The work shows that <italic>MYC</italic> induces the expression of CCL2 and IL13 and that these cytokines are sufficient for the <italic>MYC</italic>-induced liver tumors to metastasize. This is a relevant information. However, whether IL13 or CCL2 are direct transcriptional targets of <italic>MYC+TWIST1</italic> remains to be elucidated. The authors may at least ask in the databases whether the DNA region around the transcription start site of IL13 and CCL2 genes contain <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> binding motifs and to show <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> binding by ChIP. Actually the binding of <italic>MYC</italic> to the genes can be also tested I many cell lines from the public data of the ENCODE consortium.</p><p>2) Figure 1C: It is difficult to tell from these images whether the luciferase is being expressed in the liver of the animal, or another organ of the body or in the peritoneum. Maybe they can use another technique to show <italic>Twist1</italic> in the liver upon Dox withdrawal. For example, and IHQ or IF for Twist or Luc, a western blot or even RT-PCR showing the <italic>Twist1</italic> RNA expression).</p><p>Also, they should give information on the penetrance of the <italic>MYC-Twist1</italic>/Luc – What percentage of mice show it? At the same intensity? It does not look so from the two mice of the figure.</p><p>3) Figure 1—figure supplement 1B: As the authors rightly say, it is important to rule out an effect of <italic>Twist1</italic> on <italic>MYC</italic> levels. However, the figure apparently shows an increase in <italic>MYC</italic> levels in the <italic>Twist1-MYC</italic> livers, if the reduced levels of Actin are considered (compare lanes 1 and 3). A better western or a quantification of this blot normalizing against actin would be required to make the conclusion.</p><p>4) Subsection “<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> cooperate to remodel the tumor immune microenvironment” paragraph two, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E: &quot;the inactivation of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> in tumors shows rapid tumor regression&quot;. However, no quantification is given on the extent of tumor repression upon the addition of Dox to the water. In how many mice? Do the tumors completely regress? How long before they regress?</p><p>5) Figure 4C: It is known that the macrophage subtype M2a is the one activated by IL13. So it will be interesting to check whether this is the subtype polarized in the <italic>MYC</italic>+<italic>TWIST1</italic> liver tumors.</p><p>6) Subsection “Combined inhibition of CCL2 and IL13 synergistically inhibits metastasis in vivo”: The liver tumor burden in response to the neutralizing antibodies must be quantified (e.g. by densitometry of the images).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The manuscript by Baylot et al. shows a new metastastic mouse model of HCC, based on the cooperative function of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic>. The authors provide evidence that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> together are responsible for the induction of a cytokinome, including CCL2 and IL13, which cause macrophage tumor infiltration and their transition to a metastasis-promoting M2 phenotype. The story is very interesting by itself, but it is probably just the beginning of further studies needed to define the distinct contributions of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> to the metastatic phenotype (unfortunately <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> are both under the same Tet System control and cannot be turned off separately in the <italic>MYC/Twist1</italic> mice). Also, there is no mechanism explaining exactly how the macrophages are promoting metastasis, even though it is clear that they are needed for the process.</p><p>Summary of substantive concerns:</p><p>1) General comment for figures: the scale bars are missing and sometimes the same figure includes the comparison among panels with different magnifications (i.e. Figure 1J-K, lung and liver panels, or Figure 2G-H). That needs to be corrected in all figures.</p><p>2) Regarding the same Figures 1J-K, in subsection “<italic>Twist1</italic> induces spontaneous metastatic progression of <italic>MYC</italic>-driven HCC in vivo” the authors state that <italic>MYC</italic> levels are similar in the two tumor models, but the images do not seem to agree with that statement: in <italic>MYC/Twist1</italic> HCC top left panel, <italic>MYC</italic> seems much higher that the corresponding <italic>MYC</italic> HCC panel, while in the merge it looks exactly the opposite. The authors should quantify the images in order to make conclusions and correct for different exposure times.</p><p>3) The authors state that &quot;Macrophage depletion with clodronate liposomes […] had reduced intrahepatic and lung metastases&quot;. However, the figure clearly shows a difference also in the primary tumor burden, which could in part account for the reduction in mets. This is definitely a point that needs to be clarified.</p><p>4) The authors should at least comment on the fact that <italic>Twist1</italic> is a bHLH protein that can bind the same Ebox as <italic>MYC</italic> does, hence not only possibly cooperating, but even competing with it. Again, some characterization of this molecular aspects of target regulation might be relevant to future studies.</p><p>5) Orthotopic and intravenous transplantation assays: To perform this in vivo assay the authors state that the tumors or cells are inoculated into NSG mice. Why do the authors perform these experiments with an immunodeficient mouse strain? Why don't they use immune competent mice of the FVB/N background of their original transgenic mice?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50731.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>To establish a model that enables the metastasis of murine MYC-driven HCC, the authors introduced Twist1, which is known to promote the metastasis of cancer cells, to their previously reported murine MYC-driven HCC model (Tet-off conditional expression system).</p><p>Here they present a mechanism by which MYC and Twist1 drive the metastasis of HCC.

The authors should discuss this reference in more detail to highlight the novelty of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment regarding conceptual novelty and mechanistic insight. We explain now, in more detail, the novelty of our work and we have revised the text to reflect the thoughtful comments of the reviewer.</p><p>We would like to briefly highlight what we believe is the conceptual novelty of our work.</p><p>First, we identify that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> mediate a surprising non-cell intrinsic mechanism of cooperation through a novel autochthonous transgenic mouse model of metastatic HCC. We demonstrate that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> cooperate to induce metastasis. <italic>MYC</italic> has not been thought of as a metastasis gene. <italic>Twist1</italic> has been thought of as metastasis gene but through effects on EMT. We show that together they cooperate to drive a transcriptional program that elicits a change in the host immune system.</p><p>Second, we specifically identify that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> cooperate to induce a cytokinome which is both required and sufficient to induce HCC metastasis.</p><p>Third, we show that <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> are part of a generalizable mechanism to human cancer by showing that it is combined overexpression of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> that in 33 different human cancers (10,000 cancer specimens from TCGA) is generally associated with poor prognosis, pro-metastatic cytokines and TAM infiltration.</p><p>Fourth, we have gained specific new insights into how <italic>Twist1</italic> through CCL2 and IL13 mediates metastasis. The reviewer is certainly very correct to note that <italic>Twist1</italic> has been shown to induce CCL2 in breast cancer cell lines and recruit macrophages. However, we are able to show that <italic>Twist1</italic> alone expression in the liver does not lead to immune activation or spontaneous tumorigenesis. <italic>Twist1</italic> only in the context of cooperation with the <italic>MYC</italic> promotes metastasis. Moreover, treatment of <italic>MYC</italic>-HCC with CCL2 alone led to macrophage recruitment to the tumor but it was not sufficient to induce metastasis in the absence of the TAM-polarizing cytokine IL13.</p><p>To address the prior relevant work, we have now expanded the Discussion to include a specific reference of the Cancer Res. 2013 manuscript and also explained the novelty of our manuscript in this context as follows:</p><p>“Low-Marchelli and colleagues previously reported that <italic>Twist1</italic> transcriptionally induces CCL2 in breast cancer cell lines which leads to macrophage recruitment (Low-Marchelli et al., 2013). Our study demonstrates that, in fact, CCL2 induced macrophage recruitment alone was not sufficient to cause metastasis in vivo and IL13 induced macrophage polarization plays an essential and complementary role in promoting angiogenesis and metastasis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An interesting twist of this study is that Twist1 somehow needs MYC to promote the metastasis of liver cancer. Given that MYC and Twist1 have been reported to cooperate, if the authors can shed some light on the mechanism underlying this dependency, it will increase the impact of this study. Does MYC increase the transcriptional factor activity of Twist1, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an outstanding point that our “twist” is that “<italic>Twist1</italic>” needs <italic>MYC</italic> and mechanistic insight on this dependency would be exciting. So, to address this mechanistic question, we now add two results. First, we examined if both <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> need to be constitutively active to sustain metastasis; and second we examined if <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> were directly coordinating to regulate cytokine expression we implicated in the mechanism of metastasis.</p><p>First, we provide evidence using additional new data that the mechanism really is that you need both transcription factors to be present simultaneously and constitutively proving this is an active cooperative and sustained mechanism, as opposed to <italic>Twist1</italic> or <italic>MYC</italic> enabling distinct programs during tumor progression. To do this, we generated new tumor derived cell lines whereby we could discriminate the independent roles of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> in metastasis by modulating the expression of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> separately. Primary tumor derived cell lines from <italic>MYC/Twist1</italic> HCC were retrovirally transduced with constitutive <italic>MYC</italic> and/or <italic>Twist1</italic>, such that upon inactivation of transgene expression with Doxycycline, they now constitutively expressed <italic>MYC</italic> and/or <italic>Twist1</italic> (new Figure 3D). We confirmed that treatment of these cell lines with doxycycline resulted in the continued expression of constitutive <italic>MYC</italic> and/or <italic>Twist1</italic> by qPCR (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).

Thus <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> cooperate, and are both required to be active constitutively and function together to induce metastasis.

The authors may at least ask in the databases whether the DNA region around the transcription start site of IL13 and CCL2 genes contain MYC and Twist1 binding motifs and to show MYC and Twist1 binding by ChIP.

The story is very interesting by itself, but it is probably just the beginning of further studies needed to define the distinct contributions of MYC and Twist1 to the metastatic phenotype (unfortunately MYC and Twist1 are both under the same Tet System control and cannot be turned off separately in the MYC/Twist1 mice).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important concern that it would be invaluable if we could independently regulate <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic>.

There was no statistically significant difference in densitometry between control treated and clodronate treated mice (p=0.603).

Why do the authors perform these experiments with an immunodeficient mouse strain? Why don't they use immune competent mice of the FVB/N background of their original transgenic mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good question of why the orthotopic transplantation assays were performed in immunocompromised mice and not in WT FVB mice. As has been observed for many transgenic models, we were not able to transplant primary tumors into new syngeneic wild type FVB/N with regularity (10% success rate). We believe this is likely explained by possible allogeneic rejection of donor-specific antigens in the transplanted tumor by the host immune system. Hence, we were concerned that experiments would reflect a strong selection that could markedly bias the results. However, we think it is very important to point out that most of the experiments we performed were done in a primary transgenic mouse model and that this strength and novelty of our findings is exactly that we did experiments in primary tumors in vivo.</p><p>We point out that the existing syngeneic allograft orthotopic transplant models have used immortalized cell lines like MC38 colon cancer and B16 melanoma cell lines in C57/B6 background. Our cell lines derived from primary tumors are semi-immortalized and likely are still highly antigenic. Another possibility is that the macrophages recruited by the <italic>MYC/Twist1</italic>- HCC cells are able to directly and specifically reject allografts in a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dependent manner as has been shown recently (Chu et al., 2019).</p><p>Although experiments in wildtype mice would be ideal, we hope that the experiments we have done in NSG mice are adequate for the purposes of this study. Our focus is on macrophage recruitment to the orthotopic liver tumor and metastatic sites. Macrophages are functional in NSG mice and have been used by several investigators for this purpose (Sukocheva et al., 2010; Behan et al., 2013) (Hu et al., 2011) (Krepler et al., 2004). Moreover, the main mechanisms by which we show that M2-like macrophages promote metastasis in the <italic>MYC/Twist1</italic> like stimulating angiogenesis and increasing cancer cell invasiveness are largely independent of adaptive immunity.</p><p>Finally, most of our experiments were performed in primary tumors in a new transgenic models of <italic>MYC/Twist1</italic> HCC where we could study the natural history of stepwise progression of metastatic HCC in an immunocompetent host.</p></body></sub-article></article>
