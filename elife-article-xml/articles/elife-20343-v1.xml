forests are now aging. Here, we show that the lack of regeneration of these populations began ca. 165 ya (around 1850) after major anthropogenic disturbances ceased. Since 1885, less itinerancy and disturbance in the forest has occurred because the colonial administrations concentrated people and villages along the primary communication axes. Local populations formerly gardened the forest by creating scattered openings, which were sufficiently large for the establishment of light-demanding trees. Currently, common logging operations do not create suitable openings for the regeneration of these species, whereas deforestation degrades landscapes. Using an interdisciplinary approach, which included paleoecological, archaeological, historical, and dendrological data, we highlight the long-term history of human activities across central African forests and assess the contribution of these activities to present-day forest structure and composition. The conclusions of this sobering analysis present challenges to current silvicultural practices and to those of the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20343.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20343.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20343.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The world’s forests contain trillions of trees. Some of those trees require more light than others to mature, and certain species can only grow to reach the forest canopy if they have access to sunlight throughout their whole life.</p><p>Central Africa is home to the second largest tropical rainforest in the world. Previous studies showed that few young trees of light-demanding species were growing to replace the old trees in this forest. As a result this population is aging and at risk of disappearing, which is a major concern. Many light-demanding tree species in the Central African forest are cut down for their valuable timber. However, if young trees do not grow to replace the mature ones that are logged, even logging operations that follow national and international environmental rules cannot guarantee the sustainability of these trees.</p><p>As such, Morin-Rivat et al. set out to understand what changed in the Central African forest in the past to stop the regeneration of the light-demanding trees. The analyses focused on four species classified as light-demanding trees in part of Central Africa called the northern Congo Basin. Most of the trees in these species were about 165 years old. This was the case even though the different species grow at different rates, and it means that they all grew from young trees that settled in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>So what was it that changed after this period to stop this population of light-demanding trees in the Central African forest from regenerating? By combining information from a number of datasets and historical records, Morin-Rivat et al. arrived at the following conclusion. Before the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, many people lived in the forest and their activities created clearings that turned the forest into a relatively patchy landscape. However from about 1850 onwards, when Europeans started to colonize the region, people and villages were moved out of the forests and closer to rivers and roads for administrative and commercial purposes. Moreover, many people were killed in conflicts or died because of newly introduced diseases, which also led to fewer people in the forest. As a result, the forest became less disturbed. With fewer clearings, fewer light-demanding trees would have had enough access to sunlight to grow to maturity.</p><p>The findings of Morin-Rivat et al. show that disturbance is needed to maintain certain forest habitats and tree species, including light-demanding species of tree. As common logging operations do not create openings large enough to guarantee that such species will be able to establish themselves naturally, complementary treatments are needed. These might include selectively logging mature trees around young members of light-demanding species, or planting threatened species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20343.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20343.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>central Africa</kwd><kwd>tropical forests</kwd><kwd>tree regeneration</kwd><kwd>anthropogenic disturbance</kwd><kwd>European colonization</kwd><kwd>recent history</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003134</institution-id><institution>Fonds pour la Formation à la Recherche dans l’Industrie et dans l’Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morin-Rivat</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>King Léopold III Fund for Nature Exploration and Conservation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morin-Rivat</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique -

Over the last three millennia, significant changes in the vegetation structure and floristic composition were caused by climate fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neumann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lézine et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, a dry event around 2500 ya caused forest fragmentationan event with a more pronounced seasonality occurred around 2500 ya and caused forest fragmentation, and this fragmented forest included patches of savanna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maley, 2002</xref>). This dry episode stopped around 2500 BP, as evidenced from the Mopo Bai site in the Republic of the Congo, where Poaceae pollen severely dropped from 36% to 13% between 2580 and 2400 BP, which is evidence for a retreat of the savannas to the benefit of the forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostoen et al., 2015</xref>). After 2000 yrs BP, a relatively wet climate in central Africa favored forest recolonization by light-demanding tree species, with few effects imputable to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lézine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brnčić et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostoen et al., 2015</xref>). The subsequent climatic variations were less important with little effect on the vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oslisly et al., 2013a</xref>); however, human activities are assumed to have increased in importance, particularly during the most recent centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oslisly et al., 2013a,</xref> 2013b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Willis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brnčić et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greve et al., 2011</xref>). The abundance of direct (artifacts) and indirect evidence (charred oil palm endocarps) in soils confirms the non-pristine nature of central African forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morin-Rivat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Human activities in the Holocene, and particularly shifting cultivation, have been invoked to partially explain the low diversity of central African forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parmentier et al., 2007</xref>) and the abundance of light-demanding species in the canopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White and Oates, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engone Obiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vleminckx et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biwolé et al., 2015</xref>). The light-demanding species form, in some places, almost pure 0.5 to 1 ha stands that mirror the size of traditionally cultivated fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>). An example is the Sangha River Interval (SRI) in which the vegetation currently forms a ‘corridor’ of old-growth semi-deciduous <italic>Celtis</italic> forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fayolle et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gond et al., 2013</xref>), with local variations caused by the geological substrate or the forest degradation along roads and close to cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fayolle et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The SRI is a 400-km-wide region, with low endemism between the Lower Guinean and the Congolian subcenters of endemism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White, 1983</xref>). This area, which is between southeastern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic and northern Congo, may have been a savanna corridor 2500 ya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maley, 2002</xref>). Until the recent studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gillet and Doucet (2012)</xref>, the vegetation in the SRI was under sampled, and whether the origin of this corridor is environmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fayolle et al., 2012</xref>) or historical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morin-Rivat et al., 2014</xref>) remains to be explored. In this study, we assessed the potential impact of historical human activities on central African forests. Specifically, we analyzed the population/age structure of four primary light-demanding timber species across the SRI and examined the synchronism with the paleoenvironmental, archaeological, and historical data in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20343.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Paleoenvironmental changes and human activities in the Sangha River Interval.</title><p>The 34 sites with paleoenvironmental data (fires) and the 38 dated archaeological sites and discoveries (pots) are indicated on a vegetation map modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gond et al.

The exploration of the SRI that began after AD 1875, and the permanent presence of the European colonists since then, deeply disturbed the spatial distribution of the local populations, as well as their activities (e.g. enrolment in the concession companies, education, diseases, etc.). During this period, the conflicts that opposed France and Germany (i.e. the 1870 War, and the First and Second World Wars) were also transferred to the African territories.</p><p>Finally, the region experienced a massive rural exodus since the 1930s, which was amplified since the independences (Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, and Central African Republic the same year: 1960).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generalized decline of light-demanding tree populations</title><p>The reverse-J-shape distribution of diameters, characteristic of most genera, is typical of ‘active’ tree populations with many small and young trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, the unimodal distribution of diameters for could represent a generalized limited number of young trees (i.e., a lack of regeneration) and indicate the widespread decline of the tree populations. This type of distribution was characteristic of four primary canopy genera (i.e., <italic>Erythrophleum</italic> and <italic>Pericopsis</italic> (Fabaceae), <italic>Terminalia</italic> (Combretaceae), and <italic>Triplochiton</italic> (Malvaceae)), which we studied further.

Similarly, a unimodal distribution of diameters was reported for the light-demanding timber species <italic>Aucoumea klaineana</italic> in Gabon, which could not be explained only by demography.</p><p>Ontogenic variations in growth are well described for tropical tree species, and unimodal growth trajectories are widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hérault et al., 2011</xref>). The low performance of the models to estimate tree age is explained by the slow growth of young trees (dbh ≤10 cm) and the great uncertainty regarding the time a tree remains in the small diameter classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Indeed, a linear relationship between tree diameter and age is acceptable for tropical tree species of a larger size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Worbes et al., 2003</xref>). Most suppressed individuals were destined to die, and therefore, only the trees with vigorous growth are able to reach the canopy and could be thus included in this type of analysis. The tree-ring approach, including information for the growth of small trees, remains therefore essential for age estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Worbes et al., 2003</xref>), but studies are only sporadic for central African forests.</p><p>Based on mean growth estimates, canopy trees in the SRI were aged to only a few centuries, with a mode dated to AD 1850 in average. This age range is consistent with the estimated ages of canopy trees in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>) and in Cameroon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Worbes et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the population decline of <italic>A. klaineana</italic> in Gabon is attributed to a shift in the disturbance regime two to three centuries ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engone Obiang et al., 2014</xref>). The argument for a regional trend is supported by these age estimates and the general pattern we reported across the SRI. We assumed that the unimodal population/age structure of the light-demanding tree species was linked to the recent human history. Specifically, we postulated that the decrease in anthropogenic disturbances and the generalized land abandonment from ca. 165 ya were less favorable to the regeneration of light-demanding tree species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brnčić et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greve et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biwolé et al., 2015</xref>).

The vegetation was composed of forest tree species according to δ<sup>13</sup>C values between −30.6 and −25.8‰ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sangen, 2012</xref>). In southeastern Cameroon, alluvial records indicate a growing human impact on forests between AD 1000 and 1200, particularly because of shifting cultivation and the associated increase in erosional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sangen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). Charcoal (related to natural fires and anthropogenic burning) in lake sediments and soils were recorded only at the end of this period, which corresponds to the end of the hiatus phase in human activities (massive depopulation) previously documented for central Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oslisly et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wotzka, 2006</xref>) and specifically for the SRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morin-Rivat et al., 2014</xref>). Surveys have been carried out, but the poor surface visibility can underestimate true human presence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morin-Rivat et al., 2016</xref>, for an example of methodology). Sometimes no archaeological research have been carried out in certain regions covered by dense forest (B. Clist, pers. comment). Notably, at this time, human populations were only indicated at a few sites that were dedicated to iron metallurgy (southern CAR near Bangui and Nola and the site of Ngombé in the Rep. of the Congo, approximately AD 1300) and to salt exploitation (Ngoko River, approximately AD 1000).</p><p>From AD 1300 to 1850, pollen sequences indicated a relatively wet climatic period. Nevertheless, burning increased, and this burning is attributed to human activities because the moisture content of the vegetation was too high for fires to often occur naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brnčić et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vennetier, 1963</xref>). The Mbaéré valley and the Sadika alluvial fan (Gadzi-Carnot sandstones in CAR) recorded intensive erosion and relatively high δ<sup>13</sup>C values after AD 1200, indicating forest regression and the formation of a forest-savanna mosaic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sangen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Runge et al., 2014</xref>).

The decrease in the run-off with an increased rate of sedimentation between AD 1400 and 1600 corresponds to the climatic period of the Little Ice Age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brnčić et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2009</xref>), in combination with an increase in the frequency of El-Niño events between AD 1200 and 1500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sangen, 2012</xref>). Since then, despite a more humid period following the Little Ice Age, maximal incidence of human activities have been recorded in the SRI, which opened the forest cover and favored the pioneers. Nonetheless, we must remain cautious regarding the interpretation of the archaeological data, as there is a huge gap of knowledge in the SRI, especially in the area between Souanké and Berberati (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the state of the art, it is not possible to interpret the spatial distribution of human settlements and activities.

Indeed, between AD 1550 and 1850, the Fulbe populations coming from northern Cameroon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burnham, 1996</xref>) organized the slave-raiding for Europeans and induced the flight of populations southward into the forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vennetier, 1963</xref>), explaining the increase in human presence and activities (i.e. agriculture and smelting) in the region.

AD 1850, which corresponds to the beginning of the regeneration shortage of light-demanding tree populations. In the last decades of the 19th century, Savorgnan de Brazza reported that the SRI was densely populated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Copet-Rougier, 1998</xref>), which seems now unlikely given the low density of human populations (less than one inhabitant per km²). We hypothesize that the European colonization deeply disturbed the spatial organization of the local populations in central Africa, as demonstrated in Gabon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pourtier, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engone Obiang et al., 2014</xref>). Colonization stopped the migrations and the interethnic warfare and forced entire groups to settle along rivers and roads for administrative and commercial purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vennetier, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robineau, 1967</xref>). However, the process of village redistribution during the colonial times strongly varied from one place to another, according to the settlement of the colonial posts, and the borders between the French and German possessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pourtier, 1989</xref>: e.g. of the Fang villages in Gabon). Additional factors can also be invoked to explain the emptying of the forests, including the involvement of local populations in the Franco-German conflicts during their respective colonial expansions and the two World Wars, the forced or voluntarily labor in concession companies, the deadly repression of riots, and the increased mortality because of diseases (e.g., trypanosomiasis along the Ubangui and the Sangha rivers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robineau, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Runge and Nguimalet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Runge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Runge et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, because of the land abandonment caused by the new relationships established between the local peoples and the colonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giles-Vernick, 2000</xref>), the Mpiemu tales of the late 19th century relate to the regrowth of the forest.</p><p>From the 1930s and after the independence (1960), the abandonment of the forests was amplified because the access to education contributed to an increase in the rural exodus to the main towns and capitals in a search for valued wage labor in administration or trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vennetier, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robineau, 1967</xref>). From this period, deep demographic disparities emerged between towns and rural areas: most working-age people went to cities (e.g., Ouesso, Impfondo and Brazzaville in Congo, Yokadouma and Bertoua in Cameroon, and Berberati and Bangui in CAR), while children and the elderly people were left in villages. Thus, less labor force was available for forest clearing and cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vennetier, 1963</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first time in the Sangha River Interval, a convergent body of evidence shows the effect of past changes in the disturbance regime on forest structure and composition. Consistent with previous observations in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White and Oates, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>), in Gabon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engone Obiang et al., 2014</xref>), and in southwestern Cameroon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biwolé et al., 2015</xref>), the population decline of light-demanding tree species that now dominate the canopy is explained by the decrease in anthropogenic disturbances. Caution is nevertheless required regarding the interpretation of the radiocarbon signal. Large-scale historical events, such as the interethnic wars and the European colonization of Africa, contributed to reduce human pressure on the forest. Former agricultural activities such as shifting cultivation, which were scattered in the forest areas between AD 1300 and 1850, likely had an indirect positive influence on the regeneration of these species. Past local populations of ‘foragers-horticulturists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kay and Kaplan, 2015</xref>) gardened the forest by preserving useful light wooded trees (e.g., <italic>T. scleroxylon</italic>) or dense wooded trees (e.g., <italic>P. elata</italic> and <italic>E. suaveolens</italic>) in the fields during forest clearing and therefore created favorable conditions for their recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrière et al., 2002</xref>). Since ca. AD 1850, the reduced disturbance regime has apparently hindered the regeneration of most species of light-demanding trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrière et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Willis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brnčić et al., 2007</xref>). The current lack of regeneration and the general aging of the populations threaten both their viability and the sustainability of logging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gemerden et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, based on these results, a renewed interest in silvicultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doucet et al., 2004</xref>) that create larger openings in the canopy should be inspired. Complementary liberation, thinning treatments, and population enforcement, may also contribute to maintain these timber species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fayolle et al., 2014a</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study area</title><p>The Sangha River Interval (SRI) is a 400-km-wide area in southeastern Cameroon, southern Central African Republic (CAR), and northern Republic of Congo.

The reforestation was ongoing then [Bostoen et al. 2015 pages 357-358: – Bostoen (K.), Clist (B.), Doumenge (C.), Grollemund (R.), Hombert (J.-M.), Koni Muluwa (J.) and Maley (J.), 2015, Middle to Late Holocene Paleoclimatic Change and the Early Bantu Expansion in the Rain Forests of Western Central Africa, Current Anthropology, 56 (3), pp.354-384]. J. Maley has previously argued for the existence of two different dry climatic episodes, one around 4000 bp affecting the periphery of the Equatorial forest, the other at 2500 bp affecting the core of it. The data can be used another way, with a start at 4000 bp of the regional dessication ending around 2500 bp with then the largest savanna expanses in position; it would have been a single palaeoclimatic crisis, soon after a slow process of forest regeneration with pioneer trees would have started, i.e. already at 2500 bp.</p><p>Subsection “The regional history of human activities”, first paragraph – it is suggested there was a 'massive depopulation' between AD 950-1300 with almost no human activity there. This should be better balanced as only some archaeologists lend an ear to such an interpretation while others prefer to speak of a lack of fieldwork to explain the apparent lack of human presence. An ongoing work to be published in 2017 tends to demonstrate the latter to be the better case.</p><p>2) The archaeological signature inside the SRI since 1000 years ago.</p><p>The caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> speaks of 52 archaeological sites. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref> lists 65 dates coming from 38 sites only. Explain the discrepancy.</p><p>A note explaining the relevance of the 4 columns of the table would be welcome. Pottery is plain enough as is smelting though one should specify if this is iron slag only, or tewels, or iron slag and tewels, or furnaces, etc. The difference is important. Salt sites: how were they identified, what is their material identification, what is their relationship with settlements? Oil palm, must mean carbonized endocarps I believe. Can we be more specific? An endocarp can be carbonized in a natural forest fire as following human consumption.</p><p>Making good use of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref> and considering the settlement (pottery) and the industrial evidence (iron smelting) one finds a somewhat slightly different picture than the one presented.</p><p>The sites having yielded pottery are only 13 not 15 (2 dates each time at sites n°18 and 23).</p><p>Using the calibrated dates of the 15 dates associated to pottery (2 OSL and 13 14C) one finds 3 dates between AD 800 and 1100, none between AD 1100 and 1300, 8 between AD 1300 and 1600, 2 at AD 1700-1800, none after that. Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the map, we find a minimum of 50 km between these <italic>pottery</italic> sites, though sites 15 and 16, then sites 27 and 28 are situated closer together. This is not a good geographical and chronological sampling to discuss ancient man use through the large area of the SRI for the last 1000 years.</p><p>Using now the <italic>smelting</italic> sites as referenced in the paper, one finds one at AD 1000-1100, none between AD 1100-1300, 6 at AD 1300-1400, none at AD 1400-1500, 2 at AD 1500-1700, and an extraordinary 17 at AD 1700-1900. But most of them come from work done by Lupo et al. and Moga on only 5 sites, and Lupo et al. processed 17 14C dates from a single site (!), Bagbaya (site n°34) to the extreme north-east of the SRI.</p><p>This severely stresses again it is dangerous to use dates and especially radiocarbon dates in a global way without first getting into details of their respective contexts and making an internal criticism. Work done by the present reviewer on a series of 51 new 14C dates led before using them in a synthesis to discard 5 of them due to bad context.</p><p>The observation made of 17 14C dates associated to smelting during the short period of AD 1700-1900 should make one think of the associated deforestation sometimes quite extensive due to human settlements and evidenced in southern Congo (see work by B. Pinçon, iron smelting vs. volume of charcoal needed). This has an immediate relationship with the main topic of this paper.</p><p>The decrease of human impact on the forests due to a village redistribution during colonial times along the roads newly created has varied in time according to where you are situated: on the border between Cameroon and Gabon it happened in the early 20th century (see end of 19th century German maps of Fang villages in the Equatorial forest compared to French maps showing villages moved to the roads; R. Pourtier 1989 Le Gabon: espace, histoire et société, L'Harmattan, Paris). In the former Bas-Congo province of the Democratic Republic of Congo this happened in the early 1950s.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20343.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>Abstract – Please state what methods you used for the study in the Abstract, instead of just 'an interdisciplinary approach'.</italic></p><p>It has been detailed.</p><p><italic>Abstract – 'regeneration shortage of these populations'- sounds a little strange.

Indeed, there is a crucial need for new archaeological and <sup>14</sup>C data coming from central Africa.

Obviously, endocarps could be charred naturally. The mention of the artifacts and ecofacts in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref> are only indicative, as all publications we used did not systematically mention such findings.</p><p><italic>Making good use of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref> and considering the settlement (pottery) and the industrial evidence (iron smelting) one finds a somewhat slightly different picture than the one presented.</italic></p><p>Your comment suggests that settlements for living and craft places for smelting are not related to each other, or are far apart, depending of ore availability. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref> gathers all evidence we have, independently from their function, either residential, or industrial, so as to provide a picture of the state of the art in the region. At the moment, this is rough, I confess. But fortunately, I have recently read about new discoveries of smelting sites (unpublished field report) nearby our own discoveries of residential sites, which could surely complete our understanding of site functions and site interactions in the SRI.</p><p><italic>The sites having yielded pottery are only 13 not 15 (2 dates each time at sites n°18 and 23).</italic></p><p>The paper does not mention such number about pottery.

The field report I mentioned above fill in a substantial part of this gap (approximately from the Dja River to Yokadouma). I wish these new results would be published soon.</p><p><italic>Using now the smelting sites as referenced in the paper, one finds one at AD 1000-1100, none between AD 1100-1300, 6 at AD 1300-1400, none at AD 1400-1500, 2 at AD 1500-1700, and an extraordinary 17 at AD 1700-1900.

This point has been precised in the part “Recent and generalized land abandonment”.</p><p>However, as mentioned by Lupo et al. (2015), there is still a debate about evaluating the volume of wood needed for metallurgy, compared to the volume of trees logged for shifting agriculture (by referring to Goucher 1981, and Fairland and Leach 1998 publications). In the present paper, we did not deny the potential important environmental impacts of both activities. They were simply grouped into the single category “human activities”. More work should be done regarding site functions and site spatial influence.</p><p><italic>The decrease of human impact on the forests due to a village redistribution during colonial times along the roads newly created has varied in time according to where you are situated: on the border between Cameroon and Gabon it happened in the early 20th century (see end of 19th century German maps of Fang villages in the Equatorial forest compared to French maps showing villages moved to the roads; R.

In the former Bas-Congo province of the Democratic Republic of Congo this happened in the early 1950s.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this reference. Indeed, I think that mortality (i.e. because of conflicts, hard work, and diseases) was the first cause of population decrease in the last decades of the nineteenth century, and in the first of the twentieth. As mentioned in our paper, during the following years (since the 1920s, as proposed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>), the organization of the colonial administration and trade, then the rural exodus where very important causes of this forest depopulation.</p><p>I had access to the rare French and German maps dated to the end of the nineteenth century, and the situation in the SRI was less documented than that for Gabon. I wish I could find more maps in the national archives, including the Belgian colonial ones for western DRC (not accessible yet because of an ongoing transfer to the Royal Library).</p></body></sub-article></article>
