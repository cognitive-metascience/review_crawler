factor-like (EGF) repeats of a limited number of secreted and membrane proteins, including Notch receptors. In EOGT-deficient cells, the binding of DLL1 and DLL4, but not JAG1, canonical Notch ligands was reduced, and ligand-induced Notch signaling was impaired. Mutagenesis of O-GlcNAc sites on NOTCH1 also resulted in decreased binding of DLL4. EOGT functions were investigated in retinal angiogenesis that depends on Notch signaling. Global or endothelial cell-specific deletion of <italic>Eogt</italic> resulted in defective retinal angiogenesis, with a mild phenotype similar to that caused by reduced Notch signaling in retina. Combined deficiency of different <italic>Notch1</italic> mutant alleles exacerbated the abnormalities in <italic>Eogt</italic><sup>−/−</sup> retina, and Notch target gene expression was decreased in <italic>Eogt<sup>−/−</sup></italic>endothelial cells. Thus, O-GlcNAc on EGF repeats of Notch receptors mediates ligand-induced Notch signaling required in endothelial cells for optimal vascular development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24419.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24419.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24419.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, its cells undergo a series of divisions and transformations until they specialize to form distinct cell types. These transformations are regulated by many molecules and signaling pathways. Often one cell will release signaling molecules that are then recognized by specialized receptor proteins on other cells that then trigger a reaction in the receiving cell. A signaling molecule that binds to a receptor is often referred to as a ligand.</p><p>Specific chains of sugar molecules known as glycans are attached to receptor proteins and help to regulate the signaling pathways that control how cells develop in an embryo. One of these receptors is called the Notch receptor, which carries several types of glycans. Mutations that prevent the glycans from being attached to this receptor can lead to congenital diseases. For example, EOGT is an enzyme that attaches a sugar molecule onto the Notch receptor, and mutations in the gene that encodes EOGT are found in people with Adams-Oliver syndrome – a rare condition that causes their skin and limbs to fail to develop properly. However, it was not clear what exact role the attachment of the sugar molecule (referred to as O-GlcNAc) plays and if it regulates Notch signaling.</p><p>Sawaguchi et al. studied animal cells grown in the laboratory to investigate ligand binding to Notch receptors and Notch signaling. The experiments showed that if the gene for the EOGT enzyme was deleted, some ligand molecules could not bind well to the Notch signaling receptor. This affected how the receptor became activated and how it triggered a signaling reaction in the receiving cell. In mutant mice that lacked EOGT, the blood vessels of the developing retina had reduced Notch signaling. Blood vessels are important for the normal development of the retina. Together, the results suggest that O-GlcNAc on Notch receptors are important for specific aspects of Notch signaling, including the signals that lead to the normal development of retinal blood vessels.</p><p>A next step will be to identify other roles of the O-GlcNAc glycans on Notch receptors and to explore how they affect Notch signaling during development. A better understanding of these mechanisms will extend our knowledge of Adams-Oliver syndrome, which at the moment remains a poorly understood condition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

or Thr (O-GlcNAc) is a rare form of post-translational modification specifically modifying epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains in secreted or membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr"

In contrast to O-GlcNAc modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma and Hart, 2014</xref>), EGF-specific O-GlcNAcylation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the action of the EGF-domain-specific O-GlcNAc transferase, EOGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakaidani et al., 2011</xref>). To date, only a small number of secreted or membrane proteins have been shown to be O-GlcNAcylated, including Notch receptors and their ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tashima and Stanley, 2014</xref>). Notch receptors are also modified by O-fucose and O-glucose glycans at independent consensus sites on EGF repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and both types of O-glycan regulate the strength of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haltom and Jafar-Nejad, 2015</xref>). Loss of O-fucose, but not O-glucose glycans reduces binding of canonical Notch ligands to Notch receptors, and consequently Notch signaling. Removing one class of O-glycan will affect many EGF repeats but is not expected to affect modification of EGF repeats by unrelated O-glycans. In this paper, we report that Notch receptors lacking only O-GlcNAc glycans have reduced ligand-induced Notch signaling.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24419.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EOGT promotes NOTCH1 binding to Delta ligands.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of predicted O-glycans on mouse NOTCH1: red triangle, O-fucose glycans; blue circle, O-glucose glycans; blue square, O-GlcNAc glycans.

Although the pathogenesis of AOS is broad, it could arise from small-vessel vasculopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piazza et al., 2004</xref>). AOS is a heterogeneous disorder caused by mutation in one of at least six different genes. Among these, loss-of-function mutations of <italic>EOGT</italic> and <italic>DOCK6</italic> were identified as the basis of an autosomal-recessive form of AOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaheen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2011</xref>).

In contrast, loss-of-function mutations of <italic>DLL4</italic>, <italic>RBPJ</italic> and <italic>NOTCH1</italic> in AOS patients suggest that impaired Notch signaling is an alternative basis of the pathogenesis of AOS. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that loss of EOGT affects Notch signaling using cell-based Notch ligand binding and signaling assays and <italic>Eogt</italic> mutant mice. We show that EOGT-catalyzed NOTCH1 O-GlcNAcylation potentiates DLL1- and DLL4-NOTCH1 binding and Notch signaling, whereas JAG1-NOTCH1 binding remains unaffected. Using retinal angiogenesis as a sensitive assay of Notch signaling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roca and Adams, 2007</xref>), we show that mice lacking EOGT have impaired retinal vascular development, with a phenotype characteristic of Notch pathway deficiencies in retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, we show that endothelial functions of EOGT are responsible for the retinal vascular phenotype. Thus, O-GlcNAc on the EGF repeats of Notch receptors is required for optimal Notch signaling in developing retina, and likely in other Notch-dependent processes in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EOGT regulates DLL1 and DLL4 binding to NOTCH1</title><p>To address whether EOGT regulates physical interactions between Notch receptors and ligands, Notch ligand binding assays were performed on control and <italic>Eogt</italic>–siRNA Lec1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. <italic>Eogt</italic> transcripts determined by quantitative RT-PCR were reduced by ~60%. <italic>Eogt</italic>-siRNA Lec1 cells exhibited reduced binding of soluble DLL1-Fc and DLL4-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Because endogenous levels of EOGT were not readily detectable in HeLa cells by Western analysis, and reduced transcript levels do not reflect enzyme activity, knockdown efficiency was determined by Western blot detection of the O-GlcNAc product of EOGT. The TA197 and TA198 shRNAs that were most effective at reducing NOTCH1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), exhibited marked loss of O-GlcNAc on species comigrating with NOTCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; the lower band of the O-GlcNAc-positive doublet).

Retinal angiogenesis is induced just after birth in mice when a single layer of superficial retinal plexus grows from the center toward the periphery until P7. Although a vascular plexus was formed in P5 <italic>Eogt<sup>−/−</sup></italic> retina, vascular progression toward the periphery was delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

However, the distribution of anti-NG2-positive pericytes was unaffected at P5 in <italic>Eogt<sup>−/−</sup></italic> retinas (data not shown).

DLL4 constitutes the critical Notch ligand in regulating angiogenesis and vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hellström et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, JAG1 antagonizes Notch signaling during vasculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pedrosa et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that EOGT-catalyzed O-GlcNAc modification potentiates DLL1- and DLL4-mediated NOTCH1 signaling in co-culture assays and is required in vivo during retinal angiogenesis and the maintenance of retinal vascular integrity in mice. Site-directed mutagenesis of O-GlcNAc consensus sites in mouse NOTCH1 revealed that O-GlcNAc on EGF repeats located outside the canonical ligand-binding region affects DLL4-NOTCH1 binding. This O-GlcNAc in one or more EGF repeats may function directly in the binding of DLL4. Alternatively, O-GlcNAcylation may induce a conformational change of NOTCH1 that promotes DLL4 binding. Future structural analysis of O-GlcNAcylated NOTCH1 in complex with DLL4 will reveal how O-GlcNAc potentiates DLL4-NOTCH1 interactions. Such a study revealed that DLL4 makes specific contacts with the O-fucose glycan in the ligand binding domain (EGF11 and 12) of NOTCH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luca et al., 2015</xref>). O-fucose glycans on EGF12 affect both Delta and Jagged ligand-induced signaling as evidenced by the EGF12 O-fucosylation site mutant of NOTCH1 which has reduced signaling in response to DLL1 and JAG1 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rampal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). An O-GlcNAc consensus site is present in EGF11, but not EGF12 in mammals, but the EGF11 site is not conserved among vertebrates.</p><p>The ability of EOGT to potentiate Delta ligands is similar to that of Fringe, a glycosyltransferase that transfers GlcNAc to O-fucose on Notch receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brückner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moloney et al., 2000</xref>). In mammals, three Fringe genes, <italic>Mfng</italic>, <italic>Lfng</italic>, and <italic>Rfng</italic>, are expressed in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Lfng<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice exhibit enhanced sprouting and increased density of the vascular area in retinal angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>), a similarly mild phenotype to that in <italic>Eogt</italic><sup>−/−</sup> retina. Thus, <italic>Fringe</italic> and <italic>Eogt</italic> might play complementary functions during retinal angiogenesis. However, <italic>Mfng</italic> inhibits JAG1-Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>), whereas we found no effect on JAG1-induced Notch signaling in assays using <italic>Eogt</italic>-deficient or <italic>Eogt</italic>-overexpressing cells. Thus, the distinct effects of the different GlcNAc modifications of Notch receptors indicate that EOGT and Fringe glycosyltransferases possess different physiological functions. Indeed, we observed no obvious abnormality in the skeleton (data not shown) of <italic>Eogt</italic>-null mice, making them phenotypically distinguishable from <italic>Lfng<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evrard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang and Gridley, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The phenotypic similarity and genetic interaction between <italic>Eogt</italic> and <italic>Notch1</italic> in retinas suggest that decreased Notch signaling caused by <italic>Eogt</italic> mutation is mediated by impaired O-GlcNAcylation of Notch1. However, we cannot formally exclude the possibility of involvement of other Notch receptors as EOGT substrates. In fact, all Notch receptors are potentially modified with O-GlcNAc and NOTCH2 was reported to be O-GlcNAcylated in mouse cerebrocortical tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro et al., 2012</xref>).

However, a recent report revealed that DLL4 and JAG1 may fail to activate NOTCH4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James et al., 2014</xref>). A detailed analysis will be required to address the contribution of other Notch receptors to EOGT-dependent regulation of Notch signaling.</p><p>The GlcNAc transferred by Fringe or EOGT can be extended with galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakaidani et al., 2012</xref>).

In the course of preparation of this manuscript, a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch revealed that a Y/F/L residue at the −1 site is not absolutely required for the modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, C<sup>5</sup>XXGX(T/S)GX<sub>2-3</sub>C<sup>6</sup> can be proposed as a broad consensus site. Nonetheless, removing only four modification sites (EGF2, 10, 17, 20) out of 11 C<sup>5</sup>XXG(Y/F)(T/S)GXXC<sup>6</sup> sequences drastically decreased the O-GlcNAc level on NOTCH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results suggest that preferred O-GlcNAcylation requires additional constraints. Consistent with this view, five domains (EGF4, 11, 12, 14 and 20) out of 15 <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch EGF repeats containing the C<sup>5</sup>XXG(Y/F)(T/S)GXXC<sup>6</sup> consensus were found to be major O-GlcNAcylation sites in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, <italic>Eogt</italic> may affect Notch signaling in a tissue-specific manner. However, O-GlcNAc consensus sites on EGF repeats are poorly conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch and mammalian NOTCH1. Moreover, the elongation of O-GlcNAc by galactose is not observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2016</xref>). It would be of interest to determine whether the O-GlcNAc Notch-ligand interaction we report here is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The combined data on roles for O-glycans in Notch signaling suggest that each of the responsible glycosyltransferases may have different effects on Notch receptor functions. Thus, POFUT1 (Ofut1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and POGLUT1 (Rumi in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), which catalyze O-fucosylation and O-glucosylation, respectively, regulate the strength of Notch activation. Genetic inactivation of <italic>Pofut1/ofut1</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in diminished ligand binding to Notch and <italic>Poglut1/rumi</italic> mutation results in impaired Notch processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haltom and Jafar-Nejad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stanley and Okajima, 2010</xref>).

After four washes with PBSTX for 15 min at RT and a rinse with PBS-CMF, retinas were mounted using prolong diamond anti-fade mounting medium (Life Sciences, [1664835]) for observation using a TiE-A1R-KT5 microscope (Nikon) or a P250 High Capacity Slide Scanner (Perkin Elmer [1S10OD019961-01]). Whole mount staining for NG2+ pericytes was performed following the procedure described above using rabbit anti-NG2 antibody (1:200) or rat anti-NG2 antibody (1:1000), and DyLight488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) or CF640R-conjugated anti-rat IgG (1:200) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Whole mount staining of extravasated fibrinogen was performed as described above using rabbit anti-fibrinogen antibody (1:200) as a primary antibody and DyLight488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) as a secondary antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of retinal angiogenesis</title><p>The length of <italic>α</italic>SMA<sup>+</sup> blood vessels was calculated by determining the average of the 3–4 longest <italic>α</italic>SMA<sup>+</sup> vessels per retina. The number of vascular branch points was measured by analyzing 3–8 fields of 500 × 500 µm per retina which were chosen randomly to cover the region under the vascular front for P5, or central regions for P15 retinas. AngioTool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zudaire et al., 2011</xref>) was used to calculate branch points. For counting the number of filopodia, 4–12 random fields of 250 × 250 µm per retina at the vascular front, and the number of filopodia were counted by eye and marked with a red dot in NIH ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Eyes from newborn mice were fixed with 4% PFA/PBS for 15 min at RT.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Holger Gerhardt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers were supportive of the overall concept that O-GlcNacylation could be another form of glycosylation with impact on Notch signaling. However, in their reviews and in the online discussion between the editor and the reviewers, there was concern that the in vivo phenotype reported was very mild and not fully substantiated. Also, the in vitro demonstration of EOGT function in modulating Notch signaling used cell lines that were not related to the in vivo endothelial function. It was felt that this study needs a complete revision with careful analysis of EOGT biochemistry and effects on Notch signaling in endothelial cells in vitro, and a much better characterization of the in vivo phenotypes. As it stands, this work does not provide the same level of rigorous validation provided by the published papers on the effects of other glycosylation enzymes in Notch biology. Because the paper will need substantial additional work to achieve the required quality for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, we are unable to accept the manuscript at this time. We hope that the referees' comments will help you improve the paper for future publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Sawaguchi and colleagues present a rigorous study that describes the regulatory role of EGF O-GlcNAc transferase (EOGT) in the mammalian Notch signaling pathway. Previous studies from Okajima and Stanley laboratories reported that loss of eogt in flies does not impair Notch signaling but shows a dosage-sensitive genetic interaction with components of the Notch pathway, suggesting that eogt might be a modulator of the Notch pathway. More recently, loss-of-function mutations of EOGT were identified in an autosomal recessive form of Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS), a disease which is also caused by dominant mutations in several Notch pathway components. Despite these observations, to my knowledge, no functional links had been established between Eogt and mammalian Notch signaling. To address this issue, the authors generated germline and conditional Eogt alleles and showed that although Eogt<sup>-/-</sup> animals are viable, they exhibit phenotypes compatible with impaired Notch signaling during retinal angiogenesis and genetically interact with Notch pathway components during this process. Conditional loss of Eogt in endothelial cells indicated that the observed phenotypes are primarily, although not exclusively, caused by loss of Eogt from endothelial cells. The authors complement their in vivo observations with a number of cell-based assays and provide strong evidence that the vascular phenotype observed in the EOGT mutants is mediated through its effect on Notch1-DLL4 binding and signaling. Of note, EOGT does not seem to affect JAG1-Notch1 binding and signaling. Finally, by introducing mutations in four conserved O-GlcNAc sites outside of the core ligand-binding domain of Notch1, the authors show that O-GlcNAc moieties on specific EGF repeats of mammalian Notch1 likely enhance Notch1-DLL4 interaction. It is somewhat surprising that EOGT-null mice fail to recapitulate any of the gross clinical pathologies observed in AOS patients, and it might be a genetic background issue. Nevertheless, the study proves that EOGT is a regulator of the Notch1 signaling during mouse angiogenesis and indicates that addition of O-GlcNAc to the Notch1 receptor promotes its binding to and signaling in response to DLL4 but not JAG1.</p><p>In my opinion, the manuscript addresses an important biological question, with potential implications to a human disease. The authors provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of mammalian Notch signaling by EOGT. The major conclusions of the study are well supported by the data. It might have been better to introduce T-to-V mutations in EGF repeats 10 and 17 instead of T-to-A, as T is more similar to V than to A, and therefore the chance for seeing a result due to altered amino acid structure rather than lack of sugar might be somewhat higher in T-to-A mutation. However, the severe decrease in O-GlcNAc Western blot band on mutant Notch1 and all the other data in the manuscript do not leave much doubt that the observed effects are due to the loss of O-GlcNAc saccharides.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic></p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph: The reference &quot;Shaheen, 2011&quot; seems out of place here since the cited article does not mention EOGT. It seems that the authors/word-processor may have inadvertently swapped &quot;Shaheen, 2013&quot; from earlier in the paragraph, with this one.</p><p>2) Subsection “Loss of Eogt phenocopies Notch1 haploinsufficiency and compound mutants display an enhanced vascular phenotype”, last paragraph: Please rewrite these sentences to address the following issues: (1) The authors write &quot;data not shown&quot;, but they have shown quantifications for the hypomorphic alleles in 3B and 3C. (2) I do not agree with the authors' interpretation of the genetic interaction studies. First, in the case of Eogt interaction with Rbpj+/- and N1+/-, both components of the genetic interaction have a phenotype by themselves, one functional copy of Rbpj and N1 remain, and the interaction is not synergistic. Therefore, it is hard to draw conclusions. If Eogt and N1/Rbpj acted in parallel and independently of each other, the authors might still have seen similar results. Second, the results with the hypomorphic alleles are stronger and strongly suggest that EOGT regulates Notch pathway in this context (because they don't have a phenotype by themselves). However, it does not inform us about the actual target of EOGT in the pathway. Even if O-GlcNAc residues on DLL4 were important, a similar genetic interaction might have been observed. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that &quot;EOGT modification of NOTCH1 is important in regulating the Notch signaling pathway.&quot;</p><p>3) Subsection “Eogt regulates Notch pathway target genes in ECs and ligand-induced Notch signaling”, first paragraph: &quot;These results suggested that EOGT affects Notch signaling mediated by DLL4&quot; – although this is a reasonable conclusion at the end of the paper, the results presented up to this point only suggest that Notch signaling is suppressed but do not seem to provide an indication that the effect is limited to one particular ligand.</p><p>4) Subsection “Eogt regulates Notch pathway target genes in ECs and ligand-induced Notch signaling”, third paragraph: an siRNA.</p><p>5) Subsection “EOGT regulates DLL1 and DLL4 binding to NOTCH1”: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, it looks like DLL4 binding is slightly decreased. But in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, the decrease does not seem to be statistically significant. Please clarify.</p><p>6) Subsection “O-GlcNAcylation of NOTCH1 promotes DLL4-Notch1 interaction”, first paragraph: &quot;Thus it appears that multiple sites are O-GlcNAcylated in NOTCH1.&quot; Although this conclusion is correct, I think an equally if not more important conclusion is that the consensus is probably too wide. Notch1 has more than 20 predicted sites or 11 sites based on the more stringent consensus sequence. However, mutating 4 sites almost abolished the O-GlcNAc band in Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This strongly suggests that only some sites are modified.</p><p>7) Discussion, first paragraph: The logic of this section is not clear to me. Yes, removing one enzyme should not affect other sugars, but I don't understand how this leads to the last sentence. I suggest that instead of these sentences, the authors add a few sentences about the previous two studies on the fly eogt from their labs, mention that eogt null flies did not have Notch phenotypes, and eogt RNAi in the wing showed some genetic interaction with Notch pathway components and then end by what they have. In my opinion, this should not affect the novelty of their work at all, but provides a better framework for the paper. It will also serve as an example to the readers that when a posttranslational modification regulates mammalian Notch signaling in a tissue-specific manner, it might not show overt Notch loss of function phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>8) Discussion, second paragraph: &quot;DLL4 constitutes the critical Notch ligand in regulating angiogenesis and vascular development&quot;. This sentence gives the impression that DLL4 is the only important Notch ligand in vascular development. However, JAG1 is also important in vascular development. Please modify to make the sentence more accurate.</p><p>9) Discussion, third paragraph: The authors have previously reported that at least in mammalian cells, O-GlcNAc on EGF repeats can be extended by the addition of a galactose. Given that in this paragraph the authors highlight some similarities between the functions of Eogt and Fringe proteins, and because Fringe adds the second sugar not the first one, it is tempting to speculate that the Eogt phenotype might result from the loss of galactose. Of note, to my knowledge, this elongation has not been observed in flies (for example, see Harvey et al., JBC, 2016). Therefore, this hypothesis can also explain why eogt mutant flies do not show any obvious Notch loss of function phenotypes. It will be up to the authors whether they want to incorporate this hypothesis in their Discussion or not.</p><p>10) Discussion, third paragraph: &quot;JAG1-Notch1 interactions were not evident in our assays employing Eogt-deficient.…&quot; Instead of evident, I think affected or something like that should be used.</p><p>11) Discussion, last paragraph: &quot;we generated mice homologous for Eogt gene&quot;. Homozygous?</p><p>12) Subsection “Materials and mice”, first paragraph: It is hard for the reader to understand from the rest of the article exactly which Cre mouse line was used to generate the global KO (I'm assuming it was Ayu1-Cre). I suggest rewriting this sentence more clearly. Also, in the first paragraph of the subsection “Generation of Eogt-targeted mice” the authors use &quot;Alternatively&quot; to describe the generation of global knockout mice. Do they mean &quot;In addition&quot;?</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: Please show a scale bar for the schematic so that the predicted length of the Southern blot bands can be estimated.</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: Please provide labels for wt versus mutant in the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The biology of Notch signalling in development and disease, and in vascular morphogenesis in particular, is highly relevant and of broad general interests. Understanding the multiple layers of transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation of Notch signalling is a major challenge, and the present work adds by addressing the role of O-GlcNacylation via the enzyme EOGT.</p><p>The authors study effects of general or endothelial specific loss of function using mouse mutants and the model of post-natal retinal vascularisation. The same model has been extensively studied and the effects of loss of function of the ligands Dll1, Dll4, Jagged1, the receptors Notch1, and various modifiers as well as signalling components including RBPJ are very well understood. The authors here demonstrate a very mild hypervascularization, claiming similarities to other Notch mutants. In addition, the general EOGT knockout shows reduced aSMA staining indicating deficient smooth muscle coverage. Furthermore, the authors claim reduced vessel integrity. The authors then move on to investigate the mechanism and identify reduced Dll1 or Dll4 mediated Notch activation, correlating with reduced Notch O-GlcNAcylation. Various cell lines including Hela, HEK, CHO are used for an array of assays to confirm reduced signalling, ligand binding and investigate whether Dll4 and Jagged1 show similarly reduced binding when EOGT is deficient. Finally, the authors show by mutation of the putative glycosylation sites the these indeed affect Dll4, but not Jagged1.</p><p>Overall, this is a potentially interesting piece of work, mostly clearly written and concise. However, I have several major concerns that reduce my confidence in the conclusions and in the general relevance of the findings. The retinal analysis shows a very mild if any phenotype, and this is not at all comparable to other pathway mutants.</p><p>The quality of the images, magnifications, microscopy technique etc. undermine the ability to appreciate what the authors claim. For example, the filopodia quantification images do not allow visualisation of filopodia therefore making it difficult to appreciate the quantifications.</p><p>The same is true for the leakage data. This is not a standard BRB assay and what the authors show as leakage cannot be appreciated in those images. Why would this be focal? Not diffuse?</p><p>Why do the authors then choose Hela, HEK and CHO cells for functional studies, with the odd choice of GAPDH shRNA as control?</p><p>The WB panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are oddly assembled with mismatch between the grey line and the actual gel cuts. I am not suggesting this is attempted image manipulation, but it is either not careful enough or indeed indicative of multiple gels that are assembled together. This needs clarification.</p><p>The evidence of Notch1 O-GlcNacylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> also seems over interpreted as co-migration is not evident.</p><p>The authors also use 3 different GSI, but do not mention why and where in the text.</p><p>The binding assay with beads needs Notch null controls as the lack of O-GlcNacylation will not be Notch specific and other effects might interfere with the adherent of the beads.</p><p>Overall, although I am generally positive about the topic and the ideas in the work, I feel this study needs a complete revision with careful analysis of EOGT biochemistry and effects in endothelial cells in vitro, and a much better illustration of the in vivo effects.</p><p>Also, whether this is Notch1 selective or generally affects Notch receptor affinities, importantly also in vascular smooth muscle, needs to be addressed. Furthermore, as also ligands have these EGF repeats, it would seem important to include analysis of potential effects here. As it stands, this work is not equally convincing as the published effects of other glycosylation enzymes in Notch biology and requires substantial additional work to achieve the required quality. Given the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> for revisions, I feel that the extent of work required to clarify and improve is beyond what would constitute a normal revision.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;O-GlcNAc on NOTCH1 EGF Repeats Regulates Ligand-Induced Notch Signaling and Vascular Development in Mammals&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the value of restructuring the manuscript and data organisation, and believe the core conclusions are sufficiently supported by your new experiments. They also state your work exposes an interesting contrast between the functions of Fringe proteins and EOGT. Previous studies showed that addition of GlcNAc to O-linked fucose on Notch1 by Fringe proteins promotes DLL-induced signaling and simultaneously reduces JAG1-mediated signaling. However, your work identifies that addition of O-linked GlcNAc to Notch1 by EOGT seems to promote DLL-Notch1 binding and signaling without reducing JAG1-Notch1 binding. Therefore, although the EOGT loss of function phenotypes in vivo are rather weak, the reviewers agree that linking the function of EOGT to mammalian Notch signaling for the first time and this nuance in ligand-specific activity of EOGT will make your paper of significant interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readership.</p><p>Having said that, we ask you to make the following minor revisions, which should not necessarily require further experiments:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the western blots showing EOGT expression are poor. It is difficult to discern endogenous EOGT band, because it is obscured by a non-specific band. It is important to corroborate the (extent of) ablation of EOGT expression in the shRNA-expressing cell lines, but it is difficult to evaluate this in the present data.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the cells are indicated to stably express siRNAs. Should this be shRNAs? Please clarify/correct.</p><p>3) We recommend to revise <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> based on Rana et al. (JBC, 2011), which reported the identification of O-glucose glycans on 17 EGF repeats of the mouse Notch1.</p><p>4) Subsection “Eogt regulates Notch pathway target genes in ECs and ligand-induced Notch signaling”: &quot;In contrast, Eogt-/- ECs showed a significant decrease in the induction of Notch target genes stimulated by DLL4, but not JAG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).&quot; It might be more accurate to say that &quot;DLL4 fails to induce Notch target genes Hey1 and Hes1 in Eogt-/- endothelial cells, but JAG1 results in a robust induction of these genes&quot;.</p><p>5) You cite a proteomic study (Alfaro et al., PNAS, 2012) that identified a cohort of membrane proteins modified by GlcNac. One of these proteins identified was <italic>Notch2</italic>. It would be useful to add a discussion on this to the manuscript: can EOGT-mediated modification of <italic>Notch2</italic> explain the phenotypes observed in the current manuscript?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24419.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We note that Reviewer #1 concludes “Nevertheless, the study proves that EOGT is a regulator of the Notch1 signaling during mouse angiogenesis….” and that “the major conclusions are well supported by the data”.

Conditionally removing NOTCH1, DLL4 or RBP-Jk has a dramatic effect on retinal angiogenesis but removing Lunatic Fringe gives a mild phenotype (Benedito et al. 2009). Since the latter report, the consequences of removing any other glycosyltransferase in the Notch pathway have not been published. As explained in the revised text, our experiments removed only one of three classes of O-glycans, so we were expecting a very mild phenotype. Both O-fucose and O-glucose glycans are important in promoting Notch signaling in many contexts, including angiogenesis in the case of the O-fucose glycans that are extended by LFNG.

The combined data convincingly demonstrate changes consistent with reduced Notch signaling. We have included a diagram of the predicted O-glycans based on known consensus sequences in the extracellular domain of mouse Notch1 to highlight the point that knocking out EOGT removes only one of three types of O-glycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>The quality of the images, magnifications, microscopy technique etc. undermine the ability to appreciate what the authors claim.

However, in the case of a milder phenotype, it looks focal rather than diffuse. Please refer to the following literature: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> (SIRS vs. SIRS+2-BP), Richard S. Beard Jr. et al. Nature Communications: 12823 (2016) doi:10.1038/ncomms12823. Non-diffusive sulfo-NHS-biotin staining in retinal vasculature was also reported (Xuwen Liu Am. J. Pathol. 2016). Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin reacts with proteins that have primary amines. Therefore, a small amount of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, once it is extravasated, will be easily trapped in the extracellular matrix or on cell surface proteins. That may be the reason the staining patterns differ depending on the amount of the tracers leaked from vessels. To clarify the extravascular sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin staining, we added 3D images in higher resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and moved the original images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. As an independent measure for increased vascular permeability, we performed staining for fibrinogen, as analyzed in Notch3-/- retinas (Henshall TL et al. Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.

We note that Benedito et al. (2009) also used HeLa cells to investigate Fringe effects in co-culture Notch signaling assays. Also, it was important to show that effects we saw were not confined to a single cell line. The combined experiments provide comprehensive data that reducing EOGT causes a reduction in Notch1 activation (HeLa), reduced Notch1 signaling (CHO) and reduced Notch1 binding to Delta ligands, but no change to Jagged1 binding (CHO and HEK-293T). We also isolated endothelial cells (EC) from <italic>Eogt</italic>[-/-] mouse brain and lung and showed that Notch pathway target gene transcripts are reduced in <italic>Eogt</italic>[-/-] versus <italic>Eogt</italic>[+/+] ECs (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>The technical concerns of the reviewer have been addressed as follows:</p><p><italic>The WB panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are oddly assembled with mismatch between the grey line and the actual gel cuts. I am not suggesting this is attempted image manipulation, but it is either not careful enough or indeed indicative of multiple gels that are assembled together. This needs clarification.</italic> </p><p>The western blots in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were performed on sections of PVDF membrane cut from a single membrane and probed with the relevant antibody. The panel probed for Notch1 was stripped and probed for O-GlcNAc. The single membrane was then reassembled for the figure. We now present the panels separately and explain more clearly how the western blots were probed.</p><p><italic>The evidence of Notch1 O-GlcNacylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> also seems over interpreted as co-migration is not evident.</italic> </p><p>Co-migration was evident from the markers on the original gels which are now included in the figure.</p><p><italic>The authors also use 3 different GSI, but do not mention why and where in the text.</italic> </p><p>We used different GSIs for no particular reason other than they were on hand in our two laboratories. It is now made clear in the figure legends which GSI was used in each experiment. L-685,458 was used in some experiments but not those shown.</p><p><italic>The binding assay with beads needs Notch null controls as the lack of O-GlcNacylation will not be Notch specific and other effects might interfere with the adherent of the beads.</italic> </p><p>We now included NOTCH1-null control data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. The fact that Notch1 transfection increases JAG1- and DLL4-bead binding provides good evidence that our assay indeed measures NOTCH1 recognized by DLL4 and JAG1. In contrast to <italic>Notch1</italic>-null cells, DLL4 binding but not JAG1 binding was markedly diminished in <italic>Notch1</italic>- transfected <italic>Eogt</italic>-null cells. Similarly, removal of O-GlcNAc sites in Notch1 decreased DLL4 binding. These data clearly show that the specific effect of O-GlcNAc on NOTCH1 which affects DLL4-NOTCH1 binding.</p><p><italic>Overall, although I am generally positive about the topic and the ideas in the work, I feel this study needs a complete revision with careful analysis of EOGT biochemistry and effects in endothelial cells in vitro, and a much better illustration of the in vivo effects.</italic> </p><p>Now the manuscript is completely revised by performing additional analysis of the effect of EOGT on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), including the improved biochemical data for Notch1 O-GlcNAcylation by EOGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), improved images (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>), additional data on retinas (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, 7E, 7F</xref>), and better illustration of in vivoeffects in the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>Also, whether this is Notch1 selective or generally affects Notch receptor affinities, importantly also in vascular smooth muscle, needs to be addressed. Furthermore, as also ligands have these EGF repeats, it would seem important to include analysis of potential effects here. As it stands, this work is not equally convincing as the published effects of other glycosylation enzymes in Notch biology and requires substantial additional work to achieve the required quality. Given the policy of eLife for revisions, I feel that the extent of work required to clarify and improve is beyond what would constitute a normal revision.</italic> </p><p>Eogt[-/-] retinas were analyzed for vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes by staining with aSMA and NG2 antibodies in P15. The results revealed that the coverage with vascular smooth muscle and pericyte investment are unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>), which suggests that cellular basis for impaired vascular integrity is distinct from Notch3[-/-] retina (subsection “EOGT is required for retinal vascular integrity”, last paragraph) and thus Notch3 appears to function without Eogt in this context. As also suggested by the reviewer, we analyzed the requirement for EOGT in ligand function. EOGT-null cells were transfected to express Notch ligands and their ability to send signals was compared with wild-type cells. The results showed that EOGT is dispensable for the ability of DLL4 and JAG1 to send signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and 8D</xref>).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Having said that, we ask you to make the following minor revisions, which should not necessarily require further experiments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the western blots showing EOGT expression are poor. It is difficult to discern endogenous EOGT band, because it is obscured by a non-specific band. It is important to corroborate the (extent of) ablation of EOGT expression in the shRNA-expressing cell lines, but it is difficult to evaluate this in the present data.</italic> </p><p>As is often the case with glycosyltransferases, endogenous EOGT levels are too low to be readily detected by Western analysis in CHO and HeLa cell lysates. Similarly, it has been shown that levels of glycosyltransferase gene transcripts may not reflect protein levels or enzyme activity. Thus, we decided that the best test of EOGT knockdown was reduction in</p><p>O-GlcNAc (the product of EOGT activity), as detected by the anti-O-GlcNAc Ab CTD110.6. Western blots of each construct are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>. All constructs showed reduced O-GlcNAc signal, consistent with the data from an independent experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> for TA197 and TA198 shRNAs. The latter constructs were the most effective at reducing ligand-induced NOTCH1 activation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and so subsequent experiments were pursued with these two constructs. This explanation has been included in the revised text (subsection “Knockdown of EOGT reduces Notch signaling”, first paragraph).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24419.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24419.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24419.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24419-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>Characterization of <italic>Eogt</italic>-siRNA CHO cells were published in Tashima and Stanley, JBC, (2014) as mentioned in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the cells are indicated to stably express siRNAs.
