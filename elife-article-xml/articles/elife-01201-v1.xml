Depletion of PTBP2 in developing mouse cortex leads to degeneration of these tissues over the first three postnatal weeks, a time when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits. Cultured <italic>Ptbp2</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons exhibit the same initial viability as wild type, with proper neurite outgrowth and marker expression. However, these mutant cells subsequently fail to mature and die after a week in culture. Transcriptome-wide analyses identify many exons that share a pattern of mis-regulation in the mutant brains, where isoforms normally found in adults are precociously expressed in the developing embryo. These transcripts encode proteins affecting neurite growth, pre- and post-synaptic assembly, and synaptic transmission. Our results define a new genetic regulatory program, where PTBP2 acts to temporarily repress expression of adult protein isoforms until the final maturation of the neuron.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01201.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01201.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01201.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells within the developing brain undergo an extended period of maturation. A neuronal progenitor cell must first migrate to the proper place within the brain and then develop long extensions that become the axon and dendrites used by the mature neuron to communicate with other cells. Finally, the synapses that connect neurons with other neurons must be established. Multiple mechanisms are needed to ensure that all the proteins involved in this process are expressed when and where they are needed.</p><p>The production of a protein begins with a region of DNA being transcribed to produce an RNA transcript that consists of segments called exons separated by segments called introns. This transcript then undergoes a process called splicing that involves the introns being removed and the exons being joined together to form a messenger RNA molecule that can be translated into protein. Specialized RNA binding proteins regulate the splicing process, and most RNA transcripts are subject to a form of splicing called alternative splicing that allows a single gene to express more than one messenger RNA molecule and hence more than one protein product.</p><p>As neuronal progenitor cells in the brain are induced to mature into neurons, many RNA transcripts are seen to change their splicing patterns. At the same time, the level of a regulatory RNA binding protein called PTBP1 decreases and the level of a related protein called PTBP2 increases. Now Li et al. have studied mutant mice that lack PTBP2, and have found that structures of the forebrain that normally undergo extensive development after birth instead experience tissue degeneration when PTBP2 is absent. Similarly, when neurons lacking PTPB2 are grown in culture, they fail to develop correctly and die.</p><p>Li et al. also found that messenger RNAs from many genes involved in postnatal brain development—affecting processes such as the growth of axons and dendrites and the formation of synapses—exhibit defective alternative splicing in the mutant mice. Specifically, protein variants that would normally be expressed only in adult brains were being expressed much earlier.</p><p>By inhibiting the expression of adult forms of proteins until neurons have matured, PTBP2 plays an essential role in controlling the brain’s early development. Further work is now required to determine how individual changes in messenger RNA and protein structure controlled by PTBP2 might alter protein function between immature and mature neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01201.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01201.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA binding protein</kwd><kwd>neuronal development</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brain &amp; Behaviour Research Foundation (formerly NARSAD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Qin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 MH096807, R01 GM084317, R01 GM49662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Sika</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PTBP2 ensures that adult protein variants are expressed only in mature neurons through regulation of alternative splicing during early neuronal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Compared to other cells, neurons undergo an unusually long period of maturation as they differentiate. In rodents, the time required for neuronal progenitors to become fully functional neurons can be many days, during which cells will exit mitosis, migrate to a proper location, grow initial neurites to be defined in their polarity, fully extend these axons and dendrites to their proper targets, and finally assemble active synaptic connections and circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>). A wide variety of genetic mechanisms ensure that these events occur in proper sequence and induce cell death when a process is incorrect. This developmental pathway is best understood at the level of transcriptional regulation where important signaling molecules, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications are implicated in lineage commitment, cell survival, and establishment of synaptic connections. However, many aspects of the genetic control of neuronal development are not understood.</p><p>Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing is a common mechanism for genetic control in the nervous system, where many proteins important for neuronal differentiation and function are made in diverse isoforms through changes in splice site choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norris and Calarco, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yap and Makeyev, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng and Black, 2013</xref>). Changes of splicing pattern are regulated by <italic>trans-</italic>acting RNA-binding proteins that can be expressed in a temporal- or cell-type-specific manner to enhance or silence particular splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Manley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalsotra and Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braunschweig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kornblihtt et al., 2013</xref>). Splicing regulators generally control large numbers of target transcripts and several have been shown to be essential for proper brain development or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gehman et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charizanis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At the onset of neuronal differentiation, there is a change in the expression of two polypyrimidine tract binding proteins, PTBP1 (also known as PTB or HnRNP I) and PTBP2 (also known as nPTB or brPTB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>). Early in development, PTBP2 is present at low levels in neuronal progenitor cells (NPC), but is sharply upregulated when NPCs are induced to differentiate into post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, PTBP1 is expressed at high levels in neural progenitor cells, glia, and other non-neuronal cells, but is repressed in differentiating neurons coincident with the increase in PTBP2 concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Polydorides et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). The repression of PTBP1 is mediated by the miRNA miR124 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>), which leads to the induction of PTBP2 expression through additional post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spellman et al., 2007</xref>). SiRNA mediated depletion of PTBP1 stimulates PTBP2 expression and can be sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). However, the role of PTBP2 in differentiating neurons is not understood.</p><p>PTBP1 and PTBP2 are encoded by paralogous genes and are very similar in peptide sequence, especially in their four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), giving them similar RNA-binding properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oberstrass et al., 2005</xref>). The best-characterized function of the two PTB proteins is in the regulation of alternative splicing patterns. PTBP1 and PTBP2 bind to CU-rich regulatory sequences within or adjacent to many alternative exons to repress or activate their splicing, or sometimes to cause intron retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kafasla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>). However the two proteins differ in their splicing regulatory activities. Some exons, such as exon 8A of the CaV1.2 calcium channel transcript (<italic>Cacna1c</italic>), are more strongly repressed by PTBP1 than PTBP2, whereas other exons, such as exon 18 of the PSD95 transcript (<italic>Dlg4</italic>), are affected by both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Neither the mechanisms underlying the different responses of exons to the two PTB proteins, nor the roles of their partially overlapping splicing programs in neuronal development are known.</p><p>To identify roles of PTBP2 in the developing mouse brain, we used conditional gene targeting. We show that the loss of PTBP2 leads to a catastrophic failure in neuronal maturation and to the misexpression of many protein isoforms affecting neurite growth, synapse formation and synaptic transmission. We find that PTBP2 and the program of splicing it controls are critical to both embryonic and postnatal brain development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of PTBP2 in all neurons has limited effects on brain morphology but leads to lethality at birth</title><p>PTBP2 is induced as nestin-positive neuronal progenitors exit mitosis and begin to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>). This can be seen in the embryonic cortex and olfactory bulb where proliferating cells in the subventricular zone are stained for nestin, but more mature cells populating the outer cortical layers have lost nestin expression but gained PTBP2 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In targeted tissues, Cre-mediated deletion of exon 4 introduces a reading frame shift to render the allele null. Correct targeting in ES cells and germ line transmission were confirmed by Southern blot and PCR of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). A <italic>Ptbp2</italic> null allele (<italic>Ptbp2</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup>) was generated in crosses of <italic>Ptbp2</italic><sup><italic>loxP/+</italic></sup> mice to a germline-active Cre transgenic line <italic>EIIaCre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lakso et al., 1996</xref>).

Immunoblots of E18.5 whole brain lysates confirm the complete absence of PTBP2 in homozygous mutant mice and reduced protein in heterozygous mice compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

The neocortex showed normal thickness and laminar organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Immunostaining for a variety of neuronal markers, including pan-neuronal markers (Map2, TuJ1), interneuron subtype markers (calbindin and calrectinin), a marker for proliferating nuclei (phosphoHistone3), and for glial and radial glial markers (GFAP and RC2) all showed no significant differences between mutant and control littermate brains (data not shown). To assess possible defects in neuronal migration, we examined cortical layer markers (Tbr2, Brn2 and Cux1) and again did not observe any significant differences between mutant and control brains (data not shown).

Several major axonal tracts were either absent or significantly diminished in the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> mutant brain; the internal capsule, external capsule, and the lateral olfactory tract were reduced, and the anterior commissure was absent in the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> mutant. These major axonal tracts connect distant regions of the developing brain, such as cortex, thalamus, and the brainstem, and are essential to basic physiological functions such as respiratory control. These axonal defects may thus contribute to the neonatal lethal phenotype. However, quantification of this phenotype and linking it to neonatal death will require more extensive analysis of mice at a variety of developmental timepoints.

By P14, their average weight was less than half of control pups, and they all died around weaning age (P18-21). The cause of the <italic>Ptbp2</italic>-EmxKO pups’ failure to thrive was apparent upon dissection of their brains. The <italic>Ptbp2</italic>-EmxKO cortex appeared relatively normal at birth. However, while the control cortices thicken and grow in size during the first three postnatal weeks, largely due to development of the neuropil and white matter, the EmxKO cortex displayed widespread neuronal death and degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Brain structures not subject to PTBP2 loss, such as striatum, developed normally. The knockout tissue showed a progressive loss of structural integrity making it difficult to section and stain. Comparing coronal sections of mutant and control brains at P5, the EmxKO cortex was substantially thinner than control cortices. Nissl staining revealed widespread pyknotic nuclei within the EmxKO cortical plate as a result of neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Further staining with more specific cell death markers showed evidence of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death but was difficult to quantify in the degenerating tissue (data not shown). Understanding the mechanisms initiating cell death in these tissues will require additional analyses. By P11, when control cortex had substantially thickened with well-defined cellular layers, the EmxKO cortex had further degenerated with additional loss of tissue integrity.

To assess whether neural development proceeded to later stages, such as synapse formation, in the absence of PTBP2, we examined the expression of several important synaptic proteins in the brains of E18 <italic>Ptbp2</italic> null mice. The mutant brains exhibited strikingly lower levels of multiple synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), including PSD95, the neurotransmitter receptor NR2B, the major synaptic vesicle protein Synaptophysin (SYP), and the trans-synaptic scaffolding protein Neuroligin1 (NLG1). Other synaptic proteins, such as the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Cask and the Glutamate Receptor GluR2 also declined.

These include the initial extension of multiple immature neurites (days in vitro, DIV1-2), establishment of axon–dendrite polarity (DIV2-4), axon and dendrite outgrowth (DIV4-15), and finally synapse formation and maturation (after DIV10). Immediately after dissociation and plating, cortical neurons from E15-16 <italic>Ptbp2</italic>-NesKO mice exhibited similar viability to control neurons. The <italic>Ptbp2</italic>-KO neurons grew extensive neurites during the first week in culture and were indistinguishable from control cultures when stained with the dendritic marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Using cutoffs of a Sepscore of 0.345 for the arrays and a 10% change in PSI for the RNAseq, we identified 359 PTBP2 target cassette exons by array (Supplementary file 2 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>])) and 597 exons by RNAseq (Supplementary file 3 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>]). These included 92 exons found by both methods. Exons identified by RNAseq but not microarray included exons that were not represented on the array, exons exhibiting complex patterns of splicing, and a few exons where particular exon probes seemed to fail on the array. Alternative splicing events identified by array but not RNAseq included exons that did not pass the deltaPSI and/or overall expression filters, and a few exons that were absent from the SpliceTrap database.

These data indicate that the majority of isoform changes identified in the knockout are likely to be directly regulated by PTBP2. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the analyzed brains developed to E18 in the absence of PTBP2 and it is expected that some splicing changes will be indirect effects of other changes in the developing mice.</p><p>Validated PTBP2-dependent splicing events include many transcripts with important neuronal functions, including the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD95 (<italic>Dlg4</italic>) and gephryn (<italic>Gphn</italic>), the neurotransmitter receptor GABA<sub>A</sub> Rγ2 (<italic>Gabg2</italic>), and the key calcium signaling molecules CamK2a and CamK2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AB</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>). As a general assessment of the PTBP2 regulatory network, gene ontology analyses were performed on the set of PTBP2-dependent splicing changes relative to the set of transcripts identified by RNAseq as expressed in mouse brain. Biological Process annotations that were significantly enriched in the PTBP2 target set (p&lt;0.001) included ‘regulation of transcription’, ‘synaptic transmission’, ‘transmission of nerve impulse’, ‘synapse organization’, ‘cell morphogenesis’, ‘endocytosis’, and ‘neuron projection development’ (Supplementary file 4 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>]). All of these functions are dynamically changing during the period of neuronal maturation when PTBP2-dependent defects are observed.</p><p>We also analyzed the RNA-seq data using CuffDiff to identify changes in overall transcript expression (rather than splicing) in the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> mutant brain (Supplementary file 5 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>]). Some of these transcripts are likely to be reduced through direct PTBP2 effects on post-transcriptional processes. These include five transcripts containing PTBP2-dependent exons with mapped CLIP clusters whose change in splicing is predicted to lead to nonsense mediated decay. Other changes in transcript expression are likely to be an indirect result of developmental defects associated with the loss of PTBP2. Gene ontology analyses were performed on genes exhibiting greater than a twofold change in the knockout brain (Supplementary files 6 and 7 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>]). Relative to all transcripts expressed in wild-type brains, upregulated transcripts were highly enriched for GO terms associated with innate immunity and the inflammatory response (p&lt;0.001). Given the phenotype of the mice, these functional enrichments likely result from the degeneration seen in the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> knockout brains, rather than direct PTBP2 targeting of the transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts were only weakly enriched for particular bioprocess terms. Only terms related to cell adhesion had enrichment p values below 0.01. Terms related to axonogenesis and axon choice point recognition were less significantly enriched among the down-regulated transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PTBP2 controls a splicing regulatory program specific to early neuronal maturation</title><p>We find that many of the identified PTBP2 targets display a common pattern of temporal regulation in the developing wild-type brain.

To examine splicing within a more defined population of cells coincident with the normal downregulation of PTBP2, we isolated RNA from the EmxKO cortex for RNAseq at P1. These analyses identified splicing changes in many of the targets previously identified in the NesKO mice (Supplementary file 8 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>]). As seen in the NesKO at E18, the mutually exclusive exons 9a and 9b of the dynamin1 (<italic>Dnm1</italic>) transcript also display aberrant splicing in the EmxKO cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6A and 7A</xref>). The adult exon 9a was spliced at significantly higher levels (79%) in the EmxKO than in control mice (56%). The embryonic and adult isoforms of dynamin1 are functionally distinct and their activity has been investigated in mutant mice, where a missense mutation in exon 9a results in impaired synaptic function, seizures and other behavioral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boumil et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, PTBP2 is playing a key role in the regulation in this postnatal switch in Dnm1 isoforms.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01201.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Exons can respond to the loss of PTBP2 differently in E18 whole brain or P1 cortex.</title><p>Genome browser tracks of aligned RNAseq reads from E18 whole brain, NesKO (green) and wild type (pink), and from P1 cortex, EmxKO (blue) and wild type (yellow).

These include an exon in B-raf (Braf), a protein kinase in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>). This exon is normally included in no more than 25% of the total Braf transcript. In contrast, 60% of Braf mRNA in E18 null brain, and 41% of the mRNA in P5 EmxKO cortex contains the exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The PITPbeta (phosphatidylinositol transfer protein beta, <italic>Pitpnb</italic>) transcript, involved in inter-organelle lipid transfer and inositol signaling, contains an exon that can be skipped or included to produce alternative C-termini of the final protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cockcroft, 2001</xref>). In wild-type mouse brain, this exon is included in less than 10% of the Pitpnb mRNA at all points of normal development. However, in the absence of PTBP2 splicing of this exon increases to more than 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These and other exons appear to be especially sensitive to loss of PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although reduced in expression after differentiation, PTBP2 continues to be present at moderate levels into adulthood. This remaining PTBP2 may serve to maintain the partial repression of some exons. In addition to the precocious expression of adult isoforms, the deleterious effect of PTBP2 loss may also result from the aberrantly high expression of isoforms normally present at lower levels.</p><p>In addition to splicing changes seen in the NesKO whole brain, new PTBP2-dependent splicing events were identified in EmxKO cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7BC</xref>, Supplementary file 8 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>]). The zinc finger protein transcript <italic>Zfp277</italic> contains two exons whose splicing increases substantially in postnatal cortex compared to E18 whole brain. Interestingly, one of these exons shows greater induction in the Emx-cre KO than in wildtype, indicating that it is partially repressed by PTBP2 in this tissue. In contrast, this exon remains fully repressed in E18 brain even in the absence of PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Conversely, several exons in the <italic>Mical3</italic> transcript are repressed in P1 cortex but not E18 whole brain. One of these exons loses this cortical repression in the absence of PTBP2, even though it is unaffected by PTBP2 depletion at E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These exons showing PTBP2 dependence in P1 cortex but not E18 whole brain indicate that the PTBP2 target transcripts are subject to other splicing regulatory programs that are also changing during development, with exons exhibiting different regulatory factor dependencies at different developmental stages.</p><p>The many adult isoforms misregulated in the <italic>Ptbp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos greatly expands earlier observations of exon 18 of the <italic>Dlg4</italic> (PSD95) transcript, whose skipping generates a non-productive transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. The splicing of this exon is required for PSD95 protein expression, and its repression by PTBP2 keeps PSD95 levels low until late in neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). We now find that this exon is part of a large program of coordinated splicing changes. This PTBP2-driven splicing transition takes place subsequent to the earlier splicing switch driven by PTBP1 depletion as neurons are born (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01201.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Changes in the expression of the two PTB proteins define three splicing regulatory states during neuronal differentiation.</title><p>Neuronal progenitor cells primarily express PTBP1.

Other exons that are sensitive to both proteins maintain their repression during the early stages of neuron differentiation, when PTBP2 is high. When these cells finally mature and form synapses, PTBP2 is downregulated. This leads to changes in a splicing regulatory program that includes exons in Cam Kinase 2 and Dynamin 1.

The loss of PTBP2 in the complete CNS or in particular neuronal lineages does not greatly affect lineage commitment or developmental patterning. However, postmitotic neuronal maturation and survival are severely impaired. Mice with Emx-cre driven depletion of PTBP2 from developing cortex survive through about 3 weeks of postnatal development during which time the cortex degenerates. Neuronal cell death is also seen in <italic>Ptbp2</italic> knockout neurons in culture. These cells initiate differentiation from progenitor cells and progress through the first stages of post-mitotic differentiation, with the extension of neuritic processes and expression of early neuronal markers. However, they subsequently undergo a catastrophic failure in the second to third week of culture and die prior to synaptogenesis. Thus, the PTBP2-driven splicing program plays a key role in the maturation and survival of neurons.</p><p>In keeping with the neuronal maturation defect, we find PTBP2 target exons in many transcripts affecting neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, synaptic assembly, and synaptic function. In the mutant embryos, a large number of genes exhibit early expression of spliced isoforms that are normally expressed only in the adult brain. For these genes, the presence of PTBP2 in developing cells serves to prevent expression of a functionally distinct adult isoform until late in neuronal maturation. This pattern of regulation is seen for NCAM, Cam Kinase II, drebrin, dynamin1, Magi1, Kcnq2, Calcineurin and the previously identified PTBP2 target PSD95 (<italic>Dlg4</italic>). These proteins all play key roles in the development and function of the neuron including both its pre and postsynaptic specializations.</p><p>PTBP2 is present at low levels in nestin-positive neuronal progenitor cells. When these cells exit mitosis and begin differentiation, PTBP1 expression is repressed and PTBP2 expression is induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>). PTBP2 levels remain high in the differentiating cells and then drop late in maturation, with adult neurons expressing moderate levels. It was previously shown that some exons are more strongly affected by PTBP1 than by PTBP2, whereas for other exons the regulatory effect of the two proteins is nearly equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>). The expression profile of the PTB proteins thus creates three regulatory states during neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). PTBP1 maintains repression of many exons in neuronal progenitor cells. As cells begin to differentiate and shift to PTBP2 expression, exons that are more sensitive to PTBP1 begin to be spliced. These include the <italic>c-src</italic> N1 exon and exon 8A from the <italic>Cacna1c</italic> calcium channel transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2011</xref>). Later in neuronal maturation when PTBP2 levels drop, a second transition occurs with changes in the splicing of a new group of transcripts. We previously found that PSD95 exon 18 is controlled during this second transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). We now identify a large network of exon targets that have this common regulatory profile and are precociously spliced in the <italic>Ptbp2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Thus, one function of the PTBP2 protein is to maintain repression of a subset of PTBP1 target exons after PTBP1 is depleted in early differentiation. The differing sensitivity of target exons either to just PTBP1 or to both PTBP1 and PTBP2 presents an interesting mechanistic question of how an exon can be structured to respond to one protein or to both.</p><p>A recent paper described the phenotype of a full germline <italic>Ptbp2</italic> null mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>). As we observe with both germline and pan-CNS conditional knockouts, this mouse exhibited neonatal lethality, precluding examination of later neuronal maturation. Perhaps because of this neonatal lethality, the authors focused on PTBP2 expression in neuronal progenitor cells. Although we also see low expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we find the primary period of PTBP2 expression to be during neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). This study reported sporadic observation of cortical progenitors undergoing ectopic mitoses away from the apical edge of the ventricular zone in <italic>Ptbp2</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>). This defect was in keeping with an observed change in <italic>Numb</italic> pre-mRNA splicing. We have not observed ectopic mitoses in either the germline null or the pan-CNS conditional null mice, and found only minor changes in <italic>Numb</italic> splicing. However, this phenotype was reported to be sporadic and a careful comparison of the phenotypes from the different mutations will require matching their genetic backgrounds. Licatalosi et al. also report microarray identification of PTBP2 target exons in germline null brain that largely overlap with exons we identify in the pan-CNS knockout brain by microarray and by RNAseq. They suggest a role for the PTBP2 splicing program in neurogenesis. We do not see defects in neurogenesis and commitment to neuronal lineages, but find a dramatic defect in the later maturation of neurons after their birth. This is in keeping with both the developmental timing of PTBP2 expression and the precocious expression of adult isoforms observed by both groups in the knockout mice.</p><p>Interestingly, the later Emx-knockout mice show some differences from the NesKO in their ensemble of PTB2 target exons. These transcripts may be subject to regulatory events that occur after birth and are thus not observable in mice subject to neonatal lethality. Exons observed to change in the EmxKO but not in the NesKO mice point to the dynamic nature of splicing regulation during neuronal development. Most exons are controlled by combinations of factors, and there is likely to be extensive intersection between the PTBP2 regulatory program and splicing programs driven by other splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calarco et al., 2011</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to focus on the development of particular circuits and assess the temporal expression profiles of multiple other splicing regulators. Such studies will allow examination of how the different splicing regulatory networks are integrated.</p><p>Our analysis has focused on the dramatic changes in alternative splicing caused by loss of PTBP2. PTBP1 is known to also affect miRNA function and cytoplasmic translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sawicka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fred and Welsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorospe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kafasla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). PTBP2 will likely also serve similar roles, and a portion of the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> null phenotype may also derive from the loss of these other functions. In the CAD neuronal cell line, PTBP1 has been reported to cause retention of selected introns in transcripts for several important synaptic proteins, leading to their downregulation through nuclear RNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yap et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yap and Makeyev, 2013</xref>). These introns appear to be efficiently spliced in embryonic brain, as might be expected after the downregulation of PTBP1. PTBP2 may have similar activity on a different set of target transcripts. So far we have not seen a clear example of this, but one possibility is <italic>Ngrn</italic>, which contains a 3′-terminal intron that is spliced more efficiently in the Emx-KO than in wild type (data not shown).</p><p>As seen with other splicing regulators, the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> mutation is highly pleiotropic. Future studies will examine the functional roles of individual PTBP2 target transcripts. We are particularly interested in two processes. The establishment of axonal/dendritic polarity that occurs early in differentiation may coincide with the loss of PTBP1 protein and gain of PTBP2. In contrast, synaptic assembly occurs late in maturation and requires the downregulation of PTBP2. Many identified synaptic proteins change their splicing at this stage and it will be very interesting to examine how their isoform switching affects synaptic architecture and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of the <italic>Ptbp2</italic> conditional KO mouse</title><p>The <italic>Ptbp2</italic> conditional null allele was generated using homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Supplementary file 1: Exons validated by RT/PCR. A variety of exons showing differences in splicing between wild-type and <italic>Ptbp2</italic> nestin-KO brain were subjected to further analysis by RT/PCR. These included exons identified by MJAY array, RNAseq, and exons previously reported to be PTBP targets. Gene names, exon coordinates, and percent spliced in values (PSI) are listed. Genome coordinates are for mm9. Supplementary file 2: Splicing changes identified by exon junction microarray. RNA from WT and Ptbp2-NestinKO E18 pups was analyzed on Affymetrix MJAY arrays (see ‘Materials and methods’). Splicing events yielding Sepscores greater than 0.345 are listed. Supplementary file 3: Splicing changes identified by RNAseq analysis in Ptbp2-NesKO mice. RNAseq reads from E18 WT and NesKO mice were subjected to Splicetrap analysis (‘Materials and methods’). Events with a change in PSI of greater than 10% are shown with genome coordinates, read numbers, and coverage statistics. Supplementary file 4: Gene Ontology analysis of functional or process enrichment for genes showing splicing changes in Ptbp2-NesKO mice. Enrichments are relative to all genes expressed in wild-type brain. Supplementary file 5: Expression changes in Ptbp2-NesKO mice. Genes showing overall expression changes were identified by Cuffdiff analysis. Supplementary file 6: Gene Ontology analysis of genes up-regulated in Ptbp2-NesKO mice. Genes showing a twofold or greater increase in expression in the KO relative to WT were analyzed for functional or process enrichment relative to all genes expressed in wild-type brain. Supplementary file 7: Gene Ontology analysis of genes down-regulated in Ptbp2-NesKO mice. Genes showing twofold or greater reduced expression in the KO relative to WT were analyzed for functional or process enrichment relative to all genes expressed in wild-type brain. Supplementary file 8: Splicing changes identified by RNAseq analysis in Ptbp2-EmxKO mice. RNAseq reads from P1 WT and EmxKO mice were subjected to Splicetrap analysis (‘Materials and methods’). Events with a change in PSI of greater than 10% are shown with genome coordinates, read numbers, and coverage statistics.</comment></related-object></p></sec></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Ben Blencowe, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Li and colleagues investigate the role of the neuronally-enriched RNA binding protein and splicing regulator PTBP2 in nervous system development in vivo. Using different conditional knockout mouse lines in combination with phenotypic analyses and transcriptome profiling, the authors investigate the contribution of PTBP2 at different stages of development. The results show that PTBP2 regulates programs of alternative splicing events, and that loss of PTBP2 leads to premature derepression of exons that are normally included later in development. Taken together, the data support a model in which PTBP2 coordinates, in conjunction with PTBP1 and likely other splicing regulators, at least two distinct temporal transitions in the landscape of neuronal splicing regulatory networks: one from neural progenitors to differentiating neurons, and the other from differentiating to mature neurons.</p><p>While the effects of loss of PTBP2 on neuronal development has been described recently by the Darnell laboratory (Licatalosi et al. G&amp;D, 2012), the results presented by Li and colleagues significantly extend our understanding of the function of this protein since the use of different conditional knockout backgrounds unmasked phenotypes later in development that could not be observed in null mutants. The results thus emphasize the importance of studying the dynamics of RNA regulatory networks in knockout animals at different stages of development, especially for RNA binding proteins that are dynamically regulated such as PTBP2. Although it is unclear which of the many alternative splicing events regulated by PTBP2 are most critical for the observed mutant phenotypes, this study represents an important step towards the future characterization of these variants. The authors are requested to address (by inclusion of experiments or appropriate modification of the text) the following points in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In order to demonstrate that the authors are analyzing the desired homologously recombined allele and not an insertion (i.e., one arm homologous recombination), they should include a Southern of the -/- (i.e., FLOX/FLOX) mouse DNA.</p><p>2) The Western shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> only displays a slice of the gel where full length protein is detected, whereas the full gel should be shown to confirm whether or not a fragment of PTBP2 is expressed that might retain partial or aberrant activity. This is important to know since it could have bearing on interpretations that follow, including the question as to why there are phenotypic differences compared to those observed in the Darnell study.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors show that the levels of some proteins with roles in synaptogenesis are reduced, yet there are no experiments addressing whether synapses are actually formed (in the right location, the right numbers or at the right time). This could be addressed by performing immunofluorescence microscopy on appropriate sections. As it stands, the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not currently supported by the data presented.</p><p>4) The evidence presented for “degeneration” is decreased brain size and that 10-20 day old neuronal cultures from mutants do not survive as well as those from wild type animals. These data may indicate stalled or delayed development or “neurodegeneration”. Typically markers for apoptosis and/or microglial infiltration are used to determine whether neurodegeneration is occurring.</p><p>5) The authors state that their PTBP2-KO lines display defects in the formation of axonal tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), postnatal cortical expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref>) and synaptogenesis, but only show one or two sections to support the first two claims. The phenotypic analysis should comprise biological replicates (multiple brains for each genotype) and the defects should be quantified (i.e., measurements of cortical thickness, axonal tract areas should be taken).</p><p>6) Compared to results reported in the Darnell study, Li et al. do not observe major effects on neurogenesis in their “full null” strain and they attribute this to possible strain background differences or differences in sensitivity of immunofluorescence based phenotypic assays. While these are possible contributors, there are two intriguing (and ultimately more easily testable) possible explanations not mentioned by the authors: (1) The Nestin-Cre based knockout of PTBP2 occurs after the effects of requirement for PTBP2 in neurogenesis. Nestin expression commences upon neuronal differentiation not during the earliest of neurogenic stages; (2) PTBP2 expression in non-neuronal cell types (such as glia, for instance) might contribute to proper neurogenesis. Accordingly, the authors are requested to provide a deeper discussion of possible factors underlying differences between results from the two studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your manuscript entitled “The splicing regulator PTBP2 controls a program of embryonic splicing required for neuronal maturation” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Related to your responses to specific comments from the previous review, please address the following.</p><p><italic>Main point</italic> <italic>3</italic></p><p>The authors were not asked by the reviewers to analyze individual synapses, whereas overall synapse distribution can be examined using immunofluorescence. Visualizing the distribution of synaptic markers in sections reveals whether or not developing neurons lay down rudimentary synapses, and if they do, where this happens. If neurons in culture do not develop to the point where synapses can be examined, then no statement/claims can be made concerning effects on synapse formation/synaptogenesis. A reduction of “synaptic” protein levels could just reflect stalled development/overall differentiation. While the authors have acknowledged and corrected some of the previous “overstatements” related to this point, they are requested to carefully check their manuscript to ensure that the description of the experiments and results are not misleading.</p><p><italic>Main point</italic> <italic>5</italic></p><p>The authors are requested to at least provide the numbers of mice analyzed in their study (what does “all”, “multiple mice”, “multiple litters” etc mean?).

Thus, we don’t see what information would be gained with an additional Southern lane.

To observe individual synapses containing particular markers, these immuno-stains are used on primary cultured neurons. However, the PTBP2<sup>-/-</sup> cultured neurons do not survive long enough to form synapses, which usually form after about two weeks in culture. Thus staining for them would not be informative. However, the reviewers are correct that the title of the figure was an overstatement. Our discussion of the data for this figure made a misstatement that combined the results from the whole brain and the cell culture. We have rewritten our description of this and corrected the title of the figure to be more judicious in our interpretation.</p><p><italic>4) The evidence presented for “degeneration” is decreased brain size and that 10-20 day old neuronal cultures from mutants do not survive as well as those from wild type animals. These data may indicate stalled or delayed development or “neurodegeneration”. Typically markers for apoptosis and/or microglial infiltration are used to determine whether neurodegeneration is occurring</italic>.</p><p>We should have said more about this. The cortices in the EmxKO are not just smaller or stalled in development, but are actively degenerating. We thought this was clear from the presented sections. We have stained sections for various markers and there is clearly widespread cell death. The problem is that the tissue is extremely unstable and difficult to stain, yielding very messy sections, and we see staining for a variety of markers making the results so far rather equivocal for understanding the pathway of cell death. We have added further explanation of this in the Results section.</p><p><italic>5) The authors state that their PTBP2-KO lines display defects in the formation of axonal tracts (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>), postnatal cortical expansion (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C-E</italic></xref><italic>) and synaptogenesis, but only show one or two sections to support the first two claims. The phenotypic analysis should comprise biological replicates (multiple brains for each genotype) and the defects should be quantified (i.e., measurements of cortical thickness, axonal tract areas should be taken)</italic>.</p><p>The phenotypes we discuss were found in all mice of a particular genotype. We have added clarification on the consistency of our findings across multiple mice and have added scale bars to the figures to allow easier comparison across the presented sections. The reviewers are correct that to really add statistical rigor to the phenotypic analysis, one would need to quantify the defects over a large number of mice. This would take at least 18 months of additional mouse breeding. We feel this is beyond the scope of this study, where our intent is to make an initial report of these complex phenotypes – each portion of which will require substantial additional analysis. It is perhaps worth noting that the phenotypes we observe appear to be more penetrant than the ectopic mitoses reported in the Darnell paper described below.</p><p><italic>6) Compared to results reported in the Darnell study, Li et al. do not observe major effects on neurogenesis in their “full null” strain and they attribute this to possible strain background differences or differences in sensitivity of immunofluorescence based phenotypic assays. While these are possible contributors, there are two intriguing (and ultimately more easily testable) possible explanations not mentioned by the authors: (1) The Nestin-Cre based knockout of PTBP2 occurs after the effects of requirement for PTBP2 in neurogenesis. Nestin expression commences upon neuronal differentiation not during the earliest of neurogenic stages; (2) PTBP2 expression in non-neuronal cell types (such as glia, for instance) might contribute to proper neurogenesis. Accordingly, the authors are requested to provide a deeper discussion of possible factors underlying differences between results from the two studies</italic>.</p><p>This also needed more explanation. We were not clear that we also did not observe the neurogenesis phenotype reported by Darnell even in our full null mouse. So our different observations are not simply due to the differences between the nestinKO and the full null. While the reviewers are correct that there are markers for neuronal progenitors that are somewhat earlier than Nestin, Nestin expression is induced quite early and is turned off when progenitors exit mitosis to differentiate. These same progenitors give rise to glial cells but this occurs primarily after the developmental period we analyze here. Thus, we don’t think that either of the two explanations offered by the reviewers are likely. Nestin positive progenitors express very low amounts of PTBP2, but the primary period of PTBP2 expression is after the downregulation of nestin with the onset of differentiation. To clarify these questions, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> to the paper. This shows nestin expression in the progenitor cells of the subventricular zone and PTBP2 expression in the maturing neurons that have migrated to outer layers. This expression pattern is consistent with our observed defect in neuronal maturation. From our reading of the Darnell paper, the phenotype of ectopic mitoses in the subventricular zone appears to be sporadic and not able to explain the large differences in splicing or the neonatal death seen in their and our mice. Nevertheless, the fact that we haven’t yet observed this defect does not mean that we doubt the result. Most splicing factor knockouts analyzed so far have highly pleiotropic phenotypes and the early defect observed and its relation to Numb splicing will be very interesting to examine further.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Main point 3</p><p><italic>The authors were not asked by the reviewers to analyze individual synapses, whereas overall synapse distribution can be examined using immunofluorescence. Visualizing the distribution of synaptic markers in sections reveals whether or not developing neurons lay down rudimentary synapses, and if they do, where this happens. If neurons in culture do not develop to the point where synapses can be examined, then no statement/claims can be made concerning effects on synapse formation/synaptogenesis. A reduction of “synaptic” protein levels could just reflect stalled development/overall differentiation. While the authors have acknowledged and corrected some of the previous “overstatements” related to this point, they are requested to carefully check their manuscript to ensure that the description of the experiments and results are not misleading</italic>.</p><p>I confess that I didn’t entirely understand this point at first, but upon re-reading the text I agree that we made some statements regarding the data that were not quite correct, or might be interpreted differently than we intended. Very simply, if the cells do not survive long enough to reach the major stage of making synapses then we cannot draw conclusions about the mutation specifically affecting synaptogenesis. Moreover, since some synaptic proteins are being expressed, often with altered splicing, we cannot exclude that early synapses are not forming. I have gone through the text making changes to make this clearer, with particular changes to the Results section, as well as changes to the titles and legends of the figures.</p><p>Main point 5</p><p><italic>The authors are requested to at least provide the numbers of mice analyzed in their study (what does “all”, “multiple mice”, “multiple litters” etc mean?).
