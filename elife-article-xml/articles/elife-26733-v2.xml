of TIC induction or maintenance in lung cancer is not fully understood. In this study, we show the calcium pathway transcription factor NFATc2 is a novel regulator of lung TIC phenotypes, including tumorspheres, cell motility, tumorigenesis, as well as in vitro and in vivo responses to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In human lung cancers, high NFATc2 expression predicted poor tumor differentiation, adverse recurrence-free and cancer-specific overall survivals. Mechanistic investigations identified NFATc2 response elements in the 3’ enhancer region of <italic>SOX2</italic>, and NFATc2/SOX2 coupling upregulates ALDH1A1 by binding to its 5’ enhancer. Through this axis, oxidative stress induced by cancer drug treatment is attenuated, leading to increased resistance in a mutation-independent manner. Targeting this axis provides a novel approach for the long-term treatment of lung cancer through TIC elimination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26733.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26733.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26733.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer develops when cells become faulty and start to grow uncontrollably. They eventually form lumps or tumors, which may spread to surrounding tissues or even to other areas in the body. One of the reasons why cancer treatment remains a challenge is that there are over 200 types of cells in the body, and there are a lot of moments in the life cycle of a cell when things could go wrong. Researchers have shown that many cancers, including lung cancer, are not only extremely different from patient to patient, but also display great differences between cancer cells within the same tumor.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggest that these differences may be caused by a type of cells called tumor initiating cells, or TICs for short. These TICs behave like stem cells and can renew themselves or mature into different types of cells. They are thought to help cancers grow and spread, and even make them resistant to treatments. Previous research has shown that in many types of cancer, the protein NFATc2 helps cancer cells to grow and spread. Until now, however, it was not known if NFATc2 is also important in TICs in lung cancer.</p><p>Using human lung cancer cell lines and animal models, Xiao et al. show that the protein NFATc2 stimulates the stem-cell like behavior of TICs. The results showed that TICs had higher levels of the NFATc2 protein than other lung cancer cells that were not TICs. Tumors with higher levels were also more aggressive. When NFATc2 was removed from the cells, they formed smaller tumors and were more sensitive to drug treatment compared to cancer cells with NFATc2.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that NFATc2 helped to increase the levels of a protein called Sox2, which gives cells the ability to renew or develop into different cell types. Together, these two proteins stimulated the production of another protein that was already known to play a crucial role in TIC maintenance.</p><p>A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating TICs in lung cancer will help scientists tackle new questions about how this cancer progresses and resists to therapy. In the longer-term, combining classic cancer treatments with new therapeutic strategies targeting NFATc2 could make treatments for lung cancer patients more effective.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26733.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26733.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NFATc2</kwd><kwd>tumor-initiating cells</kwd><kwd>SOX2</kwd><kwd>ALDH1A1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HKU 17123514 M</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jie</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Si-Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Xu-Yuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Tin</surname><given-names>Vicky Pui-Chi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Maria Pik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003803</institution-id><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Zhi-Jie</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Si-Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Xu-Yuan</given-names></name><name><surname>Tin</surname><given-names>Vicky Pui-Chi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Maria Pik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NFATc2 maintains the drug-induced TIC phenotypes through trans-activating SOX2/ALDH1A1 expression and scavenging stress from ROS.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer results from mutations induced by DNA adducts, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during tobacco smoking and chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okumura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Houghton, 2013</xref>). Due to late presentation and the lack of effective long term therapy, it has a high mortality and new treatment approaches are needed to improve patient outcomes. Recent research has shown the cellular landscape of a cancer is heterogeneous. Cells showing aberrant expressions of various molecules have enhanced propensities for survival, tumorigenicity, drug resistance, designated as cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells (TIC). In some cancers, constitutive activities of inherent embryonic or developmental pathways for stem cell renewal are involved in TIC maintenance, such as the WNT/β-catenin pathway in colonic adenocarcinomas (AD). In tissues with slow cell turnover, mechanisms that elicit cell plasticity and stemness properties during tissue response to intracellular and extracellular stresses are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Valent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Visvader and Lindeman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck and Blanpain, 2013</xref>). For the adult lung, stem cell niches or their physiological regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined, and molecular programs sustaining lung TIC are still elusive.</p><p>Intracellular free calcium is at the hub of multiple interacting pathways activated by extracellular and/or intrinsic stimulations, e.g. EGFR, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stresses, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roderick and Cook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prevarskaya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Déliot and Constantin, 2015</xref>), raising the possibility stress signals transduced by calcium pathway mediators could be involved in the induction of TIC phenotypes. In cancers of the breast, pancreas, colon and melanoma, the calcium signaling transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) has been shown to contribute to malignant properties including cell invasion, migration, survival, proliferation, stromal modulation and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Werneck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerlach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2014</xref>). However, information on its role in TIC phenotypes, especially drug resistance, is limited and details of the molecular pathways linking calcium signaling to TIC induction have not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated the parlor NFATc2 supports tumorigenicity, cell survival, motility and drug resistance of human lung AD. Amongst essential factors of pluripotency, SOX2 is an NFATc2 target upregulated through its 3’ enhancer, while SOX2 couples to a 5’ enhancer of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> mediating overexpression. NFATc2 induces ALDH<sup>+</sup> subsets and ALDH<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup>-TIC and enhances drug resistance by ROS scavenging through the NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis. Our study reports a novel lung TIC maintenance pathway which links micro-environmental stimulation to induction of stemness phenotypes, evasion of cell death and enhancement of drug resistance. NFATc2 could be an important target in treatment strategies aiming at disruption of lung TIC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NFATc2 expression correlated with adverse survivals of human NSCLC</title><p>By analyzing transcripts expression, we observed <italic>NFATc2</italic> was significantly overexpressed in human primary NSCLC compared to normal lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Alignment with ChIP-seq data of A549 cells retrieved from public databases showed significant overlap at loci of H3K27Ac occupancy with regions 2 and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Luciferase assays confirmed these regions are active transcriptional regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further evaluation with respective SOX2 luciferase reporter revealed transcriptional activities were mediated by sites 1, 2, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Using H441 lung cancer cell line with NFATc2 transient overexpression, we observed only sites 1, 4 and 5 showed statistically significant increased reporter activities while those of sites 4 and 5 were reciprocally abolished by CSA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, site directed mutagenesis of NFAT motifs (GGAAA to GACTA) prevented reporter activities of sites 4 and 5 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and the findings were supported by data from A549 and H1299 cells ectopically expressing NFATc2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Notably, sequence homology analysis showed <italic>SOX2</italic> sites 4 and 5 are highly conserved across different mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, the data suggested NFATc2 was highly likely to regulate SOX2 expression through binding to 3’ enhancers at sites 4 and 5. For validation, NFATc2 ChIP-qPCR assays were performed using A549 with NFATc2 upregulation, which showed statistically significant enrichment of sites 4 and 5 sequences compared to vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In HCC827 cells, sites 4 and 5 sequences were significantly enriched by anti-NFATc2 antibody compared to IgG control.

Thus, in A549 CR cells, intracellular ROS levels were significantly lower compared to parental A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). To investigate for possible relation between NFATc2 and ROS modulation, NFATc2 was silenced by knockdown or knockout which led to increased ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, NFATc2 depletion sensitized PDCL#24 cells to cisplatin treatment, but the addition of the reducing agent NAC reversed cisplatin IC<sub>50</sub> to above the control level dose-dependently. Reciprocally, the enhanced resistance of A549 by NFATc2 overexpression was reversed by oxidative stress induced by the glutathione inhibitor BSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), consistent with the suggestion that drug resistance by NFATc2 is effected through ROS attenuation. Similarly, ROS regulation also supported other tumor phenotypes mediated by NFATc2. For example, tumorspheres suppression by NFATc2 knockdown was restored by NAC dose-dependently but in control cells, no significant changes were induced even in the presence of additional NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>).

To further address the involvement of SOX2 coupling and ALDH1A1, we showed suppression of ROS by NFATc2-overexpression in A549 cells were reversed by silencing SOX2 or ALDH1A1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J–K</xref>). Together, the data suggested NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH1A1 form a functional axis in the homeostatic regulation of an optimal level of ROS for in vitro tumorigenicity, cell motility, and mediation of drug resistance.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26733.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>NFATc2 regulated TIC properties through ROS suppression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ROS levels detected by flow cytometry in A549 and A549 CR cells.

Many studies have demonstrated cell populations expressing high levels of specific markers such as ALDH, CD44, CD166, CD133, etc. are enhanced for a multitude of tumor phenotypes, with tumorigenicity and drug resistance being clinically the most important. Constitutive stem cell programs or stress-induced pathways are the main TIC sustaining mechanisms but details of their regulation are still elusive. NFAT is a family of transcription factors with the calcium-responsive parlors NFATc1, -c2, -c3 and -c4 being expressed in a tissue-dependent manner. In this study, using NFATc2 depletion and overexpression models of multiple lung cancer cell lines in TIC-defining functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pattabiraman and Weinberg, 2014</xref>), as well as clinical evidence from excised human lung cancers, we showed NFATc2 mediates TIC phenotypes. In vitro cell renewability was demonstrated by tumorspheres passaged for consecutive generations and and in vivo tumorigenicity tumorigenicity was illustrated by the limiting dilution assay. In clinical tumors, high level NFATc2 segregated with impaired tumor differentiation, advanced pathological stage, shorter recurrence-free and overall survivals in NFATc2-positive NSCLC, suggesting NFATc2 mediates the more primitive and aggressive tumor phenotypes. In the literature, only one research group has reported NFATc2 expression in 52% of 159 lung cancers and similar to our findings, high expression was associated with late tumor stage and poor survival. In their studies, supportive evidences for cell proliferation, invasion and migration were demonstrated by cell models but the in vivo role of NFATc2 and, in particular, its effects on TIC, drug response or mechanisms of action were not addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2013b</xref>). We have also evaluated public data sets on NFATc2 mRNA expression in lung cancer but a correlation with adverse patient outcome was not found (data not shown). Since NFATc2 is expressed by tumor infiltrating leukocytes, specific conclusions cannot be reached using this approach.</p><p>To identify the TIC sustaining mechanism of NFATc2, we hypothesized NFATc2 might be coupled to the core pluripotency factors SOX2, NANOG and/or OCT4, whose aberrant activities, if present, would be most suitable to orchestrate multifaceted cancer propensities through extensive transcriptional and epigenetic reprograming. Using multiple analyses of cancer cells and tumorspheres, we observed SOX2 was the most consistently altered factor with the highest magnitude of change when NFATc2 expression or calcineurin activity were manipulated. SOX2 is an important oncogene for squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the lung and other organs through SOX2 locus amplification at 3q26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hussenet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boumahdi et al., 2014</xref>). For lung AD, although SOX2 is often expressed at high levels and predicts adverse survivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2013</xref>), distinct genetic mechanisms have not been identified, indicating regulatory or signaling aberrations might be involved. To evaluate the effects of NFATc2 on SOX2 expression, we avoided the potentially confounding element of SCC and focused on moderate to poorly differentiated AD where NFATc2 is shown to play an important prognostic role. Indeed, SOX2 expression is significantly correlated with that of NFATc2 in this group of human lung cancer. Functionally, NFATc2/SOX2 coupling contributes to tumor behavior as depletion of SOX2 in cell lines with NFATc2 overexpression led to significant suppression of TIC phenotypes. Hence, clinical and experimental evidences support NFATc2 impedes tumor differentiation and negatively affects patient outcome through coupling to SOX2 in lung AD.</p><p>We observed NFATc2 binds to the 3’ enhancer region of <italic>SOX2</italic> at around 3.2 kb and 3.6 kb from TSS, effecting functional TIC enhancement and supporting the direct involvement of NFATc2 in stemness induction. In a recent study of a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with <italic>KRAS G12VD</italic> mutation and p53 heterozygous inactivation, Singh <italic>et al</italic> reported an analogous mechanism involving another NFAT family protein, NFATc1, which acts as a coactivator and transcriptional regulator of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). They showed NFATc1 played a permissive role for tumor dedifferentiation and expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, while p53 disruption was essential for tumorigenesis, suggesting under the appropriate genetic context, NFATc1 activation transduces EMT through SOX2 upregulation. The authors proposed since chronic inflammation is a known etiology of pancreatic AD, NFATc1 might be a crucial factor involved in the progression of this cancer. On the other hand, we have shown NFATc1 inhibition does not result in SOX2 suppression, indicating NFATc2 is likely to be preferentially involved in lung cancers. Our data also distinguish a different SOX2 enhancer region accessible to NFATc2 which functions not only in the presence of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation (A549, PDCL#24) but also in <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant (HCC827) cancers. Chronic inflammation is an important etiological mechanism of lung cancer through release of ROS and free radicals from alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. While many studies modeling carcinogenetic mechanisms of tobacco toxicity or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases have featured the NF-κB pathway as a major mediator, our findings on the effects of NFATc2 on TIC induction might add to this repertoire. In fact, NFATc2 and NF-κB share highly similar DNA binding domains but differ in the upstream activators, with NF-κB being stimulated by cytokine receptors and inflammatory molecules while NFATc2 is downstream of calcium signaling reputed as a stress response integrator, illustrating the multiple mechanisms through which inflammation-induced carcinogenesis might be initiated in the lung.</p><p>We have shown the ALDH<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup> fraction of lung cancer cells, despite being the smallest subset, demonstrates the highest tumorigenic capacity compared to counterpart subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). Evaluation of the role of NFATc2/SOX2 coupling in inducing this cell fraction revealed only ALDH but not CD44 showed consistent changes upon NFATc2 suppression or overexpression, respectively, and more specifically, ALDH1A1 was identified as a major functional target. Recent reports have shown β-catenin can directly regulate ALDH1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Condello et al., 2015</xref>), and since SOX2 can upregulate β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), this could infer SOX2 might indirectly regulate ALDH1A1 through β-catenin. We thus assessed β-catenin activity by western blot in A549 cells with NFATc2 overexpression and SOX2 knockdown, but no significant alternation of total or activated β-catenin levels was observed in these cells and the possible mechanism of indirect ALDH1A1 upregulation through β-catenin was not supported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). On the other hand, computational screening did not detect significant and conserved SOX2-binding motifs within the proximal promoter region of ALDH1A1, but a more distant locus at 27 kb upstream from its TSS was shown to be a probable response region which we confirmed by CHIP-seq, CHIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays, respectively. This illustrates a distal enhancer is involved in the trans-regulation of ALDH1A1 expression, which has not been reported before. Current views on cancer stem cells suggest TIC is unlikely to be a single population with unique identifiers; instead, cell plasticity might induce variant TIC populations through dynamic response mechanisms, enabling cancer cells to meet the requirements of a complex micro-environment. In this connection, since we have only demonstrated the NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis, further investigation for the mechanisms of CD44 regulation in ALDH<sup>+</sup>/CD44<sup>+</sup>-TIC is needed.</p><p>Acquired drug resistance is mediated through complex genetic and molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>). We have shown NFATc2 augments cancer resistance with more prominent effects on tumors treated by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Response to targeted therapy is dominated by addiction to aberrant signaling from the mutant <italic>EGFR</italic>, and the effects of NFATc2 are modest by comparison. Nevertheless, as shown by the xenograft model of short term gefitinib treatment, complementary NFATc2 inhibition might be considered for patients receiving sub-therapeutic treatment regimes, e.g., due to the occurrence of serious skin or liver side effects.</p><p>Adaptive antioxidant response to alleviate oxidative stress from ROS surge during systemic therapy is one of the most important mechanisms of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), suggested to be accentuated in cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diehn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achuthan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we have observed in multiple cell lines with induced resistance to chemotherapy or targeted therapy, NFATc2 was upregulated, while ROS was maintained at a lower level compared to parental cells. Changes in TIC phenotypes induced by NFATc2 up- or down-regulation were correspondingly restored by the redox reagents BSO or NAC, respectively, suggesting ROS scavenging is an important mechanism of drug resistance and other TIC properties mediated by NFATc2. In line with this suggestion, it has been reported in adult immortalized bronchial epithelial cells, NFAT can be upregulated in response to inflammatory and carcinogenic stimulation such as benzo-(a)-pyrene and heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), leading to ROS-induced COX2 pathway signaling and enhanced cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). However, whether ROS is in turn suppressed by NFATc2 through a negative feedback mechanism has not been reported. Our findings supplement this information and show NFATc2 facilitates ROS scavenging, and further implicates this effect is mediated by ALDH1A1 through SOX2 coupling. This is consistent with findings of other studies on the role of ALDH1A1 in drug resistance through repressing ROS level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizuno et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the calcium signaling molecule NFATc2 enhances functional characteristics associated with cancer stemness phenotype. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of SOX2 upregulation in lung cancers through enhancer binding by NFATc2. The NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis contributes to drug resistance by mediating a negative feedback mechanism for ROS scavenging and restoration of redox homeostasis. This study employed a candidate-based approach and the involvement of other potential NFATc2 and SOX2 targets in cancer phenotypes is not addressed. Nevertheless, the findings implicate NFATc2 is a potential therapeutic target for sequential or combination therapy of lung cancer that aims to eliminate TIC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Established cell lines (H1993, HCC1833, H358, H1650, H2228, H1299, H1437, H1975, H23, H2122, HCC827, HCC78, A549, H441, and BEAS-2B) were obtained from ATCC.

Briefly, different numbers of cells mixed with an equal volume of matrigel (BD Pharmingen) were injected subcutaneously at the back of 6 week old severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice or Ncr-nu/nu-nude mice. Tumor sizes were monitored every 3 days using digital vernier calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula [sagittal dimension (mm) ×cross dimension (mm)<sup>2</sup>]/2 and expressed in mm<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement</title><p>Cells with or without respective treatments were washed with PBS and stained with 1 µM of the ROS probe CellROX<sup>TM</sup> Deep Red (Lift Technologies) for 30 mins according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Tissue collection protocols were approved by the Joint Hospital and University Institutional Review Board and written informed consents from patients were obtained. Fresh tissues were snap-frozen within 45–60 min after vascular clamping and kept in −70°C until use. Adjacent tumor tissues were fixed in 4% neural buffered formalin for 24 hr and processed into formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. Tumor classification and differentiation grading was according to the WHO classification of lung tumors, 2004. Tumor typing and pathological staging was performed by a qualified anatomical pathologist (MPW). Clinical parameters and outcomes were charted from hospital records in consultation with relevant clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p>Tissue microarrays were constructed using at least 5 cores of tissue from different representative tumor areas and 1 core of corresponding normal lung from each case. Tumor cores were randomly arranged in the microarray to prevent positional bias during recording of IHC results. De-paraffinized tissue microarray sections (5 µm) were subjected to antigen retrieval using microwave heating at 95°C in 1 mM EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Blocked sections were labeled with primary antibodies against NFATc2 (1:50 dilution, Cell Signaling), SOX2 (1:200 dilution, Cell Signaling) and ALDH1A1 (1:1000 dilution, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Anti-rabbit HRP-labeled polymer (DAKO) was used as a secondary antibody. Color detection was performed by liquid DAB +substrate chromogen system (DAKO). Protein expression levels were semi-quantitatively analyzed using an automated image capturing and analysis system (Aperio).</p><p>NFATc2 expression level was scored according to the extent and intensity of nuclear staining in the tumor cells only and expression in the cytoplasm, stromal or inflammatory cells was excluded from evaluation. The intensity was graded as 1, 2, or 3 according to whether nuclear staining was absent or weak, moderate, or strong, respectively. The staining extent was graded as 1, 2, or 3 according to whether expression was observed in scattered individual cells, aggregates of 5 or more but &lt;19 cells, or sheets of 20 or more cells. The products of the 2 grades were then computed, and cases with scores of 4 and above were counted as high level expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analyzed by SPSS (version 16.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), GraphPad Prism 7.0 or Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) software packages and shown as mean ±standard deviations (s.d.). Differential expression between paired tumor/normal tissues were analyzed by Wilcoxon text. Differences between groups were analyzed by <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables. Differences between growth curves of xenograft model were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Correlation between NFATc2 and SOX2 mRNA level were analyzed by Pearson correlation test. Correlation between NFATc2, SOX2, ALDH1A1 expressions and clinicopathological variables in lung cancers were analyzed by the χ<sup>2</sup>-test. Association between NFATc2 expression and overall survival and recurrence-free survival were analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method with log-rank test. Multivariate survival analyses were performed by Cox regression model. Two-sided p values &lt; 0.05 were considered as being statistically signiﬁcant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We thank the Core Facility and Laboratory Animal Unit of the LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong for technical support.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NFATc2 enhances tumor-initiating phenotypes through the NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH axis in lung adenocarcinoma&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors have uncovered an interesting role for NFATc2 in lung cancer cell differentiation, growth and drug response. The authors found that in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, the transcription factor NFATc2 promotes tumor initiating activities, migration, invasion, xenograft growth and resistance to cisplatin and EGFR inhibition. Mechanistically, NFATc2 seems to transactivate the pluripotency factor SOX2 through a 3' enhancer, and SOX2 is required for some of the biological activities of NFATC2 in this setting. Furthermore, NFATc2 and SOX2 exert some of their effects via transactivation of ALDH1A1 and attenuation of ROS production.</p><p>The reviewers discussed the findings and decided to encourage a resubmission that would address the following major concerns:</p><p>1) The majority of the studies use only two cell lines, rather than primary tumor cells, to make conclusions about TICs. The assays used in vivo are not selective for TIC activity, but could be a readout of tumor cell growth or proliferation. To meet the claims about TICs, data is needed showing that the effects of NFATc2 knockdown are not simply just an effect on proliferation. This can be done with a number of assays that measure cell cycle progression.</p><p>2) NFATc1 is mentioned in the Discussion but no data are shown. It needs to be determined if NFATc1 knockdown has the same effect as NFATc2.</p><p>3) Is calcium signaling responsible for changes in SOX2 expression changes? While genetic manipulation of NFATc2/SOX2 has been shown, does chemical inhibition of calcium signaling have the same effect? The nuclear translocation (and therefore activity) of the NFATc family of transcription factors is entirely dependent on the calcineurin phosphatase complex and there are potent and specific inhibitors of this complex. They only present a single experiment using the calcineurin inhibitor Cyclosporin A. In many experiments the use of CsA would add further strength to their arguments that the Cn/NFAT pathway is important for these phenotypes. Experiments with CsA should be added to at least some of their experiments even as a very simple control in their luciferase assays and added proof that this pathway is important in the responses to cisplatin and EGFR inhibitors. Does CsA or FK506 block sphere formation as is shown for NFATc2 knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> etc.?</p><p>4) If NFATc2 knock-down reduces tumor growth in the xenograft experiments, then it is predicted that the tumors that do grow from the shNFATc2 line would have selected away from knockdown and would express NFATc2. This should be investigated by qPCR, western, or IHC. This would further support the conclusion that it is knockdown of NFATc2 that leads to the reduction in tumor growth.</p><p>5) The comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D and J</xref> are not right. The effect of cisplatin on tumors size should be compared to the untreated samples with the same shRNA. So, its 1.68 fold reduction in sh-Cntrl but how much is sgNFATc1-A and -B reduced relative to the untreated tumors with that same shRNA? Then is that effect really any different than the response of the control tumors? This is really not right as it is shown now. It is not convincing that NFATc2 knock-down actually extenuates the response of tumors in vivo to the various treatments. The effects on the IC50 of the drug responses in vitro are also quite subtle and should be presented as such.</p><p>6) The conclusion that NFATc2 is a direct regulator of SOX2 expression is based in part on a ChIP experiment using artifact-prone protein overexpression. It would be important to demonstrate that 'endogenous' NFATc2 binds to the 3' enhancer in the SOX2 locus. The ChIP experiment in the paper is done in cells overexpressing RFP-NFATc2 and the data are not very convincing. The authors seem to count with antibodies that work well in Western blot and it would strengthen the paper to ChIP endogenous NFATc2. The authors also count with a pair of cell lines (A549 and A549CR) with vastly different levels of NFATc2, as well of isogenic NFATc2 KO cell lines, which would facilitate the experiment and ensure specificity in the signals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26733.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers discussed the findings and decided to encourage a resubmission that would address the following major concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The majority of the studies use only two cell lines, rather than primary tumor cells, to make conclusions about TICs.

Using the BrdU cell proliferation assay, we observed NFATc2 inhibition did not significantly reduce the proportion of proliferating cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), while the ratios of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The findings do not support NFATc2 induces cell proliferation at the basal state, and thus this is unlikely to be the sole mechanism for its effects on TIC. These results are included in the last paragraph of the subsection “NFATc2 was overexpressed in lung TIC and mediated TIC properties”.</p><p><italic>2) NFATc1 is mentioned in the Discussion but no data are shown. It needs to be determined if NFATc1 knockdown has the same effect as NFATc2.</italic> </p><p>In the Discussion, we referred to the transgenic mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by Singh et al., in which carcinogenesis was driven by <italic>KRAS<sup>G12VD</sup></italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> heterozygous inactivation. NFATc1 was found to mediate cancer functions by transactivating SOX2 through a 3’ enhancer.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we investigated whether NFATc1 might also be involved in lung adenocarcinomas. Unlike the effects of inhibiting NFATc2, transient NFATc1 suppression using si-RNA did not lead to significant reduction of <italic>SOX2</italic> transcripts in HCC827 or PDCL#24 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and 5K</xref>), implicating NFATc1 and NFATc2 are likely to be involved in cancer functions in a tissue-specific and/or context dependent manner. These results are described in the first paragraph of the subsection “NFATc2 upregulated SOX2 expression through its 3’ enhancer” and discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) Is calcium signaling responsible for changes in SOX2 expression changes? While genetic manipulation of NFATc2/SOX2 has been shown, does chemical inhibition of calcium signaling have the same effect? The nuclear translocation (and therefore activity) of the NFATc family of transcription factors is entirely dependent on the calcineurin phosphatase complex and there are potent and specific inhibitors of this complex. They only present a single experiment using the calcineurin inhibitor Cyclosporin A. In many experiments the use of CsA would add further strength to their arguments that the Cn/NFAT pathway is important for these phenotypes. Experiments with CsA should be added to at least some of their experiments even as a very simple control in their luciferase assays and added proof that this pathway is important in the responses to cisplatin and EGFR inhibitors. Does CsA or FK506 block sphere formation as is shown for NFATc2 knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> etc.?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the reviewers’ suggestions. We have performed additional experiments using both CSA and FK506 to inhibit de-phosphorylation and activation of NFAT through the calcineurin/NFAT complex, including effects on sphere formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), cisplatin and gefitinib sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, I, M</xref>), pluripotency factors expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>), luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), ALDH/CD44 distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and ALDH1A1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>The effects of CSA and FK506 were similar to those of NFATc2 suppression. Inhibition of calcineurin led to suppression of sphere formation, sensitization of cells to cisplatin and gefitinib, reduced SOX2 expression and transcriptional activities of luc-SOX2-site 4 and 5. More specifically, we also transiently knocked down PPP3R1, one of the subunits of calcineurin, by two siRNA which led to reduction of SOX2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) If NFATc2 knock-down reduces tumor growth in the xenograft experiments, then it is predicted that the tumors that do grow from the shNFATc2 line would have selected away from knockdown and would express NFATc2. This should be investigated by qPCR, western, or IHC. This would further support the conclusion that it is knockdown of NFATc2 that leads to the reduction in tumor growth.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ views. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed NFATc2 expression in a subpopulation of xenograft tumor cells, indicating tumor cells that had selected away from knockdown contributed to xenograft growth. Moreover, in many areas, NFATc2 expression was more prominent in tumor cells at the tumor/stroma interface where exogenous stimulation from the micro-environment, e.g. through the Wnt/Ca signaling pathway, might take place. This is in contrast to the control xenografts where NFATc2 expression was more diffuse throughout thick trabeculae of tumor cells. These results were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and described in the subsection “NFATc2 mediated tumorigenesis in vivo”, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> legend.</p><p><italic>5) The comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C and 3H</xref> are not right. The effect of cisplatin on tumors size should be compared to the untreated samples with the same shRNA. So, its 1.68 fold reduction in sh-Cntrl but how much is sgNFATc1-A and -B reduced relative to the untreated tumors with that same shRNA? Then is that effect really any different than the response of the control tumors? This is really not right as it is shown now. It is not convincing that NFATc2 knock-down actually extenuates the response of tumors in vivo to the various treatments. The effects on the IC50 of the drug responses in vitro are also quite subtle and should be presented as such.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the reviewers’ comments. We have changed the comparison groupings as suggested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, both groups of NFATc2 knockdown mice (shNFATc2-A and shNFATc2-B) showed accentuated responses to cisplatin treatment, resulting in 3.15 and 2.2 folds tumor shrinkage, respectively, while the control xenografts shrunk by 1.68 fold only. From the tumor growth curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), tumor growth in all cisplatin treated groups were significantly slower than their respective vehicle control groups. Amongst the treated groups, the growth of tumors with NFATc2 knockdown was also significantly slower than those without knockdown. Together, the data indicated NFATc2 knockdown mediated additive effects and increased cisplatin sensitivity of the lung cancer cells evaluated.</p><p>For gefitinib response, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, although both groups of NFATc2 knockdown mice resulted in higher folds of tumor shrinkage (3.57 fold, 4.73 fold, respectively) compared to scramble control (3.38 fold), the added effects of NFATc2 inhibition were very modest. This is due to oncogene addiction of HCC827 to mutant EGFR which causes precipitous tumor shrinkage upon gefitinib exposure. Nevertheless, tumors harvested from the gefitinib treated NFATc2 knockdown groups were significantly smaller than those from gefitinib treated Sh-Ctrl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><p>Using an alternative model, we investigated the effects of NFATc2 inhibition on response to short term gefitinib treatment for 5 days to allow the tumors to regrow. In mice with NFATc2 knockdown, tumor regrowth was observed in only 3 and 2 mice of the sh-NFATc2-A and sh-NFATc2-B groups, respectively. In contrast, all mice in the control group showed tumor regrowth. The NFATc2-inhibited xenografts showed much more pronounced inhibition of tumor resurgence (5.44 fold, 39.73 fold, respectively) compared to the control group (3.54 fold) and differences in tumor volumes on the growth curve were statistically significant by 2-way ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The data provided additional evidence that NFATc2 has a tumor-supportive effect and increases tumor resistance. Clinically, patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors for <italic>EGFR</italic> mutated lung adenocarcinomas often experience skin and liver side effects requiring reduced drug dosage or increased administration intervals. The addition of NFATc2 inhibitors might be beneficial as a complementary treatment. These results were described in the second paragraph of the subsection “NFATc2 promoted cancer resistance to cytotoxic and targeted therapy” and discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>For the in vitro MTT assays, results of all treatment groups were normalized to their respective untreated controls when the IC<sub>50</sub> was calculated, i.e. the effects of NFATc2 knockdown on cell viability have been normalized and the differences in IC<sub>50</sub> were entirely due to drug sensitization effects. We apologize for the confusing use of the terms “significantly increased/reduced”. As suggested by the reviewers, we have omitted these and just stated the p value, or replaced them with “statistically significant”.</p><p><italic>6) The conclusion that NFATc2 is a direct regulator of SOX2 expression is based in part on a ChIP experiment using artifact-prone protein overexpression. It would be important to demonstrate that 'endogenous' NFATc2 binds to the 3' enhancer in the SOX2 locus. The ChIP experiment in the paper is done in cells overexpressing RFP-NFATc2 and the data are not very convincing. The authors seem to count with antibodies that work well in Western blot and it would strengthen the paper to ChIP endogenous NFATc2. The authors also count with a pair of cell lines (A549 and A549CR) with vastly different levels of NFATc2, as well of isogenic NFATc2 KO cell lines, which would facilitate the experiment and ensure specificity in the signals.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We have performed ChIP-qPCR experiments using HCC827 without NFATc2 manipulation and results showed endogenous NFATc2 binding to SOX2 enhancers. With NFATc2 knockout, markedly reduced levels were observed. The results were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
