Additionally, <italic>Foxp2</italic> was removed from the developing mouse cortex at different prenatal ages using two Cre-recombinase driver lines. Detailed molecular and circuit analyses were undertaken to identify potential disruptions of development.

These circuits are built through interdependent processes, including proliferation of neural progenitors, migration of neurons to their appropriate positions, morphological and physiological differentiation of diverse neuron subtypes, and the formation of synapses of requisite strength between appropriate pairs of neurons. Impairments in these fundamental aspects of development can lead to lifelong dysfunction of the cortex, which is believed to contribute to core symptoms of many neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubenstein and Rakic, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The winged helix transcription factor, FOXP2, has been implicated in ontogenetic processes relevant to the development of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vernes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and some studies have directly implicated FOXP2 in cortical ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Calero et al., 2016</xref>). FOXP2 expression in the developing cortex is restricted to subpopulations of post-mitotic neurons in the deep cortical layers, a pattern that is highly conserved across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukamel et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in <italic>FOXP2</italic> cause a severe developmental speech and language disorder, known as childhood apraxia of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDermot et al., 2005</xref>). Human neuroimaging and animal studies have identified alterations in basal ganglia function that could contribute to the clinical disorder symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vargha-Khadem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groszer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">French et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), but whether changes in cerebral cortical organization and function are critically involved in impairments associated with <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations is currently unknown.</p><p>The present study aimed to establish a more detailed understanding of the cell-type identity of FOXP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in the developing murine cerebral cortex, using molecular and neuroanatomical phenotyping approaches. Further, this study applied gold-standard conditional mouse genetics to selectively remove <italic>Foxp2</italic> from the developing cerebral cortex at different prenatal ages to ascertain its putative roles in the normal histogenic processes that generate the canonical six layers, specific cell types based on gene expression, and basic axon targeting to subcortical structures. The results show that FOXP2 expression is limited to specific corticofugal neuron populations and suggest that the gene plays a more limited role in mouse corticogenesis than previously concluded based on results obtained by other experimental methodologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Foxp2 expression is enriched in developing corticothalamic projection neurons</title><p>Initial <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression mapping studies determined that <italic>Foxp2</italic> transcript and protein expression begin prenatally, with the onset of protein expression delayed relative to the mRNA, and with protein present primarily in postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferland et al., 2003</xref>). However, other more recent studies have reported that FOXP2 protein is also expressed in mitotic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>), where it regulates cortical neurogenesis. FOXP2 immunohistochemistry of coronal sections of the embryonic forebrain suggested that FOXP2 protein expression begins between embryonic day (E) 14.5 and E16.5 within postmitotic neurons of the infragranular layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Postnatally, it is well established that <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression is limited to glutamatergic neurons of the infragranular cortical layers, with robust expression predominantly in layer 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hisaoka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sundberg et al., 2018</xref>). Layer 6 contains many FOXP2<sup>+</sup> neurons, whereas layer 5 contains some FOXP2<sup>+</sup> neurons that are more abundant in medial cortical areas at early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>). Layer 6, where most of the FOXP2<sup>+</sup> neurons are located, is comprised of two primary glutamatergic cortical neuron populations, corticothalamic (CT) and corticocortical (CC) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petrof et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). To determine whether FOXP2 expression is selective to one of these populations or is expressed in both layer 6 projection neuron subtypes during development, on postnatal day (P) 12, the neuroanatomical tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into primary somatosensory thalamus or primary motor cortex in separate cohorts of mice. Cell bodies of CT or CC neurons residing in layer 6 of primary SSC were retrogradely labeled. Sections through primary SSC were then stained with an anti-FOXP2 antibody and cellular expression of FOXP2 was assessed among retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the tracer injections. FOXP2 expression was evident in most CT neurons (Mean ± SEM, 78.3 ± 2.9%), but was expressed by very few CC neurons (Mean ± SEM, 6.4 ± 1.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42012.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FOXP2 is enriched in corticothalamic neurons during cortical development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Low magnification (left) and high magnification (right) images of FOXP2 (yellow) immunohistochemical labeling of E14.5 forebrain reveals absence of expression in the dorsal pallium, whereas the developing striatum is robustly labeled at this timepoint (N = 5).

The CT-specific cre-driver mouse, Ntsr1-cre, was crossed with a cre-dependent Rosa-tdTomato reporter line (<italic>Ai14</italic>) to selectively and comprehensively label layer 6 CT neurons with tdTomato. FOXP2 immunohistochemistry revealed that nearly all tdTomato-positive neurons in the primary SSC co-expressed FOXP2 at P0, P7, and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>, Mean ± SEM: P0 = 90 ± 2%, P7 = 87 ± 2%, P14 = 91 ± 1%). For further molecular characterization, we also examined FOXP2 overlap with the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, which is expressed in CC neurons of layer 6, but nearly excluded from layer 6 CT neurons in SSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kast et al., 2019</xref>). Using co-labeling in Met<sup>GFP</sup> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kast et al., 2019</xref>), analysis of FOXP2 expression among GFP<sup>+</sup> layer 6 CC neurons revealed relatively few double-positive neurons at P0, P7, and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>, Mean ± SEM: P0 = 19 ± 2%, P7 = 16 ± 2%, P14 = 5 ± 2%). This finding is consistent with the limited expression of FOXP2 by layer 6 CC neurons observed through retrograde tracing. It is noteworthy, however, that there are FOXP2 and Met<sup>GFP</sup> double-positive cells positioned in the subplate/layer 6B, similar to the observation of Ntsr1-cre and Met<sup>GFP</sup> colocalization in deep layer six previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kast et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the FOXP2 and GFP double-labeled neurons became quite sparse by P14, perhaps due to the downregulation of GFP in the subplate or to the programmed cell death of some subplate neuron populations, as has been reported previously during early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>). We also examined two other layer 6 neuronal subtype marker genes, PCP4 and ppCCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watakabe et al., 2012</xref>). There was extensive colocalization between FOXP2 and PCP4, a marker of corticothalamic neurons, in layer 6, but there was minimal colocalization between FOXP2 and ppCCK, a marker of CC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Together, the molecular and connectivity analysis of FOXP2+ neurons in layer six indicate that FOXP2 expression is highly enriched in CT neurons of primary SSC during postnatal development. This is consistent with analysis in primary visual cortex of adult mice, which showed that <italic>Foxp2</italic>/FOXP2 expression is nearly exclusive to Ntsr1-cre expressing (CT) neurons in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sundberg et al., 2018</xref>). The present study builds on previous findings by demonstrating minimal colocalization with two layer 6 CC markers (MET and CCK). Notably, lower level expression of <italic>Foxp2</italic> transcript has been detected in molecularly-defined subcerebral projection neurons by RNA-sequencing at perinatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with the low-level expression observed in layer 5 at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Colocalization analysis with the pyramidal-tract (PT) neuron marker gene CTIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>), confirmed that these layer 5 neurons are PT-type neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in contrast to the temporally stable and relatively uniform expression of FOXP2 by CT neurons in layer 6 of the postnatal SSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), FOXP2 was expressed by a minor subset of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> PT neurons at P0 (34 ± 3%) and P7 (10 ± 2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), and was almost completely absent from retrogradely labeled PT neurons in Layer 5 of SSC by P14 (4.4 ± 1.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FOXP2 is not required for normal histogenesis of the cerebral cortex</title><p>Given the enrichment of FOXP2 in corticofugal neuron subclasses in SSC, coupled with previous reports of fundamental roles for <italic>Foxp2</italic> in cortical neuron development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clovis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Calero et al., 2016</xref>), we next used a direct genetic deletion strategy to examine putative involvement of FOXP2 in the development of anatomical and molecular properties of CT neurons. For these studies, mice harboring a <italic>Foxp2</italic> conditional allele (<italic>Foxp2<sup>fx</sup></italic>) were bred with the CT-specific reporter line <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Rosa-tdTomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Immunohistochemistry verified the elimination of FOXP2 from tdTomato+ neurons of <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>fx/fx</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset). tdTomato-expressing cell bodies remained limited to layer 6 of the cerebral cortex across genotypes, consistent with the absence of gross changes in laminar patterns due to <italic>Foxp2</italic> deletion. Confocal microscopy further revealed no overt changes in the distribution of tdTomato-labeled neurites in more superficial layers of cortex, suggesting minimal morphological rearrangement of the CT neuron population in response to <italic>Foxp2</italic> deletion. Inspection of tdTomato-labeled efferent axons arising from the deep layer neurons revealed a nearly identical pattern of CT innervation across <italic>Foxp2</italic> genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). There was normal fasciculation within the internal capsule and extensive axonal elaboration in the dorsal thalamus and thalamic reticular nuclei of <italic>Foxp2</italic> conditional knockout mice, their heterozygous littermates and <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Rosa-tdTomato</italic> mice on a wild-type C57Bl/6J background. Consistent with the reported cell-type specificity of the <italic>Ntsr1-cre</italic> driver line, no tdTomato-expressing axons in the corpus callosum or cerebral peduncle were evident for any <italic>Foxp2</italic> genotype at the ages examined.

Unexpectedly, the percentage of GFP and tdTomato double-positive neurons was minimal and indistinguishable across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; one-way ANOVA, p=0.441; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (WT) mean ± SEM = 1.9 ± 0.4; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/+</sup></italic> (cHET), mean ± SEM = 2.7 ± 0.1; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic> (cKO), mean ± SEM = 2 ± 0.5), indicating that the exclusion of <italic>Met</italic> expression from CT neurons occurs independent of transcriptional regulation by FOXP2. Next, to determine whether FOXP2 is required to repress CCK expression in CT neurons, colocalization of CCK and tdTomato was quantified. Despite abundant CCK expression among layer 6 neurons, there was minimal co-expression of CCK by tdTomato<sup>+</sup> neurons across <italic>Foxp2</italic> genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; one-way ANOVA, p=0.5016; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (WT) mean ± SEM = 0.6 ± 0.4; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/+</sup></italic> (cHET), mean ± SEM = 1.2 ± 0.4; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic> (cKO), mean ± SEM = 0.6 ± 0.4), consistent with selective CCK expression by layer 6 CC neurons and exclusion from CT neurons, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watakabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kast et al., 2019</xref>). These data indicate that FOXP2 is not required for the exclusion of CCK and <italic>Met</italic> expression from CT neurons. To determine whether molecular markers unique to CT neurons continue to be expressed in their normal pattern in the absence of FOXP2, labeling of FOG2 among tdTomato-expressing CT neurons was assessed in <italic>Foxp2</italic> conditional knockouts and their heterozygous littermates. FOG2 immunolabeling was detected in nearly 100% of CT neurons, independent of <italic>Foxp2</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>; one-way ANOVA, p=0.3163; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (WT) mean ± SEM = 97.1 ± 0.1; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/+</sup></italic> (cHET), mean ± SEM = 97.5 ± 0.7; <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic> (cKO), mean ± SEM = 96.1 ± 0.7).</p><p>Because <italic>Ntsr1-cre</italic> is selectively expressed in CT neurons, it is likely Cre expression begins postmitotically, but the timing of the developmental onset of Cre-mediated recombination in the <italic>Ntsr1-cre</italic> mouse line has not been reported. Given the normal development of CT neurons in <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx</sup></italic> conditional knockout mice, we reasoned that the potentially late timing of the developmental deletion of <italic>Foxp2</italic> could have influenced the lack of abnormal CT phenotypes. This possibility was investigated first by determining the onset of Cre-dependent tdTomato expression in <italic>Ntsr1-cre; Rosa-tdTomato</italic> embryos. Coronal sections of the embryonic forebrain were analyzed on embryonic days (E)14.5, E16.5, and E17.5. Expression of tdTomato was not detected until E17.5, when it was localized in a sparse population of subplate and layer 6 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, cre-mediated recombination in the <italic>Ntsr1-cre</italic> line does not begin until approximately E17, well after <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression is initiated in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferland et al., 2003</xref>), and at a developmental time point only shortly preceding the initial innervation of the thalamus by descending CT axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torii et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that <italic>Foxp2</italic> operates in an earlier developmental window, prior to <italic>Ntsr1-cre</italic> mediated recombination and the subsequent depletion of previously transcribed and translated <italic>Foxp2/</italic>FOXP2. To determine whether <italic>Foxp2</italic> might play a role earlier in the development of cortical neurons, the <italic>Emx1-cre</italic> driver line was employed, which exhibits cre-mediated recombination in dorsal pallial progenitors beginning at E10.5, when they have just started to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>). Evaluation of <italic>Emx1-cre</italic> embryos confirmed cre-dependent tdTomato expression by E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Much broader molecular profiling is warranted, but the data indicate that <italic>Foxp2</italic> is neither required for the specification of some of the unique molecular features of FOXP2<sup>+</sup> layer 6 CT neurons, nor for the regulation of alternate cell-type molecular signatures that were predicted from previous analysis of FOXP2 transcriptional regulatory targets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FOXP2 and early cortical neuron development</title><p>Using the early expressing <italic>Emx1-cre</italic> driver line (E10.5), the data show that <italic>Foxp2</italic> deletion does not disrupt the normal generation and migration of neurons in SSC. Thus, unlike other transcriptional regulators of cell-type identity (e.g. CTIP2, FEZF2, TBR1), for which dramatic changes in cell type numbers and projection phenotypes develop upon mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKenna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>), FOXP2 appears dispensable for the general production of cortical neurons and the specification of the specific projection populations that normally express FOXP2. This conclusion is consistent with the absence of developmental defects recently reported in <italic>Nex1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx</sup></italic> mice, in which <italic>Foxp2</italic> is deleted from postmitotic excitatory neurons of the dorsal pallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medvedeva et al., 2018</xref>). These results were unexpected given the data in previous studies using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation (IUEP)-mediated <italic>Foxp2</italic> shRNA knockdown, which demonstrated atypical cortical neurogenesis and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Calero et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, using IUEP and identical shRNA reagents, we observed similar phenotypes to those previously reported (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>). Several explanations, based on distinct methodologies, could account for the discrepant findings using IUEP knockdown compared to hetero- and homozygous genetic deletion. Recent studies have revealed compensatory transcriptional responses by orthologous transcripts in some mutant mouse lines, and thus it is possible that other Foxp family members could compensate for Foxp2 removal in our studies (discussed more below). Additionally, when crossed with the <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx</sup></italic> conditional allele, <italic>Emx1-cre</italic> leads to uniform removal of <italic>Foxp2</italic> from dorsal pallial progenitors, whereas <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation reduces gene expression in a much smaller subpopulation of cells. This generates a mosaic of <italic>Foxp2</italic>-positive and negative cells. The altered neurogenesis phenotype observed following IUEP mediated-knockdown could result from the removal of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in a mosaic fashion in the dorsal pallium resulting in atypical interactions between neighboring FOXP2<sup>+</sup> and FOXP2<sup>-</sup> cells. A similar mosaic effect could explain the altered migration observed following IUEP of <italic>Foxp2</italic> shRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>). Mosaic expression of mutant and wild-type alleles can influence cortical development, shown recently in mouse models of X-linked <italic>Pcdh19</italic> epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pederick et al., 2018</xref>). Resolving whether mosaic <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression can disrupt neurogenesis and migration will require many additional studies using methods distinct from shRNA knockdown, such as <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of Cre-expressing plasmid constructs into <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic> embryos. We note, however, the importance of determining the relevance of such mosaic effects, may depend on the identification of a natural context, in humans or developing mouse models, in which mosaic <italic>Foxp2</italic> function occurs in the cortex.</p><p>An alternative explanation is that the <italic>Foxp2</italic>-targeting shRNA used in ours and previous studies may lead to incomplete reduction of <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression. This would in turn result in different adaptive responses compared to complete deletion of <italic>Foxp2</italic> genetically. Similar mechanistic explanations have been posed for the discrepant observations of germline versus IUEP-mediated manipulation of doublecortin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2003</xref>). Noteworthy is the finding that ectopic overexpression of <italic>Foxp2</italic> results in a paradoxically similar arrest in the radial migration of cortical neurons caused by <italic>Foxp2</italic> shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clovis et al., 2012</xref>). While no direct evidence currently exists, non-physiological mosaic reduction or overexpression of FOXP2 could create an imbalance that itself disrupts cortical development, while genetic disruptions fail to produce the same phenotypes. Finally, shRNA knockdown does have the technical caveat of potential ‘off-target’ effects, which cannot be ruled out unequivocally. For example, it is possible that the Foxp2 shRNAs also impact the expression of other genes including other Foxp family members, such as Foxp1, which are expressed in the cortex and could hypothetically compensate for Foxp2 function in our knockout studies. However, in vitro analysis of the specificity of the shRNA constructs suggested that they did not alter the levels of Foxp1 or Foxp4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, it is noteworthy that, in a previous study, quantification of<italic> Foxp1</italic> and <italic>Foxp4 </italic>transcript levels demonstrated that these genes were expressed at similar levels in WT and <italic>Foxp2 </italic>conditional knockout embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">French et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, recombination of the <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx</sup></italic> allele does not necesarrily trigger genetic compensation by other Foxp family members. Although unidentified compensatory mechanisms may mask a dispensable role that Foxp2 plays in the core aspects of cortical development studied here, based on results obtained following complete genetic removal of <italic>Foxp2</italic> function, we conclude that <italic>Foxp2</italic> does not play an essential role in murine SSC neurogenesis, neuron migration, subtype specification or axonal pathfinding, contrary to conclusions of other studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications of FOXP2 in developmental disorders</title><p>The lack of overt changes in the generation, migration, differentiation, or axon pathfinding of SSC neurons following conditional <italic>Foxp2</italic> deletion, using two different Cre driver lines, is important to consider in several contexts. The results may have implications for understanding the involvement of the cerebral cortex in speech and language impairments associated with <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vargha-Khadem et al., 2005</xref>). The results suggest that loss of <italic>FOXP2</italic> function likely does not contribute to these deficits through altered cortical histogenesis. However, it is important to note that the present studies were carried out in mice, and thus it remains possible that novel species-specific roles for <italic>Foxp2</italic> may have been acquired in the human lineage. Nonetheless, the results provide foundational knowledge that will be essential when designing studies to further address the role of FOXP2 in the development and function of specific neuronal cell types in the cortex.</p><p>The normal development of cortical phenotypes in <italic>Foxp2</italic> conditional knockout mice is consistent with conventional magnetic resonance imaging of brain structure in patients with <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations, which did not identify substantive alterations in gray and white matter structure of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vargha-Khadem et al., 2005</xref>). However, more refined analysis using voxel-based morphometric analysis identified spatially restricted, minor alterations in the gray matter in perisylvian cortical areas of patients with <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belton et al., 2003</xref>). Area-restricted deficits in the development of cerebral cortical anatomy may occur in <italic>Foxp2</italic> conditional knockout mice, but were not detected in the present study due to the focus of the analysis on primary SSC. More expansive studies will need to be pursued. In addition, given the lack of speech and language homologous regions in the cerebral cortex of mice, discovery of regional disruptions relevant to humans with <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations may not be possible.</p><p>Here, the genetic deletion of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in mice is distinct from the most common mutations observed in human patients with inherited speech and language abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDermot et al., 2005</xref>). Cre-mediated recombination of the conditional <italic>Foxp2</italic> allele produces a nonsense mutation that eliminates DNA-binding ability and causes near complete loss of FOXP2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">French et al., 2007</xref>). Functionally analogous, truncating <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations have been identified in some patients with speech and language disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDermot et al., 2005</xref>). However, missense mutations like the one in the KE pedigree are more common and are the best characterized in terms of their associated brain abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vargha-Khadem et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the conditional knockout mice used here may not fully recapitulate aberrant FOXP2 functions caused by single amino acid changes, which are proposed to elicit dominant-negative functions that could be distinct from the simple loss-of-function caused by conditional <italic>Foxp2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsui et al., 2013</xref>). For example, missense <italic>FOXP2</italic> mutations could lead to gain-of-function impairments by influencing the activity of other transcription factors. Importantly, transgenic mouse models that carry the same missense mutations as those observed in human populations have been generated and functionally, but not developmentally, characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">French and Fisher, 2014</xref>). Irrespective of the differences in the genetic strategies used to disrupt <italic>Foxp2</italic>, the present results strongly suggest that the histogenesis of murine SSC does not depend on transcriptional regulation by FOXP2.</p><p>Finally, in <italic>Foxp2</italic> constitutive knockout mice, medium spiny neurons of the striatum display decreased mEPSC frequency, decreased dendritic spine density, and increased mEPSC amplitudes, whereas the macro-level organization and cell-type composition of the striatum remains intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether the cortical neurons that express Foxp2 display similar synaptic abnormalities in <italic>Foxp2</italic> knockout mice. Altered excitability of CT neurons could contribute to atypical activity within cortico-striato-thalamocortical loops that are important for motor control and information processing, which could significantly alter speech related functions. The demonstration that the histological organization of the somatosensory cortex is unaffected by the removal of <italic>Foxp2</italic> warrants more detailed characterization of cortical circuit

Similarly, numbers of FOG2<sup>+ </sup>and CTIP2+/FOG2<sup>-</sup> nuclei at P14 were manually quantified by an observer blind to genotype, due to challenges in automated detection of the lower level expression at this time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image adjustments and figure preparation</title><p>Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (CS6). Only linear adjustments (i.e. gamma = 1.0) were made to the contrast and signal levels of fluorescence microscopy images, and were done in an identical manner across genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experimental design and statistics</title><p>Numbers of biological replicates (number of animals) for each experiment are included in the figure legends. Numbers of animals in each group were chosen in accordance with group numbers in previous publications reporting differences in murine cortical phenotypes similar to those measured in the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woodworth et al., 2016</xref>). Summary statistics and specific statistical tests used are described in the Results section. Parametric tests were used in some cases, although tests for normality were not possible given the modest sample sizes. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Simon Fisher and Dr. Catherine French for generously sharing the <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx </sup></italic>mice. We thank Dr. James Morgan and Dr. Takeshi Kaneko for providing anti-PCP4 and anti-CCK antibodies, respectively.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;FOXP2 exhibits neuron class specific expression, but is not required for multiple aspects of cortical histogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Myriam Heiman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Interest in <italic>Foxp2</italic> derives from human genetics, where it is linked to developmental language defects. Given the paucity of disease genes linked to language, the original finding of <italic>Foxp2</italic> defects in humans was very exciting. Studies in the mouse suggested that it is important in development of the cerebral cortex, specifically layer 6 cortical neurons. Here, the authors use mouse genetics to delete FoxP2 from the developing mouse cortex. They did not find defects in cortical neuron genesis, migration, or corticothalamic connectivity. Other defects may be present, but were not characterized. These data are important to the field, since language and cognitive development of humans is such an interesting, but difficult, topic to address outside of animal models. As the current manuscript shows convincing evidence (but needing more documentation of <italic>Foxp2</italic> loss) that the previous studies from mouse are incorrect, these data are important to set things right.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Loss of <italic>Foxp2</italic> needs to be definitively established along with the timing of the loss. RNA ISH, using RNAscope, or the new SABER FISH method, can give quantitative data on RNA level or isoform changes. If IHC of IF are used, controls must be convincing.</p><p>2) The numbers of animals used for various experiments needs to be provided, and that those numbers should be &gt;2. For negative findings, it is important that we are not looking at some biological oddities.</p><p>3) Assess the expression of <italic>Foxp1</italic> following the KO of <italic>Foxp2</italic>. Again, can be done by ISH. If not ISH, then again any protein detection must be done in a convincing and quantitative manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an important study utilizing mouse genetics to assess the requirement of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in cortical development. The findings are predominantly negative building upon previous loss and gain of function studies, which suggested an important role for <italic>Foxp2</italic> in layer 5/6 cortical development. Surprisingly, the findings from the current study instead suggest that <italic>Foxp2</italic> does not appear to be required for deep layer neuron generation, specification, or axonal pathfinding.</p><p>Importantly, I think these negative results would be a valuable contribution to the field and would be received with much interest. The study was well-executed and if a few more experiments were performed, I think it could increase confidence in the results. After completion of additional experiments, it should be accepted for publication.</p><p>Overall critiques/questions:</p><p>To look at the early specification of CT neurons, the authors utilize Emx1-cre tdTomato reporter. In their conditional FOXP2 deletion, is the total number or overall size of the cortex affected? In the Emx1-cre <italic>Foxp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, for example, it seems as though the overall brain size is affected, at least transiently during development? Figure 2—figure supplement 1 is a good example of that. I can see that at adult stages, the total number of Fog2 positive cells is comparable, but is there a chance that during development there are differences in the timing of their generation that might affect brain function?</p><p>A related concern about experimental design, the authors use <italic>foxp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> as a control to <italic>foxp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> emx1-cre</italic>, to report that the number of Fog2 cells in layer 6 are reduced, although not significantly. One issue is that the control is not really an appropriate control.</p><p>To investigate the early phenotypes of FOXP2, the authors use Emx1-cre and find early evidence of recombination, but only report loss of protein at E16.5, which seems pretty late in layer 6 differentiation. It would be important to investigate further loss of <italic>Foxp2</italic> protein becomes apparent.</p><p>The authors emphasize <italic>Foxp2</italic> mutations in speech deficits and forebrain development, which may have an impact in human cortical neurogenesis. However, the studies were performed in mouse. The text should clarify that this is mouse forebrain development in the Abstract/Discussion and <italic>Foxp2</italic> requirement may be different in different species.</p><p><italic>Foxp2</italic> may be very important for circuit formation and function which may explain the disease phenotypes in humans. What are the effects of loss of <italic>Foxp2</italic> on connectivity? Synapse formation? Functional activity?</p><p>Could some differences be identified if you looked earlier in development during embryogenesis? Potentially <italic>Foxp2</italic> loss may affect timing of generation, differentiation, maturation etc. which would provide insight into its developmental role.</p><p>Although the authors speculate reasons for previously reported findings on <italic>Foxp2</italic>, it is difficult to reconcile with the current study without a more thorough characterization/description of <italic>Foxp2</italic> activity. Are there other genes known to compensate for <italic>Foxp2</italic>? It would be helpful to have some data reconciling the results of this study with previous findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Recent studies have suggested that FOXP2, a gene that in human is linked to developmental speech impairments, may have a role in cortical neurogenesis and migration. Although a study in the developing mouse brain by the Walsh group demonstrated that cortical <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression is absent from the ventricular zone and restricted to stages of late neuronal migration or during neuronal differentiation, and MRI studies of brain structure in patients with FOXP2 mutations showed no gross defects of the cerebral cortex, mouse overexpression and shRNA knockdown studies have suggested an important role for <italic>Foxp2</italic> in mouse cortical neurogenesis. To more fully investigate the proposed role of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in cortical histogenesis, Kast et al. have used molecular, neuroanatomical, genetic, and circuit level approaches. The data together convincingly show, with the use of two independent conditional genetic approaches, that murine <italic>Foxp2</italic> is not required for cortical neurogenesis or migration. The results are of great importance to the field to clarify the function of FOXP2.</p><p>One major point is that loss of <italic>Foxp2</italic> with the conditional genetic approaches is shown only with the use of a goat <italic>Foxp2</italic> polyclonal antibody. It would be important to present RNAScope (or similar in situ with cell type-specific resolution) and global qPCR assessment to show <italic>Foxp2</italic> mRNA depletion based on both conditional approaches.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This interesting paper essentially reports negative results: despite a good deal of previous data that supported a role for FoxP2 as being an important transcriptional regulator of layer 6 cortical neuron development, two different conditional knockout strategies reported here both lack any detectable phenotypes. Looking at neuronal projections (corticothalamic) and protein expression in layer 5 and 6 neurons (by immunofluorescence) in both models, no differences with controls were observed. To control for timing of Cre-mediated recombination, the study was carried out using Cre lines with early (Emx1-Cre) and late (Ntsr1-Cre) expression, and presumably recombination.</p><p>Overall, this is a thorough and well-reported study. One potential area of concern is that the paper is completely dependent on using immunofluorescence in sections for FoxP2, using a commercial polyclonal antibody, to confirm the timing and degree of loss of FoxP2 function. In terms of major comments, this is the one area that is essential to address with a technically independent method: confirming that either the mRNA or protein are completely absent from the knockout cortex, and when this is the case.</p><p>Related to this, the authors speculate a good deal as to why acute knockdown with shRNA would lead to detectable phenotypes, whereas the genetic knockout does not. Aside from the additional experiment suggested above to confirm that this is a true null, the lack of discussion of possible redundancy with or compensation by FoxP1 is a puzzling omission. FoxP1 expression overlaps with FoxP2 in many regions/times – some comment by the authors in the discussion on whether this may or may not compensate for FoxP2 would be helpful.</p><p>The conclusion of the paper lacks balance: the authors do not detect gross phenotypes in cell specification or projections, but there are many other features that are not studied here, including neuronal maturation, dendrite development, synaptogenesis etc. Given that FoxP2 is largely expressed post-mitotically in migratory neurons, the title and main conclusions do not accurately reflect the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42012.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Loss of Foxp2 needs to be definitively established along with the timing of the loss.

Hisaoka et al., 2010, reported using double labeling methods that <italic>Foxp1</italic> (concentrated in layers 2-5) and <italic>Foxp2</italic> (concentrated in layer 6, with some expression in layer 5) are expressed almost exclusively in different neuronal populations in the cerebral cortex. There is minor overlap in deep layer 5. There is, however, substantial overlap of <italic>Foxp1</italic> and <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression in the developing striatum, and yet Vernes et al., 2011 nor French et al., 2007 , did not report <italic>Foxp1</italic> expression changes in striatum or whole brain at E16.5, well after <italic>Foxp2</italic> positive neurons are generated. Given the lack of significant overlap in the cerebral cortex, and the hundreds of other genes identified by Vernes et al. that exhibit changes in expression in mice carrying a <italic>Foxp2</italic> mutation, we believe the rationale is weak for doing further studies of <italic>Foxp1</italic> expression. We do believe it would be of interest to do an in depth profiling of gene expression using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of <italic>Foxp2</italic>-expressing layer 6 and 5 neurons, but that profiling would require follow-up functional studies to determine the relevant developmental adaptations, which we argue is well beyond the scope of the current report. Finally, as we note below in response to reviewer #1, changes in gene expression of other Foxp family members, or any other genes, due to <italic>Foxp2</italic> loss, would not provide conclusive mechanistic evidence for the lack of a phenotype, nor would it change the main conclusion of this report that <italic>Foxp2</italic> is not required for cortical development phenotypes that have been assigned previously to <italic>Foxp2</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall critiques/questions:</p><p>To look at the early specification of CT neurons, the authors utilize Emx1-cre tdTomato reporter.

The results (Figure 3C, D) demonstrated that the number of CT neurons were not statistically significantly different across genotypes. Additionally, the radial thickness of the cortex was measured at P14 and found to be indistinguishable across genotypes (Figure 3H, I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems as though the overall brain size is affected, at least transiently during development.

We have looked more carefully at this and included comparisons of very closely matched (in terms of anterior-posterior level) coronal sections from cKO and control littermates. The new data show that the size of the brains are not different across genotypes at E14, E16, P0, or P14. We have replaced the images in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 with these new images at E16. These sections also were stained with an optimized immunohistochemical procedure to convincingly show the presence and absence of cortical FOXP2+ cells in the control and cKO brains, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I can see that at adult stages, the total number of Fog2 positive cells is comparable, but is there a chance that during development there are differences in the timing of their generation that might affect brain function?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the numbers of layer 6 neuron subtypes at P0 and P14 and found no differences across genotypes at either age. So, any developmental differences would be limited to the late prenatal period. We have not performed an exhaustive analysis of cell types across genotypes during prenatal development, so we cannot rule out such a change. The hypothesized rate changes of neuronal subtype differentiation would need to be limited to a 72-hour developmental window, between E16.5 (FOXP2 onset) and P0.5 (when we observe no differences in cell numbers). We note that addressing this hypothesis would require analysis at many prenatal time points (to account for variation in developmental timing due to the imprecision in determining fertilization), and thus many more months of experimentation. While possible, we believe rate changes in differentiation are unlikely, and moreover would not explain the end result of normal subpopulation representations and other normal phenotypes in the <italic>Foxp2</italic> cKO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related concern about experimental design, the authors use foxp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> as a control to foxp2<sup>fl/fl</sup> emx1-cre, to report that the number of Fog2 cells in layer 6 are reduced, although not significantly. One issue is that the control is not really an appropriate control.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text to properly emphasize that there is no statistical difference in the numbers of Fog2 cells across genotypes. We share the reviewer’s emphasis on properly controlling for genotypes in these experiments, which is why 4 genotypes were included in experiments that suggested a trending effect when comparing <italic>Emx1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic>and <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic>littermates (e.g. Fog2 counts at P0). We note that most developmental studies of similar type to the report here do not include 4 relevant genotypes, as we have done. In experiments in which initial comparisons of <italic>Emx1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup> </italic>and <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic> groups did not show any differences (i.e. cell type counts and cortical thickness measurements at P14), we chose not to include a Cre-only control group as there was no effect of <italic>Foxp2</italic> removal. We added the Cre-only control group in cases where initial data indicated that there might be a trend. We have repeated the experiment by increasing the sample sizes (N) of each group in the P0 cell type counting experiment:</p><p>1 – <italic>Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic> from n=5 to n=7</p><p>2 – cHet from n=5 to n=6</p><p>3 – cKO from n=4 to n=7</p><p>4 – Emx1-cre only from n=4 to n=6</p><p>The results of the experiment, and the application of appropriate non-parametric statistics, with correction for multiple comparisons, continue to support our conclusion that the numbers of Fog2 cells are not different across genotypes, and thus <italic>Foxp2</italic> does not influence the specification of this cortical cell type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To investigate the early phenotypes of FOXP2, the authors use Emx1-cre and find early evidence of recombination, but only report loss of protein at E16.5, which seems pretty late in layer 6 differentiation.

This precedes the expression of FOXP2 protein, which we could not detect through IHC until E16.5. We note that our assessment of initial expression of FOXP2 protein is consistent with that reported by Ferland et al., 2003, and in the in situ hybridization data publicly available in the Allen Brain Institute database for developing mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors emphasize Foxp2 mutations in speech deficits and forebrain development, which may have an impact in human cortical neurogenesis.

What are the effects of loss of Foxp2 on connectivity? Synapse formation? Functional activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this statement. For example, it is clear that disruption of <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression in the striatum has developmental and functional outcomes. However, we wish to re-emphasize that the results of experiments probing later aspects of brain development and function would be difficult to interpret in the absence of the foundational data provided in the present study. Moreover, in the context of the dramatic effects attributed to <italic>Foxp2</italic> in previous publications, such experiments would seem somewhat distant from the primary action of <italic>Foxp2</italic>. Given the lack of overt histological changes, we agree that as a follow-up of the current detailed analysis, it would be of interest to investigate the role of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in later aspects of brain development, plasticity and function. We believe the current study will assist in focusing those in the field on other epochs of development that speak to the issue raised by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could some differences be identified if you looked earlier in development during embryogenesis? Potentially Foxp2 loss may affect timing of generation, differentiation, maturation etc. which would provide insight into its developmental role.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is related to our third response to reviewer 1 above and we have addressed the challenges of the hypothesis of evaluating timing of maturation in a short window from the onset of <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression to our initial quantitative analysis (72 hr). As noted for #6, we believe follow-up studies are merited, but are beyond the scope of the present study. We have attempted to be very careful about the conclusions drawn with regard to speaking only to the time periods and measures that we have conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors speculate reasons for previously reported findings on Foxp2, it is difficult to reconcile with the current study without a more thorough characterization/description of Foxp2 activity. Are there other genes known to compensate for Foxp2? It would be helpful to have some data reconciling the results of this study with previous findings.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and valid point. Indeed, pioneering work by Edward Morrisey and colleagues demonstrated the functional cooperativity of Foxp family members including <italic>Foxp1</italic>, 2, and 4 in the development of anterior gut derived structures including the esophagus and airway (Li et al., 2004; Shu et al., 2007). These studies demonstrated that compound <italic>Foxp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Foxp1</italic><sup>-/+</sup> mutants display more dramatic lung development defects than <italic>Foxp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> single mutants, but in the case of the lung, even <italic>Foxp2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> single mutants showed defects in anterior gut developmental phenotypes. The present neurodevelopmental study aimed to build on previous publications that concluded that <italic>Foxp2</italic> plays a critical role in corticogenesis. However, we found that previous conclusions drawn about the role of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in cortical development (suggested to occur independent of manipulating other Foxp family members using shRNA technology) are inconsistent with the genetic approaches used here, with 2 different Cre driver lines, performed in the present study. Genetic manipulations are typically taken as the gold standard for determining gene function, although other approaches can be valuable. Thus, while the possibility still exists that compensation for the loss of <italic>Foxp2</italic> function [by any mechanism, including <italic>Foxp1</italic> upregulation, or upregulation of the hundreds of transcripts reportedly regulated by <italic>Foxp2</italic> (Vernes et al., 2011)] might mask a valid, but nonessential, role for <italic>Foxp2</italic> in the development of the cortex, the main conclusion drawn here – that <italic>Foxp2</italic> is not required for basic cortical histogenic events that include cell type production in which <italic>Foxp2</italic> is expressed, and fundamental cortical axon extension and targeting to the dorsal thalamus and pyramidal tract – is supported firmly by the present data. Developmental manipulations can also be assessed for potential compensatory mechanisms, because phenotypes could be a sum of direct loss of gene activity coupled with adaptations. These types of studies are of great interest, and will require significant new detailed molecular, developmental and functional experiments that will likely take years, given the number of genes that are regulated putatively by Foxp family members. We believe this is well beyond the scope of the present study, and will not impact the conclusions drawn that <italic>Foxp2</italic> is not required for specific aspects of cortical development in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] One major point is that loss of Foxp2 with the conditional genetic approaches is shown only with the use of a goat Foxp2 polyclonal antibody. It would be important to present RNAScope (or similar in situ with cell type-specific resolution) and global qPCR assessment to show Foxp2 mRNA depletion based on both conditional approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new ISH data based on a new method (BaseScope) that demonstrates complete absence of <italic>Foxp2</italic> exons 12-14 (floxed region, encodes DNA-binding domain) in the dorsal pallium of <italic>Emx1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic>mice from at least E14.5 onward due to the recombination of the floxed <italic>Foxp2</italic> allele in the cortex. We note that we were unable to detect FOXP2 protein until E16.5, and thus genetic recombination occurs prior to FOXP2 protein production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] One potential area of concern is that the paper is completely dependent on using immunofluorescence in sections for FoxP2, using a commercial polyclonal antibody, to confirm the timing and degree of loss of FoxP2 function. In terms of major comments, this is the one area that is essential to address with a technically independent method: confirming that either the mRNA or protein are completely absent from the knockout cortex, and when this is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we’ve added new ISH data based on a new method (BaseScope) that demonstrates complete absence of <italic>Foxp2</italic> exons 12-14 (floxed region, encodes DNA-binding domain) in the dorsal pallium of <italic>Emx1-cre; Foxp2<sup>Fx/Fx</sup></italic>mice. Please see response to reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, the authors speculate a good deal as to why acute knockdown with shRNA would lead to detectable phenotypes, whereas the genetic knockout does not. Aside from the additional experiment suggested above to confirm that this is a true null, the lack of discussion of possible redundancy with or compensation by FoxP1 is a puzzling omission. FoxP1 expression overlaps with FoxP2 in many regions/times – some comment by the authors in the Discussion on whether this may or may not compensate for FoxP2 would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above (Essential revisions, comment #3), <italic>Foxp2</italic> and <italic>Foxp1</italic> are expressed mostly in non-overlapping neuronal populations in the developing and adult cerebral cortex. We have added discussion to address this. Also, as noted, given the plethora of genes with Foxp family member DNA binding sites and that are hypothetically regulated by <italic>Foxp2</italic>, compensation is certainly possible, and we note this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion of the paper lacks balance: the authors do not detect gross phenotypes in cell specification or projections, but there are many other features that are not studied here, including neuronal maturation, dendrite development, synaptogenesis etc. Given that FoxP2 is largely expressed post-mitotically in migratory neurons, the title and main conclusions do not accurately reflect the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript to ensure accuracy in the conclusions drawn from these studies. While limited to the late prenatal and early postnatal periods, we do not believe that the phenotypes we studied are gross in nature. Cell type specification is an essential histogenic event for which connectivity, circuit formation and function all depend upon. We agree that doing studies later in development may be useful for follow-up, but would not change the careful conclusions that we have drawn.</p></body></sub-article></article>
