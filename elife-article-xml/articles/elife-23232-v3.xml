Variability of behavior is commonly attributed to noise in the brain’s decision-making machinery. We hypothesized that phasic responses of brainstem arousal systems are a significant source of this variability. We tracked pupil responses (a proxy of phasic arousal) during sensory-motor decisions in humans, across different sensory modalities and task protocols. Large pupil responses generally predicted a reduction in decision bias. Using fMRI, we showed that the pupil-linked bias reduction was (i) accompanied by a modulation of choice-encoding pattern signals in parietal and prefrontal cortex and (ii) predicted by phasic, pupil-linked responses of a number of neuromodulatory brainstem centers involved in the control of cortical arousal state, including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus. We conclude that phasic arousal suppresses decision bias on a trial-by-trial basis, thus accounting for a significant component of the variability of choice behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23232.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23232.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23232.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When asked to make repeated decisions we will often choose differently each time even when we are given the same information to inform our choice. A stock trader, for example, will typically be more inclined to buy on some days and sell on others even if the financial markets remain unchanged. Fluctuations in the brain’s level of alertness or excitability, otherwise known as its arousal, are thought to contribute to this variability in decision-making.</p><p>An area at the base of the brain called the brainstem – and in particular one of its subregions, the locus coeruleus – helps shape arousal levels by releasing chemicals called neuromodulators. For reasons that remain unknown, activation of the locus coeruleus also causes the pupil of the eye to suddenly increase in size. Now, de Gee et al. have exploited this link to unravel how changes in brain arousal lead to systematic changes in decision-making.</p><p>Volunteers were asked to judge whether a faint pattern was embedded in flickering noise on a computer screen, and to report their judgment by pressing one of two buttons to indicate “yes” or “no”. Although the decision was comparatively simple, it did involve evaluating changing information over time before making a choice – like when considering the stock market. As the volunteers performed the task, de Gee et al. measured their brain activity and the size of their pupils. Most of the volunteers had a tendency to respond “no” even when the pattern was present. However, whenever their locus coeruleus was particularly active, and their pupils increased in size, their decision process was changed so that this unhelpful choice bias decreased.</p><p>This suggests that by boosting arousal, the locus coeruleus reduces existing biases in our decision-making. Varying levels of locus coeruleus activity may thus explain why we can reach different conclusions when considering the same information on multiple occasions. The next challenge is to identify what it is about the decision-making process that activates the locus coeruleus on some occasions but not others.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23232.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23232.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>Locus Coeruleus</kwd><kwd>Decision-making</kwd><kwd>Trial-to-trial variability</kwd><kwd>Accumulator model</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>283314-NOREPI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nieuwenhuis</surname><given-names>Sander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 936/Z1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DO1240/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>604102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donner</surname><given-names>Tobias H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rapid increases in the brain’s level of alertness, or arousal, contribute to variability in decision making by reducing existing biases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decision-makers often arrive at different choices in the face of repeated presentations of the same evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shadlen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sugrue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wyart and Koechlin, 2016</xref>). This intrinsic behavioral variability is typically attributed to spontaneous fluctuations of neural activity in the brain regions computing decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shadlen et al., 1996</xref>) (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>]). Indeed, fluctuations of neural activity are ubiquitous in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faisal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One candidate source of these fluctuations in cortical activity is systematic variation in central arousal state. Central arousal state is controlled by the neuromodulatory systems of the brainstem, which have widespread projections to cortex and tune neuronal parameters governing the operating mode of their cortical target circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>). Importantly, these neuromodulatory systems operate at different timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>). Some, in particular the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), are rapidly recruited, in a time-locked fashion, during elementary decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouret and Sara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>). Pupil diameter, a reliable peripheral marker of central (cortical) arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>), also increases during decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beatty, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lempert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>). These observations point to an important role of phasic (i.e., fast) pupil-linked arousal signals in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>). Yet, the precise nature of this role has remained unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigated how phasic, task-related arousal interacts with decision computations in the human brain. We combined pupillometry, fMRI, and computational modeling to probe into the interplay between task-related arousal and decision computations underlying elementary sensory-motor choice tasks. Sensory-motor decisions entail the gradual accumulation of noisy ‘sensory evidence’ about the state of the world towards categorical decision states governing behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>). A large-scale network of regions in frontal and parietal cortex seems to accumulate stimulus responses provided by sensory cortices towards choices of motor movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Siegel et al., 2011</xref>) (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Katz et al., 2016</xref>]). We here aimed to elucidate the interaction between pupil-linked arousal responses, evidence accumulation, and decision processing across several (cortical and subcortical) brain regions.</p><p>Large task-evoked pupil responses were consistently accompanied by a reduction in perceptual decision bias in different sensory modalities (visual and auditory) and task protocols (detection and discrimination). Decision bias reflects the degree to which an observer’s choice deviates from the objective sensory evidence. Using fMRI for one of these tasks revealed that the bias reduction was accompanied by a modulation of choice-encoding pattern signals in prefrontal and parietal cortex. Further, the bias reduction was predicted by task-evoked, pupil-linked responses in a network of neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei controlling cortical arousal state. We conclude that phasic neuromodulatory signals reduce biases in the brain’s decision-making machinery. As a consequence, phasic arousal accounts for a significant component of the variability of choice behavior, over and above the objective evidence gathered from the outside world.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We systematically quantified the interaction between pupil-linked arousal responses and decision computations at the algorithmic and neural levels of analysis. We here operationalize ‘phasic arousal’ as task-evoked pupil responses (TPR). This operational definition is based on recent animal work, which established remarkably strong correlations between non-luminance mediated variations in pupil diameter and global cortical arousal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>The Results section is organized as follows. First, we quantify TPRs during the main behavioral task studied in this paper. The key observation here was the substantial trial-to-trial variability of the TPR amplitude. All subsequent analyses exploited this variability to pinpoint the functional correlates of phasic arousal. We then present results from modeling TPR-dependent changes in choice behavior, identifying precise algorithmic correlates of phasic arousal. These results yielded detailed predictions for the underlying modulations of cortical signals. Third, we present tests of these predictions, focusing on functionally delineated cortical regions of interest. We conclude by establishing that the trial-to-trial fluctuations in TPR amplitude, and the associated bias reduction, were closely linked to task-evoked responses of neuromodulatory brainstem centers involved in regulating cortical arousal state.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tracking trial-to-trial fluctuations in phasic arousal</title><p>The main task used in this study was detection (‘yes-no’, simple forced choice protocol) of a low-contrast grating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The grating contrast was titrated to the 75% correct level, and subjects did not receive trial-by-trial feedback. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>), TPR amplitudes during this task fluctuated widely from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; see Materials and Methods for quantification of TPR). To illustrate, pooling trials into two bins containing the lowest and highest 40% of TPR amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) yielded, on average, the commonly observed task-evoked pupil dilations for the high TPR bin, but pupil constrictions for the low TPR bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We used a previously established model to estimate the time course of the neural input driving the measured TPRs (GLM; see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). This revealed that the difference between the low and high TPR bins was primarily due to the difference in a sustained component that spanned the entire interval from cue to behavioral choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The difference of the sustained component between low and high TPR was significantly larger than the corresponding difference for two components at cue or choice, respectively (2-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors temporal component and TPR bin; interaction: F<sub>2,26</sub> = 79.00, p&lt;0.001).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23232.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task and task-evoked pupil responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yes-no contrast detection task.

In all cases, here and below, we tested whether fits of second-order polynomials, reflecting non-monotonic relationships between TPR and behavior, were superior to the linear fits (via sequential polynomial regression analysis; Materials and methods). We found a non-monotonic relationship between TPR and sensitivity in the behavioral data set from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al. (2014)</xref>, but not in the fMRI dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>, left panels). This non-monotonic (inverted U-shape) relationship between pupil diameter and sensitivity is consistent with previous animal work on correlations between baseline arousal and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>). However, it was less consistent across the data sets analyzed in this paper than the negative linear effect of TPR on decision bias. The consistent effect of TPR on decision bias has not been reported before in previous studies of slow fluctuations of baseline pupil diameter. In what follows, we focus on the negative effect of TPR on decision bias.</p><p>Most subjects were overall (i.e., without splitting trials by TPR) intrinsically biased to respond ‘no’: 10 out of 14 subjects exhibited a significantly conservative criterion (within-subject permutation tests; p&lt;0.05) in the fMRI data set, and 14 out of 21 subjects in the data set from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al. (2014)</xref>. Because signal+noise and noise trials were equally frequent in both experiments, this bias was always maladaptive. Critically, this maladaptive bias was particularly pronounced under low TPR; but under high TPR the bias was nearly neutralized, especially in the fMRI data set (criterion around zero, and fraction of ‘yes’-choices around 0.5 for highest TPR bins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A robust effect of phasic arousal on the decision computation</title><p>A number of control analyses and experiments supported the idea that the negative correlation between TPR amplitude and decision bias reflected a specific effect of phasic arousal on the decision computation that generalized across perceptual choice tasks. First, the effect emerged during, not after, decision formation: a sliding-window correlation between TPR and criterion became negative from decision onset onwards, and reached statistical significance before button press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). In the fMRI data set, this correlation was highly significant more than 800 ms before button press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Given the sluggish nature of the pupil response (see above), the underlying central arousal transients must have occurred even earlier than that, leaving substantial time for shaping the decision outcome.</p><p>Second, there was no robust association between baseline pupil diameter and decision bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). This ruled out possible concerns that the effect might be due to corresponding (opposite) associations between baseline pupil diameter and behavior, ‘inherited’ by TPR through its negative correlation with baseline pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Third, the effect of TPR on decision bias was robust with respect to the details of the analysis approach. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, as for all other analyses reported in the main text, we removed (via linear regression) components explained by RT. The rationale was to specifically isolate variations in the amplitudes of the neural responses driving TPR, irrespective of RT, variations of which might also cause variations of TPR amplitude without changes in the underlying neural response amplitudes (for details see Materials and methods). We observed the same linear effect of TPR on bias without removing trial-to-trial variations in TPR that were due to RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pupil-linked bias reduction is a general phenomenon</title><p>Fourth, the effect of TPR on decision bias shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> generalized to other perceptual choice tasks, which differed on several dimensions from the main contrast detection task used in this paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In one follow-up experiment, we measured pupil-linked behavior during an auditory yes-no (tone-in-noise) detection task near psychophysical threshold using the same stimuli as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>) (see Materials and methods). The only visual stimulus was a stable fixation dot. The decision interval contained only auditory noise (the same as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>)) on half the trials, and a pure sine wave superimposed onto the noise on the other half of the trials. Again, TPR predicted a significant (linear) reduction in conservative decision bias, and an increased tendency to respond ‘yes’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

Symmetric two-alternative forced choice tasks are commonly associated with weaker biases than yes-no detection tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>). We used a symmetric visual random dot motion (up vs. down) discrimination task near psychophysical threshold with feedback after each trial (see Materials and methods). Although many subjects exhibited clear biases for reporting one or the other direction, these were more evenly distributed around zero than in the above yes-no tasks, in which the sign of the bias was largely consistent across individuals. Therefore, we here analyzed subjects’ absolute criterion values (i.e., overall bias regardless of sign) and fraction of non-preferred choices (i.e., the choice opposite to their general bias, irrespective of TPR). Again, TPR predicted a reduction in absolute decision bias, and an increase in the fraction of non-preferred choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), analogous to the effects observed for the detection tasks above.</p><p>In sum, a number of analyses and experiments showed that pupil-linked, phasic arousal was consistently associated with a monotonic reduction in perceptual decision biases in different sensory modalities and task protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phasic arousal predicts a reduction of evidence accumulation bias</title><p>To further pinpoint the nature of the TPR-induced bias suppression, we fitted the drift diffusion model, an established dynamic model of two-choice decision processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>]) to subjects’ RT distributions from the main task (contrast detection).

Within the model, the TPR-induced reduction of conservative bias, evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, may have been brought about by two distinct mechanistic scenarios: (i) the evidence accumulation process started from a level closer to the ‘yes’-bound (i.e., a change in the ‘starting point’ parameter); or (ii) the accumulation process was driven more towards the ‘yes’-bound (i.e., a change in the ‘drift criterion’ parameter). The drift criterion is equivalent to an evidence-independent constant added to the drift. A non-zero drift criterion results in a bias of the decision variable that grows linearly with time. Although clearly distinct in nature, both mechanisms (starting point and drift criterion) would have resulted in an increase in the fraction of ‘yes’-choices, and thus a reduction of decision bias. Critically, both mechanisms were distinguishable through their distinct effects on the shape of the RT distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To dissociate between these alternative mechanisms we fitted the model, while allowing several model parameters (boundary separation, non-decision time, mean drift rate, starting point, and drift criterion) to vary with TPR.</p><p>The model fits (see Materials and methods and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>]) supported the second mechanism: a change in drift criterion. An individual example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and group data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Drift criterion was generally negative, indicating an overall conservative accumulation bias towards the bound for ‘no’-choices. But drift criterion was pushed closer towards zero under high TPR, indicating an unbiased drift, as optimal for the current task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The other main parameters (including starting point and mean drift rate) were not significantly affected by TPR. The TPR-linked effect on drift criterion was also evident in the individual point estimates from the fMRI sample only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Again, we we found no evidence for an effect on any parameter of the drift diffusion model when comparing trials with low and high baseline pupil diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and we obtained qualitatively identical results without removing trial-to-trial variations of RT from the TPR amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>; Materials and methods).</p><p>As a control of the significance of the TPR-dependent effect on drift criterion, we re-fitted the model, but now fixing drift criterion with TPR, while still allowing all other of the above parameters to vary with TPR. In this variant of the model, we again found no TPR-dependent change in any of the other parameters (boundary separation: p=0.428; non-decision time: p=0.370; starting point: p=0.117; mean drift rate: p=0.361). Critically, model comparison favored the complete version of the model with TPR-dependent variation in drift criterion (deviance information criterion, 50437 vs. 50528, respectively; see Materials and methods). This implies that the TPR-dependent variability in accumulation bias was essential to account for the TPR-dependent effects on behavior.</p><p>The individual changes in drift criterion between low vs. high TPR trials established by means of diffusion modeling accounted for a substantial fraction of the individual differences in TPR-predicted changes in the fraction of ‘yes’-choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) obtained in the model-free analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>, right panels). TPR-related changes in starting point had a weaker, and statistically not significant, effect on the fraction of ‘yes’-choices (fMRI data set: r = −0.345, p=0.227; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al. (2014)</xref> data set: r = −0.419, p=0.059).</p><p>In sum, in the decision task studied here, pupil-linked, phasic arousal predicted a reduction of conservative bias, specifically in the evidence accumulation, and was neither reflected in the baseline level of the decision variable at the start of the accumulation nor its mean drift. In other words, TPR accounted for a portion of the trial-to-trial variability in the drift unrelated to the objective sensory evidence. This correlate of phasic arousal at the algorithmic level was in line with the notion that phasic arousal shapes decision outcome by interacting with the evidence accumulation computation that lies at the heart of the decision process.</p><p>Taken together, the behavioral modeling results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> put strong constraints on the expected changes in cortical decision processing due to phasic arousal. Specifically, changes in the encoding of the incoming evidence by sensory cortical areas, as observed in previous work on fluctuations in baseline arousal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>), would be associated with changes in perceptual sensitivity. However, we found that TPR was not associated with any robust change in sensitivity (measured as d’ or as mean drift rate) in the fMRI dataset, thus, predicting no TPR-linked modulation of sensory responses in visual cortex. Instead, the observed effect of TPR on choice bias (criterion, drift criterion) predicted a directed shift (towards ‘yes’) in neural signals encoding subjects’ choices, in downstream cortical regions. We next tested these predictions by assessing the relationship between TPR and (i) stimulus-specific responses in early visual cortex, and (ii) choice-specific responses in downstream cortical regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Phasic arousal does not boost sensory responses in visual cortex</title><p>The fMRI response in early visual cortex (areas V1, V2, and V3) during near-threshold visual tasks is made up of distinct components, including a (weak and focal) stimulus-specific component and a (large and global) task-related, but stimulus-independent, component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ress et al., 2000</xref>).

Because the majority of visual cortical neurons encoding stimulus contrast are also tuned to stimulus orientation, orientation-tuning could serve as a ‘filter’ to separate the cortical stimulus response from stimulus-unrelated signals. Specifically, the low contrast signal in our task should have evoked a small response in each visual cortical neuron selective for the orientation of the target signal (45° or 135°, on different experimental runs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) across a substantial part of the retinotopic map. Thus, the presence or absence of the target signal should be reliably encoded in the orientation-specific component of the cortical population response, within the retinotopic sub-region corresponding to the signal. We first individually delineated these retinotopic sub-regions within each of V1-V3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> for an example subject) and then quantified the orientation-specific response component therein as the spatial correlation of multi-voxel response patterns with an orientation-specific ‘template’ (Materials and methods).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23232.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Phasic arousal does not boost sensory responses in visual cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of fMRI responses during stimulus localizer runs (see Materials and methods); example subject.

Here, we use the term ‘choice-specific’ to refer to fMRI-signals that reliably discriminated between subjects’ choice (‘yes’ vs. ‘no’). Two complementary approaches delineated several cortical regions that exhibited such choice-specific signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The first approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) was based on the lateralization of fMRI responses with respect to the motor effector used to report the choice (i.e., response hand; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donner et al., 2009</xref>) and Materials and methods). In addition to the hand area of primary motor cortex (henceforth referred to as M1), this approach yielded reliable effector-specific lateralization also in two regions of posterior parietal association cortex: the junction of the intraparietal and postcentral sulcus (IPS/PostCeS) and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The second approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) was based on multi-voxel pattern classification of choice, using a ‘searchlight’ procedure that scanned the entire cortex for choice information (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hebart et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2016</xref>) and Materials and methods). The underlying rationale was to identify cortical regions encoding choice in other formats (e.g., in terms of more fine-grained patterns) than the hemispheric lateralization of response amplitudes. The second approach revealed robust (and reproducible) choice-specific response patterns in a number of additional regions in bilateral posterior parietal cortex and (right) prefrontal cortex: superior and inferior parietal lobule (SPL and IPL, respectively), a second region within aIPS (aIPS2), posterior insula (pIns), the junction of precentral sulcus and right inferior frontal gyrus (PreCeS/IFG) and right medial frontal gyrus (MFG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

The effect of TPR differed by cortical signal (2-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors signal type (3 levels) and TPR bin (2 levels); interaction: F<sub>2,26</sub> = 7.30, p=0.003). Specifically, the difference of the choice-specific signals between low and high TPR was significantly larger for the combined lateralization signal and the combined searchlight signal than for M1 (combined lateralization signal vs. M1: p=0.015; combined searchlight signal vs. M1: p=0.004; permutation tests).</p><p>Because subjects’ mean accuracy was about 74% correct, their choices were partially correlated with the physical stimulus (i.e., signal+noise vs. noise trials).

To isolate variations in the amplitude of the choice-specific response that were independent of the stimulus, we removed (via linear regression) components explained by the stimulus and quantified the effect of TPR on the residual choice-specific cortical signals. Fitting the linear model to the combined choice-specific responses yielded highly significant TPR coefficients, for both the combined lateralization and combined searchlight signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, middle and right panel).

Previous work from monkey physiology has implicated three brainstem nuclei in particular in the control of TPR: the locus coeruleus (LC), the inferior colliculus (IC), and the superior colliculus (SC), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we exploited the wide coverage of our fMRI measurements to concurrently monitor responses across a wider brainstem network, including a number of other nuclei implicated in central arousal: the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as the (partly) cholinergic basal forebrain (BF). We further sub-divided the BF region into the part including cell groups within the septum and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (BF-sept) and the sublenticular part (BF-subl).

Most current models of choice treat this intrinsic behavioral variability as a nuisance to be accounted for by additional ‘noise parameters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>).

Here, we present evidence that helps reconcile these ideas. We found that a significant component of choice variability was explained by trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude of task-evoked, pupil-linked arousal responses. Specifically, pupil-linked arousal responses accounted for trial-to-trial variations in the bias of the evidence accumulation process as well as decision-related cortical population signals: under large phasic arousal conservative biases were reduced. The implication is that, without monitoring arousal responses, the associated, systematic variations in accumulation bias would appear as random trial-to-trial variability in the accumulation process (i.e., drift). Going further, we established that the dynamic bias suppression was explained by responses in a network of neuromodulatory brainstem systems controlling cortical arousal state. Taken together, our results are consistent with a scenario in which phasic neuromodulatory activity during decision-making optimizes choice behavior through a suppression of maladaptive biases in the evidence accumulation process.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Challenges and limitations of brainstem fMRI</title><p>Imaging the brainstem with fMRI is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astafiev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beissner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Forstmann et al., 2017</xref>) because this region is prone to physiological noise artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2013</xref>), and brainstem nuclei tend to be small relative to the spatial resolution of standard fMRI measurements. For example, although the adult human LC is an elongated structure of approximately 15 mm length along the rostro-caudal axis, its diameter is only a few millimeters, as assessed by high-resolution MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keren et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2015</xref>). Our study addressed these challenges by following the recommendations of Eckert and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eckert et al., 2010</xref>): We (i) delineated the LC in each brain, based on individual (neuromelanin-sensitive) structural MRI scans; (ii) performed fMRI tailored to the anatomical layout of the LC while maximizing functional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by using an in-plane spatial resolution of 2 × 2 mm and 3 mm thick slices that were oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of the LC; (iii) performed no spatial smoothing of these functional data; and (iv) rigorously removed measured cardiac and respiratory signal components, as well as residual fourth ventricle signal, which have been identified as a major source of uncertainty regarding previous fMRI work on the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astafiev et al., 2010</xref>). The resulting time-course of task-evoked fMRI responses exhibited the standard features of hemodynamic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–E</xref>), and correlations to pupil responses that are largely consistent with single-unit physiology in monkeys (see below). Taken together, the brainstem responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> likely reflect true neural signal from brainstem nuclei, rather than physiological noise. However, there is some inevitable uncertainty regarding the spatial specificity of our measurements. Due to the lower spatial resolution of fMRI images, the co-registration between functional and structural images, and the point spread of the hemodynamic response, each fMRI voxel is likely to sample activity from brain tissue neighboring the nuclei depicted as the regions of interest (e.g., LC). Consequently, we do not conclude that the LC responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref> reflect the activity of noradrenergic neurons only; such a conclusion would require single-unit measurements. The focus of our conclusions instead lies on the distribution of pupil and behavioral correlations across different brainstem structures, which provides an important complement to targeted single-unit measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Brainstem correlates of pupil dilation and decision bias</title><p>Despite the above-mentioned limitations, the overall distribution of pupil-linked brainstem responses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> meaningfully follows the outlines of key candidate structures, in a fashion that is largely consistent with monkey physiology, and a previous human study on fMRI correlates of fluctuations in baseline pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murphy et al., 2014a</xref>). Our approach also identified so-far unknown effects. Previous monkey physiology has established significant coupling of pupil responses to responses of the LC, SC, and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), but not yet for dopaminergic and cholinergic structures (i.e., SN, VTA, and BF). The ability to monitor all of the above brainstem regions at once enabled quantification of their trial-to-trial correlation structure, and hence isolating the contributions that were unique to each region. This revealed that (i) many brainstem nuclei co-fluctuated during the decision task and that (ii) not only the LC and SC, but also the VTA and sublenticular part of the BF each made robust and specific contributions to task-evoked pupil dilations, over and above those shared with other brainstem centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Thus, the noradrenergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic systems are all phasically, and to some extent independently, recruited during challenging decision tasks, and jointly shape the concomitant changes in arousal state. Our findings provide a basis for a more comprehensive neurophysiological interpretation of results from cognitive pupillometry studies in humans.</p><p>Most importantly, we also established that only a subset of those brainstem nuclei exhibiting robust correlations with pupil responses were also predictive of the trial-by-trial suppression in decision bias. The latter effect was solely accounted for by responses in the (noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic) neuromodulatory nuclei with diffuse projections to cortex, but not by responses in the superior or inferior colliculi. This indicates that the phasic release of neuromodulators in the brain, possibly a combination of different neuromodulators, is key for behavioral correlates of phasic arousal identified here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phasic versus tonic arousal effects</title><p>A number of recent studies have characterized the relationship between tonic arousal levels (measured through baseline pupil diameter) and cortical state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Warren et al., 2016</xref>).

The comparison between this previous work and ours points to possible differences between the functional correlates of tonic arousal levels and phasic, task-evoked changes in arousal. We found that phasic, task-evoked arousal responses were primarily linked to decision bias, at both, the algorithmic and cortical levels. By contrast, the above studies of tonic arousal levels have revealed effects on the quality of sensory cortical responses and behavioral sensitivity to sensory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>). While we also found some evidence for non-monotonic (inverted U-shape) relationships between phasic arousal and sensitivity, the dominant and most consistent link was a monotonic and approximately linear relationship between phasic arousal and decision bias. Candidate factors accounting for these apparent differences between the functional correlates of phasic and tonic arousal might be the dynamics of the underlying neuromodulatory effects on cortical circuits, or the different combination of neuromodulatory systems involved. It will be instrumental to track TPR-linked changes in brainstem and cortical state in real time in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Post-decisional versus intra-decisional drive of phasic arousal</title><p>One account holds that the phasic arousal signals (specifically, phasic responses of the noradrenergic LC) are triggered by the bound-crossing in one of the cortical accumulator circuits; the resulting transient and cortex-wide neuromodulator release then facilitates the translation of the choice into a motor act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). An alternative idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>), supported by indirect evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheadle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>), is that arousal systems are already recruited before the bound-crossing, throughout the evidence accumulation process. In line with the latter notion, we found that task-evoked pupil responses are driven most strongly by a sustained central input throughout decision formation, not only after commitment to a choice. This finding has potentially important implications for the functional role of phasic arousal in decision processing. The finding indicates that at least one of the brainstem nuclei linked to pupil responses was, likewise, activated in a sustained fashion throughout decision formation. The resulting neuromodulatory transients might alter the state of brain regions involved in decision computations as the decision unfolds, provided that the accumulation operates on timescales of seconds or longer. Because the tasks used in previous animal physiology studies of task-related LC responses involved much faster decision processes than the one studied here (reaction times of about 0.5 s vs. 2 s, respectively), it remains unknown whether the more sustained, task-evoked responses also occur in noradrenergic neurons (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>]). Sustained responses encoding reward uncertainty have been observed in dopaminergic neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>), one of the structures whose task-evoked responses predicted pupil responses. Future electrophysiological studies should determine the time course of task-related activation in the different nuclei of the brain’s arousal network during sensory-motor decisions involving protracted evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nomoto et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>How do diffuse neuromodulatory signals translate into specific effects on choice behavior?</title><p>One notable aspect of our findings is that the functional correlates of neuromodulatory responses were specific for a particular choice option (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Also in the context of learning, the interplay between pupil-linked arousal and competitive cortical circuitry has been found to translate into specific effects on cognition and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Eldar et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A scenario consistent with our results is that phasic neuromodulator release alters the relative strength of information flow between cortical processing stages, suppressing ‘top-down’ relative to ‘bottom-up’ signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hsieh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kimura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>). In perceptual decisions like the ones studied here, early sensory cortices provide bottom-up sensory likelihood signals, while top-down signals might encode prior beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pouget et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, through a relative suppression of ‘top-down’ signal flow, phasic arousal might reduce the weight of the prior (reflecting subjects’ intrinsic bias) relative to the likelihood. Specifically, in our yes-no task, the prior may have been a conservative bias for choosing ‘no’. Reducing its weight would reduce this bias. Such an increase in the relative weight of bottom-up signals might be implemented by synaptic gain modulation through neuromodulators. This gain modulation, in turn, might depend on the precision (inverse of uncertainty) of incoming sensory data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moran et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The above scenarios postulate a uni-directional effect of neuromodulatory transients on cortical decision computations. However, this interaction may also be bi-directional, with trial-to-trial fluctuations of cortical decision signals driving fluctuations of phasic arousal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>). Specifically, phasic LC responses may be driven by specific cortical regions (e.g., the ACC), which compute the ratio of the posterior probability of target presence over the (estimated) prior probability of target occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>). The resulting phasic norepinephrine release across cortex might reset cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouret and Sara, 2005</xref>) and interrupt the (default) state encoding the prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>). In a yes-no task such as ours, a tendency towards the ‘no’-option may correspond to the default state for conservative subjects, and a phasic arousal signal is generated when decision-related neural activity ramps towards ‘yes’, facilitating the transition of the entire cortical system towards that non-default state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings establish that phasic task-evoked pupil responses during the formation of sensory-motor decisions reflect responses of a network of neuromodulatory brainstem centers including the noradrenergic LC. Phasic, pupil-linked arousal alters choice-encoding population signals in parietal and prefrontal association cortices. Phasic arousal in general, and neuromodulatory brainstem responses in particular, explain a dynamic reduction in decision-makers’ bias towards one particular choice. The resulting trial-to-trial variability of decision bias accounts for a significant component of the intrinsic behavioral variability: when decisions are made in the face of uncertainty, tracking phasic arousal signals may be just as important for predicting choice behavior as tracking the objective evidence gathered from the outside world.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We report analyses of four independent data sets, from behavioral tasks described in the subsequent section.

Indeed, there was a robust relationship between reaction time and TPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, to specifically isolate trial-to-trial variations of underlying response amplitudes, variations due to RT were removed via linear regression from both the TPR and fMRI responses.

Thus, estimated beta weights were comparable between both sets of regressors. Each regressor was then convolved with a canonical pupil impulse response function (parameters taken from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hoeks and Levelt, 1993</xref>]), and multiple regression yielded the best-fitting beta weights for each regressor type (i.e., temporal component of the pupil response), separately for each subject.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis and modeling of choice behavior</title><p>The first trial from each block and trials in which subjects failed to respond within the time limit of 3.5 s (see section <italic>Stimuli, task and procedure</italic>) were excluded from all analyses.

We tested models from the zero-order (constant, no effect of TPR) up to the second-order (quadratic, non-monotonic). If the first-order model was significantly better than the zero-order model at the group level, we fitted a linear model and tested the corresponding linear correlation coefficients across the group.

We computed separate, baseline-corrected TPR values (see section <italic>Quantification of task-evoked pupillary responses</italic>) for each position of the window.

We fitted the model using the hierarchical Bayesian implementation of the HDDM toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>) (version 0.6). The group distribution constrains individual subject parameter estimates, with a stronger influence when its variance is estimated to be small (for details of the procedure, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>]). Fitting the model to RT distributions for ‘yes’- and ‘no’-choices (termed ‘stimulus coding’ in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>]), as opposed to the more common fits of correct and incorrect choice RTs (termed ‘accuracy coding’ in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiecki et al., 2013</xref>]), was essential for estimating parameters that could have induced biases in subjects’ behavior.</p><p>We fit the model to the behavioral data from a total of 35 subjects: 14 subjects from the current fMRI study, and 21 subjects from a previous study employing an analogous contrast detection task ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>]; see section <italic>Subjects</italic>). Doing so improved the estimation of the group-level distribution over parameters, which was used to constrain the individual subject parameter estimates. Specifically, the pooling was required to jointly fit the parameters starting point and drift criterion, both of which can account for changes in decision bias, but via different mechanisms, and are distinguishable through their distinct effects on the shape of the RT distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In our fits, we allowed the following parameters to vary between low and high TPR: (i) the mean drift rate across trials; (ii) the drift criterion (an evidence-independent constant added to the drift toward one or the other bound); (iii) the separation between both decision bounds (i.e., response caution); (iv) the starting point of the accumulation process; (v) the non-decision time (sum of the latencies for sensory encoding and motor execution of the choice). Drift rate variability is an additional parameter that was found to improve fits to empirical RT distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>). However, this parameter is prone to fit error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ratcliff and Childers, 2015</xref>) and we had no a priori hypothesis about its relationship to phasic arousal. We therefore fit drift rate variability to all data (i.e., regardless of TPR), to maximize robustness of our fits.</p><p>To test the robustness of the significance of the TPR-dependent effect on drift criterion, we re-fitted the model, but now fixing drift criterion with TPR, while still allowing all other of the above parameters to vary with TPR. Using deviance information criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spiegelhalter et al., 2002</xref>) for model selection, we compared whether the added complexity of our original model was justified to account for the data.

For the computation of group average TPR-brainstem correlation map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) and of the cortex-wide functional maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), the time series of EPI volumes were first transformed to MNI space (affine transformation with 12 degrees of freedom and sinc interpolation with FSL FLIRT). For the computation of cortex-wide functional maps, we additionally applied spatial smoothing to all EPI volumes in MNI space using isotropic Gaussian filter kernels; the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the kernels was 8 mm for all maps except for those of searchlight precision scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

Scalar fMRI response amplitudes were computed by collapsing response values across the interval 2 s to 12 s from cue. Trial-to-trial variations of each voxel’s task-evoked fMRI response amplitude due to RT were removed (via linear regression), to isolate fMRI response variations that were due to variations in the amplitude of the underlying neural responses (see section <italic>Analysis of task-evoked pupil responses</italic>).

This yielded a subject-specific set of weights per ROI that maximized the correlation to TPR. We then used these weights to compute, for each subject, a linear combination of the single-trial ROI-responses. The resulting signal was z-scored, with the purpose of using it as a predictor variable within the DDM framework (see section <italic>Analysis and modeling of choice behavior</italic>).

Second, the responses of the selected 100 voxels were arranged as vectors, each of which constituted a multi-voxel response pattern for one trial. Third, these single-trial response patterns were separately averaged across counter-clockwise and across clockwise trials, leaving out one trial per iteration. Fourth, a ‘template pattern’ was constructed as the difference between the mean counter-clockwise and clockwise response patterns. Fifth, the pattern of fMRI responses of the remaining trial (including noise trials) was correlated with the template pattern (on CW blocks), or with the inverted template (on CCW blocks). This procedure yielded a correlation coefficient per trial, which quantified the strength of the orientation-specific component of the population response of V1-V3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Quantification of choice-specific responses: univariate approach</title><p>We used two approaches to identify choice-encoding regions of interest (ROIs) and to quantify choice-specific signals therein.

Performing this analysis for all voxels yielded a map of choice-specific activity for each subject. We performed the analysis separately for signal+noise trials and for noise trials and averaged the resulting maps. That way, the effect of choice was isolated, discarding potential differences between signal+noise and noise trials.</p><p>In the main task, ‘yes’- and ‘no’-choices were mapped onto motor responses with different hands. We therefore computed the logistic regression not only for each voxel’s fMRI response, but also for the lateralization – that is, the difference between a voxel’s response and its homotopic counterpart in the contralateral hemisphere. The mapping between the ‘yes’- vs.'no’-choice and response hands was counterbalanced across subjects. Thus, the lateralization reflected the effector-specific activity (left vs. right hand button presses). Because in any given session ‘yes’- and ‘no’-choices were mapped onto button presses with different hands, the lateralization was a proxy of the choice-specific activity, encoded in the format of a plan to act (e.g., see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>]). Before computing the lateralization, each voxel was flipped with its homotopic counterpart in the contralateral hemisphere for half of the subjects, for whom the mapping was: ‘yes’ -&gt; right hand and ‘no’ -&gt; left hand. The lateralization was then expressed with respect to the hand for ‘yes’ for all subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donner et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, lateralization values could be pooled across subjects without cancellation. The result of this analysis was visualized on the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>We computed choice-specific fMRI response lateralization for a number of ROIs that were symmetric between the two hemispheres (see section <italic>Definition of regions of interest;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). First, per scanning session, we selected the 50 voxels from the hemisphere contralateral to the hand used for reporting ‘yes’ with the most positive t-values for the comparison between ‘yes’- vs. ‘no’-choices (same as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>, but now taking the difference of ‘yes’- and ‘no’-trials), and vice versa for the ipsilateral hemisphere. This adds up to a total of 100 voxels. Second, we separately averaged the single-trial responses across each of these two groups of voxels. Third, we computed the single-trial lateralization as the difference between the mean fMRI response of the ‘yes’ and the ‘no’ voxel group. Performing this analysis for each trial enabled computing single-trial correlations of fMRI lateralization values with TPR and behavioral choice, respectively.</p><p>To compute the ‘combined lateralization signal’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), we fitted multiple logistic regression of choice on choice-specific responses in aIPS1 and IPS/PostCeS, and obtained the weighted sum of these responses that maximized the correlation to choice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>Quantification of choice-specific responses: multivariate (searchlight decoding) approach</title><p>We used searchlight multi-voxel pattern classification to identify additional cortical regions which might encode the choice in other formats (e.g., more fine-grained patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hebart et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2012</xref>]) than the coarse hemispheric lateralization of response amplitudes. We used the LIBSVM implementation of a linear support vector machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>), with a standard cost value of c = 1. A sphere of voxels (i.e. ‘searchlight’) was selected around a given voxel with a radius of 10 mm (435 voxels). From these voxels, the task-evoked fMRI responses were extracted, which made up the pattern vectors that were used for multivariate pattern classification of choices. We assigned each vector a label corresponding to the choice of the subject (‘yes’ vs. ‘no’). The pattern vectors of all but one trial were then used to train a support vector machine to predict the category of the left-out pattern. After training, we validated the model by comparing the true label of the left-out pattern with the label predicted by the model. We repeated this train-test approach iteratively for each trial and calculated a mean cross-validated precision score across all trials for this searchlight. This precision score was assigned to the center voxel of the searchlight sphere. This procedure was repeated iteratively, for all voxels in the brain, yielding a map of precision scores for each subject. We performed the choice decoding analysis separately for signal+noise and noise trials and averaged the resulting maps. This combined individual map was spatially smoothed (FWHM: 4 mm) for group-level analyses.</p><p>Choice-specific responses for ROIs defined in the searchlight analysis (see section <italic>Definition of regions of interest</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) were computed as follows. First, per scanning session, we selected from each ROI the 100 voxels with the strongest choice preference. To this end, we selected the 50 most positive and 50 most negative t-values for the comparison between ‘yes’- vs. ‘no’-choices (same as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>, but now taking the difference of ‘yes’- and ‘no’-trials). Second, a ‘template pattern’ was constructed by averaging the task-evoked fMRI response of each selected voxel across all ‘yes’ trials minus the average on all ‘no’ trials. One trial was left out (leave one out cross-validation). Third, the pattern of fMRI responses of the remaining trial was correlated with the template pattern. This procedure yielded a correlation coefficient per trial, which quantified the sign and strength of the choice-specific pattern response. Again, performing this analysis for each trial enabled computing single-trial correlations of choice-specific pattern responses with TPR and behavioral choice, respectively.</p><p>To compute the ‘combined searchlight signal’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), we fitted multiple logistic regression of choice on choice-specific responses in IPL, SPL, aIPS2, pIns, PreCeS/IFG and MFG, and obtained the weighted sum of these responses that maximized the correlation to choice. Although trial-to-trial variations in RT had been removed (via linear regression) from the fMRI response of each individual voxel (see above), there was a small, but statistically significant correlation between the ‘combined searchlight signal’ and trial-by-trial RTs (group average r = 0.027, p=0.004, permutation test). However, this correlation was significantly smaller than the correlation between the ‘combined searchlight signal’ and behavioral choice (group average difference in correlation: Δr = 0.481, p&lt;0.001).

The LC, as some other brainstem structures, has increased neuromelanin concentration and can thus be identified in the TSE scans as two bilateral local maxima of elevated signal intensity within the midbrain tegmentum and pons, at the floor of the fourth ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Keren et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shibata et al., 2007</xref>). We delineated LC voxels in the slice with the clearest signal intensity elevation in the designated region and in the one slice above and one below. The ROI definition was initially performed by the first author and then independently verified by another author. For the analysis of functional LC responses, we transformed the individually delineated high-resolution LC ROI to subject- and session-specific EPI space (trilinear affine transformation, using FSL FLIRT) after first (i) co-registering the high-resolution partial field-of-view TSE scan and whole-brain TSE scan (with 6 degrees of freedom), (ii) co-registering the whole-brain TSE scan and the T2-weighted anatomical scan (12 degrees of freedom), and (iii) concatenating the estimated transformation matrices. We then determined the minimum number of EPI voxels (obtained at lower resolution) for which the probability of the anatomical LC ROI contained in this EPI voxel was larger than 0 within each of the 14 subjects. The average number of voxels with a non-zero probability of containing the anatomical LC ROI was 18 voxels, and the smallest number across the group was 12. We therefore included for each subject the 12 voxels with the largest probability of containing the LC. The LC region time series was computed as the average of the time series from these 12 voxels, weighted by their probability values. For comparison, we used the same procedure, including the same number of voxels, for the other brainstem regions. For the most spatially specific definition of the LC region afforded by our measurements we computed a weighted average across the two voxels with the largest probability of containing the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s48"><title>Superior and inferior colliculi (SC and IC)</title><p>We manually delineated the SC and IC based on the anatomical standard (MNI) brain as the two elevated ‘hills’ at the dorsal part of the midbrain.</p></sec><sec id="s49"><title>Other brainstem nuclei</title><p>We used probabilistic atlases in anatomical standard (MNI) space to delineate the following other brainstem nuclei: ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra (SN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murty et al., 2014</xref>), and two divisions of the basal forebrain (BF): one that includes cell groups within the septum and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (BF-sept), and one that includes the sublenticular part of the basal forebrain (BF-subl). The probabilistic BF atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaborszky et al., 2008</xref>) were obtained from the SPM anatomy toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eickhoff et al., 2005</xref>). As we did for the LC, we transformed these anatomical ROIs to subject- and session-specific EPI space and thresholded the resulting masks such as to include only the 12 voxels with the largest probability of containing the particular structure. Likewise, ROI-level time series were computed as the average of the time series from these 12 voxels, with the weights corresponding to each voxel’s probability value.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Anterior cingulate cortex</title><p>We parcellated the cortex with the Freesurfer/Destrieux atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Destrieux et al., 2010</xref>), and obtained anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) masks by transforming the label G_and_S_cingul-Mid-Ant_d to subject- and session-specific functional space (with Freesurfer mri_label2vol tool).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Visual cortical areas V1-V3</title><p>Stimulus-responsive and surrounding sub-regions of early visual cortical areas V1-V3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were defined in two steps. First, the boundaries between these visual cortical areas were identified by retinotopic mapping via population receptive field imaging (i.e., quantifying, for each voxel, the preferred polar angle and eccentricity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008</xref>). To this end, in a separate scanning session, we presented moving bar apertures consisting of a large number of randomly oriented Gabor patches (100% contrast). The width of the bar subtended 25% of the stimulus radius. Four bar orientations (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°) and two different motion directions for each bar were used, yielding a total of eight different bar configurations within a given scan. Subjects fixated at the center of the screen, and pressed a button with their right index finger when the fixation dot changed color (from red to green) at random time intervals. Second, using a localizer run in each session of the main experiment, we identified the sub-regions of V1-V3 that corresponded retinotopically to the stimulus judged in the main experimental (yes-no) task. To this end, full-contrast gratings were presented at the same position as the stimuli in the main experimental task, in periodic alternation with central fixation of an otherwise blank screen (block duration: 12 s). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows the map of localizer responses in one example subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Choice-specific cortical regions</title><p>Choice-specific ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) were defined as follows: univariate logistic regression on lateralized task-evoked fMRI responses and multivariate searchlight decoding (see section <italic>Analysis of MRI data</italic>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sabine Kastner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Klaas Enno Stephan (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Micah Allen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of manuscript:</p><p>This study examines biases in human perceptual decision-making processes, testing the hypothesis that they may arise from fluctuations in the activity of neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei, such as the locus coeruleus, which may correspond to variations in arousal. Participants performed a simple forced choice perceptual detection task in the MRI scanner while their pupil responses were tracked. The authors report that larger peri-response pupil sizes were associated with reduced bias, and that pupil size variation was reflected by activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex, the basal forebrain, and noradrenergic and dopaminergic brainstem nuclei. They conclude that phasic arousal signals explain a significant portion of choice variability. While the authors have reported the behavioral effects previously (de Gee et al., 2014, PNAS), the current paper goes an important step further in examining potential neurobiological mechanisms.</p><p>Summary of reviews:</p><p>Overall, all reviewers agreed that the paper represents an important step forward in understanding possible neurobiological determinants of choice variability. However, they also thought that the paper was densely written and not easy to read, and they identified a number of issues that would need to be addressed in a revision of the paper.</p><p>The policy of the journal is to provide you with a single set of comments which reflect the consensus view amongst reviewers. These comments can be found below and must be addressed convincingly. We hope that you will find these comments helpful to further improve the paper.</p><p>1) The paper is densely written and not easy to read. Given that the <italic>eLife</italic> does not impose length restrictions, you would have the liberty to explain your rationale, analyses and findings in a less condensed way. We think it would be very helpful for most readers and would enhance the reception of your paper if you could consider this and reformulate the text where you think it is appropriate.</p><p>2) The fMRI analysis of effects of phasic arousal (as indexed by TPR) on sensory responses in visual cortex (subsection “Phasic arousal predicts a reduction of accumulation bias”) appears to be unnecessarily complicated. Would it not be much simpler (and arguably more direct) to test for TPR x stimulus interactions, using a standard GLM?</p><p>3) A similar concern applies to the next section, the fMRI analysis of phasic arousal on decision-making (subsection “Phasic arousal predicts selective changes in frontal and parietal decision signals”). The analysis presented does not refer to computational variables (from the drift diffusion model) but tests for an effect of TPR on decision-making in an indirect way (differences in lateralisation of activity between low and high TPR trials). Against this background, the conclusion that &quot;[…] the selective effect of phasic arousal on behavioural bias is mediated by a selective modulation of cortical <italic>decision signals</italic>&quot; (our emphasis) seems a little overstated; testing for interactions between TPR x drift rate interactions would have been more convincing. Furthermore, it would help if you clarified what exactly you mean by &quot;selective&quot; (this word occurs frequently throughout the paper) and how in this analysis you operationalise &quot;lateralisation&quot;.</p><p>4) The analysis of association between TPR and activity in brainstem nuclei is compelling as it does not restrict itself to the locus coerulus. Having said this, it is not clear how/whether you corrected for multiple comparisons – could you please clarify?</p><p>5) Several aspects of the mediation (structural equation modeling) analysis are not clear. First, it is not clear why the structural model presented is the most obvious choice, and it would be helpful to see a model comparison (e.g., based on BIC) against at least two alternative models: (i) a model that does not allow for the indirect path (i.e. a model lacking the path from TPR to <italic>Ctx</italic>); (ii) a model without stimulus input into Choice. Second, what exactly is the &quot;cortical response&quot; in <italic>Ctx</italic>? Third, where does the &quot;predicted probability that the subject made a yes-choice&quot; (subsection “Mediation analysis of TPR effect on cortical signals and behavior”) come from?</p><p>6) Psychologically it is unclear whether there might be alternative interpretations of what the variations in pupil size reflect. Given that activity fluctuations in multiple neuromodulatory nuclei show a relation to TPR, is a strong conclusion/interpretation in terms of a &quot;phasic arousal signal&quot; warranted? This may be an obvious interpretation for noradrenaline, but is this an appropriate interpretation for dopamine and acetylcholine? For example, could something like motor confidence, (violations in the) expectation of being correct, or simply fluctuations in attention represent alternative interpretations?</p><p>7) It would be helpful if the relation of pupil responses to response times could be illustrated. Relatedly, could you verify that you did not decode differences in response times in the multivariate choice analysis?</p><p>8) Although it used to be standard practice for the authors of psychophysics papers to be subjects too, one wonders whether in this case, the inclusion of authors as subjects may have biased the findings, given that they knew the results of the previous paper. Do the results quantitatively remain the same when excluding the two authors? Relatedly, one subject performed significantly more trials than the other subjects (640 instead of 400-480 trials). Please specify whether this was one of the authors and demonstrate that this subject did not bias the findings.</p><p>9) A sense factor of 3 is relatively high, and one might be concerned that residual aliasing or noise enhancement affected the data. Could you please address this?</p><p>10) Model comparison (subsection “Phasic arousal predicts a reduction of accumulation bias”): do the DIC values reported reflect an overall group result, i.e., was the model treated as a fixed effect in the population? If so, did you verify that this result was not driven by a single or few outliers (a random effects analysis would protect against this)? Do AIC or BIC provide for converging conclusions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23232.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] 1) The paper is densely written and not easy to read. Given that the eLife does not impose length restrictions, you would have the liberty to explain your rationale, analyses and findings in a less condensed way. We think it would be very helpful for most readers and would enhance the reception of your paper if you could consider this and reformulate the text where you think it is appropriate.</italic> </p><p>We are happy with the opportunity to expand the text and present the rationale, analyses and findings in a less condensed way. We agree that this substantially aids the comprehensibility of the paper. We have now revised the entire text accordingly. In so doing, we have focused in particular on the following two points, which we felt did not sufficiently come across in the original submission:</p><p>A) The difference between the drift diffusion model parameters “starting point”, “drift rate”, and “drift criterion” (see Results section “Phasic arousal predicts a reduction of accumulation bias<italic>”</italic>, updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In discussions with several colleagues, we have realized that the drift criterion parameter does not seem to be widely known, even among researchers using the drift diffusion model in their own research. The reason seems to be that the model is most commonly fitted to reaction time (RT) distributions for correct and error trials, after collapsing across choices/responses (so-called “accuracy coding”). Only the relatively few studies in the literature that used the model to unravel mechanisms underlying choice biases have estimated drift criterion. This requires fitting RT distributions split by choice/response, while coding the stimulus category of each trial (so-called “stimulus coding”). We now explain this parameter in more detail and present simulations that show how the model can tease apart biases due to shifts in starting point from biases due to changes in drift criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>B) Rationale for our focus on the stimulus- and choice-specific fMRI responses. We think that these specific signal components are more useful for linking the fMRI data to the algorithmic correlates of phasic arousal than the overall levels of fMRI responses. The reasoning is as follows. The decision variable in both signal detection theory and drift diffusion model is a signed quantity that encodes the relative support in favor of one over the other choice. Thus, neural correlates of these variables should also be signed, and specific for one or the other choice. This is the same rationale that underlies the vast majority of the highly influential single-unit physiology studies of perceptual choice (work by leading labs). We do realize that this rationale has, at least so far, not been widely used in human neuroimaging studies of perceptual choice (although there are some exceptions). Thus, we now elaborate on this point in more detail at several points: Results sections “Phasic arousal does not boost sensory responses in visual cortex<italic>”</italic> and <italic>“</italic>Phasic arousal modulates choice-specific signals in frontal and parietal cortex<italic>”</italic>. See also our reply to issues #2 and #3 below.</p><p><italic>2) The fMRI analysis of effects of phasic arousal (as indexed by TPR) on sensory responses in visual cortex (subsection “Phasic arousal predicts a reduction of accumulation bias”) appears to be unnecessarily complicated. Would it not be much simpler (and arguably more direct) to test for TPR x stimulus interactions, using a standard GLM?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion, and for pointing us to the complexity of the description. To address this issue, we have completely changed the figure and the corresponding text in the Results section “Phasic arousal does not boost sensory responses in visual cortex”: We now show these interactions between stimulus and TPR in the main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (panel B, focusing on stimulus-specific response component in visual cortex) as well as in a new main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (panel D, map of the above interaction in the overall task-evoked fMRI signal across cortex). Neither analysis revealed a significant interaction between stimulus and TPR.</p><p>We assume that part of the complexity that this comment refers to stemmed from our shift in focus from the overall fMRI response in retinotopic visual cortex to the stimulus-specific component of the multivariate fMRI response. We think the latter, but not the former, is crucial for addressing the question whether phasic arousal modulates the <italic>sensory encoding</italic> of the target. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that our stimulus-specific signal taps into that encoding, in the sense that it reliably discriminates between presence and absence of the target signal. The original version of the figure showed, in addition, that the target presence is <italic>not</italic> encoded in the overall fMRI response. To simplify this part of the Results, we have now dropped the overall fMRI responses from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Instead we now show maps of the cortical distribution of the TPR- and stimulus-effects, and their (absent) interaction, in a new main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>The absence of stimulus encoding in the overall fMRI response in visual cortex may seem surprising, although it has antecedents in the literature on near-threshold detection tasks (Ress et al., 2000; Ress and Heeger, 2003) and relates to a bigger issue pertaining to the neurophysiological underpinnings of the BOLD signal (Cardoso et al., 2012; Logothetis, 2008). For the sake of simplicity and focus on the main theoretical questions, we refrained from elaborating on these methodological issues in the present paper (although we do find them important and interesting). Instead, we simply moved on to exploit clearly established insights from single-unit physiology to extract a component of the fMRI signal that actually does reliably encode the target stimulus: the orientation-specific component of the population response, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. As alluded to in our reply to issue #1, we have now clarified our rationale and explicitly defined “stimulus-specific”:</p><p>“Because the majority of visual cortical neurons encoding stimulus contrast are also tuned to stimulus orientation, orientation-tuning could serve as a “filter” to separate the cortical stimulus response from stimulus-unrelated signals. […] Consequently, we henceforth refer to this component as the “stimulus-specific response”.</p><p>We then went on to test if TPR and stimulus presence exhibit interacting effects on this stimulus-specific response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We hope and expect that this re-written sub-section of the Results is easier to follow than the original presentation.</p><p><italic>3) A similar concern applies to the next section, the fMRI analysis of phasic arousal on decision-making (subsection “Phasic arousal predicts selective changes in frontal and parietal decision signals”). The analysis presented does not refer to computational variables (from the drift diffusion model) but tests for an effect of TPR on decision-making in an indirect way (differences in lateralisation of activity between low and high TPR trials).</italic> </p><p>We have also clarified our rationale behind the approach to cortical choice signals. The insight that the increase of “yes”-choices (and the resulting bias reduction) was due to a bias reduction in the evidence accumulation process itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) led to the strong prediction: “[…] the observed effect of TPR on choice bias (criterion, drift criterion) predicted a directed shift (towards “yes”) in neural signals encoding subjects’ choices, in downstream cortical regions”. We went on to test that prediction, establishing that phasic pupil-linked arousal predicts changes in choice-specific frontal and parietal decision signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, we used separate analyses to assess if and how TPR modulates (i) computational variables of the drift diffusion model and (ii) choice-encoding cortical signals.</p><p>We think that identifying and carefully characterizing choice-specific cortical signals was crucial before correlating these signals to TPR. Further, we think that the single-trial correlation with specific (i.e., “yes” vs. “no”) choices was exactly the right approach for doing so. Even if this did not involve explicit correlations to DDM parameters, our analysis approach was constructed to identify signals whose functional properties have a straightforward correspondence to the decision variable postulated by models like the DDM, in the sense that their signed values correspond to a tendency for either of the two choices at stake. Please note that our current approach is conceptually analogous to approaches for identifying decision-related activity in single neurons. Our approach is based on our previous neuroimaging work, which has translated the single-unit approaches to human neuroscience (de Lange et al., 2013; Donner et al., 2009; Hebart et al., 2012; 2016). The main question of this part of our current paper was, if and how choice-specific cortical signals are modulated by TPR. We feel this question is conclusively answered by the analyses presented.</p><p>That said, the comment did motivate us to perform a new, model-based analysis of another part of our fMRI data, namely the brainstem nuclei. Here, we model the influence of the neuromodulatory brainstem signals on the drift at the single-trial level, to directly test the hypothesis that phasic neuromodulatory signals (but not the responses of the superior/inferior colliculi) suppress biases inherent in the single-trial drift of the decision variable. This analysis is presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and we believe that it substantially strengthens and specifies the core conclusion of the paper.</p><p><italic>Against this background, the conclusion that &quot;[…] the selective effect of phasic arousal on behavioural bias is mediated by a selective modulation of cortical decision signals&quot; (our emphasis) seems a little overstated; testing for interactions between TPR x drift rate interactions would have been more convincing.</italic> </p><p>Given the issues discussed in detail under issue #5 below, we agree that the mediation statement was overstated. We have now toned down this statement throughout. For example, at the end of the Introduction we now write:</p><p>“Using fMRI for one of these tasks revealed that the bias reduction was accompanied by a modulation of choice-encoding response patterns in prefrontal and parietal cortex.”</p><p><italic>Furthermore, it would help if you clarified what exactly you mean by &quot;selective&quot; (this word occurs frequently throughout the paper).</italic></p><p>We used “selective” in analogy with the terminology from single-unit physiology, in which neuronal responses are being classified as “selective” for a particular stimulus, cognitive, or movement variable, based on analyses of neuronal tuning curves, mutual information, or ANOVAs. However, we realized that we used the attributes “selective” and “specific” interchangeably throughout our manuscript, which may have been confusing. To eliminate this confusion, we decided to only use “specific”, and to define this upon first use (see also our replies to issues #2 and #3). We have now defined “stimulus-specific” as follows:</p><p>“The orientation-specific response component also reliably discriminated between signal+noise and noise trials on a single-trial basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consequently, we henceforth refer to this component as the “stimulus-specific response”.</p><p>Likewise, we have defined “choice-specific” as follows:</p><p>“Here, we use the term “choice-specific” to refer to fMRI-signals that reliably discriminated between subjects’ choice (“yes” vs. “no”).”</p><p><italic>And how in this analysis you operationalise &quot;lateralisation&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We now describe in more detail how lateralization was operationalized in the Materials and methods section “Quantification of choice-specific responses univariate approach<italic>”</italic>:</p><p>“In the main task, “yes”- and “no”-choices were mapped onto motor responses with different hands. […] The result of this analysis was visualized on the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>4) The analysis of association between TPR and activity in brainstem nuclei is compelling as it does not restrict itself to the locus coerulus. Having said this, it is not clear how/whether you corrected for multiple comparisons – could you please clarify?</italic> </p><p>The map of single-trial correlations between TPR and evoked fMRI responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) was indeed plotted after cluster-based multiple comparison correction (nonparametric permutation test within the FSL Randomise implementation; see also Materials and methods section “Statistical comparisons<italic>”</italic>).</p><p>The matrix of correlations between evoked brainstem fMRI responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>) was, likewise, corrected for multiple comparison, now using false discovery rate (FDR).

Because the analyses in the above panels also quantified the same effect (the coupling between TPR and evoked fMRI responses) the statistics presented in these panels were not further corrected.</p><p><italic>5) Several aspects of the mediation (structural equation modeling) analysis are not clear.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this important issue. Running the analyses to address your point made us realize a shortcoming of the analysis that we had not noticed before. After careful consideration, we have now decided to replace it with a simpler approach, which suffices to address the question we set out to test here. In what follows, we first elaborate on this decision, and then address your specific questions pertaining to the original analysis.</p><p>In the mediation analysis we had quantified the indirect path (<italic>a • b</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>), and tested this against 0. However, the choice-specific cortical signals (<italic>Ctx</italic>) were selected on the basis of strong correlation with choice. This implies that the coefficient <italic>b</italic> was constrained to consistently positive (and large) values in all subjects. Consequently, statistical significance of the term (<italic>a • b</italic>) was largely dependent on the inter-subject variability in <italic>a</italic>. This means that a simpler model assessing the same effect is a test of our former <italic>a</italic>-path. We now present this simpler analysis in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>. It supports the conclusion that phasic arousal accounts for a significant component of the variability of choice-encoding response patterns in prefrontal and parietal cortex, over and above the evidence.</p><p>The analysis (as the analysis that we originally presented) does <italic>not</italic>, however, provide sufficiently strong support for the conclusion that the TPR or brainstem effects on decision bias are <italic>mediated</italic> by this modulation of cortical signals, as described below. Consequently, we have toned down this part of the conclusion. We even removed “cortical” from the title in order to focus the paper on what we think to be the main and novel insights: the computational and brainstem correlates of pupil-linked, phasic arousal. Overall, we think these changes have led to a fairer representation of the data, without diluting our key conclusions.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23232.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Schematic of original mediation analysis.

We found a difference in BIC for the “Combined” response of 3.65 (+/- 0.73 s.e.m.), and virtually the same numbers for the other choice-specific cortical responses.

Having said that, we would like to point out, that basic neurobiology favors our original model: pupil responses <italic>cannot</italic> affect choice directly, so there <italic>must</italic> be mediation via <italic>some</italic> signal in the brain. Nonetheless, the ambiguity inherent in the data with respect to this point favored dropping this aspect of the conclusion.</p><p>The corresponding models and their statistical tests and BIC values are shown below.</p><p><italic>Second, what exactly is the &quot;cortical response&quot; in Ctx?</italic> </p><p>With <italic>Ctx</italic> we indicate any of the choice-specific cortical responses identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These were separately entered in the mediation analysis, or linearly combined, in order to construct the “combined choice-specific signal”.</p><p><italic>Third, where does the &quot;predicted probability that the subject made a yes-choice&quot; (subsection “Mediation analysis of TPR effect on cortical signals and behavior”) come from?</italic> </p><p>For this part of the regression model, we used logistic regression, modeling the probability of a binary response (“yes” vs. “no”) given particular values of the continuous predictors <italic>TPR</italic> and <italic>Ctx</italic>. We clarified this point in the Materials and methods section “Quantification of choice-specific responses: univariate approach”, in which we introduce the logistic regression approach for the first time.</p><p><italic>6) Psychologically it is unclear whether there might be alternative interpretations of what the variations in pupil size reflect. Given that activity fluctuations in multiple neuromodulatory nuclei show a relation to TPR, is a strong conclusion/interpretation in terms of a &quot;phasic arousal signal&quot; warranted? This may be an obvious interpretation for noradrenaline, but is this an appropriate interpretation for dopamine and acetylcholine? For example, could something like motor confidence, (violations in the) expectation of being correct, or simply fluctuations in attention represent alternative interpretations?</italic> </p><p>Our focus on pupil-linked arousal is based on recent work establishing a close link between pupil diameter and “cortical state” (as defined based on a range of different physiological parameters) – these associations are strong and range from single-neuron membrane potentials to LFPs and brain-wide patters of fMRI responses (Eldar et al., 2013; McGinley et al., 2015a; Pisauro et al., 2016; Reimer et al., 2014; Vinck et al., 2015; Yellin et al., 2015). For example, McGinley et al. (2015) report coherence between pupil diameter and hippocampal ripple rate of about 0.8 (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and pupil diameter and neocortical membrane potential fluctuations of about 0.7 (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Vinck et al. (2015) report correlations of pupil diameter with LFP activity in δ (1-4 Hz) and γ (55-65 Hz) frequency bands of close to 1 (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). We have added a statement to the opening paragraph of the Results section that qualifies our use of the term “pupil-linked arousal”:</p><p>“We systematically quantified the interaction between pupil-linked arousal responses and decision computations, at the algorithmic and neural levels of analysis. We here operationalize “phasic arousal” as task-evoked pupil responses (TPR). This operational definition is based on recent animal work, which established remarkably strong correlations between non-luminance mediated variations in pupil diameter and global cortical arousal state (McGinley et al., 2015b).”</p><p>This clarifies that we use the above (physiologically defined) concept of arousal as <italic>starting point</italic> of our analysis, not as an <italic>interpretation</italic> of our findings. Given the well-defined neurophysiological correlates of (non-luminance mediated) changes in pupil diameter, we ask how those neurophysiological effects shape decision computations. In so doing, we remain deliberately agnostic about the psychological interpretation of pupil-linked arousal. While we are open to the idea that pupil dilation might correlate with psychological variables, such as those listed in your comment, we did not measure or operationalize those variables explicitly, and we do not see the evidence that would support a one-to-one mapping between particular neuromodulators and such variables. Therefore, we prefer stick to our operationally-defined and general term “pupil-linked arousal” in this paper.</p><p><italic>7) It would be helpful if the relation of pupil responses to response times could be illustrated.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We added an illustration of the relationship between TPR and response times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and refer to this panel in the Materials and methods section “Quantification of task-evoked pupillary responses (TPR)”.</p><p><italic>Relatedly, could you verify that you did not decode differences in response times in the multivariate choice analysis?</italic> </p><p>Indeed, in the yes-no detection task, response time (RT) was smaller for “yes”- than for “no”-choices in the fMRI data set (median of median RTs: “yes”: 2035 ms, “no”: 2175 ms). Thus, one might wonder if RT might have contributed to our decoding analyses. This scenario seemed unlikely <italic>a priori</italic>, because we removed the effect of trial-to-trial variations in RT from each voxel’s fMRI responses. See the Materials and methods section “Quantification of task-evoked fMRI responses and correlation with TPR”:</p><p>“Trial-to-trial variations of each voxel’s task-evoked fMRI response due to RT were removed (via linear regression), to isolate fMRI response variations that were due to variations in the amplitude of the underlying neural responses (see section Analysis of task-evoked pupil responses).”</p><p>In addition, we have now verified that trial-to-trial variability in RT was only a minor (if any) factor contributing to our choice decoding results on the residual fMRI responses. In our version of multivariate pattern analysis, positive correlation coefficients corresponded (by construction) to stronger tendency towards a “yes”-choice (see Materials and methods section “Quantification of choice-specific responses: multivariate (searchlight decoding) approach”). At the same time, RTs were, on average, shorter for “yes”- than for “no”-choices. Thus, had RT contributed to the decoding of “yes” choices, the correlation between choice-specific responses and RT should have been <italic>negative</italic>. In contrast to this prediction, we observed a small, but statistically significant <italic>positive</italic> correlation between the combined “searchlight signal” and RT (group average r = 0.027, p = 0.004, permutation test). This indicates that, if anything, RT variations counteracted our choice decoding results.</p><p>Most importantly, the above correlation was negligible. Indeed, the correlation was substantially and significantly smaller than the correlation between the combined searchlight signal and behavioral choice (group average difference in correlation: Δr = 0.481, p &lt; 0.001). The same qualitative pattern of results for choice-specific responses was evident for all the individual ROIs obtained through searchlight classification. In sum, the multivariate choice classifier primarily decoded choice rather than RT. This issue is now addressed in Materials and methods:</p><p>“Although trial-to-trial variations in RT had been removed (via linear regression) from the fMRI response of each individual voxel (see above), there was a small, but statistically significant correlation between the “combined searchlight signal” and trial-by-trial RTs (group average r = 0.027, p = 0.004, permutation test). […] Thus, the multivariate choice decoder primarily decoded trial-to-trial variations in choice rather than in RT.”</p><p><italic>8) Although it used to be standard practice for the authors of psychophysics papers to be subjects too, one wonders whether in this case, the inclusion of authors as subjects may have biased the findings, given that they knew the results of the previous paper. Do the results quantitatively remain the same when excluding the two authors? Relatedly, one subject performed significantly more trials than the other subjects (640 instead of 400-480 trials). Please specify whether this was one of the authors and demonstrate that this subject did not bias the findings.</italic> </p><p>We share your general concern about including authors as subjects, and we generally refrain from doing so in most of the ongoing work in our lab. In the case of this particular study, we reasoned that the risk of biasing our results through the inclusion of authors as subjects would, however, be small. This is because we envisage the key process under study – phasic pupil-linked arousal – as rather automatic. Specifically, subjects’ control over their pupil responses during decisions, the trial-to-trial fluctuations of which we exploited in our study, seems negligible.</p><p>To completely rule out possible biases, we have now recomputed all 2<sup>nd</sup> level statistics for the group, excluding three authors and the one subject who performed 640 trials (who was not an author). The results of this control analysis were qualitatively identical, except for two minor differences which are not essential for the central conclusions of this paper: (i) the correlation between TPR and the combined “lateralization signal” (after regressing out stimulus) was only marginally significant (p = 0.064; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>); and (ii) the partial correlation between TPR and the BF-subl just fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.056; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). In both cases, the direction of the effect remained the same as for the complete set of 14 subjects, indicating that there is nothing special about these four subjects. The full set of main figures for N=10 is appended to the bottom of this response to reviewers, and we have added to the Materials and methods section <italic>“</italic>Subjects”:</p><p>&quot;Three subjects were authors, and the remaining 12 subjects were naive to the purpose of the study. The results were unchanged when excluding the three authors (see <italic>Author response</italic>, online) and the one subject who performed three sessions (and more trials; see section <italic>Behavioral tasks</italic>) of the main experiment.”</p><p>We would also like to point out that there was an error in the original submission, which we have now corrected. Three, not two, of ours subjects were authors. The third “author-subject” (OC) joined the author list after we had composed the first draft, by contributing the data from the motion-discrimination control experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>), which we realized was important for generalizing our conclusions. We apologize for the confusion.</p><p><italic>9) A sense factor of 3 is relatively high, and one might be concerned that residual aliasing or noise enhancement affected the data. Could you please address this?</italic> </p><p>We are aware that a sense factor of 3 is relatively high. This choice was governed by the need to image a large part of brain (brainstem and most of the cortex) while keeping spatial and temporal resolution (inverse of TR) comparably high. A relatively high image resolution was important for the brainstem analyses in particular, because its nuclei of interest are small (primarily the locus coeruleus). A relatively high temporal resolution (i.e., short TR) was important for the reliable quantification of single-trial fMRI response time courses, which formed the basis of all our statistical analyses.</p><p>That said, there is no indication that residual aliasing or noise enhancement were a matter of concern. First, we found no residual aliasing artifacts (i.e., folding) in our EPI data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref> shows example images from six of our subjects. These are representative for the images we analyzed in this data set.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23232.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Raw EPI-images of six example subjects.</title><p>The images depict the full field of view covered by our measurements. Aliasing artifacts occur when the dimensions of an object exceed the imaging field-of-view, but are within the area covered by the receiver coil. This “wrap-around artifact” is evident as a folding over of surrounding parts into the area of interest, and it is most severe along the phase-encode dimension. In our measurement, the phase-encode dimension was the anterior-posterior axis. No wrap-around artifacts are evident in any of the examples, nor in the other image data that were part of this data set.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23232.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23232.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23232-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig></p><p>Second, we verified that all our individual fMRI data were of sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to perform meaningful second-level analyses. To verify this, we have systematically assessed not only statistical parameter estimates, but also the actual fMRI response time courses for all brain regions of interest, at both, the group and single-subject level This verified well-behaved fMRI response time courses for all brainstem regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-E</xref>), as well as for all cortical regions under study.

We now write in the Materials and methods section “Analysis and modeling of choice behavior”:</p><p>“To test the robustness of the significance of the TPR-dependent effect on drift criterion, we re-fitted the model, but now fixing drift criterion with TPR, while still allowing all other of the above parameters to vary with TPR. Using deviance information criterion (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002) for model selection, we compared whether the added complexity of our original model was justified to account for the data. This is a common metric for comparing hierarchical models, for which a unique “likelihood” is not defined, and the effective number of degrees of freedom is often unclear (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002).</p></body></sub-article></article>
