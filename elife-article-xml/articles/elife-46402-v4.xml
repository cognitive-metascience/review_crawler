aureus</italic> (MRSA) transmission in the hospital setting has been a frequent subject of investigation using bacterial genomes, but previous approaches have not yet fully utilised the extra deductive power provided when multiple pathogen samples are acquired from each host. Here, we used a large dataset of MRSA sequences from multiply-sampled patients to reconstruct colonisation of individuals in a high-transmission setting in a hospital in Thailand. We reconstructed transmission trees for MRSA. We also investigated transmission between anatomical sites on the same individual, finding that this either occurs repeatedly or involves a wide transmission bottleneck. We examined the between-subject bottleneck, finding considerable variation in the amount of diversity transmitted. Finally, we compared our approach to the simpler method of identifying transmission pairs using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) counts. This suggested that the optimum threshold for identifying a pair is 39 SNPs, if sensitivities and specificities are equally weighted.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular epidemiology</kwd><kwd>MRSA</kwd><kwd>hospital infections</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holden</surname><given-names>Matthew TG</given-names></name><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>Sharon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000589</institution-id><institution>Chief Scientist Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SIRN10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holden</surname><given-names>Matthew TG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106698/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wuthiekanun</surname><given-names>Vanaporn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1000803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>Sharon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBDR-339251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reconstruction of transmission pathways of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> using multiple genomes per host reveals great variation in the size of the transmission bottleneck and limited evidence for body site/phylogeny association.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has proved a valuable tool in the investigation of the transmission of infectious agents. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and in particular methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) has been a frequent subject, often in a hospital environment where it is responsible for a considerable burden of disease. The focus of previous studies has ranged from identifying bacterial spread between continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harris et al., 2010</xref>), to reconstructing the detailed timelines of outbreaks in single hospital wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">KÃ¶ser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). Several prospective studies have also been conducted in single settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">NÃ¼bel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tong et al. (2015)</xref> acquired and sequenced MRSA isolates from the high-transmission setting of two intensive care units (ICUs) in a Thai hospital. All were of sequence type 239 (ST 239). They showed that bacterial genetic diversity in this single location provided evidence of at least five circulating clades in a state of temporal flux, with multiple clades colonising different subjects over the course of the study period. By sequencing a very large number of isolates from a single subject, they also demonstrated the existence of a considerable within-host âcloud of diversityâ. As a result, they cautioned against using a single pathogen genome as a representative of the colonisation of a single subject.</p><p>In the time since the publication of that study, methodological work has emerged to demonstrate how phylogenetic reconstruction using multiple genomes perÂ subject can be used to identify individuals involved in pathogen transmission or colonisation events, and to reconstruct the direction of that transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Romero-Severson et al., 2016</xref>). The software package <italic>phyloscanner</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wymant et al., 2017</xref>) was subsequently developed to perform analyses of this kind. Thus there are now additional reasons to perform multiple sampling beyond the cautionary point made by Tong et al.</p><p>AnÂ obvious extension of multiple sampling is to sample from different body sites of the same host, and from there investigate the dynamics of colonisation at the within-host level. The anterior nares are the primary ecological niche for humanÂ <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kluytmans et al., 1997</xref>), but the sensitivity of detection of MRSA carriage based on nasal screening alone is only 68â75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McKinnell et al., 2013</xref>). Colonisation of multiple anatomical sites excluding the nose, however, appears rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eveillard et al., 2006</xref>) and eradication of nasal <italic>S. aureus</italic> is often followed by disappearance of the bacterium from other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Parras et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reagan et al., 1991</xref>). The process by which <italic>S. aureus</italic> spreads between sites has been little studied.</p><p>Another potential investigation is the size of the transmission bottleneck of an MRSA strain during the colonisation of a given individual, in other words the quantity of genetic diversity that is passed from one subject to another at transmission. This is an important concern when transmission routes are to be reconstructed using pathogen genomes, but inference is challenging in the absence of previous studies of this nature for <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Most previous work has not had access to dense within-host sampling and has used one sequence per host, which severely limits what can be determined about the bottleneck. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Worby et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated that shared genomic variants, identified using deep sequencing data, can be a powerful tool in identifying transmission pairs, but conclude that they are much more useful where the bottleneck is wide, as shared variants are rare if it is narrow. Selection of a suitable method for identifying pairs therefore requires quantification of the bottleneck width.</p><p>As the availability of multiple samples per host in standard microbiological practice is limited, genetic studies of MRSA outbreaks have, at least until recently, usually used only a single pathogenÂ sequence perÂ patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">NÃ¼bel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">KÃ¶ser et al., 2012</xref>). The investigation of transmission between individuals has then usually relied on selecting a threshold for the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separating isolates to identify possible transmission pairs, together with epidemiological investigation. Tong et al, in common with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Young et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Golubchik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Price et al., 2014</xref>), expressed caution that high <italic>S. aureus</italic> diversity in the source individual would reduce the sensitivity of this approach. Nevertheless, it may be the best available method for reasons of cost or circumstance. In those cases, the SNP threshold must be carefully chosen. The value used in past work has been between 23 and 40 SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Long et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azarian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uhlemann et al., 2014</xref>), but at the same time pairwise distances as large as 40 SNPs have been encountered within-host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Golubchik et al., 2013</xref>). As sampling within-host diversity provides an alternative, more sophisticated method to identify transmission pairs, the results of an analysis utilising it can be used to test different threshold values, in order to aid researchers who have access only to single genomes.</p><p>In this paper, we return to the study previously described by Tong et al. We use a considerably expanded version of that dataset, which adds more extensive within-host sampling. Our objectives were to reconstruct transmission between patients in the study usingÂ theÂ new methodological insightsÂ mentionedÂ above, to examine the bottleneck at MRSA transmission, to investigate the movement of the bacterium between body sites of individual hosts (that is, its phyloanatomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Salemi and Rife, 2016</xref>]), and to compare our identification of transmission pairs with those obtained using an SNP-based approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and setting</title><p>Recruitment to the study was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, consenting patients admitted to two ICUs (a paediatric unit and a general adult surgical unit) at Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, during a period of three months in 2008 were recruited. MRSA screening was performed on admission and then twice weekly until discharge. Nasal swabs and fingertip cultures were also taken from ICU health care workers (HCWs) at three time points. Each screen consisted of swabbing the anterior nares, throat (or endotracheal suction tube if intubated), axilla, catheter urine if catheterised, and wounds if present (including pressure sores). Microbiological culture and bacterial identification have also been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). Up to ten colonies on primary culture plates were saved per sample. All colonies from nasal swab cultures were selected for sequencing, together with up to one colony from cultures from each other positive body site. For one subject (an adult ICU patient designated T126), additional colonies were collected, up to a maximum of 29 for some time points, also as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The complete set of subjects screened consisted of 169 adult patients, 98 child patients and 37 HCWs. To the dataset of Tong et al., which comprised up to three sequences from each subject for a total of 76, we added 923 more, for a total of 999. Of these, four were excluded as suspected contaminants, leaving 995, from 55 subjects (compared to 51 in the previous study). Five subjects were HCWs, 21 wereÂ surgical ICU patients, and 29 wereÂ paediatric ICU patients. The number of sequences per subject ranged from 1 to 239 (mean 18). In addition, 20 sequences (one per patient) for isolates originating from an earlier study in the same hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harris et al., 2010</xref>) were included for the purposes of comparison. All isolates belonged to ST 239.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phylogeny reconstruction</title><p>The complete core chromosome sequence alignment was 3,043,210 base pairs in length.

This tool, intended for the analysis of large genetic datasets of within- and between- host pathogen data, reconstructs the relative positions of hosts in the chain of transmission.</p><p>This reconstruction was performed with an awareness of the possibility that subjects may experience multiple independent infection or colonisation events, in which case eachÂ suchÂ event should be treated as a separate entity when investigating transmission. An initial <italic>phyloscanner</italic> investigation suggested that sequences from five subjects (designated T035, T099, T159, T271 and T327) formed two phylogenetic clades where the median patristic distance between clade MRCAs (across the ExaBayes posterior) was greater than 100 substitutions, sufficiently diverse that they were unlikely to be the product of single-strain colonisation events. The sequences from each of these were separated into two groups and each was subsequently treated independently. We will refer to links in the transmission chain as âcolonisationsâ; each isolate belongs to a single colonisation. Numerical codes prefixed with a âTâ are used for study subjects and codes with âCâ for colonisations. In most cases the numbers after this prefix match; forÂ example C009 is the sole colonisation of subject T009. For the five multiply-colonised subjects, a lowercase letter is used to differentiate them, forÂ example C035a and C035b are the two colonisations of subject T035.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Trace colonisations</title><p>Of 60 identified colonisations from the 55 subjects, cultures for 33 came only from a single positive swab. Those for the remaining 27 were obtained either on at least two time points, from at least two body sites, or both. The median number of available sequences per colonisation was 1, but this rises to 14.5 with these singletons excluded. In 25 of the 33 single-swab colonisations, previous and/or subsequent examinations of the same patient did not identify MRSA belonging to the same colonisation, while in eight only one examination was performed. In what follows we refer to these 33 as trace colonisations.</p><p>When compared to those from multiple isolations, sequences from trace colonisations showed greater similarity to those from isolates collected from other study subjects at an earlier time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> displays the distribution of the median number of SNPs separating the isolates in each colonisation from the most closely related isolate sampled on an earlier date. There was strong evidence supporting a difference in the distribution of these distances between trace and non-trace colonisations (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test p=0.018), suggesting that the natureÂ ofÂ trace isolates could be fundamentally different to that of typical isolates from a non-trace colonisation,Â ratherÂ than beingÂ simply the product of colonisations of a similar nature subject to sparser sampling. A similar pattern was observed when the median SNP distance was calculated from only those isolates in a non-trace colonisation that were acquired at the time of the first positive swab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) although in this case statistical support was lacking (p=0.119). For six trace colonisations (C104, C105, C223, C225, C270, and C271b), our subsequent <italic>phyloscanner</italic> analysis inferred an infector from amongst the patients already or previously present in the hospital at the time that the sample in question was taken. For the six patients corresponding to these colonisations, the positive swab was acquired on the day of or day after ICU admission, and within three days of hospital admission. Such a short time from hospital admission to a positive swab with a sample very similar to those already existing in the hospital was not observed for any non-trace isolates.

It works by performing ancestral state reconstruction on a phylogeny using maximum parsimony, using the set of colonisations as states. It identifies phylogenetic relationships between colonisations by examining the arrangement of <italic>subgraphs</italic>: contiguous blocks of phylogenetic nodes which all have the same reconstructed state. Pairs of colonisations that are closely related in the transmission chain are identified by proximity of their subgraphs and the direction of transmission between them inferred from their topological arrangement, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

Links between colonisations are made up of three segments, whose colour represents the frequency of a given topological relationship between two colonisations in the ExaBayes posterior. The outer two, which have directional arrows, represent transmission in the direction of the arrow, while the central segment represents the âcomplexâ ancestral relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wymant et al., 2017</xref>), which suggests a close genetic relationship for which the direction of transmission is unclear.

To avoid excessive clutter in the figure, they are only displayed when this number is 0.5 or greater. Two of the large clusters revolve around the long-staying patients T012 in the paediatric ICU and T126 in the general ICU. 8 of the 12 clusters are singletons, representing colonisations not closely related to any other sample in this study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> gives the equivalent diagram from an analysis where each subjectâs isolates were further subdivided by the body site of origin; links with coloured backgrounds connect colonisations from the same patient.

In every case, one site was the anterior nares. Two subjects (T178 and T322) provided only a single sequence from each of two sites, which rendered them unsuitable for further investigation as only one phylogenetic topology is possible under that circumstance. To investigate phylogeny-site associations in the remaining 21 subjects, we ran ExaBayes on the sequences from each separately and analysed the results using BaTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Parker et al., 2008</xref>), to identify deviations from the null hypothesis of no phylogeny-site association according to the association index (AI), parsimony score (PS) and the size of largest monophyletic clade (MC) for each trait.</p><p>Deviation from the null in the AI statistic indicates the presence of phylogenetic nodes whose descendants are more frequently associated with some sites than would be expected by chance. This is the most sensitive of the three statistics to the existence of an association, but such an association does not imply the existence of the distinct monophyletic clades that would be expected if sites were separately colonised by different lineages, or if a single lineage from one site was transmitted to another. For the PS and the MC statistics, deviation from the null is much more suggestive of site-specific monophyletic clades. However, the PS statistic is invariant if all but one tip in the tree comes from the same site, as is the MC statistic for any site with just a single tip, and hence these statistics are useless in this scenario. If some sites have only one tip and the AI statistic shows significant deviation from the null, then further examination is required to check if, for example, the tip in question is basal.

For 11 of 21 subjects there was no evidence of any association between a tipâs position in the phylogeny and the site the corresponding sequence was acquired from. For another six, the only statistic to show deviation from the null at the p=0.05 level was the AI. The lack of significance for the PS suggested that no site-specific monophyletic clades were present, but this cannot identify divergent singleton tips. Examination of the ExaBayes consensus trees by eye revealed singletons for only one patient, T271. In this case the divergence (431.2 SNPs) of a single isolate from an endotracheal suction tube from the remaining isolates was so large that it had already been taken into account by the separation of the patientâs sequences into colonisations C271a and C271b; the trace colonisation C271b is the single endotracheal sequence.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Results of the investigation of body site/phylogeny associations.</title><p>Each row corresponds to a single BATS analysis on a posterior set of phylogenies consisting just of the sequences from that subject.

As our data admits a more powerful approach based on the topology, we compared our results to those from a hypothetical study where only a single sequence is available from each subject. We used phyloscanner as a gold standard for identification of transmission pairs, and pairs of subjects that were definitively not transmission pairs. For the latter we used posterior support of less than 0.05 for having adjacent subgraphs and a topological relationship implying ancestry. We used two standards for positivelyÂ identifying pairs. The first was in inverse of the previous, thatÂ is support greater than 0.95 for having adjacent subgraphs and a topological relationship implying ancestry. This version, however, has some problems as a gold standard as it does not attempt to eliminate the possibility of unsampled intermediaries in the transmission chain. For a second version where these are much less likely, we used support greater than 0.95 for having adjacent subgraphs and a topological relationship that implied the transmission of multiple lineages. This is the equivalent of the âPPâ topology of Romero-Severson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Romero-Severson et al., 2016</xref>) which was shown to be highly suggestive of direct transmission. (Intuitively, for a missing intermediary to be present in this scenario, multiple lineages would need to be transmitted at least twice, which is a rarer event than repeated transmission of at least one lineage.) This classification, however, means that subjects from whom only trace colonisations were identified have to be excluded, as it is impossible to reconstruct multiple lineage transmission if one subject contributes only a single tip to the phylogeny (or both do). As this is an analysis from which there is little reason to remove trace colonisations, which would not be identifiable in our hypothetical single-sample study, we present both versions.</p><p>For each subject, we used the samples taken at the first positive swab as potential samples from a single-sequence study. For each pair of these acquired from different subjects, we calculated the raw SNP distance and used these figures to evaluate the performance of SNP distance as means to determine transmission pairs and members of clusters, using the above two measures as gold standards. The results can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Subfigure A shows how the sensitivity and specificity vary with the threshold. To prevent bias in these results due to variable sample counts per subject, these figures are weighted by the probability of (uniformly) selecting a given pair of sequences from all those available from the same pair of subjects. (The maximum threshold shown in this figure is 60 SNPs, but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref> for the range up to 500 SNPs.)</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Performance of SNP distance as a method for identifying transmission pairs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Plots of the sensitivity and specificity of using the number of SNPs to identify transmission pairs, for different distance thresholds.Â (<bold>B</bold>) ROC curves plotting true positive rate (sensitivity) against false positive rate (1-specificity) for different thresholds.

We found great variation in the size of the transmission bottleneck between study subjects, and that in the majority of cases there was no suggestion of an association between the phylogenetic placement of an isolate and the body site that it was acquired from. Finally, we determined SNP thresholds for identifying transmission pairs with high sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>33 out of 60 colonisations consisted of a single swab (trace colonisations). If the nature of these was precisely the same as the multiply-isolated colonisations and they were merely sampled less often, one would expect to see no difference in the distribution of genetic distances to isolates already identified in the hospital between the two groups. We did not find this to be the case. One explanation for this would be transient carriage, due to incidental exposure of patients to bacterial lineages already well established in the hospital environment. Indeed, thirteen trace colonisations came from patients who underwent a subsequent screen with negative results (and five underwent several such screens, which never occurred at all for non-trace colonisations). Previous studies have found transient carriage to be quite common in both patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley et al., 1991</xref>) and HCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cookson et al., 1989</xref>). However, it remains impossible to rule out the possibility that any individual example was the result of a contamination event leading to the source individual being wrongly identified, especially given the very short times from hospital admission to a positive swab that are implied for six subjects. This leads us to recommend that in future phylogenetic studies, positive swab results should be verified by undertaking multiple sampling wherever possible.</p><p>The concordance of the order of colonisation given by the phylogenetic topology and the known dates of hospital stays was generally good; with the exception of one case (C271a) which plausibly involved contamination, those transmissions that contradicted the reported timings of stays and MRSA screens did not achieve posterior support above 0.76 and a threshold of 0.95 would comfortably eliminate them.</p><p>The role of variable sample counts per colonisation in an analysis of this sort is complex. The relative number of tips derived from one colonisation is information that the parsimony reconstruction will use in determining the source and recipient in a putative transmission pair; the colonisation with more tips is more likely to be reconstructed as the source in situations of phylogenetic uncertainty. While this may appear at first glance to be a bias, we see here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>) that removing the effect by equalising counts leads to a much poorer reconstruction. This is because sample count is associated with a variable, ICU stay length, which is itself associated with source status. Adjusting for it is hence adjusting for a variable on the causal pathway between source status and identification as a source, which is inappropriate. As methodologies of this sort are likely to become more common in future, this issue is a candidate for further investigation.</p><p>Clear from the between-subject relationship diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is the pivotal role played by the two long-term ICU residents, T012 and T126, as sources of colonisation. The former appears to be the originator of colonisations in at least two other subjects (and perhaps as many as six), and the latter three (up to five). When treating separate body sites as separate hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the direction of transmission was usually away from nasal colonisations. This is consistent with the role of the anterior nares as the ecological niche of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kluytmans et al., 1997</xref>). However, in our study the denser sampling from nasal sites likely also introduced some bias.</p><p>In over half of the subjects who screened positive for MRSA on more than one body site, there was no evidence for any site/phylogeny correlation. Some of the individual patient datasets involved were small and contained very few non-nasal isolates, in which cases the lack of detected structure may be due to lack of diversity. However, the correlation was absent even in subject T012, who was in the ICU throughout almost the entire study period, providing 223 isolates from three sites (and at least seven from each). Even for patient T126, where the phylogeny (seeÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) shows distinct axilla and endotracheal suction tube clades, other tips from those same sites appear distributed amongst nasal sequences. While further investigation of between-site colonisation using a sampling protocol designed specifically for the task would be advisable, these results suggest that the establishment of a colony due to the transmission of a single lineage between sites, or the colonisation of distinct sites with distinct lineages, is quite rare, at least in a setting of this sort. It has been observed that eradication of nasal <italic>S. aureus</italic> frequently results in the disappearance of the bacterium from other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Parras et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reagan et al., 1991</xref>), and also that extranasal colonies are significantly less genetically diverse than nasal colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harkins et al., 2018</xref>). Both observations suggest that the organism is readily and regularly spread from the anterior nares to other parts of the body, but that the resulting extranasal colonisations are frequently transient. Our results are consistent with this scenario.</p><p>While the bottleneck in colonisation of one body site from another is more often than not wide, that involved in subject-to-subject transmission was very variable amongst the five pairs examined. In one case only a single lineage appeared to be transmitted, while in others it was very wide indeed. This is perhaps unsurprising in a bacterial infection spread by contact, as the circumstances under which colonisation occurs, and the quantity of bacteria displaced, may vary greatly. There did not appear, in this small sample, to be any suggestion of an association between bottleneck width and the proximity of patient beds in an ICU. It appears that the size of the bottleneck can be very variable even in a single setting. This suggests that the shared genomic variant methodologies outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Worby et al. (2017)</xref> may be of limited use because they reconstruct sources of infection only infrequently when the bottleneck is tight, and that phylogenetic approaches that analyse multiple isolates per individual, of the type implemented in <italic>phyloscanner</italic>, are to be preferred as they enable reconstruction regardless of the bottleneck size. Short-read deep sequencing, however, is unsuitable for the reconstruction of within-host phylogenies in bacteria as their slow mutation rates do not provide sufficient phylogenetic resolution in segments of the genome of such a short length, while the approach of sequencing multiple colony picks that we employ here may be unsuitable for routine deployment for cost reasons. Ideally, a full bacterial genome could be sequenced without the intermediate step of growing the organism in culture, an approach which could be possible using single-cell genomics.</p><p>The SNP cut-off approach to identifying pairs has already been identified as potentially inadvisable; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">KÃ¶ser et al. (2012)</xref>, in investigating a British neonatal outbreak, identified one outbreak strain of seven as a âhypermutatorâ whose genetic distance from the remainder was an outlier. Nevertheless, not every investigation will have access to the means to do anything else. If sensitivity and specificity are considered equally important, then we recommend 39 SNPs as a threshold, which was suggested by both our gold standard sets. We would caution, however, that positive results are liable to lack predictive power at any SNP threshold in virtually any population survey unless the probability of a false positive test is extremely low. This is because, of the set of all pairs of subjects, the great majority will not be transmission pairs. In the ideal situation of a completely sampled transmission chain of <italic>n</italic> individuals, only <italic>n-1</italic> of the <italic>n</italic>(<italic>n</italic>-1)/2 pairs are transmission pairs, and for a positive test to be even 50% predictive of a positive result requires a false positive rate of at most 2/(<italic>n</italic>-2). In large studies picking a threshold to fulfil this may in turn require unacceptably low sensitivity, and it should be noted that this is the best case scenario, in which every transmission pair is sampled. Ideally, sampling of within-host diversity and interrogation of the phylogenetic topology would be preferred to the use of a crude threshold, if this is feasible in a particular setting and using available resources.</p><p>A clear limitation of these results is their applicability to other settings, particularly to hospitals with greater (or poorer) resources for infection control. Better procedures would be expected to decrease the size of within-hospital transmission clusters, and also decrease the size of the bottleneck between both patients and body sites. In addition, our sampling was highly biased towards nasal isolates. We also lacked access to isolates from the general, extra-hospital, population that might have been used for phylogenetic comparison purposes. Finally, the sequencing protocol used here is expensive and replicating it will not be feasible in many settings.</p><p>This study demonstrates the additional insights into bacterial transmission that may be gleaned when sequencing multiple isolates per host. This is obviously essential when considering questions of bottleneck size and phyloanatomy, but also offers advantages in investigating the direction of between-host transmission. As costs decrease, it may become increasingly feasible to design and conduct studies with sampling frames that accommodate multiple sampling, and also to use it for investigations in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequencing</title><p>DNA was extracted, libraries prepared and 100 bp paired end sequences determined for 2320 isolates on an Illumina HiSeq2000, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reuter et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tagged genomic library preparation and DNA sequencing</title><p>Illumina reads were mapped onto theÂ TW20 (accession number FN433596) reference sequence using SMALT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/</ext-link>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tong et al., 2015</xref>).

The TW20 reference sequence was included as an outgroup. Due to computational memory limits, the alignment was divided into six sequential partitions of around 500,000 bp each, but in ExaBayes all parameters and the phylogenetic topology were linked across the six. Four MCMC runs, each in turn consisting of four coupled chains, were run for 5,000,000 generations with chain swaps every five generations and the heat factor set to 0.016. 50% of states in each run were discarded as burn-in, and the topologies forming output for all four runs were combined into a single tree set. The concatenated parameter trace for all four was examined to verify that the effective sample size (ESS) for the prior, likelihood and all numerical parameters was at least 200. The estimated ESS for the topology for the unified set of trees was calculated using RWTY 1.0.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Warren et al., 2017</xref>) and similarly verified to ensure a value of at least 200.

Identification of subjects who experienced clear multiple colonisation was performed in a pre-processing step using <italic>phyloscanner</italic>âs dual infection detection utility with a <italic>k</italic> value of 30,432.1. For a single tree, this will divide the tips from a single subject into separate colonisations if the patristic distance between the MRCA nodes of each colonisation is equal to or greater than 100 SNPs. For each subject, the most common division when this procedure was applied to all 100 trees was used to define the number of colonisations and the sequences making up each one; this is equivalent to dividing a hostâs tips into two groups in cases where the median patristic distance between these MRCAs across the posterior was at least 100 SNPs.</p><p><italic>Phyloscanner</italic> was then run in full on both the consensus phylogeny and the posterior set of trees. Four tips were identified by manual inspection as probable contaminants, due to suspicious genetic similarity to sequences from isolates from other subjects which were processed at the same time, and blacklisted.

The ancestral state reconstruction used <italic>phyloscanner</italic>'sÂ modified Sankoff algorithm, with the <italic>k</italic> parameter again set to 30,432.1.

Departing slightly from default <italic>phyloscanner</italic> settings, which are designed primarily for HIV, we did not define relationships if the configuration was âno ancestryâ (this occurs where the reads from the two colonisations form sibling clades) and also did not use a patristic distance threshold. Edges were drawn between colonisations if they were related in at least 50% of posterior trees, and these edges used to identify the clusters.</p><p>When defining gold standard transmission pairs and non-transmission pairs for the SNP threshold analysis, both versions used posterior support of less than 0.05 for adjacency and a topological relationship of âancestryâ, âmultiple ancestryâ or âcomplexâ to define the latter.

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Improved characterisation of MRSA transmission using within-host bacterial sequence diversity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Don Klinkenberg (Reviewer #1); Taj Azarian (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this study is a step forward compared to earlier such analyses in that it makes use of multiple sequences from multiple samples per patient, from various body sites, and that it addresses questions that can only be addressed because of this intensive sampling scheme: direction of transmission based on the phylogeny only, width of the bottleneck at transmission, and transmission between body sites within patients. In addition, based on the identified transmission pairs and clusters, the paper investigates the use of a SNP threshold to detect pairs and clusters in settings with fewer sequences available.</p><p>As a whole, it is a valuable contribution to the field of outbreak analyses with pathogen sequence data. The major strengths of the analysis are:</p><p>1) The application of a novel analytical approach to an unmatched dataset (995 isolates from 55 patients), which allowed them to move beyond &quot;proof of concept&quot; pilot analyses or simulations.</p><p>2) In doing so, the paper is able to address (with supporting data/results) three major unknowns about <italic>S. aureus</italic> genomic epidemiology: (i) the range of transmission bottleneck sizes (at least as it relates to the healthcare setting), (ii) the sensitivity and specificity of using a SNP cut-offs to determine transmission events and (iii) the compartmentalization/ migration of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to various body sites during carriage.</p><p>3) The utility of the approach (and accompanying software) to investigating transmission. This level of dense within-host sampling has never been attempted. Considering this and the results, this study is a significant advance from the original analysis by Tong et al., 2015 as well as the PHYLOSCANNER manuscript by Wymant et al., 2017.</p><p>4) The characterisation of aspects of MRSA hospital dynamics that were previously unknown or only suspected based on other types of evidence, and as a showcase of methods that can be used with such data.</p><p>5) The manuscript is clearly written, and we very much appreciate the efforts made to conceptually explain some of the methods, notably Figure 3 and Supplementary file 1.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;median patristic distance&quot; (first, please repeat the use of median in the Materials and methods section). How sensitive is the result to this choice? For instance, can't a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm be used? Also, if additional samples are taken from a patient, the distance of these samples to the sequence(s) at infection will increase; consequently, the median distance to another colonisation should increase with larger clusters. Wouldn't it therefore be better to use the minimum distance?</p><p>2) Subsection âTrace colonisationsâ: Were the 9 single-swab colonisations with only one examination similar to the 24, e.g. in Figure 2? These could have been true colonisations, after all.</p><p>3) Figure 2 displays the median number of SNPs, but as explained above in comment 1, just increasing the number of samples is expected to increase this median. That would definitely cause bias in the comparison in Figure 2 and the Mann-Whitney U test.</p><p>4) Figure 2 is visually a bit misleading because of the 6 samples that are not in the Figure, four of which should be blue. Maybe add them at the right, below a &quot;&gt;100&quot; mark on the X-axis?</p><p>5) The arguments for the âsix trace colonisationsâ is strong, but there are 27 more. Do the data for the other 27 not suggest the same, or is it impossible to say for the other 27?</p><p>6) In the end, it seems reasonable to focus on the non-trace colonisations for the cluster and bottleneck analyses. However, for the SNP threshold analysis it should be realised that more than half of the cases were left out, so that identified transmission pairs could very well have been separated by intermediate cases. That affects the &quot;gold standard&quot; transmission pairs set.</p><p>7) Subsection âReconstructed transmission eventsâ, last paragraph: The nature of multiple arrows between cases should be explained. From the caption it appears that each arrow is associated with a unique subclade, but it is possible to conclude that multiple arrows between hosts indicate multiple lineages being transmitted, and thus a wide bottleneck?</p><p>8) Figure 4 legend: One aspect of the analysis that was not clear was if or how the time of transmission was estimated. In at least one instance, it appears that multiple transmission events occurred between two patients. From the text it states that &quot;the timings represent [â¦] the earliest time of sampling of all the sequences involved in the recipient subgraphs.&quot; Is this an assumption made for simplicity or is this method able to determine more accurately the timing of the event? This would be good to clarify because it has implications for the generalizability of the method to settings where the exposure period (in this case from admission to discharge) is not as well defined.</p><p>9) Subsection âEpidemiologically plausible transmissions have high posterior supportâ: It's difficult to understand why downsampling results in more impossible events. Wouldn't fewer samples per patient results in fewer &quot;ancestry&quot; configurations and more &quot;no ancestry&quot; configurations, so more external sources rather than (incorrect) internal sources? Is it possible to explain this phenomenon in one or two sentences?</p><p>10) Subsection âTransmission clustersâ: A transmission cluster would be a set of cases that is linked by direct transmission, and separated from other clusters by unobserved transmission links. You define transmission clusters with phyloscanner based on &quot;ancestry&quot;, &quot;multiple ancestry&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; configurations of the phylogenetic tree, and exclude the &quot;no ancestry&quot; configuration. From this it appears that you would exclude the relation between A and D in Figure 3 but it's unclear why: Figure 3 shows the singleton D is linked to A and not to B and C, which is a transmission link, even more so because transmission links are already defined with the possibility of intermediary patients. The text states &quot;colonisations not closely related&quot;, which can't be concluded about A and D in Figure 3. Isn't it possible to connect the clusters of Figure 6 based on being siblings in the phylogenetic tree? Or is the variation between the 100 sampled trees too large to make this useful?</p><p>The problem is not so much in this part of the paper, which just describes the results following from the definitions. The problem is more in the SNP threshold part, where these defined clusters are used as gold standards for defining clusters with SNP thresholds. For that, it should be made clear why these are indeed separate clusters, and why they are set apart from one another.</p><p>11) Absence/presence of arrows in Figures 6 and 7: when comparing Figures 6 and 7, absence and presence of arrows is often not the same. For instance, in Figure 6 there are no arrows between C183-C249 and between C194-C249, but in Figure 7 they both point towards C249. In general, Figure 7 seems to have many more directions resolved than Figure 6. Suggestions: first, explain one example to provide intuition for the difference; second, make directions bidirectional (or draw two arrows) if there is evidence for transmission either way (back and forth).</p><p>12) Subsection &quot;Between-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable size&quot;:</p><p>The transmission bottleneck size results are extremely valuable as these results are of great interest to multiple fields. Though, it is hard to judge how generalizable the bottleneck size findings are to other settings. While the authors are cautious in stating this, it would be beneficial to put their findings in the context of previous estimates. Further, they currently present the bottleneck size as the estimated number of transferred lineages, which will depend on the number of sequenced pathogens. Can this also be presented in terms of nucleotide diversity of the transmitted population?</p><p>13) &quot;narrow bottleneck&quot;, but still two lineages at least, so why is that not wide?</p><p>14) Subsection âBetween-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable sizeâ: in discussing T183 and T194, the link with T178 is included, but considering Figures 6 and 7, C249 appears even more interesting, as that forms a triangle with both C183 and C194 (but with arrows in Figure 7)</p><p>15) Subsection âThe majority of subjects showed no evidence of phylogeny/body site correlationâ, last paragraph: subject T232 is mentioned with evidence for separate colonisation events, but in Figure 7 there is an arrow with equal support for the direction as for the link itself. That is not intuitive.</p><p>16) Subsection âThe majority of subjects showed no evidence of phylogeny/body site correlationâ, last paragraph: Figure 7: C178 would be expected to have multiple colonisation events, because the nose and throat samples are at completely different parts of the graph. That one missing here (and from Table 2) is also not intuitive.</p><p>17) Subsection âIdentification of transmission pairs from single genomesâ: The problem addressed is very relevant, but the gold standard definitions are not convincing.</p><p>First, transmission pairs (true positives) are defined by a posterior support of 0.95, but what about the set of no-transmission pairs? Is that the complete matrix of all other possible pairs in the dataset? What about the lower-support pairs, and the siblings (A and D in Figure 3)? If included into the set of no-transmission pairs, this set will contain transmission pairs as well.</p><p>Second, transmission pairs from the phyloscanner analysis can be through an intermediary hosts, especially because more than half of the positives (the trace colonisations) are left out. So, a transmission pair may not be a true transmission pair</p><p>Third, the definition of a cluster, only consisting of proven ancestral relations. As argued above, siblings in the phylogenetic tree may also be related through direct transmission, only without evidence of the direction. In the current analysis, these are treated as separate clusters.</p><p>18) Regarding the single genome sensitivity and specificity â The authors select one pair of genomes at random from all the possible pairs. It seems more practical to select the first isolate identified during sampling as this would be consistent with practice â most facilities conducting either active or passive surveillance usually don't re-swab after a positive surveillance swab is identified.</p><p>19) Discussion, eighth paragraph: As you state, it is currently not feasible to sequence 223 isolates from a single individual. In their analysis, they pool the samples from multiple time points and also down-sample to five isolates. It would be of great interest for the field to know what number of isolates is required to achieve this level of transmission/cluster prediction using this approach. What we imagine is presenting the sensitivity/specificity with progressive down-sampling from the entire sample and/or from different epochs. Are five random isolates from a single collection time point sufficient to replicate the accuracy of their analysis? Are multiple isolates longitudinally collected more important?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46402.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;median patristic distance&quot; (first, please repeat the use of median in the Materials and methods section).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to the Materials and methods to clarify this (subsection âPhyloscannerâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How sensitive is the result to this choice?</p></disp-quote><p>This threshold was selected as a number that split up what seemed obvious instances of multiple colonisation by eye, and is not at all sensitive to variations within a reasonable range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, can't a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm be used?</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely â this tool was used just because it is already included in <italic>phyloscanner</italic> and would give similar results to many other simple approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, if additional samples are taken from a patient, the distance of these samples to the sequence(s) at infection will increase; consequently, the median distance to another colonisation should increase with larger clusters.

The median distance is, as per <italic>phyloscanner</italic> convention, between the MRCAs of each clade, not between tips. It thus should be at most the minimum distance between tips. (The median is across the ExaBayes posterior, not the tip set.) This has been clarified (subsection âIdentification of potential multiple colonisation eventsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection âTrace colonisationsâ: Were the 9 single-swab colonisations with only one examination similar to the 24, e.g. in Figure 2? These could have been true colonisations, after all.</p></disp-quote><p>The number is actually 8 rather than 9, and we apologise for the typo. There is scant evidence of a difference in distributions between those 8 and the rest according to the metric in Figure 2 (<italic>p</italic>=0.164) or indeed between the 13 trace colonisations with a subsequent negative swab and those without (<italic>p</italic>=0.327).

It would represent a single draw from the same distribution that produces the many samples from the latter. Hence we take the isolates from non-trace colonisations with the median genetic distance as representing âtypicalâ examples. We have clarified the text (subsection âTrace colonisationsâ).</p><p>We do, however, acknowledge that there is a potential <italic>temporal</italic> source of bias with this approach. Isolates from trace colonisations cannot be acquired at anything but the first possible opportunity, whereas some from non-trace colonisations may have undergone further days or even weeks of mutation. If instead we take the median distance to the most similar earlier sample from amongst the isolates acquired on the first sample date, we see a similar tendency for shorter distances amongst trace colonisations, but it is not significant at the <italic>p</italic>=0.05 level (<italic>p</italic>=0.119). This can be seen in the new Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2 is visually a bit misleading because of the 6 samples that are not in the Figure, four of which should be blue.

However, while such a pattern implies transient colonisation, not all transient colonisations would be expected to show it; such an event need not happen in the early part of a patientâs ICU stay. The only information we really have that strongly argues against transient colonisation (or indeed contamination) is repeated isolation of the same strain. We choose to emphasise examples where we have this, out of an abundance of caution. We have revised the text somewhat to clarify this point (subsection âTrace colonisationsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the end, it seems reasonable to focus on the non-trace colonisations for the cluster and bottleneck analyses.

Text has been added to clarify this (subsection âReconstructed transmission events.â).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4 legend: One aspect of the analysis that was not clear was if or how the time of transmission was estimated. In at least one instance, it appears that multiple transmission events occurred between two patients. From the text it states that &quot;the timings represent [â¦] the earliest time of sampling of all the sequences involved in the recipient subgraphs.&quot; Is this an assumption made for simplicity or is this method able to determine more accurately the timing of the event? This would be good to clarify because it has implications for the generalizability of the method to settings where the exposure period (in this case from admission to discharge) is not as well defined.</p></disp-quote><p>It was indeed merely for simplicity as we do not have a means to estimate such timings from the genetic information. This has been clarified (Figure 4 legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection âEpidemiologically plausible transmissions have high posterior supportâ: It's difficult to understand why downsampling results in more impossible events. Wouldn't fewer samples per patient results in fewer &quot;ancestry&quot; configurations and more &quot;no ancestry&quot; configurations, so more external sources rather than (incorrect) internal sources? Is it possible to explain this phenomenon in one or two sentences?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for this is that there is a tendency to infer the more frequently-sampled individual as the source in a likely transmission pair. Equalising counts reduces the topological signal in one direction and makes reconstructions of the opposite direction more frequent in the posterior set. This might seem at first glance to be simply a bias but, as we see here, matters are actually more complex. In our case removing this bias by downsampling results in a reconstruction which is plainly less accurate. High sample counts are not irrelevant information as they indicate something (a long ICU stays here) that in of itself makes an individual a more probable source. A high sample count lies at least partially on the causal pathway from a factor making source status more likely to detection as a source, and a variable lying on the causal pathway is not considered confounding. There is, nonetheless, undoubtedly scope for further investigation of this issue. An explanation of this has been added to the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><p>(This is a phenomenon which we have also seen in HIV, where viral load is associated with both high sample counts and more readily transmitting the virus.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection âTransmission clustersâ: A transmission cluster would be a set of cases that is linked by direct transmission, and separated from other clusters by unobserved transmission links. You define transmission clusters with phyloscanner based on &quot;ancestry&quot;, &quot;multiple ancestry&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; configurations of the phylogenetic tree, and exclude the &quot;no ancestry&quot; configuration. From this it appears that you would exclude the relation between A and D in Figure 3 but it's unclear why: Figure 3 shows the singleton D is linked to A and not to B and C, which is a transmission link, even more so because transmission links are already defined with the possibility of intermediary patients. The text states &quot;colonisations not closely related&quot;, which can't be concluded about A and D in Figure 3. Isn't it possible to connect the clusters of Figure 6 based on being siblings in the phylogenetic tree? Or is the variation between the 100 sampled trees too large to make this useful?</p><p>The problem is not so much in this part of the paper, which just describes the results following from the definitions. The problem is more in the SNP threshold part, where these defined clusters are used as gold standards for defining clusters with SNP thresholds. For that, it should be made clear why these are indeed separate clusters, and why they are set apart from one another.</p></disp-quote><p>See below for a full description of the changes to this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Absence/presence of arrows in Figures 6 and 7: when comparing Figures 6 and 7, absence and presence of arrows is often not the same. For instance, in Figure 6 there are no arrows between C183-C249 and between C194-C249, but in Figure 7 they both point towards C249. In general, Figure 7 seems to have many more directions resolved than Figure 6. Suggestions: first, explain one example to provide intuition for the difference; second, make directions bidirectional (or draw two arrows) if there is evidence for transmission either way (back and forth).</p></disp-quote><p>The updated versions of the network figures now have bidirectional arrows, and text has been added to explain the case of C249, which is the most striking example of the improved resolution in Figure 7 (subsection âTransmission clustersâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection &quot;Between-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable size&quot;:</p><p>The transmission bottleneck size results are extremely valuable as these results are of great interest to multiple fields. Though, it is hard to judge how generalizable the bottleneck size findings are to other settings. While the authors are cautious in stating this, it would be beneficial to put their findings in the context of previous estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, there are no previous estimates of transmission bottleneck size between human subjects in the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, they currently present the bottleneck size as the estimated number of transferred lineages, which will depend on the number of sequenced pathogens. Can this also be presented in terms of nucleotide diversity of the transmitted population?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these numbers to Table 1 and discuss them (subsection âBetween-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable sizeâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) &quot;narrow bottleneck&quot;, but still two lineages at least, so why is that not wide?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text here (subsection âBetween-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable sizeâ) in order to talk about ânarrowâ and âwideâ in more relative terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Subsection âBetween-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable sizeâ: in discussing T183 and T194, the link with T178 is included, but considering Figures 6 and 7, C249 appears even more interesting, as that forms a triangle with both C183 and C194 (but with arrows in Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>This was overlooked because of the lack of significant overlap with the other patients in the same bed. However, T183 did briefly occupy a bed that had previously been occupied by T249, which we now mention (subsection âBetween-subject transmission bottlenecks are of very variable sizeâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Subsection âThe majority of subjects showed no evidence of phylogeny/body site correlationâ, last paragraph: subject T232 is mentioned with evidence for separate colonisation events, but in Figure 7 there is an arrow with equal support for the direction as for the link itself. That is not intuitive.</p></disp-quote><p>This part of the manuscript was too cursory and relied entirely on examining the consensus trees. We have changed it to a description of the patterns over the full posterior (subsection âThe majority of subjects showed no evidence of phylogeny/body site correlationâ). T232 has a quite poorly resolved topology which can support multiple scenarios, and in the main analysis the direction depicted in the original version of Figure 7 was the most well supported by the rules used to construct the diagram.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Subsection âThe majority of subjects showed no evidence of phylogeny/body site correlationâ, last paragraph: Figure 7: C178 would be expected to have multiple colonisation events, because the nose and throat samples are at completely different parts of the graph. That one missing here (and from Table 2) is also not intuitive.</p></disp-quote><p>We neglected to mention that T178, while sampled from two body sites, provided only a single sequence from each, which makes investigation using BATS impossible. The same is, in fact, true of T322. We have added text to this effect (subsection âThe majority of subjects showed no evidence of phylogeny/body site correlationâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Subsection âIdentification of transmission pairs from single genomesâ: The problem addressed is very relevant, but the gold standard definitions are not convincing.</p><p>First, transmission pairs (true positives) are defined by a posterior support of 0.95, but what about the set of no-transmission pairs? Is that the complete matrix of all other possible pairs in the dataset? What about the lower-support pairs, and the siblings (A and D in Figure 3)? If included into the set of no-transmission pairs, this set will contain transmission pairs as well.</p><p>Second, transmission pairs from the phyloscanner analysis can be through an intermediary hosts, especially because more than half of the positives (the trace colonisations) are left out. So, a transmission pair may not be a true transmission pair</p><p>Third, the definition of a cluster, only consisting of proven ancestral relations. As argued above, siblings in the phylogenetic tree may also be related through direct transmission, only without evidence of the direction. In the current analysis, these are treated as separate clusters.</p><p>18) Regarding the single genome sensitivity and specificity â The authors select one pair of genomes at random from all the possible pairs. It seems more practical to select the first isolate identified during sampling as this would be consistent with practice â most facilities conducting either active or passive surveillance usually don't re-swab after a positive surveillance swab is identified.</p></disp-quote><p>For the SNP analysis:</p><p>1) We have concluded that the definition of a transmission cluster that was used probably cannot be made entirely coherent, and have entirely removed that part of the paper.</p><p>2) Sequences for SNP analysis are now taken from just the first positive swab for each subject, rather than the pool of all sequences.</p><p>3) We now use a cut-off of 0.05 posterior support for any ancestry to define non-transmission pairs in the gold standard. Any pairs lying between 0.05 and 0.95 are not used.</p><p>4) As a result of modification 3, the PPV and NPV statistics become meaningless as these are setting-dependent and the study âpopulationâ is no longer even the complete set of pairs in our sample. We have removed these from the results. Nevertheless, the point that in most circumstances most pairs of subjects cannot be transmission pairs, and thus the PPV will be low for even medium-sized study populations unless the false positive rate is also low, is still valid, and we now make it in the Discussion by means of a mathematical sketch (Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p><p>5) When using <italic>phyloscanner</italic> as a gold standard for SNP distance thresholds, we could not use patristic distance thresholds as the reasoning becomes circular. In particular, the relationship between A and D in Figure 3 cannot be established as that of a transmission pair without reference to branch lengths, and branch lengths are themselves obviously very closely related to SNP distance. We used only the topological signal of transmission instead, and sibling clades are not a definitive signal of transmission.</p><p>6) The point about missing intermediaries is valid. To address this, we created a second gold standard set for which membership required posterior support of 0.95 for the âmultiple ancestryâ or âcomplexâ topological relationships, which are equivalent to the âPPâ configuration in Romero-Severson et al. That paper showed that PP tends to imply direct transmission. While the simulations in that paper were designed to be similar to HIV, the reason, that it is much more unlikely that two distinct lineages will be transmitted twice in succession, remains valid here (subsection âIdentification of transmission pairs from single genomesâ).</p><p>7) We agree that there is no particular reason to exclude trace colonisations from this analysis, but anything involving a trace colonisation cannot be used in the new gold standard of point 6 because it is impossible to identify multiple lineage transmission to a subject with a single tip in the phylogeny. As a result, we present both â the original version with trace colonisations included, and the new one with them excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Discussion, eighth paragraph: As you state, it is currently not feasible to sequence 223 isolates from a single individual. In their analysis, they pool the samples from multiple time points and also down-sample to five isolates. It would be of great interest for the field to know what number of isolates is required to achieve this level of transmission/cluster prediction using this approach. What we imagine is presenting the sensitivity/specificity with progressive down-sampling from the entire sample and/or from different epochs. Are five random isolates from a single collection time point sufficient to replicate the accuracy of their analysis? Are multiple isolates longitudinally collected more important?</p></disp-quote><p>While this would be a very interesting addition, we feel that the paper is quite long as it is and would prefer to leave it for future work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
