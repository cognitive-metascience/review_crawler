especially CpG methylation at promoter regions, has been generally considered as a potent epigenetic modification that prohibits transcription factor (TF) recruitment, resulting in transcription suppression. Here, we used a protein microarray-based approach to systematically survey the entire human TF family and found numerous purified TFs with methylated CpG (mCpG)-dependent DNA-binding activities. Interestingly, some TFs exhibit specific binding activity to methylated and unmethylated DNA motifs of distinct sequences. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focused on Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and decoupled its mCpG- and CpG-binding activities via site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, KLF4 binds specific methylated or unmethylated motifs in human embryonic stem cells in vivo. Our study suggests that mCpG-dependent TF binding activity is a widespread phenomenon and provides a new framework to understand the role and mechanism of TFs in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00726.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00726.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00726.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA methylation—the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine or adenine base within DNA—has a key role in regulating the expression of genes as proteins. It contributes to processes such as X-inactivation, in which one copy of the X chromosome is silenced in females, and genomic imprinting, in which the expression of a gene depends upon which parent it was inherited from. DNA methylation has also been implicated in the development of cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which it produces these effects are not fully understood.</p><p>In mammals, the methylation of CpG sites—which consist of a cytosine base next to a guanine base—is typically thought to reduce gene expression by preventing proteins called transcription factors from binding to regions of DNA called promoters. This can occur directly if methylation disrupts interactions between the DNA and the transcription factors, or indirectly if other proteins that bind to the methylated DNA compete with the transcription factors for binding sites. However, only a small number of proteins that bind to methylated DNA have so far been identified.</p><p>Now, Hu et al. have screened the entire family of roughly 1300 human transcription factors and 210 co-factors (proteins that interact with transcription factors) for their ability to bind to some 150 different stretches of methylated DNA. They found that 47 of the proteins could bind to methylated CpG sites, with the majority showing a preference for specific DNA sequences. Moreover, some transcription factors and co-factors bind to methylated and non-methylated DNA targets with distinct sequences. These two types of binding are largely independent, as illustrated by the fact that mutations that prevent a transcription factor called KLF4 from binding to methylated DNA do not prevent it binding to unmethylated DNA, and vice versa.</p><p>The work of Hu et al. suggests that methylated cytosine can effectively act as a ‘fifth base’—in addition to adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine—and emphasizes the importance of DNA methylation for regulating gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00726.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00726.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>protein-DNA interaction</kwd><kwd>protein microarray</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM076102, U54 RR020839, U24 CA160036, U54 HG006434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 EY021897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>Jiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS047344, MH087874, ES021957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Hongjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Hongjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS048271, HD069184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Guo-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dr Miriam and Sheldon G Adelson Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Guo-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009-MSCRFE-0063-00, 2012-MSCRFII-0063-00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ming</surname><given-names>Guo-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive study of human transcription factors reveals that a greater number of these proteins bind to methylated DNA sequences than previously thought.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation is an ancient and major epigenetic modification that plays an important role in key biological processes, including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of transposable elements, and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaenisch and Bird, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Robertson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reik, 2007</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, methylation of CpG sites, especially at promoter regions, is generally considered as the hallmark of gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baylin, 2005</xref>). The molecular consequence of CpG methylation is generally believed to disrupt TF–DNA interactions either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nan et al., 1998</xref>), or indirectly by recruiting sequence-independent methylated DNA-binding proteins that occupy the methylated promoters and compete for the TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyes and Bird, 1991</xref>). So far, only MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and a few zinc finger proteins have been identified as bona fide methylated DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lewis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meehan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filion et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartels et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quenneville et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>). It is unclear whether the methylated DNA binding activity is widespread among different TF subfamilies. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulatory activity of these methylation-dependent TF–DNA interactions has not been explored. Finally, the structural basis of these methylation-dependent TF–DNA interactions remains elusive.</p><p>Here we employed a protein microarray-based approach to characterize the entire human TF repertoire for their direct binding capacity to a large set of methylated DNA motifs. In this work, we simultaneously tested the methylated DNA-binding activity for the majority of human TFs. Since we examined each methylated DNA motif individually on the protein microarray, we were able to determine the specific sequences surrounding the methylated CpG that is recognized by TFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the methylated- and unmethylated-DNA binding activities of KLF4 could be decoupled by protein mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We selected a total of 154 DNA motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) with the following characteristics: (1) predicted to be potential TF-binding sites in promoter regions of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elemento et al., 2007</xref>); (2) representative of a subset of the 460 DNA motifs that have been examined for protein-binding activity in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2010</xref>); and (3) carrying at least one CpG site. Because our goal was to identify DNA methylation-dependent binding activity, we developed a competition assay on a protein microarray to identify TFs that prefer DNA motifs carrying mCpGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each synthesized double-stranded DNA motif was end-labeled with Cy5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) and converted to the double-stranded mCpG form using a bacterial CpG DNA methylase <italic>Sss</italic>I. Each methylated motif was incubated with the protein microarray in the presence of its unlabeled (cold), unmethylated counterpart in 10-fold excess. The competition assay was first tested on a pilot array, comprised of MBD1, MBD2, MeCP2, and several negative control proteins. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, strong binding signals were observed in a protein concentration-dependent manner, while control proteins, such as GST and BSA, did not show any detectable signals, confirming the reliability of the competition assay.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00726.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein microarray-based approach identified mCpG-dependent DNA-binding activity among human TFs and cofactors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A competition assay was used to identify proteins that preferentially bind to methylated DNA motifs.

These full-length human proteins were overexpressed and individually purified in yeast as N-terminal GST fusion proteins as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). The quantity and purity of the purified proteins were examined with Coomassie and silver stains against a random set of purified proteins (data not shown). Each of the labeled 154 methylated motifs was separately incubated on the human TF protein microarray in the presence of the unlabeled counterparts in 10-fold excess. Each reaction was performed in duplicate to ensure reproducibility. After a washing step, binding signals were acquired and processed using the GenePix software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After the binding signals were further normalized by correcting local background signals with a 9 × 9 sub-grid, Z-scores of each protein on the array were determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). A Z-score of 3 was used as the cutoff to identify the positives. Correlation analysis of the binding signals showed high reproducibility between each duplicated assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of the 154 methylated motifs examined, 150 (97%) showed significant binding signals to at least one protein on the microarrays (median = 8), suggesting binding to methylated DNA is prevalent, at least in this in vitro competition assay (see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, 41 TFs and 6 TF co-factors (3% of all factors examined) showed mCpG-dependent binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Among these, 15% showed a broad binding activity to over 50% of all methylated motifs tested, suggesting that these proteins are not sensitive to the sequence context surrounding the mCpG site. For example, two zinc finger TFs, ZNF114 and ZNF416, could recognize almost all of the motifs tested in the competition assay. However, the majority of the 47 mCpG-binding proteins showed mCpG- and sequence-dependent binding activity, with 22 TFs exhibiting binding signaling to fewer than three motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, the mCpG binding activity is widespread among various TF subfamilies, such as the zf-C2H2, Homeobox, bHLH, Forkhead, bZIP, and HMG box subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); no TF subfamily was found significantly enriched in the hit list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). On the other hand, consistent with the important role of DNA methylation in the development of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reik, 2007</xref>), there was a significant enrichment for known oncogenes and tumor suppressors (10/47; p&lt;0.01; hypergeometric model) and factors involved in tissue development (25/47; p&lt;0.015; hypergeometric model; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that methylation-dependent direct TF–DNA interaction is a widespread phenomenon among various TF subfamilies in humans.</p><p>To validate the protein microarray results, we selected 11 TFs with different mCpG-dependent DNA-binding behaviors (i.e., sequence-dependent or -independent). Among them, six (e.g., ARNT2) bound to fewer than three methylated motifs, while the others (e.g., HOXA5) bound to at least 66 motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we confirmed that 8 of the 11 tested TFs could readily form a protein–DNA complex with their corresponding methylated motifs, but not with the unmethylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). This result indicates either a 27% of false positive rate of the protein microarray assay or a higher sensitivity of protein microarray than EMSA. While the binding activities to the mCpG-carrying motifs could be readily competed off with the unlabeled mCpG-containing analogs in 10-fold excess, the unmethylated counterparts showed no obvious impact, indicating that the complex formation between these TFs and specific DNA motifs is not non-specific but requires CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether mCpG-dependent TF–DNA interactions could convey transcriptional activity in vivo, we selected HOXA5 and DIDO1 to perform cell-based luciferase assays. Motifs M305 and M24 recognized by HOXA5 and DIDO1, respectively, were separately cloned into the promoter region of a CpG-free luciferase construct (pCpGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klug and Rehli, 2006</xref>), which was then methylated with <italic>Sss</italic>I and transfected with the <italic>HOXA5</italic> and <italic>DIDO1</italic> expression constructs at different concentrations into a mammalian cell line. The complete methylation of the motifs before transfection was confirmed using Sanger-bisulfite sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). Unmethylated luciferase construct was used as a negative control. Comparing with the luciferase activity of the negative controls, we found that both HOXA5 and DIDO1 demonstrated dose- and methylation-dependent enhancement of the luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that the two TFs could specifically bind to the methylated promoters and enhance the downstream gene transcription.</p><p>We then asked whether these mCpG-binding TFs also bound to the same consensus motifs in an unmethylated form. Since our previous genome-wide analysis of human TF–DNA interactions included these 150 unmodified CpG-containing motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>), we integrated both protein microarray datasets. We discovered that 17 TFs recognize both methylated and unmethylated motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Of the 435 protein–DNA interactions (PDIs) examined, only a small fraction (4%) exhibited motif-binding activity irrespective of the CpG methylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; yellow bars). Even in these cases, TF binding to methylated forms is much stronger than to the unmethylated forms based on the inability of non-methylated analogs to compete effectively even when present in 10-fold excess. Interestingly, 321 (74%) and 97 (22%) PDIs exhibit specificity to methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; red bars) and unmethylated motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; blue bars), respectively. To evaluate sequence specificity for the newly discovered methylation-dependent PDIs, we determined the consensus methylated motif sequences for the 17 TFs. The comparison with their known consensus sequences indicated that, in most cases, the sequences of methylated and unmethylated motifs recognized by the same TFs are distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; right panel; ‘Materials and methods’). For example, nuclear factor I/C (NFIC) binds to a methylated motif M209, GTmCpGCC, while its known consensus sequence is TTGGC, suggesting that many TFs are of dual-specificity, recognizing methylated and unmethylated DNA motifs of distinct sequences.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00726.012</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A group of 17 TFs can bind to both methylated and unmethylated motifs of distinct sequences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our previous PDI dataset was compiled with the dataset in this study to generate binding preference of the 17 TFs.

For instance, KLF4 could form a protein–DNA complex with the methylated motif M197 (TCCmCpGCCC), but not with its unmethylated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, methylation on motif M412 (GCTTTTACG) disrupted its interaction with KLF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The same phenomenon was confirmed for three additional TFs, namely TFAP2A, ARID3B, and ZMYM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>These results raised an interesting question: does binding by a dual-specificity TF to one motif affect binding to the other of different methylation status? By performing a competition EMSA assay we observed two scenarios for different TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). In the first scenario, binding to one motif interferes the binding activity to the other motif. For example, the formation of protein–DNA complex between ARID3B and a methylated motif M319 (AAAmCpGCTTCC) could be readily competed off with the unmethylated motif M47 (GTGGGCGAAA) in 10-fold excess, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that ARID3B either uses the same DNA-binding domain to interact with both motifs, or binding to one motif inhibits binding to the other, presumably via conformational changes or steric hindrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The specificity of these assays was further confirmed with a competition EMSA assay with ARID3B and ZMYM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the second scenario, binding activities of a dual-specificity TF are independent of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For instance, KLF4–DNA complex formation with the methylated motif M197 was not affected by adding unmethylated motif M412 in 10-fold excess in the competition assay, suggesting that it may use two different domains to distinguish methylated from unmethylated motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; left panel). As expected, addition of 10-fold excess of methylated M197 could readily compete off the complex formation of KLF4 with labeled M197 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; left panel). The same results were observed for TFAP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; right panel). The binding specificities of KLF4 and TFAP2A were further confirmed by adding both methylated and non-methylated competitor DNA, resulting in disruption of the complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To facilitate direct comparison, we reproduced all combinations of the competition EMSA assays for KLF4 in parallel on the same gel. The results confirmed its dual-specificity in a non-competitive fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The fact that KLF4 could form protein–DNA complexes with both motifs equally well, regardless of the presence of the competitors, also suggested that it is highly unlikely that these two motif sequences could bind to the same domain at different affinities.</p><p>We next employed an oblique incidence reflectivity difference (OIRD) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Landry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fei et al., 2011</xref>) to determine binding affinity (i.e., <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values) of ZMYM3, TFAP2A, and KLF4 with their corresponding methylated DNA motifs M203, 213, and M197, respectively. As a comparison, the well known methylated DNA-binding protein, MBD2b, was also included. Because the OIRD system can monitor binding events in a real-time, label-free fashion, we therefore obtained the <italic>K</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>off</sub> values, and determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of ZMYM3, TFAP2A, and KLF4 as 460 nM, 399 nM, and 479 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). As expected, none of them showed any significant binding activity to the unmethylated DNA motifs in the OIRD measurements, confirming our previous observations. On the other hand, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of MBD2b measured against the same motifs are in close range to the three TFs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), suggesting that these TFs could bind to methylated DNA motifs almost as well as MBD2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>To further dissect the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon, we focused on KLF4 to identify the key residue(s) responsible for interacting with the methylated cytosine, in order to decouple its dual-specificity. Intriguingly, KLF4 encodes a classic zf-C2H2 domain, a truncated and a full zf-H2C2 domain at its very C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the X-ray structure of KLF4 bound to methylated CpG sequences is not available, we used a modeling approach. These efforts were facilitated by crystal structures of other, unrelated 5mC-binding proteins (e.g., MeCP2 and ZFP57) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the adduct composed of mouse KLF4 and unmethylated DNA, which was employed as a modeling template. Using the existing KLF4 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuetz et al., 2011</xref>), we identified Arg458 and Asp460 in the last H2C2 zinc finger as a candidate 5mCpG recognition motif. In the KLF4 model, DNA binding is stabilized by a 5mC-Arg-G via improved van der Waals interaction and an Arg458-Asp460 salt-bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Binding is further stabilized by a CH•••O (H<sub>2</sub>O-5mC) H-bond contact of the methylated cytosine on the complementary strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the local atomic environment of the KLF4 model is rather similar to those of MeCP2 and ZFP57 in their mCpG-bound forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, Arg458 and Asp460 were predicted to be crucial for KLF4 and mCpG-dependent interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00726.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>KLF4’s mCpG-dependent binding activity is decoupled from its binding activity to unmethylated motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulation of KLF4–DNA interactions predicted that two residues, Arg458 and Asp460, are involved in the interactions with methylated cytosine.

EMSA assay with purified KLF4 mutant proteins showed that all point mutations at either or both residues completely abolished KLF4’s binding activity to methylated motif M197 (CCmCpGCC), while none of them had any detectable impact on the binding activity to the unmethylated motif M412 (TACpGCC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The R458A and R458K mutations showed similar impact on mCpG-dependent binding activity, suggesting that charge on the residue is not critical. Similarly, KLF4 truncation showed no binding activity to methylated motif M197 (CCmCpGCC), but still maintained its binding activity to the unmethylated motif M412 (TACpGCC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the C2H2 zinc finger in KLF4 mediates KLF4’s interaction with unmethylated motif M412.</p><p>To examine whether KLF4’s binding activity to M197 (CCmCpGCC) is important for transcription regulation, we employed cell-based luciferase assays using both wild-type (WT) and mutated KLF4 expression constructs. Indeed, when co-transfected with the pCpGL construct carrying methylated motif M197 in the promoter, WT KLF4 showed dose-dependent increase of the luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This enhancement of transcription is also methylation-dependent, because WT KLF4 could not increase luciferase activity when motif M197 was not methylated in the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). More importantly, both <italic>KLF4</italic><sup><italic>R458A</italic></sup> and <italic>KLF4</italic><sup><italic>D460A</italic></sup> constructs completely lost their ability to modulate transcription from the pCpGL construct carrying methylated motif M197; whereas they both showed dose-dependent enhancement of gene transcription in the luciferase assay, like WT KLF4, when co-transfected with the pCpGL construct carrying unmethylated motif M412 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistent with the EMSA results, neither WT nor mutant KLF4 constructs showed any significant increase of transcription when motif M412 was methylated in the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Western blot analysis demonstrated an equal transfection efficiency of WT <italic>KLF4</italic>, <italic>KLF4</italic><sup><italic>R458A</italic></sup> and <italic>KLF4</italic><sup><italic>D460A</italic></sup> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that KLF4 could bind to methylated and unmethylated CpG sites in different sequence contexts, resulting in activation of downstream gene expression in heterologous cells in vivo, and that these dual specificities are independent and achieved via two functionally separable domains encoded by KLF4.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether KLF4 binding preferences to both methylated and unmethylated motifs that we identified in vitro reflect sequences preferred in vivo. Since KLF4 is well known to play an important role in embryonic stem cell (ESC) maintenance, we therefore examined whether mCpG-dependent KLF4–DNA interactions occur in human ESCs (H1). First, we performed bioinformatics analysis of in vivo KLF4-binding sites in H1 cells based on their methylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We superimposed the published in vivo KLF4 binding sites, as determined by the ChIP-seq approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lister et al., 2009</xref>), with the published methylome dataset of single-base resolution obtained with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in H1 hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lister et al., 2009</xref>). We identified numerous cases in which KLF4 tends to bind to those genomic regions containing a methylated CCCpGCC sequence, consistent with our protein microarray results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; lower panel). Among the KLF4-binding sites containing at least one CpG, we found that the majority of these sites could be categorized into two groups across the whole-genome: 48% have high methylation levels of over 80% and 38% have methylation levels lower than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We identified statistically significant consensus motifs in methylated group (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). The top consensus motif, CmCpGC, discovered in the high methylation group is embedded in motif M197 (CCmCpGCC) that was recognized by KLF4 in the protein microarray assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Taken together, these integration analyses demonstrate that KLF4’s preference to methylated consensus sequence identified in vivo is highly similar to that determined in vitro.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00726.022</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Endogenous KLF4 binds to methylated loci in human embryonic stem cells (H1) in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bioinformatics analysis to derive methylated DNA motif logo binding to KLF4 by integrating of KLF4 ChIP-Seq and methylome data in H1 cells.

First, chromatin IP (ChIP) demonstrates specific and direct binding of KLF4 to five selected regulatory loci based on KLF4 ChIP-seq signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) also showed the high enrichment (≥9-fold) on the specific loci after KLF4 ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). KLF4 ChIP-bisulfite sequencing analyses showed that KLF4 could readily ChIP those loci (i.e., L1 and L2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) with TACpGCC at two completely unmethylated fragments, and with CCCpGCC at ∼100% methylation level in other two loci tested (L3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that KLF4 binds to both unmethylated and highly methylated CpGs in different sequence contexts in vivo. To rule out the possibility that other sites within the ChIP’ed fragments might be responsible for KLF4 binding, we searched the published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lister et al., 2009</xref>) and did not find any other KLF4 binding peaks within the surrounding 500 bp, supporting that KLF4 indeed binds to these unmethylated or methylated sites. We also examined KLF4 methylated target sites that exhibit medium methylation levels (e.g., ∼50%) based on the published methylome dataset. Importantly, KLF4 ChIP-bisulfite sequencing analyses showed that the methylation level of CCCpGCC consensus was significantly increased from 30% and 55% of the genomics inputs to 65% (p=0.001) and 73% (p=0.04) in the ChIP’ed samples for two examined regions, respectively (L4 and L5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; upper panel). As predicted, those nearby CpG sites not embedded in the KLF4 consensus did not show any significant increase in methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; lower panel). Together, the above analyses provided direct evidence that KLF4 preferentially binds to CCmCpGCC consensus sequence in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have identified numerous human TFs across various subfamilies that showed mCpG- and sequence-dependent binding activity, a much more prevalent phenomenon than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quenneville et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). It is likely that more proteins with the similar activity are yet to be discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>), because (1) we only surveyed a tiny fraction of methylated CpG space; (2) we did not screen for TFs that can recognize methylated CHG or CHH sequences in this study, which are present in several cell types including ESCs, induced pluirpotent stem cells, germline and neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramsahoye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ziller et al., 2011</xref>); (3) we did not include in the screen any hemimethylated DNA motifs, which occurs in vivo on newly synthesized DNAs during replication; and (4) some of the unconventional DNA-binding proteins we discovered in an earlier study might also encode this property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We estimated false positive and false negative rate for our protein microarray assays. Since 8 of the 11 methylated DNA-binding TFs were confirmed by EMSAs, we estimated that this protein microarray strategy might produce ∼27% of false positives. Our approach also showed some false negatives because some known methylated DNA binding proteins were not identified in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>). There are several possible reasons to explain this discrepancy. First, since we employed a competition assay on the human TF protein microarrays, only those that preferentially bind to methylated DNA motifs will be identified. In other words, if a protein binds to a DNA sequence irrespective of its methylation status, it will not show strong signals in our screen. Second, the number of DNA sequences we tested is rather small. Based on our simulation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>), we expect that there exist more such human TFs yet to be discovered with more DNA motifs tested. Third, because we do not have any TF heterodimers on our arrays, it may also generate false negatives. For example, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>) employed a generic methylated DNA probe to pull down potential methylated DNA-binding proteins in mouse cell lysates, resulted in the identification of 19 proteins. Among them, 11 have human orthologs and are presented on our human protein microarrays. Five of them, namely MeCP2, NRF1, MBD1/4, and KLF4, showed methylated-specific binding activities in our study. The other six proteins showed weak binding signals in our competition assay, presumably due to the reasons discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of all the above limitations, we still discovered many novel methylation-dependent DNA-binding activities. For example, Znf114 and Znf416 were identified as new generic methylated-DNA binding proteins, with binding activities to almost all methylated DNA motifs tested in this study. The reason that they were not discovered in previous studies might be due to the fact that most of the previous studies were not performed in a systematic way. In our systematic survey, we identified a total of 47 novel methylated DNA-binding proteins, which significantly expanded the methylation-dependent protein–DNA interaction landscape.</p><p>Our findings provide a new framework to better understand mechanisms of DNA methylation-dependent regulation of gene expression, especially in cancer, stem cell and development biology. For example, recent DNA methylome studies in cancer have identified dynamic epigenetic changes, resulting in global reprogramming in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones and Baylin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Figueroa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noushmehr et al., 2010</xref>). However, CpG methylation does not always correlate with transcription repression in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Everhard et al., 2009</xref>). Our unbiased screen of the entire human TF family identified many sequence-specific mCpG ‘readers’, which can presumably interpret the DNA methylation changes and in turn, regulate gene expression in a dynamic environment. Therefore, by presenting distinct binding sites for TFs, methylated cytosines may serve as the fifth alphabet that changes the landscape of TF–DNA interactions and increases the complexity and diversity of gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein annotation</title><p>The protein annotation of transcription factors and cofactors was obtained from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) with some minor manual corrections.

Since each protein is printed in duplicate on a microarray and each motif binding assay was performed in duplicate, a protein was identified as a positive hit only when all of its four spots produced a Z-score ≥ 3. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref> lists all transcription factor and cofactor hits showing binding to at least one methylated DNA motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EMSA</title><p>Each binding reaction was carried out with 100 fmol of biotinylated dsDNA probe and 1 pmol of purified protein in 20 µl of binding buffer as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). 10-fold (1 pmol) of unlabeled (cold) DNA motifs were added in the competition assays. All the expression clones for proteins used in EMSA were verified by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title><italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> measurement of transcription factors binding 5mCpG motifs</title><p>Binding affinity between a transcriptional factor and a methylated DNA motif was determined by the oblique incidence reflection difference (OIRD) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Landry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fei et al., 2011</xref>). Synthesized DNA motifs were methylated using <italic>Sss</italic>I enzyme as described above (‘Materials and methods’), then printed together with their unmethylated counterparts onto Superamine 2 slides (ArrayIt, Sunnyvale, CA) at a concentration of 2.5 μM in 50% DMSO, exposed to 600 μJ UV for 3 min, and dried in a 37°C incubator for 1 hr. We selected ZMYM3, TFAP2A and KLF4 to measure their affinity. We also used MBD2b (Millipore, Billerica, MA) as a bench marker. For each OIRD measurement, a DNA motif slide was first washed with EMSA binding buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) at 3 ml/min for 5 min, and then flooded with the corresponding TF protein solution at various concentrations as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. The observed on curve was then measured in real time until the OIRD signals reached saturation. To determine the off curve, the EMSA buffer was then pumped through the reaction chamber at a speed of 200 μl/min until the OIRD signals stabilized. Binding and dissociation signals were recorded every 10 s. Data analysis was carried out using Origin 9.0 following Majka J and Speck C’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Majka and Speck, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Luciferase assay</title><p>The CpG-free luciferase reporter vector used in our study, pCpGL, was a gift from Dr Michael Rehli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klug and Rehli, 2006</xref>). Eight units of a DNA motif were subcloned into pCpGL promoter region, and the resulting plasmids (pCpGL-8X-motif) were grown in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> PIR 1 strain using Zeocin as a selection marker. The CpG sites in the motifs were methylated using M.<italic>Sss</italic>I as described previously. GT1-7 cells were co-transfected with three constructs: pCpGL-8X-motif, pCAGIG expressing the corresponding TF constructs at various concentrations, and pTK-RL (Promega, Madison, WI) using the FugeneHD reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Cells were harvested 48 hr post-transfection for luciferase reporter assay using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All assays were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Methylated DNA binding consensus</title><p>We reason that the methylated CpG is the key and conserved position for binding because the unmethylated counterpart shows no binding. Therefore, we first aligned the motif sequences around methylated CpG. For each TF binding to multiple methylated motifs, we then hierarchically clustered all 6-mer binding sequences centered on mCpG. With a selected cutoff for sequence similarity, all the binding motifs were separated into several groups. Each group of sequences was combined to derive the consensus sequences. The consensus sequence for the largest sequence group is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. If a TF binds to only one motif, the consensus sequence is the same as the binding motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Known DNA binding consensus</title><p>We collected the known consensus sequences for the TFs from the literature and databases (TRANSFAC and JASPAR). Some TFs have multiple known consensus sequences. In such cases, we prefer consensus sequences derived from in vitro interaction assays to those derived from in vivo experiments such as ChIP-seq, because the binding sequences derived from ChIP-seq could include methylated sequences. For example, one of the KLF4 consensus sequences in TRANSFAC was based on a ChIP-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), while another KLF4 binding motif was based on an in vitro oligonucleotide library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shields and Yang, 1998</xref>). The known consensus for KLF4 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> was created based on the dataset from in vitro oligonucleotide library using MDscan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>KLF4 methylated binding motifs in vivo</title><p>We integrated human methylome data and KLF4 ChIP-seq data to obtain the KLF4 binding landscape in H1 human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lister et al., 2009</xref>). First, we adopted one popular software MACS (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq) to determine KLF4 binding peaks and summits. The lengths of peaks determined by MACS were from 152 bp to 6062 bp. We selected 95% of these peaks which were shorter than 371 bp for further analysis. To remove the effect of sequence composition difference in genomic regions, we focused on the binding peaks but extended the peaks to ±50 bp to achieve enough ‘background’ sequences. The ‘foreground’ was sequences within ±60 bp around KLF4 binding summits. Since we are interested in motifs that could be affected by methylation, we obtained the occurrences of all possible 6-mers having CpG at the center position, e.g. AACGCT. The 6-mers significantly enriched in highly methylated summits (M ≥ 0.8) than in the background were predicted as KLF4 methylated binding motifs. The p-value was calculated based on hypergeometric cumulative distribution function. At the next step, we clustered significant 6-mer sequences (p&lt;0.01 after Bonferroni multiple-test correction, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>) from methylated group to obtain KLF4 methylated DNA binding consensus motif.

The authors should better demonstrate that the dual preference of KLF4 in vivo before this work could be published. The specific points to address are:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>: because of the poor quality (or presentation) of the ChIP-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, ChIP-qPCR data for this experiment should be presented here to convince the reader that KLF4 is actually bound to these sites in vivo.</p><p>2) The authors should discuss the protein microarray approach in more detail.

Do they have any estimations about false positive or false negative hits in their screening</italic>?</p><p>We have added more details both to the main text and the Materials and methods section about the protein microarray analysis. We also estimated the false positive rate of the protein microarray assays based on the EMSA results. However, it is hard for us to evaluate the false negative rate by comparing with other results published so far. The reasons are as below: 1) Some proteins identified by others may not present on our protein microarrays, or they came from different species, e.g., mice in the study by Spruijt et al. (“Dynamic Readers for 5-(Hydroxy)Methylcytosine and Its Oxidized Derivatives”, <italic>Cell</italic>. 2013 Feb 28;152(5):1146-59). 2) Our competition assays on the protein microarrays were designed to identify those TFs that prefer methylated DNA motifs, which is very different from other works already published. 3) We only surveyed a limited space of methylated DNA sequences. (So far, we had only tested 154 methylated DNA motifs.) 4) The cutoff of Z-scores used to identify specific methylated DNA-binding proteins was set pretty high. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>, we illustrated the Z-scores for some mouse proteins identified by Spruijt et al., which are just below our cutoff. We have added discussion of false positive and false negative hits in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) The authors generate a number of KLF4 point mutants that are defective for meCpG binding (R458A, D460A) but still interact with un-methylated DNA (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C–E</italic></xref><italic>).

As a comparison, a well known methylated DNA-binding protein, MBD2b, was also included. Because the OIRD system, similar to the SPR method, can monitor binding events in a real-time, label-free fashion, we therefore obtained the <italic>K</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>off</sub> values, and determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of ZMYM3, TFAP2A, and KLF4 as 460 nM, 399 nM, and 479 nM, respectively, using their newly identified methylated DNA motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). As expected, none of them showed any significant binding activity to the un-methylated DNA motifs in the OIRD measurements, confirming our previous observations. On the other hand, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of MBD2b measured against the same motifs are in close range to the three TFs tested, suggesting that these TFs could bind to methylated DNA motifs almost as equally well as MBD2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3E</xref>). Finally, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values of MBD2b measured with the OIRD system is almost the same as reported (i.e., 330 nM; Yinni Yu et al., Direct DNA methylation profiling using methyl binding domain proteins. <italic>Anal. Chem</italic>. 2010, 82, 5012–5019). These new results and a description of the OIRD experiments can now be found in the main text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>, and the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should discuss their results in the context of previously published literature and discuss any overlap, discrepancies and novelties. For example: why were ZNF114 and ZNF416 not picked up in previous interactions screenings? Why did the authors not identify meCpG dependent interactions for Rfx proteins</italic>?</p><p>ZNF114 and ZNF416 were identified as generic methylated DNA-binding proteins in our study. The reason that they were not discovered in previous studies might be due to the fact that most of the previous studies were not performed in a systematic way. In our systematic survey, we identified a total of 47 novel methylated DNA-binding proteins, which significantly expanded the methylation-dependent protein-DNA interaction landscape. Secondly, a recent study by Spruijt et al. (Spruijt et al. <italic>Cell</italic> 2013) used a mass spectrometry approach to systematically identify methylated DNA-binding proteins. However, their approach was applied to investigate the mouse proteome, which does not encode any ZNF114 and ZNF416 orthologs. On the other hand, we did not identify Rfx proteins as methylated DNA-binding proteins. As we discussed in point 2, there are several reasons for missing previous known methylated DNA-binding proteins in our assay. For example, in our study we used a competition assay, which would not identify those TFs that binds to both methylated and un-methylated DNA motifs equally well. Only the proteins that are preferentially binding to methylated DNA motifs would be identified as hits in our study. Please note that four of the six Rfx proteins on the TF protein microarrays have a Z-score above 2, indicating that they have weak preference to the methylated DNA motifs tested in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>). We have added discussion on these issues to the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
