degradation in Proteobacteria without interfering with translation. However, Firmicutes have a fundamentally different set of ribonucleases for mRNA degradation and whether sRNAs can regulate the activity of these enzymes is an open question. We show that <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> RoxS, a major <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNA shared with <italic>Staphylococus aureus</italic>, prevents degradation of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA, encoding a malate transporter. In the presence of malate, RoxS transiently escapes from repression by the NADH-sensitive transcription factor Rex and binds to the extreme 5’-end of <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA. This impairs the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease activity of RNase J1, increasing the half-life of the primary transcript and concomitantly enhancing ribosome binding to increase expression of the transporter. Globally, the different targets regulated by RoxS suggest that it helps readjust the cellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance when perturbed by different stimuli.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

efficient way to modulate gene expression used by all organisms. In bacteria, this regulation can involve <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements such as riboswitches, which bind small molecules and modify transcription elongation, translation or mRNA stability. It can equally involve <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors such as proteins (RNases or RNA binding proteins) and small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). sRNAs can be encoded in cis (antisense RNA) or in trans relative to their target mRNAs and these regulatory mechanisms can be superimposed on each other to create complex control networks.</p><p>The two best-studied model bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> have evolved with different arsenals of ribonucleases and alternative approaches to the fundamental cellular processes of RNA maturation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechhofer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durand et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Condon and Putzer, 2002</xref>). Only eight of the &gt;30 ribonucleases currently identified in these two bacteria are present in both organisms. <italic>E. coli</italic> depends primarily on endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E to initiate RNA turnover, followed by degradation of the resulting fragments in a 3’-to-5’ orientation by exoribonucleases. <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> on the other hand, has replaced RNase E by an enzyme with similar properties called RNase Y and has the additional option of exonucleolytically degrading RNAs from the 5’ end using an enzyme called RNase J1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>). In this regard, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> shares features with the eukaryotic model of RNA decay and this observation has obscured some of the traditional divisions between « prokaryotic » and « eukaryotic » pathways of RNA degradation.</p><p>Small regulatory RNAs have been mostly studied in Gram-negative bacteria, especially in <italic>E. coli</italic> and its pathogenic relatives. In these organisms, sRNAs generally act by an imperfect base pairing with their target mRNAs. The interaction between sRNA and mRNA often requires the chaperone Hfq, an Sm-like protein that both stabilizes the sRNA and facilitates the pairing with mRNA targets (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Updegrove et al., 2016</xref>). The sRNA-mRNA interaction can lead to a positive or a negative effect on gene expression. In bacteria, most sRNAs examined to date directly affect mRNA translation with an indirect effect on mRNA half-life (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner and Romby, 2015</xref>). However, some more recent studies have shown that sRNAs are also able to directly affect mRNA stability without affecting translation, by recruiting the degradation machinery or interfering with its action (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lalaouna et al., 2013</xref>). In one particular example, the ternary complex formed between the sRNA (MicC), the mRNA (<italic>ompD</italic>) and Hfq can recruit RNase E to a site within the open reading frame and stimulate its cleavage by presenting the 5’ monophosphate of the sRNA to RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyra et al., 2012</xref>). In another, the sRNA RydC increases the stability of the <italic>cfa</italic> mRNA by pairing to the 5’-UTR of this mRNA, far upstream of the ribosome binding site, and hiding a cleavage site from RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fröhlich et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Small RNAs have also been studied in some Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes,</italic> but in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the paradigm of Gram-positive bacteria, only a handful of sRNAs have been characterized to date and the global mechanisms of sRNA regulation have not been fully resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durand et al., 2015b</xref>). In these bacteria, Hfq is generally not required for sRNA-mRNA pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hämmerle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rochat et al., 2015</xref>) although there are some exceptions in specific organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nielsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boudry et al., 2014</xref>). One key question is to what extent RNases J1 and Y are influenced by sRNA binding to mRNA targets in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, i.e. can <italic>E. coli</italic> models involving RNase E be transposed to these RNases in its Gram-positive counterpart?</p><p>RoxS (<underline>r</underline>elated to <underline>ox</underline>idative <underline>s</underline>tress) is the unique <italic>trans</italic>-acting sRNA, apart from the ubiquitous 6S RNA, that is conserved between <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and the Gram-positive pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic>. First identified in <italic>S. aureus</italic> where it is named RsaE, it was shown to regulate genes involved in amino acid and peptide transport, cofactor synthesis, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geissmann et al., 2009</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that RoxS transcription is induced during nitric oxide (NO) stress by the two-component system ResDE and regulates the expression of numerous genes linked to oxido-reduction processes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>). In searching for additional direct targets of RoxS that may not have been expressed under the experimental conditions of the first study, we found that RoxS potentially interacts with the extreme 5’-end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA, encoding a malate transporter in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We show here that RoxS expression is greatly increased in the presence of malate in the medium and acts as a positive regulator of transporter expression by directly blocking <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA degradation by the 5’−3’ exoribonuclease J1. This is the first known case of an sRNA controlling 5'-exoribonuclease activity in bacteria. RoxS can further stimulate translation of the stabilized <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA, possibly by opening a specific fold of the mRNA that partially occludes the ribosome binding site, providing an additional layer of complexity to the control mechanism. Lastly, we show that RoxS expression is controlled by Rex, a transcriptional repressor of genes linked to fermentation processes that senses the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance in the cell. The increase in RoxS expression in the presence of malate is explained by a release from Rex-mediated repression, allowing a far more efficient regulation of RoxS targets than seen previously.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In a previous study we showed that RoxS, either directly or indirectly, negatively regulates the expression of up to a hundred genes, including two mRNAs encoding proteins involved in central carbon metabolism: <italic>ppnkB</italic> (encoding an inorganic polyphosphate/ATP-NAD kinase) and <italic>sucCD</italic> (encoding succinate dehydrogenase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>). In both cases, RoxS binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences and inhibits translation initiation. To expand the number of direct RoxS targets, we searched for new potential binding sites for this sRNA (TargetRNA2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kery et al., 2014</xref>) that we might have missed in the first study because of the specific growth conditions used (rich medium at 37°C). One such predicted target, the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA (encoding one of at least four malate transporters in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) drew our attention because RoxS was predicted to bind to the extreme 5’-end of the mRNA well upstream of the ribosome binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23602.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Base-pairing between RoxS and <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA predicted by the TargetRNA2 program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~btjaden/TargetRNA2/">http://cs.wellesley.edu/~btjaden/TargetRNA2/</ext-link>).</title><p>The transcriptional start (+1) of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA is indicated.

To confirm the existence of a 5' end corresponding to this promoter prediction and confirm it was a primary rather than processed transcript, we performed primer extension assays on total RNA with or without pretreatment with the 5’−3’ exoribonuclease Xrn1. This ribonuclease only degrades RNAs with a 5’-monophosphate and leaves 5'-triphosphorylated primary transcripts intact. As a control, we used the <italic>hbs</italic> mRNA, for which two primary transcripts (P3 and P1) and a ribosome-protected maturation product (M) can be detected in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daou-Chabo et al., 2009</xref>). Treatment of total RNA by Xrn1 caused the 5'-monophosphorylated end corresponding to the <italic>hbs</italic> maturation product to disappear as expected. In contrast, the 5' ends corresponding to the P3/P1 primary transcripts of <italic>hbs</italic> and the predicted primary transcript of <italic>yflS</italic> were resistant to Xrn1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This promoter and 5'-UTR is highly conserved among <italic>Bacilli</italic> with a clearly identifiable <italic>yflS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the RoxS sRNA sequence is identical to that of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in these organisms, the predicted base-pairing with the 5' end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA is likely to be conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RoxS regulates <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA stability</title><p>The <italic>yflS</italic> gene encodes a malate transporter whose expression is induced by the two-component system (MalKR), which senses the presence of malate in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>).

These experiments were done both in the presence and absence of RoxS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Deletion of the gene encoding RNase III (<italic>∆rnc</italic>) had no major impact on <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA half-life in either the presence (3.1 min) or absence (0.7 min) of RoxS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the RNase Y (<italic>∆rny</italic>) mutant strain, the full-length <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA was stabilized about 10-fold compared to WT (25.9 min <italic>vs</italic> 2.5 min half-life) and in the <italic>∆roxS ∆rny</italic> double mutant compared to the <italic>∆roxS</italic> single mutant (9.5 min <italic>vs</italic> 0.7 min).

The accumulation of these 3' fragments was similar in the presence or absence of RoxS, consistent with the observation (above) that RNase Y cleavages were RoxS independent. In the presence of RoxS, the stability of the full-length <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA was slightly higher in the <italic>∆rnjA</italic> strain compared to wild-type strains (4 <italic>vs</italic> 2.5 min half-life, respectively).

Thus, RoxS protects the full-length <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA from degradation by RNase J1 in vivo.</p><p>RNase J1 is known to be inhibited by the tri-phosphate group present on the 5' end of primary transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>). Direct attack of the 5' end of the primary <italic>yflS</italic> transcript by RNase J1 in 5' exonucleolytic mode would thus require conversion of the 5' tri-phosphate to mono-phosphate. To date, the only known enzyme to catalyze this reaction in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2011</xref>), although other as yet unidentified enzymes are thought to have similar activity. BsRppH prefers a guanosine residue in the second position of its RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piton et al., 2013</xref>). As the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA fulfills this requirement (i.e. it starts with AG or GG), we measured the half-life of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA in both <italic>∆rppH</italic> and <italic>∆roxS ∆rppH</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the <italic>∆rppH</italic> strain, the half-life was similar to that measured in the wild-type (2.2 <italic>vs</italic> 2.5 min). The <italic>yflS</italic> half-life was also comparable between the <italic>∆rppH ∆roxS</italic> and the <italic>∆roxS</italic> strains (both 0.7 min). Thus, RppH is not the enzyme responsible for the removal of the 5’ tri-phosphate of <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA to give access to RNase J1.

The cleavage sites were in good agreement with the secondary structure of RoxS, as most of the strong RNase T2 cuts were located in the apical loops, while the RNase V1 cuts were primarily located in the helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The addition of <italic>yflS</italic> RNA caused limited changes in reactivity restricted to the region encompassing CRR2 and CRR3. Several RNase V1 cleavages were induced close to CRR3 (at nts 63–65). Concomitantly, several RNase T2 cleavages located between CRR2 and CRR3 decreased under the same conditions. Together, these observations show convincingly that, as for the <italic>ppnKB</italic> mRNA, RoxS primarily uses the CRR3 region to hybridize to <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RoxS also activates translation of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA</title><p>The data presented thus far suggests that RoxS binds to the 5’ end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA principally via the CRR3 motif to protect it from degradation by RNase J1. To determine the impact of RoxS binding on the conformation of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA and potentially on translation, we also probed the secondary structure of the leader portion of <italic>yflS</italic> alone or bound to RoxS. The probes used in this case were RNase V1, RNase T1 (specific for unpaired guanines) and RNase T2. A summary of the results is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In the absence of RoxS, two equilibrium secondary structure models best explain the enzymatic cleavage patterns detected. In the two proposed models, the SD and the AUG start codon are engaged in weak basepairing interactions, while the four guanines at the extreme 5’ end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA are accessible to RNase T1 and are therefore in single-stranded conformation. However, we noticed that adenines 11 to 14 were cleaved poorly by RNase T2 compared to other A-stretches (A50-54, A63-66, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Their three-dimensional conformation may therefore be more complex than shown here. Upon addition of RoxS, we observed a significant decrease in the RNase T1 cleavages in the first 10 nucleotides of the <italic>yflS</italic> leader, while adenines 11 to 14 become more accessible to RNase T2. A similar effect was seen with the RoxS CRR1 mutant. However, no major effect was observed with the CRR3 variants, consistent with the idea that CRR3 is the key mediator of the interaction with the 5’ end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA. In the absence of RoxS, we also noticed a strong reverse transcriptase (RT) stop between C34 and U35 of the <italic>yflS</italic> leader. This RT stop is located between the SD and AUG start codon and was suppressed by the binding of the wild-type RoxS or the CRR1 mutant, but not the CRR3 variants. These results strongly support the prediction that RoxS base-pairs with the extreme 5’ end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA through CRR3, and suggest that RoxS additionally induces a long-range perturbation of the mRNA structure close to the SD sequence.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23602.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Modification of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA secondary structure upon RoxS binding.</title><p>Summary of the cleavage patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) of <italic>yflS</italic> alone (two potential equilibrium structures) or bound to RoxS generated by RNase V1 (red arrows), RNase T1 (blue arrows) and RNase T2 (green arrows).

We therefore performed toeprinting experiments on the same 94-nt <italic>yflS</italic> leader fragment used for the RNase J1 in vitro degradation and structure probing assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The <italic>yflS</italic> transcript was incubated with the 30S ribosomal subunit and initiator tRNA either with or without pre-incubation with RoxS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the absence of RoxS, a characteristic reverse transcriptase stop was observed at position +16 relative to the start codon, showing that the translation initiation complex can be formed without RoxS. Addition of wild-type RoxS or the CRR1 mutant increased the signal at +16 approximately 3-fold, suggesting that RoxS stimulates the formation of the translation initiation complex. Significantly less stimulation was observed with the two CRR3 variants; it is possible that the apparent residual effect of these mutants comes from the extended base-pairing around CRR2 in these in vitro experiments. We also detected the strong RT stop between the SD and AUG start codon and, as previously, this species diminished with increasing concentration of wild type RoxS or CRR1 mutant, but not with the CRR3 mutants. The decrease of this signal between C34 and U35 is thus a signature of RoxS binding.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23602.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>RoxS stimulates 30S binding to the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA in vitro.</title><p>Toeprint analysis of wild-type (WT) and various mutant forms of RoxS bound to 50 nM of the <italic>yflS in vitro</italic> transcript (94 nt).

We had previously shown that RoxS is induced by nitric-oxide (NO) in the growth medium <italic>via</italic> the two-component system ResDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>). We therefore first tested the involvement of ResDE in the induction of RoxS expression by malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In the <italic>∆resDE</italic> mutant strain, RoxS levels were lower than in the WT strain, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>). However, RoxS levels were still inducible by malate in the absence of ResDE, with the same kinetics as in the WT strain, showing that ResDE is not involved in this regulation.</p><p>The two-component system MalKR, known to respond to malate levels in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and responsible for induction of <italic>yflS</italic> expression (see above), was also a good candidate for RoxS regulation by malate. In a <italic>∆malKR</italic> strain mutant, RoxS levels no longer increased upon addition of malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), suggesting a role for this two-component system in regulation. However, a comparison of the RoxS promoter sequence to those of the <italic>maeN</italic>, <italic>maeA</italic> and <italic>yflS</italic> genes, all known to bind MalR, did not reveal any obvious similarities. We purified the MalR protein and performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with a DNA fragment corresponding to the RoxS promoter, with the <italic>maeA</italic> promoter as a positive control and a portion of the <italic>yflS</italic> coding region as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We confirmed binding of MalR to the <italic>maeA</italic> promoter but found no specific interaction with the RoxS promoter region. These data suggest that the effect of the MalKR two-component system on RoxS levels is indirect.</p><p>Further examination of the sequence around the RoxS transcription start site revealed the presence of a potential binding site for the Rex transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Härtig and Jahn, 2012</xref>) immediately downstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore examined the induction of RoxS expression upon addition of malate to a <italic>∆rex</italic> strain. In the absence of Rex, RoxS levels were already high before addition of malate induction and accumulated to even higher levels over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Furthermore, we no longer observed the reduction in RoxS levels one hour after malate addition. This result suggests that Rex represses RoxS transcription and that addition of malate to the growth medium causes a transient release from this repression for at least 30 mins (see discussion). To demonstrate that Rex directly binds the RoxS promoter region, we performed EMSA experiments with the <italic>roxS</italic> and the lactate dehydrogenase (<italic>ldh</italic>) gene promoter sequences, and with a portion of the <italic>yflS</italic> coding region as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

RoxS binds to the 5' end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA through base-pairing interactions primarily with the C-rich region CRR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The inhibitory effect on RNase J1 5'−3' exoribonuclease activity can easily be understood in structural terms; the RNA binding channel that leads to the RNase J1 catalytic site is only long enough to accommodate 4–5 nts of single stranded RNA. The unbound <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA is predicted to have at least six unpaired nts before the first hairpin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and would thus be expected to be a good substrate for RNase J1 once the 5'-triphosphate group has been removed. When bound to RoxS, the duplexed 5' end of the <italic>yflS</italic> RNA can no longer reach the catalytic site, explaining how it is protected from degradation.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are only three other examples of direct mRNA stabilization by a <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory RNA in Gram-positive bacteria. In <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, the 5’-UTR of the intact <italic>irvA</italic> mRNA interacts with the coding sequence of the <italic>gbpC</italic> mRNA, encoding a surface lectin implicated in dextran dependent aggregation stress (DDAG). This interaction blocks endoribonucleolyic cleavage of the <italic>gbpC</italic> mRNA by RNase J2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obana et al. (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2013</xref>) showed that the <italic>Clostridium perfringens colA</italic> mRNA (encoding collagenase) is stabilized by the VR-RNA. Binding of the sRNA to the <italic>colA</italic> mRNA leads to a cleavage its 5’-UTR, which releases the <italic>colA</italic> SD sequence and stimulates translation initiation. The stabilization of <italic>colA</italic> depends on the binding of a ribosome to the SD sequence, but translation has no impact on mRNA stability. In the pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, the FasX sRNA stabilizes the streptokinase encoding mRNA (<italic>ska</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramirez-Peña et al., 2010</xref>) by binding to its extreme 5' end <italic>via</italic> a sequence resembling that of the RoxS CRR3 (four consecutive C's matched with four consecutive G's). Our data would suggest that RNase J1 is a prime candidate for FasX regulation of the <italic>ska</italic> mRNA. In fact, the sRNA-dependent 5' end protection mechanism discovered here could in theory be used to activate expression of any mRNA in any microorganism by shielding it from enzymes (e.g. RppH, RNase J1, RNase E) requiring a single stranded 5’ extremity to initiate degradation.</p><p>Our data also indicate that binding of RoxS to the 5' end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA both protects it from degradation by RNase J1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and stimulates 30S binding to the SD sequence in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting an activation of translation. Moreover, the increased expression of the <italic>yflS(436)-lacZ</italic> fusion in the presence of RoxS is consistent with an increase in translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We were able to uncouple the effect of RoxS on <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA stability and translation by making a non-translated variant (<italic>yflS<sup>mutTR</sup></italic>) and showed that RoxS is still able to stabilize this mRNA independently of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, in all likelihood, the two events are indissociable in vivo with the wild-type <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA, that is, stabilization of the mRNA and increased translation go hand in hand to produce more of the YflS transporter in the presence of malate.</p><p>The enzymatic probing of <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA indicated that the binding of RoxS, in addition to protecting the 5' end from RNase T1 cleavage, causes subtle modifications of the secondary structure of the <italic>yflS</italic> leader, that could account for the stimulation of initiation complex formation. Most noticeably, a strong RT stop between C34 and U35 (five nucleotides upstream of the AUG) is lost upon binding of WT RoxS or the CRR1 mutant, but is retained when <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA is incubated with the inactive CRR3 variant. This suggests a structural modification to the apex of the stem-loop in the vicinity of the SD sequence upon binding to RoxS. Surprisingly, however, no other nucleotides in this neighborhood became more reactive to single stranded probes (e.g. RNase T1) in the presence of RoxS, in particular the two G-C pairs (25G/34C and 26G/33C) that are predicted to close the apical loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that the 3D structure of <italic>yflS</italic> leader and the impact of RoxS may be more complex than the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA sequence contains several stretches of consecutive G-residues in the first 50 nts that could potentially form G-quadruplex RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kikin et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, part of the 5’ leader including the AAACAA sequence (nts 12–17) of <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA could potentially form a triple helix with the stem of the adjacent hairpin rich in AU pairings. In both cases, RoxS binding would disrupt a tertiary fold favoring the recognition of the ribosome. Our structure probing data are consistent with a model in which the duplex formed by binding of RoxS to the 5’ end of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA not only blocks RNase J1 access but also disrupts a particular fold of the 5’UTR that is unfavorable to ribosome recruitment.</p><p>Our study showed that the expression of the RoxS sRNA is not only induced by nitric oxide (NO) as we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>), but also by the presence of malate in the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The malate-induced increase in RoxS expression is indirectly dependent on the two-component system MalKR and directly dependent on release from Rex repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). The Rex repressor is a sensor of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in the cell. It has a 20,000-fold higher affinity for NADH than for NAD<sup>+</sup> and the binding of NADH to Rex provokes a structural rearrangement which prevents its binding to target promoters and allows the expression of genes involved in fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaughlin et al., 2010</xref>). The temporary release from Rex-mediated repression of RoxS expression may be linked to the generation of NADH in the early steps of malate metabolism, either in the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) in the TCA cycle, or its conversion to pyruvate by the malic enzymes MaeA, MalS and MleA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lerondel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer and Stülke, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The effect of the MalKR mutation on RoxS expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) is most likely explained by the decrease in expression of the MalKR regulon, consisting of the malate transporter genes <italic>yflS</italic> and <italic>maeN,</italic> and that of the malic enzyme <italic>maeA,</italic> and the consequent impact on NADH levels and Rex activity.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23602.027</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Model of various roles of RoxS upon addition of malate to culture medium.</title><p>For details see text.

Malate is a common source of carbon for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in its natural habitat since it is released by the roots of many plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rudrappa et al., 2008</xref>). Most of the malate imported by <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells serves in gluconeogenesis and the excess is sent towards overflow metabolism/fermentation and the production of lactate, acetate, acetoin and 2,3-butanediol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleijn et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This overflow metabolism/fermentation allows NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration, primarily catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh/LctE) that converts pyruvate to lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz Ramos et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Transcription of the <italic>maeN</italic> mRNA, encoding the main malate transporter, is essentially turned off during fermentation and ethanol stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicolas et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that RoxS specifically stabilizes the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA to compensate for this decrease in <italic>maeN</italic> expression, thus facilitating the continued uptake of malate during conditions where the fermentation/overflow pathway is turned on.</p><p>The identification of Rex as a regulator of RoxS expression significantly expands the Rex regulon and contributes to our understanding of the pivotal role of Rex in Bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laouami et al., 2014</xref>); up to now only a handful of fermentation pathway genes or operons were known to be directly repressed by this transcriptional regulator. Our previous study showed that 30% of genes with increased expression in a ∆<italic>roxS</italic> strain are linked to oxido-reduction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>). Its down-regulated targets include <italic>ppnKB,</italic> encoding NAD-kinase, and the TCA cycle components <italic>sucCD</italic> and <italic>citZ</italic>. PpnKB and the TCA cycle are significant contributors to the production of NADPH and NADH, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). These observations, together with the fact that RoxS is regulated by the NADH-sensitive transcriptional repressor Rex, suggest that a key role of RoxS is to temporarily turn down part of the TCA cycle to help restore the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH balance. In the presence of malate, this re-equilibration is further aided by the increased activity of Ldh regenerating NAD<sup>+</sup> (see above). Once the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio is restored, Rex would be predicted to become active again as a repressor, explaining the decrease in RoxS levels seen in Northern blots about one hour after addition of malate and the loss of this down-regulation in the Rex mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). In further agreement with a role for RoxS in managing NADH levels, we showed in our previous report that expression of the lactate dehydrogenase gene (<italic>ldh</italic>) and the <italic>cydA</italic> gene, encoding a subunit of cytochrome bd, is up-regulated in <italic>∆roxS</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>). Neither of these mRNAs is predicted to be a direct target of RoxS, but both are members of the Rex regulon. Their increased expression is thus most likely indicative of higher intracellular NADH levels and Rex derepression in the <italic>∆roxS</italic> strain. Interestingly, a link between NO levels and regulation of virulence via NADH and Rex has been proposed in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pagels et al., 2010</xref>). The conservation of the Rex binding site downstream of the RsaE/RoxS promoter in <italic>S. aureus</italic> suggests that this pathway is evolutionarily conserved to best serve the adaptation of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> to their respective niches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and constructs</title><p>Strains and oligonucleotides used are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">2</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Strain CCB803 (<italic>malKR::spc</italic>) was constructed by transforming <italic>B. subtilis</italic> W168 (SSB1002) with a PCR fragment generated by re-amplifying (oligo pair CC1722/CC1716) three overlapping PCR fragments corresponding to upstream (oligo pair CC1715/CC1717), downstream (oligo pair CC1719/CC1721) regions of the <italic>malKR</italic> operon and the spectinomycin resistance cassette (oligo pair CC1718/CC1720) from plasmid pDG1727 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guérout-Fleury et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Strain CCB952 (<italic>rex:pMUTIN ery</italic>) was constructed by transforming the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> W168 strain with chromosomal DNA from strain MGNA-C201 from the Japanese National Institute of Genetics (NIG) collection.</p><p>The <italic>yflS</italic>(436)<italic>-lacZ</italic> fusion was constructed using a PCR fragment generated by amplifying the <italic>yflS</italic> gene (oligo pair CC1734/CC1789) including 436 amino acids of the coding sequence (−81 to +1347 relative to transcription start site) and cloned between the <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Sal</italic>I restriction sites of the integrative plasmid pHM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gendron et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>B. subtilis</italic> W168 and CCB485 (<italic>roxS::kan</italic>) strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durand et al., 2015a</xref>) were transformed with pHM2-<italic>yflS</italic>(436)-<italic>lacZ</italic> yielding strains CCB831 and CCB832, respectively.</p><p>Strain CCB1022 (<italic>yflS<sup>mutTR</sup></italic>) was made by markerless mutation of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and fifth codon of <italic>yflS</italic> using plasmid pMAD-yflS<sup>mutTR</sup> according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnaud et al., 2004</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: David Bechhofer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Sylvain Duran et al. reports the discovery of 5'end-dependent post-transcriptional activation of a <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> mRNA by the conserved regulatory sRNA RoxS. The authors propose that RoxS recognizes the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA at the very 5' end and thereby blocks 5' exonucleolytic degradation of this target by RNase J1. This would be the first time a bacterial sRNA has been shown to regulate gene expression in trans by inhibiting 5'-3' exonucleolytic degradation, the latter of which being similar to RNA degradation in eukaryotes. In the second part of this manuscript, the authors present experiments indicating that RoxS binding also remodels structurally the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA to make it more competent for translation. In the third part, RoxS is shown to be transcriptionally controlled by the important DNA binding protein Rex. Additionally, experiments are presented to elucidate RoxS activity under different nutritional conditions. Specifically, the authors show that RoxS expression is negatively regulated by Rex, a transcriptional repressor that is itself indirectly regulated by the presence of malate. A regulatory scheme for malate metabolism involving RoxS-mediated positive and negative regulation could be developed from these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> is remarkable!).</p><p>Generally, the study is significant as much less is known about sRNA regulation in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> than in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> suite of ribonucleases is considerably different from that of <italic>E. coli</italic> – most notably the presence of a 5' exoribonuclease (RNase J1), an activity that is not known to exist in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Furthermore, RoxS and regulatory sequences controlling its expression are conserved in other Gram-positives; thus, the current findings are likely broadly applicable.</p><p>The article is well written and the majority of the conclusions are well supported by the data. However, in its current form, the study lacks some key experiments and would benefit from a more thorough quantification of the data. For orientation, the first part of this manuscript, i.e. the discovery of sRNA-mediated mRNA activation by blocking 5' exo decay, clearly constitute sufficient novelty to make this a strong candidate for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper. However, it needs to be better developed. The second part – translational control – is presently not convincing. The third part constitutes an important part, too, since it puts the activity of RoxS in physiological context.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Mapping of the 5’ extremity of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: While primer extension is an effective technology to map the 5' end of transcripts, it fails to determine the chemical nature of the 5' end. In other words, the determined 5' end might as well be that of a stable degradation intermediate. Differential 5' RACE experiments (see PMID: 8755555) would be one way to test this hypothesis. Alternatively, there seem to be ample published RNA-seq data for Bacillus for the authors; do they support this transcription start site? In addition, is the promoter conserved? In any case, this part on 5' end mapping seems rather confirmatory and doesn't deserve to be a main figure (move to the supplement).</p><p>2) Subsections “RoxS regulates <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA stability” and “RoxS blocks degradation of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA by RNase J1”: The control at the level of mRNA stability needs to be demonstrated more firmly. The authors should try to fully uncouple it from any translational control by using a non-translated 5' fragment of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA. This can be achieved by co-expression of RoxS with such a shorter RNA, perhaps as a fusion with an unrelated stable transcript. This has been done with other sRNAs that activate targets by increasing mRNA stability (SgrS, PMID:23582330; RydC, PMID:24141880). Such shorter fusion RNA target would also aid better mutational studies of the target.</p><p>3) Subsection “RoxS protects <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA from in vitro degradation by RNase J1”: The prediction that C-rich regions of RoxS are involved in base pairing with the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA comes out of the blue. Explain what's known about other RoxS-target interactions. Is the predicted target site in <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA supported by conservation at the nucleotide level?</p><p>4) Subsection “RoxS protects yflS mRNA from in vitro degradation by RNase J1”: Here and elsewhere, the predicted base pairing interaction remains to be more firmly demonstrated. Use compensatory base pair changes in sRNA and target, or show RNA structure probing data of both native and mutant variants of the RNA partners.</p><p>5) Subsection “RoxS also activates translation of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA”, second paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It is puzzling that the CCR1+3 variant of RoxS still affords an almost two-fold translational activation (30S binding) of the target, especially in light of the fact that i) wild-type RoxS manages a mere 3-fold activation in this assay, and that ii) the CCR3 mutation should nullify base pairing (according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This again demands a better definition of the RoxS-<italic>yflS</italic> RNA interaction in order to design more suitable mutants. Moreover, the 30S toeprint assay should include a second non-target mRNA to demonstrate that RoxS activity is specific.</p><p>6) Better quantification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: It would be useful to quantify and plot the intensities of the bands corresponding to the 94 nt <italic>yflS</italic> transcript and the bands corresponding to AMP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: the effect of RoxS on <italic>yflS</italic> in these experiments is approximately 2-fold, which probably presents the sum of transcript protection and translation activation. To discriminate the individual contributions of RoxS to this process, it would be useful to generate a <italic>yflS</italic> variant that is not translated (e.g. by mutating the start codon of the mRNA) and test the effect of RoxS on Northern Blots. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: Again, it would be useful to quantify the bands corresponding to RoxS in these experiments (e.g. by setting the 0 min time point to 100%). This would allow for a thorough comparison of RoxS expression across the presented experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23602.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Subsection “Mapping of the 5’ extremity of the yflS mRNA” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: While primer extension is an effective technology to map the 5' end of transcripts, it fails to determine the chemical nature of the 5' end.

As suggested, we moved this figure to the supplemental information section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Subsections “RoxS regulates yflS mRNA stability” and “RoxS blocks degradation of the yflS mRNA by RNase J1”: The control at the level of mRNA stability needs to be demonstrated more firmly.

However, the <italic>yflS<sup>mutTR</sup></italic> mRNA is still destabilized in absence of RoxS similar to the parental strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This result nicely confirms that RoxS can stabilise the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA independently of its effect on translation.</p><p><italic>3) Subsection “RoxS protects yflS mRNA from</italic> in vitro <italic>degradation by RNase J1”: The prediction that C-rich regions of RoxS are involved in base pairing with the yflS mRNA comes out of the blue. Explain what's known about other RoxS-target interactions.</italic></p><p>In a previous study, we showed that the C-rich region CRR3 of RoxS was involved in the interaction with the <italic>ppnkB</italic> mRNA target. We have better explained the rationale for focussing on the C-rich elements in the text (subsection “RoxS uses C-rich region 3 (CRR3) to interact with the extreme 5’-end of <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Is the predicted target site in yflS mRNA supported by conservation at the nucleotide level?</italic> </p><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and related bacteria have several di- and tri-carboxylate transporters homologous to YflS making it difficult to identify this particular transporter with certainty. For those examples where we can be relatively sure, because synteny is maintained, the 5'-UTR of <italic>yflS</italic> is highly conserved at the nucleotide level and, since the RoxS sRNA is identical to that of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in these organisms, the potential base-pairing with CRR3 of RoxS is maintained. A figure showing an alignment of these 5'-UTRs and the complementary section of RoxS is shown in the supplementary section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and a statement describing this conservation is included in the manuscript (subsection “Mapping of the 5’ extremity of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA”)</p><p><italic>4) Subsection “RoxS protects yflS mRNA from in vitro degradation by RNase J1”: Here and elsewhere, the predicted base pairing interaction remains to be more firmly demonstrated. Use compensatory base pair changes in sRNA and target, or show RNA structure probing data of both native and mutant variants of the RNA partners.</italic> </p><p>To confirm the base pairing prediction, we added 2 experiments to the paper.</p><p>In the first, we assayed the in vitro ability of RNase J1 to degrade mutant 5' fragments of the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA (<italic>yflS<sup>mut5'</sup></italic>), in which the predicted base-pairing with RoxS was disrupted and then restored with compensatory mutations in CRR3 (CRR3-2). In in vitro RNA degradation assays similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we show that mutant RoxS (CRR3-2) shows weaker protection of wt <italic>yflS</italic> transcripts from RNase J1. Similarly, wt RoxS shows weaker protection of <italic>yflS<sup>mut5'</sup></italic>, whereas when the RNAs bearing compensatory mutations are mixed (CRR3-2 and <italic>yflS<sup>mut5'</sup></italic>), protection from RNase J1 degradation is recovered. This result confirms that the RoxS CRR3 element is involved in binding to the 5’-end of the <italic>yflS</italic> RNA. These data are included in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We also probed the RoxS RNA secondary structure with RNase V1 and RNase T2 after addition of increasing concentrations of <italic>yflS</italic> RNA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). This experiment showed increased cleavages by RNase V1 near CRR3 and increased protection from RNase T2 between CRR2 and CRR3 of RoxS upon addition of <italic>yflS</italic>, but no protection at the CRR1 sequence.</p><p>Together, these experiments demonstrate convincingly that RoxS uses the CRR2-3 region as predicted to interact with the <italic>yflS</italic> mRNA.</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “RoxS also activates translation of the yflS mRNA”, second paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It is puzzling that the CCR1+3 variant of RoxS still affords an almost two-fold translational activation (30S binding) of the target, especially in light of the fact that i) wild-type RoxS manages a mere 3-fold activation in this assay, and that ii) the CCR3 mutation should nullify base pairing (according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This again demands a better definition of the RoxS-yflS RNA interaction in order to design more suitable mutants.</italic> </p><p>We have done the toeprint experiment three times and the quantification represents the average and error bars for these three experiments. Visually the result is always the same: the wt and the CRR1 mutant give a much stronger toeprint than either the CRR3 or CRR1+3 mutant and the apparent residual effect of these mutants, particularly CRR1+3, compared to the (-)RoxS control appears stronger in the quantification than to the eye. Furthermore, the U35 RT stop which is lost upon efficient RoxS binding to <italic>yflS</italic> (even in the absence of ribosomes e.g. lane 3) behaves as expected for the CRR3 or CRR1+3 mutants. We are confident that we have identified the correct base-pairing, particularly with the additional experiments provided (compensatory mutations, structure probing of RoxS). It is possible that since the base pairing extends into the CRR2 region (validated by RNase T2 structure probing of RoxS described above) that this is sufficient to account for the residual toe-print stimulation in vitro (it is unlikely to be sufficient in vivo in a more competitive environment). We have included a sentence stating that &quot;it is possible that the apparent residual effect of these mutants comes from the extended base-pairing around CRR2 in these in vitro experiments.&quot;</p><p><italic>Moreover, the 30S toeprint assay should include a second non-target mRNA to demonstrate that RoxS activity is specific.</italic> </p><p>RoxS specificity was demonstrated in a previous paper. In Durand et al. <italic>2015</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>),the toeprint experiment on the <italic>sucC</italic> mRNA shows that the full length of RoxS has strictly no impact on translation initiation of this mRNA.</p><p><italic>6) Better quantification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: It would be useful to quantify and plot the intensities of the bands corresponding to the 94 nt yflS transcript and the bands corresponding to AMP.</italic> </p><p>We have calculated the percent of AMP released compared to total signal (AMP + full-length transcript) and these graphs have been added to the Figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: the effect of RoxS on yflS in these experiments is approximately 2-fold, which probably presents the sum of transcript protection and translation activation.
