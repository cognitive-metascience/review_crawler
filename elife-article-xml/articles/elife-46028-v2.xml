Although the X-ray structures and overall arrangement of Gn and Gc on the hantavirus spikes are known, their detailed interactions are not. Here we show that the lateral contacts between spikes are mediated by the same 2-fold contacts observed in Gc crystals at neutral pH, allowing the engineering of disulfide bonds to cross-link spikes. Disrupting the observed dimer interface affects particle assembly and overall spike stability. We further show that the spikes display a temperature-dependent dynamic behavior at neutral pH, alternating between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ forms. We show that the open form exposes the Gc fusion loops but is off-pathway for productive Gc-induced membrane fusion and cell entry. These data also provide crucial new insights for the design of optimized Gn/Gc immunogens to elicit protective immune responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46028.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hantaviruses infect rodents and other small mammals, but do not harm them. When transmitted to humans, often through rodent urine, feces or saliva, they can cause serious and even fatal diseases. Currently, there are no known methods that effectively prevent hantavirus infections or treat the diseases that they cause.</p><p>During an infection, viruses invade the cells of their host. A hantavirus interacts with target cells through proteins on its surface called Gn and Gc glycoproteins. Previous work has shown that these glycoproteins are organized in bundles of four Gn and four Gc proteins, termed spikes, which project from the membrane that surrounds the virus. The Gc protein changes shape when it is activated and exposes a hidden region that can insert into the membrane of the target cell. The Gc proteins then change shape again to force the cell to fuse with the viral membrane. This process allows the virus to be taken up into the cell, where it can replicate.</p><p>While the structures of each viral glycoprotein have been determined in isolation, it was not known how they interact within the Gn/Gc spike. Such information is crucial to understand how the viruses infect cells and which areas are exposed to the immune system of the host – and so could be targeted by antiviral treatments.</p><p>Bignon et al. have now identified the molecular contacts that occur between spikes and interconnect them into a grid-like lattice on the surface of the virus. Genetically altering specific sections of the Gc glycoprotein strengthened or weakened these contacts, which correspondingly increased or decreased how stable the spike was. Preventing the contacts from forming resulted in cells releasing fewer virus-like particles.</p><p>Bignon et al. also show that at the body temperature of mammals, the shape of the spike fluctuates between an ‘open’ form that exposes the region of Gc that inserts into the cell membrane, and a ‘closed’ form that hides this region. However, when Gc is activated, the open form becomes unable to cause the viral and cell membranes to fuse together.</p><p>Together, the results presented by Bignon et al. help us to understand how changes to the hantavirus surface enable the virus to infect cells. This knowledge will help researchers to design vaccines that protect against hantavirus infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>envelope proteins</kwd><kwd>inter-spike interface</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>viral breathing</kwd><kwd><italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico FONDECYT 1181799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tischler</surname><given-names>Nicole D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programa de Apoyo a Centros con Financiamiento Basal 170004 to Fundación Ciencia and Vida</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tischler</surname><given-names>Nicole D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONDEQUIP EQM130092 for the improvement of BSL3 of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tischler</surname><given-names>Nicole D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labex IBEID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rey</surname><given-names>Félix A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labex IBEID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID 4E AAP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guardado-Calvo</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name><name><surname>Rey</surname><given-names>Félix A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infect-ERA IMI European network HantaHunt Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guardado-Calvo</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name><name><surname>Rey</surname><given-names>Félix A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico FONDECYT 3150695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albornoz</surname><given-names>Amelina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hantavirus spikes are related laterally by 2-fold Gc contacts that can be disulfide-linked and display a temperature-dependent dynamic behavior at neutral pH, exposing and masking the Gc fusion loops.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hantaviruses (order <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, family <italic>Hantaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Orthohantavirus</italic>) persistently infect rodents throughout the world. When transmitted to humans they can cause serious disease such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) with case fatalities up to 10% and 40%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger et al., 2015</xref>). Yet there are no efficient preventive nor therapeutic measures approved against these diseases. As other members of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order, their RNA genome is single stranded with negative polarity, composed of three segments. The medium (M) segment encodes a membrane-anchored polyprotein precursor GPC, which is processed by host cell signal peptidases to generate glyoproteins Gn and Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Löber et al., 2001</xref>). Virion-like particles (VLPs) are formed when GPC is expressed in the absence of other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuña et al., 2014</xref>), indicating an important role of the glycoproteins in virion budding and in cell exit of the progeny. Authentic virions and VLPs have been shown to project spikes organized in a square lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuña et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 1985</xref>). The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hepojoki et al. (2010)</xref> revealed that Gn/Gc species can be covalently crosslinked on the surface of virions and suggested oligomeric models for spike assembly based on the characterization of detergent-solubilized spikes. Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) data revealed spikes with volumes that can accommodate the molecular mass of (Gn/Gc)<sub>4</sub> hetero-octamers, related by 2-fold symmetry axes oriented radially in the particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battisti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huiskonen et al., 2010</xref>). A higher resolution 15.6 Å cryo-ET map allowed the docking of the Gn ectodomain into the central lobes on the tetrameric spike, at the membrane distal side, and masking the Gc fusion loops, suggesting that the 2-fold related spike-spike interactions are made by the Gc moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a central role of Gn in self-association to form spikes has recently been confirmed by number and brightness analysis in single live cells showing that separate Gn expression allows detection of Gn oligomers while separate Gc expression predominantly leads to Gc monomers and some Gc dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sperber et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The Gn/Gc spikes on the viral surface are key in directing entry into new cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cifuentes-Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>). Hantavirus cell entry occurs by the interaction of the envelope glycoproteins with host cell receptors, which leads to viral uptake into endosomes. Cell entry is completed when Gc induces the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuña et al., 2015</xref>). Structure-function studies have also confirmed that Gc is a class II fusion protein, and have provided insight into its fusogenic conformational change triggered by low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barriga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tischler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willensky et al., 2016</xref>). This irreversible structural rearrangement of Gc into a stable post-fusion trimer involves several steps, including the initial exposure of the Gc fusion loops, which then insert into the target cell membrane via an extended trimeric intermediate. The individual Gc trimer subunits then adopt a ‘hairpin’ conformation that forces apposition of viral and cellular membranes, to allow the bilayers to fuse. On the virion, the Gn and Gc residues involved in intra- and inter-spike interactions have not been identified. These interactions control the fusion activity of Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guardado-Calvo and Rey, 2017</xref>), by maintaining it at neutral pH in a functional metastable conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that the 2-fold Gc:Gc contacts between adjacent (Gn/Gc)<sub>4</sub> spikes at the surface of the hantavirus particles are mediated by the same interface observed in a crystallographic dimer revealed by the available X-ray structure of Gc in a pre-fusion form. These contacts regulate viral assembly together with spike stability and subsequent disassembly for entry. We further demonstrate that at physiological temperature, the spikes exhibit a dynamic temperature-dependent equilibrium between a ‘closed’ form in which the fusion peptides are masked by Gn, and an ‘open’ form that allows the particle to bind to liposomes at neutral pH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineering of an inter-spike disulfide bond based on the crystallographic Gc dimer</title><p>The X-ray structure of the Hantaan virus Gc ectodomain at neutral pH (PDB: 5LJY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>) revealed a pre-fusion monomer which, among other crystal contacts, presented two Gc molecules packing about a crystallographic 2-fold axis.

We surveyed residues facing each other across the crystallographic Gc dimer interface with Cα-Cα distances ranging between 4 and 10 Å and selected the highly conserved His303 and Gly187 for single cysteine substitutions. These residues face their counterpart on the 2-fold axis of the crystallographic dimer with Cα-Cα distances of 8.4 Å (His303-His303) and 5.6 Å (Gly187-Gly187) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Because the Gc:Gc interface residues are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the observed contacts made by Hantaan virus Gc should be maintained in all hantaviruses. We therefore turned to an Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein expression and VLP producer system for the functional experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuña et al., 2014</xref>), which has the advantage of corroboration of ANDV VLP data with authentic ANDV, which we can manipulate. We tested ANDV mutant Gn/Gc constructs having either the Gc H303C or the G187C substitutions (the amino acid sequence numbering is the same between Andes and Hantaan virus Gc) for protein production in 293FT cells, surveyed their transport to the plasma membrane as a measure for proper protein folding, and monitored their assembly into VLPs released in the cells’ supernatant. We found that the cysteine mutants were properly expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We next analyzed the presence of VLPs in the concentrated cells’ supernatant by reducing and non-reducing SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blot. The wild type Gc migrated as a monomer under both conditions, while the Gc cysteine mutants migrated predominantly with a molecular mass of ~100 kDa, corresponding to Gc dimers, under non-reducing conditions. In the presence of a reducing agent, these Gc dimers were readily dissociated to monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Together, these results confirm, in a biological context, that the residues forming the Gc dimer contacts in the X-ray structure of a pre-fusion form of Gc are proximal enough to each other on viral particles to allow for disulfide formation while still forming VLPs, thereby supporting the biological relevance of the crystallographic Gc dimer. Furthermore, when comparing the yields of VLP production, the G187C mutant resulted in higher production levels than H303C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This result correlates with the better geometry and distances between the Cα atoms in the crystallographic Gc dimer for G187C compared to H303C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>We compared the spikes of the G187C mutant VLPs to the wild type VLPs in terms of their migration profile in blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) combined with western blotting upon detergent-solubilization of the spikes. When we incubated Andes VLPs bearing wild type (Gn/Gc)<sub>4</sub> spikes at 20˚C and neutral pH, the detergent-solubilized spike was identified as a single band recognized by both, anti-Gn and anti-Gc MAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This band, corresponding to a molecular weight of ~500 kDa matching a (Gn/Gc)<sub>4</sub> spike, migrated roughly as expected in BN-PAGE, given the migration of the individual Gn and Gc monomers (see migration at 50˚C), of the Gc post-fusion homotrimer (see migration at acidic pH), and of the standard reference bands at 480 and 720 kDa. In contrast, in the detergent-solubilized G187C VLPs the band containing both, Gn and Gc, barely entered the gel at temperatures up to 40˚C, indicating a high molecular mass, as expected if a disulfide bond interconnects multiple adjacent spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46028.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The covalent Gc:Gc dimer disulfide bond G187C increases Gn/Gc spike stability.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Representative BN-PAGE and western blotting of ANDV wild type (<bold>a</bold>) and G187C mutant spikes (<bold>b</bold>).

No signal for Gn was detected when treated at low pH, suggesting that either the mAb may not react with Gn in native gels when forming a more compact tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rissanen et al., 2017</xref>), or that Gn may not enter the native gels.

The three other mutants were either not detected by western blot (E26A) or led to the expression of truncated versions of the protein (30 kDa) in 293FT and Vero E6 producer cells (R301A and H303A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and 1e</xref>).

The absence of intermediate Gn/Gc dissociation products suggested a two-state behavior, in a highly cooperative spike dissociation process. Quantification of the temperature-induced dissociation of the detergent-solubilized wild type ANDV Gn/Gc spike revealed a melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of 37.7 ± 0.4°C. In comparison, the Gn/Gc band of the G187C VLPs did not dissociate into homooligomeric Gn or Gc species up to temperatures of 45°C, revealing a 10˚C increase of its T<sub>m</sub> to 48°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The dissociated Gc species migrated to a further distance than the band corresponding to a wild type Gc homotrimer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, right panel), in line with the expected migration of a disulfide-linked Gc dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

In the case of the H303F mutant, the T<sub>m</sub> dropped by 7˚C. This more important effect in the thermostability of H303F may be explained by the fact that the phenylalanine side chain is bulkier than that of histidine, hence forcing the Gc protomers to re-accommodate to the change and affect the overall Gc:Gc interaction. Together, these data suggest that the intra-spike Gn/Gc interactions are affected by the lateral inter-spike Gc:Gc contact by allostery; when the Gc:Gc contacts are strengthened by a disulfide bond the T<sub>m</sub> of the Gn/Gc spike raise, and lower the spike T<sub>m</sub> when the Gc:Gc contacts are weakened.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Residues at the inter-spike Gc:Gc contacts affect the pH-triggered fusion activation</title><p>We also monitored the effect of mutations at the Gc:Gc inter-spike interface on the pH required for spike activation for membrane fusion.

For this purpose, we mixed fluorescently labeled liposomes with the VLPs at each pH, and loaded the mixture to the bottom of a sucrose step gradient. After centrifugation, we monitored each fraction for the presence of liposomes (by fluorescence) and VLPs (by western blot against Gc). At pH 6.2, the liposomes migrated to the top of the gradient while the wild type VLPs remained in the bottom fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), but increasing amounts of the VLPs were observed in the top fractions at more acidic pHs, depending on the mutant. The D28A mutant began to float at pH 6.2, 0.2 units higher compared to wild type VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Contrary to E26Q, mutant D28A is inactive in syncytia formation. The X-ray structures show that Asp28 not only contributes to the Gc dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), but its side chain is also involved in a network of inter-subunit polar interactions stabilizing the post-fusion Gc trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>). Again, in this mutant, like in E26Q, the destabilization of the Gc dimer interaction caused fusion activation at a less acidic pH. And the destabilization of the post-fusion D28A Gc trimer likely renders it incompetent for inducing fusion, unlike E26Q.</p><p>When we analyzed the H303F mutant for pH-induced liposome coflotation, we found that it was more resistant to activation and required a 0.2 units lower pH for fusion activation compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), opposite to the effect of the E26Q and D28A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>). Hence, although this mutation led to considerable destabilization of the spike in terms of its thermal resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), it turned out to be more resistant to acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Taking into account that the His303 imidazole rings face each other across the interface with a distance of 4.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), they very likely undergo a strong electrostatic repulsion upon protonation at acidic pH. Thus, when His303 is substituted by phenylalanine, this effect does not occur, and additional residues elsewhere must become protonated in order to trigger spike dissociation and fusion. Given that the H303F mutant was fusion inactive at any tested pH, the His303 role in fusion remains to be understood. Together, from these data we conclude that the hantavirus lateral inter-spike Gc:Gc interactions indirectly control spike stability, influencing at the same time Gn/Gc dissociation to induce membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Temperature-induced Gc fusion loop exposure on VLPs at neutral pH</title><p>Previous data on the hantavirus spike organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>) – and that of other class II enveloped viruses such as alphaviruses and phleboviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guardado-Calvo and Rey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halldorsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Voss et al., 2010</xref>) – suggest that Gn conceals the Gc fusion loops at the top of the spikes, keeping them from premature membrane insertion until exposure to low pH. We hypothesized that the temperature-induced Gn/Gc dissociation observed by BN-PAGE could reflect a conformational change within the spike, which would lead to a looser interaction between Gn and Gc at the VLP surface. The lateral inter-spike interaction - absent in the detergent-solubilized spikes - may restrain full dissociation of Gn and Gc on VLPs, and the Gn/Gc dissociation observed by BN-PAGE may reflect a temperature-induced transition of the spike into a state in which the fusion loops become exposed at the top of the hantavirus surface at neutral pH. To test this notion, we incubated wild type Andes VLPs with liposomes at pH 7.4 at different temperatures and assayed them in the VLP/liposome coflotation assay. When the incubation was performed at temperatures in the range from 20°C to 30°C, we found the fluorescence-labeled liposomes at the top of the gradient while the VLPs remained in the bottom fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), confirming previous data that VLPs and liposomes do not interact under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuña et al., 2015</xref>). However, when increasing the temperature to 37°C and above, we observed that at neutral pH ANDV particles floated with liposomes to the upper fractions, increasing gradually with temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

In contrast to wild type, high temperature treatment of the fusion loop mutant VLPs up to 50°C at pH 7.4 did not lead to flotation with liposomes to the upper fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), indicating that both, the acid-pH-induced and the temperature-induced interaction of VLPs with liposomes, were specifically driven by the Gc fusion loops. In contrast, treatment at 56˚C resulted in flotation of the fusion loop mutant with the liposomes, indicative of non-specific interactions with membranes likely due to partial protein denaturation and concomitant exposure of hydrophobic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46028.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Temperature-induced Gc fusion loop exposure.</title><p>(<bold>a-b</bold>) Liposome coflotation assay to visualize temperature-induced membrane interaction of ANDV wild type (WT) VLPs (<bold>a</bold>) or ANDV VLPs bearing the Gc fusion loop mutant W115A/F250A (<bold>b</bold>).

For this purpose, we labeled Andes VLPs with octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) and incubated them with liposomes. We observed R18 dequenching upon dropping the pH to 5.5, which indicated lipid mixing between the labeled VLPs and the unlabeled liposomes, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>). In turn, when we first incubated the Andes VLPs at 50˚C and then mixed them with liposomes at acidic pH, we detected no lipid mixing, confirming the infectivity results obtained with authentic ANDV. We further tested whether the fusion activity could be restored when the 50°C-treated VLPs were incubated for 1 h at 4˚C and then subjected to liposome fusion assays at acidic pH. Under these conditions, we found that the VLP-liposome fusion activity was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), again in line with the reversibility of the closed-to-open states transition and the virus infection results.</p><p>To test the validity of our observation across hantaviruses, we produced Sin Nombre VLPs as well as Hantaan VLPs and labeled them with R18. The labeled VLPs gave a clear lipid mixing signal upon acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–e</xref>), which was lost upon treatment at 50˚C, as observed with Andes VLPs. When the 50°C-treated Sin Nombre or Hantaan VLPs were allowed to recover for 1 h at 4˚C, they fully restored lipid mixing activity when incubated with liposomes at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–e</xref>). Hence, these data suggest that the temperature-induced fusion loop exposure and reversible reduction of fusion activity is not an ANDV specificity but a property shared by hantaviruses in general.</p><p>To understand the molecular basis of the drop in viral infectivity and membrane fusion after treatment of hantavirus particles at high temperature, we tested whether the temperature treatment would still allow for Gc homo-trimerization towards the post-fusion form, as a measure of an early step in the virus-cell fusion mechanism. We thus incubated Andes VLPs at different temperatures and assayed them for low-pH induced Gc trimerization by sedimentation on a sucrose gradient. As expected, this method allowed the detection of Gc running as monomer at pH 7.4 and homotrimer at pH 5.5 when using untreated VLPs. But when we pre-treated the VLPs at 50°C and then incubated them at pH 5.5, we found Gc migrating predominantly as monomer. The temperature-treatment of the VLPs thus resulted in a form of Gc unable to undergo trimerization at acidic pH to induce membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). When VLPs incubated at 50˚C were back-treated for 1 h at 4˚C and then incubated at pH 5.5, we found Gc again sedimenting as homotrimer, confirming the reversibility of the effect. This result indicates that in the open spike Gc is maintained in a form that cannot react to low pH by undergoing the fusogenic conformational change. Only when the spikes were allowed to adopt the closed conformation, they re-acquired the capacity to respond to low pH by allowing Gc homotrimerization to induce membrane fusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have addressed the surface organization of pleomorphic hantavirus particles. By combining structural, biochemical and functional analyses, we revealed the molecular interface by which individual (Gn/Gc)<sub>4</sub> hetero-octameric spikes associate laterally via 2-fold related Gc:Gc contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) akin to the contacts observed in alphavirus particles, and that an inter-spike disulfide bond across a 2-fold related Gc:Gc dimer interface improved the overall spike stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). An assembly model in which 2-fold Gc contacts relate individual (Gn/Gc)<sub>4</sub> spikes is consistent with electron microscopy observations showing a continuous surface lattice of spikes that interact sidewise to form a grid-like pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battisti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huiskonen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 1985</xref>) and with molecular assembly models proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hepojoki et al., 2010</xref>). Contrary to the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hepojoki et al. (2010)</xref> suggesting that Gc is mostly dimeric when solubilized from spikes, this and previous work show that Gc is monomeric when solubilized from viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuña et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barriga et al., 2016</xref>) or when recombinantly expressed in the absence of the transmembrane segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willensky et al., 2016</xref>). These observations are consistent with the small Gc:Gc contact patch, which appears too weak to maintain Gc dimers in solution. Similarly, membrane-anchored Gc expression in the absence of Gn was predominantly monomeric in live cells, although some Gc dimers were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sperber et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that Gc anchoring in the context of lateral inter-spike constrains may be required for efficient Gc:Gc association. The residues involved in Gc:Gc contacts are highly conserved across hantaviruses in general, suggesting that our results can be extended to viruses across the mammal-infecting branch of the <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results also show that mutation to residues that interfere with interface contacts significantly decrease virus particle production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), implying a role for these contact residues in viral assembly by connecting spikes laterally, building the viral surface lattices. Because hantaviruses do not have a matrix protein to induce membrane curvature, as do most of the other enveloped RNA viruses, the Gc:Gc contacts driving lateral interactions between spikes on the membrane are likely to play an important role in virion budding.</p><p>In spite of the unique four-fold symmetry of the hantavirus spikes, their overall arrangement on the particles has clear similarities to that of other class II enveloped viruses, such as alphaviruses, which display 3-fold symmetric spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lescar et al., 2001</xref>). The inter-spike contact area of ~500 Å<sup>2</sup> of the 2-fold related hantavirus Gc:Gc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016</xref>) and alphavirus E1:E1 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roussel et al., 2006</xref>) include a highly conserved His residue at the center the dimer interface; Gc His303 and E1 His125. Their substitution decreases the pH threshold for acid-induced activation in hantaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and in alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qin et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting in both cases that inter-spike dissociation is driven by repulsion upon protonation.</p><p>The results reported here have also revealed that the hantavirus spikes exhibit a dynamic equilibrium between closed and open forms, with the latter exposing the Gc fusion loops at physiological temperatures even at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We found that at 37°C - the physiological temperature of its rodent hosts – about 50% of the Andes VLPs bound to liposomes via Gc fusion loop exposure. The steep sigmoidal curve of liposome binding and detergent-solubilized spike dissociation as a function of temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) suggests a strongly cooperative effect. A possible explanation for these observations can be provided by assuming that the spikes change conformation intermittently, in a stochastic fashion, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46028.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hantavirus Gn/Gc spike dynamics and Gc conformational changes.</title><p>Diagrammatic representation of ‘breathing’ spikes. (<bold>a</bold>) The Gn ectodomain is represented in gray and Gc in colors: red for domain I; yellow domain II; blue domain III; stem and transmembrane (TM) segment magenta.

It is therefore possible that the observed reversibility of fusion loop exposure is related to the absence of irreversible proteolytic priming for fusion. Some mechanism must ensure, however, that Gc escapes from undergoing a premature irreversible conformational change triggered by the low pH environment of the exocytosis pathway of the cell, a mechanism that awaits to be discovered.</p><p>Our observation that hantavirus particles with spikes in the open form are not capable of inducing low-pH triggered membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–e</xref>) correlates with the inability of Gc in these particles to form homotrimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>), suggesting that low pH treatment in the presence of multiple spikes in the open form engages Gc in non-functional interactions with itself from adjacent spikes, such that it cannot reach its trimeric post-fusion form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). There appears, however, to be a thin divide between the open conformation of the particles (around 50°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) which allows recovery of their fusogenicity by returning to the ground state (i.e., a closed particle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), and an irreversible state in which they cannot recover it (i.e., treatment to 56°C) likely involving partial protein denaturation and aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7e</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5c</xref> show that at room temperature the VLPs appear to be essentially in the closed form, where no flotation with liposomes is observed. This suggests that the stability of the infectious particle is much higher in the external environment, contributing to their propagation in nature. Within a mammalian host, there would be a much more rapid particle turnover. This notion is in line with previous data showing that hantaviruses are highly labile at 37°C, while displaying prolonged infectivity outside a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kallio et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that the dynamic spike behavior at 37°C results from adaptation to their rodent hosts, providing advantages for establishing chronical infections; on the one hand the major lability of hantaviruses at 37°C may help to restrict their dissemination within the host by decreasing the time window for viral spread, while on the other hand the conformational diversity may represent an important decoy for escape from the hosts´ immune response. Furthermore, the observed dynamic behavior of the spikes is likely important for virus infectivity. In contrast to liposomes, the plasma membrane is a crowded environment with multiple proteins and glycosaminoglycans, and whether fusion loop exposure can already allow for particle binding to cells is an open question. It could take place, for instance, after binding to a protein receptor (such as β<sub>3</sub>α<sub>V</sub> integrins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gavrilovskaya et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jangra et al., 2018</xref>) that could bring the hantavirus surface into proximity of a patch of naked membrane before its uptake by endocytosis. At any rate, at 37°C there should be enough spikes in the closed conformation on the virion to allow for productive fusion once in the acidic environment of the endosomes.</p><p>Similar conformational dynamics have been observed for a number of unrelated viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heyrana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munro et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown that a similar dynamic behavior of dengue virus particles elicits highly cross-reactive but poorly neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved but cryptic fusion loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beltramello et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliphant et al., 2006</xref>). These antibodies are believed to be responsible for antibody-dependent enhancement of the infection, which is the main obstacle to developing an efficient vaccine against dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rey et al., 2018</xref>). The observed dynamic behavior of the hantavirus particles described here can have therefore an important impact in the development of suitable immunogens capable to confer protection against these pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graham, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kotecha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McLellan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rey and Lok, 2018</xref>). Our data thus suggest the possibility of designing a subunit vaccine that exposes an inert ‘closed spike’ conformation only would elicit the strongest antibody response, similar to the closed form of the HIV Env trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Torrents de la Peña et al., 2017</xref>).

Briefly, VLP samples harvested from pI.18/GPC wild type or the different mutant constructs were incubated with Coomassie G-250 0.25% and Triton X-100 0.5% for 15 min at different temperatures just before loading onto a 3–16% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The native gel electrophoresis was run at 130 mV for 15 h at 4°C. The buffering system was 200 mM Tris for anode buffer and 50 mM Tris, 100 mM glycine cathode buffer. The size of Gn and Gc species was estimated using the migration rate of a molecular standard (Native Mark Unstained Protein Standard, Invitrogen) which was independently stained. The rest of the gel was incubated in transfer buffer at room temperature. After the transfer, the nitrocellulose was blocked in PBS including 5% skim milk and next Gn and Gc glycoproteins were stained separately by using anti-Gn MAb 6B9/F5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cifuentes-Muñoz et al., 2010</xref>) and anti-Gc MAb 2H4/F6 or 5D11/G7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Godoy et al., 2009</xref>) at a 1:2500 dilution each. Primary antibody staining was detected as described above. For the quantification of the Gn/Gc spike dissociation, the densitometry values of dissociated Gc (monomeric or dimeric Gc) were divided by the densitometry values of the total signal for Gc, using the ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Guided by structural information, Bignon and colleagues subjected the Andes virus (ANDV) Gn/Gc spike to mutagenic analysis in order to identify Gc residues important for contact between spikes. They show that the interface between two Gc proteins in their pre-fusion form, as detected previously by crystallography, is the same one that mediates Gc:Gc contacts between adjacent spikes on the virion surface. Specifically, they demonstrate that disulfide bonds can be formed between certain residues located at this interface and that an intact interface is required for assembly of virus-like particles. Moreover, residues located at the interface are shown to affect spike stability and responsiveness to low pH. Finally, they demonstrate that the fusion loop in Gc can be reversibly exposed at elevated temperatures – the spike transits between an open and a closed form – and that the open form is not compatible with low pH induced membrane fusion activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three referees agree that the study is of interest and that the study provides reasonably solid experimental support for the hypothesis that the Gc:Gc intermolecular contacts observed in the crystal structure of Hantaan virus Gc represent physiologically relevant intermolecular contacts that contribute to the assembly and stability of hantavirus particles. Moreover, the observations that thermal destabilization of Andes virus or VLPs from other hantaviruses causes a conformational change that exposes the fusion loop and inhibits low pH-dependent cell entry will be interest to researchers studying hantaviruses and potential treatments or vaccines against them. However, for the study to be acceptable the following points need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the Gc:Gc dimer interface is &quot;required for VLP assembly&quot; (subsection “The inter-spike Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly”). However, in Figure 3, seven of the eleven Gc:Gc interface mutants tested positive for Gc in the &quot;VLP&quot; cell supernatant fraction, indicating that these mutants can still form VLPs. When corrected for actin expression, the expression of Gc in these mutants does not appear significantly impaired, contrary to the authors' claim. Thus, in order to substantiate the author's conclusions, immunoblots should be quantified and averages +/- SD should be presented. Additionally, of the four mutants that failed to generate VLPs, three showed no Gc expression at all, indicating that the mutations prevented Gc expression and/or folding rather than VLP assembly per se, as claimed in subsection “The inter-spike Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly”. Only one mutant, H303E, was expressed in cells but did not produce VLPs. Hence the claim that &quot;Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly&quot; is unconvincing and not supported by the data presented. The authors should remove this claim (and related claims) perhaps replacing it with &quot;…contacts are required for Gn/Gc assembly, or glycoprotein spike assembly&quot;.</p><p>Alternatively, the authors would need to provide additional evidence to support their original claims, such as one or more pairs of interacting charge reversal mutations that rescue VLP assembly whereas each individual charge reversal mutation from one any one pair is deficient for VLP assembly but not for Gc expression in cells.</p><p>2) Discussion of the results and representation of the literature:</p><p>In the Introduction the authors quite sparsely cite studies by other groups, and in the Discussion previous knowledge and hypotheses by other groups are not appropriately considered. For instance, the authors do not discuss the findings presented in Hepojoki et al. (2010), especially since it contains studies on covalent bonding between hantavirus glycoproteins. In addition to the work by other groups mentioned in the introduction, the authors may consider a recent paper by Sperber et al. (2019). Also, it is unclear why the authors did not present Gc docked into the 3D structure of the spike complex (which is available from database). Does this mean that the Gc crystal structure does not fit into the spike structure, and if so, is the orientation of the domains in respect to each other as the author claim? Generally, the authors may expand the Discussion to put the results in perspective regarding previous studies and focus more on hantaviruses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46028.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the Gc:Gc dimer interface is &quot;required for VLP assembly&quot; (subsection “The inter-spike Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly”).

We have now included the quantification of the immunoblots +/- SD for VLP release into the cell supernatant including statistical analyses (revised Figure 3A). In this figure, the amounts of VLP release of each mutant can now be compared with the corresponding signal for wild type VLPs. To ensure equal amounts of properly folded GPC for VLP release, the amount of cell surface accumulation equivalent to wild type GPC was adjusted by the amount of GPC encoding plasmid used for transfection. The corresponding western blots have been moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 1. As can be seen, each experiment includes different mutants together with the wild type as a control (used to normalize the signal for VLP release to 100%). A significant decrease of VLP assembly can be observed in the case of the alanine mutant D28A and opposite charge mutants (revised Figure 3A) while maintaining their trafficking to the plasma membrane (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D). In the cellular fraction, equal amounts of proteins in of cellular fraction loaded in each lane of the western blots were normalized by total protein quantification. Anti-β-actin was only used to detect plasma membrane integrity, as cytosolic protein control. All corresponding modifications have been introduced throughout the text (Results section and Materials and methods section) and the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, of the four mutants that failed to generate VLPs, three showed no Gc expression at all, indicating that the mutations prevented Gc expression and/or folding rather than VLP assembly per se, as claimed in subsection “The inter-spike Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly”.

To ease the interpretation of the results, in the revised Figure 3A we now only show VLP release of those mutants that were properly expressed and reached the plasma membrane. The original western blots indicating expression/folding and VLP release of all mutants have been moved to Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hence the claim that &quot;Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly&quot; is unconvincing and not supported by the data presented.

But the reviewer’s remark make us realize that we were not clear enough in the original version of the manuscript. Our data clearly shows that substitutions by alanine or by residues bearing opposite charges, significantly decreases VLP assembly compared to wild type (please see graph of revised Figure 3A). Based on the helpful reviewer’s suggestions to quantify our data, and to remove mutants from the analysis that are not properly expressed, we believe that Figure 3A now is clearer in showing that “inter-spike Gc dimer contacts are required for VLP assembly”. The revised text was accordingly adjusted, explaining the results better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the authors would need to provide additional evidence to support their original claims, such as one or more pairs of interacting charge reversal mutations that rescue VLP assembly whereas each individual charge reversal mutation from one any one pair is deficient for VLP assembly but not for Gc expression in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that charge reversal of pairs of interacting residues rescuing VLP formation would be a nice validation of our model. However, such experiments would take a lot of time, and we have shown here that engineering a cysteine residue at position G187 leads to disulfide crosslinked spikes, as expected if the dimer interface displayed in Figure 1B is the one relating two spikes. In our view, the disulfide bond is already a very strong evidence, and the additional mutagenesis only corroborates this result, by indicating that mutation of the other residues displayed in Figure 1B impacts the ease with which VLPs are formed. In other words, we agree the results reported in this session (Figure 3A) alone are not convincing evidence that this is the dimer interface, but in combination to the disulfide bond explained in the previous section (Figure 1 and Figure 2), they are. We therefore believe that the additional experiments suggested are not necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discussion of the results and representation of the literature:</p><p>In the Introduction the authors quite sparsely cite studies by other groups, and in the Discussion previous knowledge and hypotheses by other groups are not appropriately considered. For instance, the authors do not discuss the findings presented in Hepojoki et al. (2010), especially since it contains studies on covalent bonding between hantavirus glycoproteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We had cited the work of Hepojoki et al. (2010) in the Introduction of the original submission. To address this comment, we have now better highlighted the major findings of that paper in the revised Introduction:</p><p>“The work of Hepojoki et al. (2010) revealed that Gn/Gc species can be covalently crosslinked on the surface of virions and suggested oligomeric models for spike assembly based on the characterization of detergent-solubilized spikes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the work by other groups mentioned in the introduction, the authors may consider a recent paper by Sperber et al. (2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this very recent paper in the Introduction of our manuscript as follows:</p><p>“In this line, a central role of Gn in self-association has recently been confirmed by number and brightness analysis in live, single cells showing that separate Gn expression allows detection of Gn oligomers while separate Gc expression predominantly leads to Gc monomers and some Gc dimers (Sperber et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is unclear why the authors did not present Gc docked into the 3D structure of the spike complex (which is available from database). Does this mean that the Gc crystal structure does not fit into the spike structure, and if so, is the orientation of the domains in respect to each other as the author claim?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this issue. In our paper, we limit ourselves to the functional validation of the data observed in the crystallographic structure. Although crystal packing contacts have to be taken with caution, our data are further supported by the structural homology of Gc with alphavirus spikes, which interact in a similar way via the glycoprotein E1. Crystal contacts have also been shown to be valid in other cases, such as the Ebola virus matrix protein, where contacts about a crystallographic 2-fold axis were later found to be indeed involved in particle assembly (Bornholdt et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally, the authors may expand the Discussion to put the results in perspective regarding previous studies and focus more on hantaviruses.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included additional discussion of our results concerning the biochemical approach in the field (Hepojoki et al., 2010) and hantavirus infectivity in dependence of time and temperature (Kallio et al., 2006). The discussion also includes comparison with structural information (Battisti et al., 2011; Guardado-Calvo et al., 2016; Husikonen et al., 2011; Martin et al., 1985; Shi et al., 2016; Willensky et al., 2016), functional approaches (Acuña et al., 2015; Barriga et al., 2016) and cell entry studies (Choi et al., 2008; Gavrilovskaya et al., 1998; Jangra et al., 2018). We believe that this literature comprises the most relevant previous hantavirus studies related to this work. Given the similarity of hantaviruses to other viruses with class II fusion proteins or with viruses with a highly dynamic surface behavior, the comparison with those additional models is properly justified and helps drawing of future directions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
