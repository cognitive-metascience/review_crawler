However, the initial formation of taste buds is proposed to be nerve-independent in amphibians, and evidence to the contrary in mammals has been endlessly debated, mostly due to indirect and incomplete means to impede innervation during the protracted perinatal period of taste bud differentiation.

They sense nutrients in the oral cavity and transmit taste information to the termini of sensory neurons, through conventional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finger et al., 2005</xref>) and non-conventional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romanov et al., 2018</xref>) synapses. Taste receptors and their support cells have a limited life span of 8 to 20 days depending on cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perea-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) and are constantly renewed from progenitors situated outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okubo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohmoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perea-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) and, for a small minority, inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perea-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) (and references therein) the taste bud. This process depends on the sensory afferents as demonstrated by the degeneration and regeneration of taste buds triggered, respectively, by the degeneration and regeneration of their surgically severed nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oakley and Witt, 2004</xref>). While nerve-dependency has been uncontroversial for more than a century concerning the maintenance of taste buds in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobson, 1991</xref>), it is still debated concerning their initial development in the embryo. Mature taste buds have been observed to form in the absence of nerves in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlow et al., 1996</xref>). In mammals, the case for nerve-dependency of taste bud development was mostly made through genetic invalidations of neurotrophins or their receptors, which hamper, to various extents, the outgrowth of sensory afferents towards the taste buds and simultaneously entail large losses of taste buds on the tongue at postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oakley and Witt, 2004</xref>). However, the protracted development of lingual taste buds, most of which mature after birth, left open the possibility that their postnatal loss reflected a failure of ‘maintenance’ or ‘maturation’ after a process of nerve-independent embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow and Northcutt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kapsimali and Barlow, 2013</xref>). To resolve this decades-old controversy, we completely blocked sensory innervation of the oral cavity in mouse by genetically preventing the birth of cranial sensory neurons, and examined the formation of taste buds — including palatal ones, whose development is almost entirely embryonic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Taste organs (taste papillae and their resident taste buds) of the anterior tongue and soft palate are innervated by somatic sensory neurons (for touch and pain) located in the trigeminal ganglion and visceral sensory neurons (for taste) located in the geniculate ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2012</xref>). The circumvallate papilla receives innervation from visceral sensory neurons in the distal (petrosal) ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve, while its somatosensory ones, projecting in the same nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank, 1991</xref>) (and references therein) are probably located in the proximal (‘superior’) ganglion. To suppress innervation of taste organs, we exploited the developmental dependency of cranial sensory neurons on the proneural transcription factors <italic>Neurog1</italic> and <italic>Neurog2</italic>. As early as day 9.5 of embryonic development (E9.5), the knockout of <italic>Neurog1</italic> blocks neuronal differentiation in the trigeminal, superior and jugular ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 1998</xref>) which harbor somatic sensory neurons. Inactivation of its paralogue <italic>Neurog2</italic>, expressed in epibranchial placodes, blocks the formation of the geniculate and petrosal ganglia, which harbor visceral sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fode et al., 1998</xref>). In each single <italic>Neurog1</italic> and <italic>Neurog2</italic> knockout at E16.5, the epithelium of the tongue and of the soft palate retained nerve fascicles at regularly spaced locations (corresponding to the taste organs) from, presumably, visceral or somatic sensory fibers, respectively (which thus navigate to their target independently of each other) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In double <italic>Neurog1/Neurog2</italic> knockouts, which lose all sensory innervation of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Espinosa-Medina et al., 2014</xref>), all nerve fibers had disappeared from the epithelium and underlying lamina propria of the palate and tongue, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Taste organs differentiate from taste placodes, specialized patches of the oral epithelium, thickened by apico-basal elongation of the cells, which transform into dome-shaped papillae with a mesenchymal core — most dramatically at the site of the single circumvallate papilla, on a smaller scale for fungiform papillae of the tongue, and also in the palate albeit less conspicuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rashwan et al., 2016</xref>) — and express a number of markers. Expression of the signaling molecule <italic>sonic hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh)</italic>, after a diffuse phase throughout the oral epithelium, resolves around E12.5 into a punctate pattern corresponding to taste placodes, which also start expressing <italic>Prox1</italic> and high levels of <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thirumangalathu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakayama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okubo et al., 2006</xref>). Two days later, <italic>Shh</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Prox1</italic> were still expressed in the same pattern in the placodes — by then about to become papillae (hereafter placodes/papillae) — (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the transcription factors <italic>Ascl1</italic> and <italic>Hes6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seta et al., 2003</xref>) were switched on in just a few cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All these markers were expressed in a normal pattern in the soft palate and anterior tongue of double <italic>Neurog1/2</italic> knockouts at E14.5, except for <italic>Sox2</italic> whose expression was stronger and expanded in the palate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Expression of these markers was not restricted to taste placodes/papillae but also occurred in the incipient ridges (rugae) of the hard palate (which never give rise to taste buds) and this expression was also essentially unchanged in <italic>Neurog1/2</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>). Between E14.5 and E16.5, a cluster of cells in each taste papilla or ruga had switched on <italic>cytokeratine 8</italic> (<italic>CK8</italic>) in both wild type and <italic>Neurog1/2</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, fungiform and palatal taste papillae (whose morphology and, as we show here, gene expression program are similar to that of palatal rugae) are epithelial specializations that form in the absence of any nerve, in agreement with prior observations of fungiform placodes/papillae development in cultured tongue explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farbman and Mbiene, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mbiene et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall et al., 2003</xref>). The single circumvallate papilla of the posterior tongue stood in contrast. In the wild type, it displayed the same gene expression events as fungiform and palatal papillae on its dorsal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,E</xref>). However, in this case, as in rugae, expression of <italic>Shh</italic>, Sox2, <italic>Hes6, Ascl1</italic>, <italic>Prox1</italic> and <italic>CK8</italic> does not prefigure the later differentiation of taste bud cells, which takes place after birth, mostly in the semi-circular trenches, not at the dorsal surface. In the <italic>Neurog1/2</italic> knockouts at E14.5 (a day after arrival of nerve, thickening of the placode and onset of <italic>Shh</italic> expression (as previously observed on tongue explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mistretta et al., 2003</xref>] and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), the sparse expression of <italic>Hes6</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic> and <italic>Prox1</italic> was preserved, but <italic>Shh</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> was not upregulated and morphogenetic events leading to papilla formation were stalled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), corroborating and extending a previous observation of circumvallate papilla atrophy in <italic>Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor</italic>/<italic>Neurotrophin three</italic> double knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 2010</xref>). A similar phenotype was obtained in single <italic>Neurog2</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), which lack petrosal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Therefore, the circumvallate papilla, already known to differ from fungiform papillae by its ontogenetic requirement for an <italic>Fgf10</italic> signal from the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>), also differs from both fungiform and palatal papillae by requiring its afferent nerve for its formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49226.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Soft palate taste papillae as well as hard palate rugae, but not the tongue circumvallate papilla form without innervation.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Combined immunohistochemistry for β-III tubulin (Tuj1, brown) and in situ hybridization (blue) for the indicated probes (top panel and left four columns), or immunofluorescence for Prox1 or CK8, combined with immunofluorescence for β-III tubulin and a counterstain with DAPI (two right columns) in wild type (<bold>A,B,E</bold>) and double <italic>Neurog1/2</italic> KO (<bold>C,D,F</bold>) at E14.5 or E16.5 as indicated. In the circumvallate papilla, markers are expressed on the dorsal surface (white arrowhead for CK8) but not at the lower part of the trenches (red arrowhead in the right column), where taste buds will develop after birth.

From this developmental stage on, we will designate these taste bud anlagen, irrespective of their size and degree of maturation, as ‘CK8-positive (CK8<sup>+</sup>) cell clusters’. In the palate, they almost reach their mature size and structure by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rashwan et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In <italic>Neurog2</italic> knockouts, that is in the absence of visceral nerves, there was a dramatic deficit in both the number of CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters detected in every other section (43% fewer) in the palate (this number can be taken as an approximation of the number of taste buds in the palate, see Materials and methods) and their cross-sectional area (66% smaller) so that the overall area occupied by CK8<sup>+</sup> cells was 80% smaller than in wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The latter measure, on two-dimensional projections of confocal stacks through 20 μm-thick sections, likely underestimates the extent of the deficit. To rule out that the massive shortfall in taste cells in <italic>Neurog2</italic> KO at E18.5 reflected developmental delay rather than failure, and to circumvent the neonatal death of <italic>Neurog2</italic> KO, we prolonged pregnancies by 2 days with Delvosteron delivered to the dams, and examined the embryos at E20.5 (equivalent to post-natal day 2 (P2) for the normal pregnancy of C57BL/6 mice). The degree of atrophy was even more pronounced at E20.5 than at E18.5, due to a decrease in the number of CK8+ cell clusters (now 89% fewer than in wild type) and a stagnation of their average size (while their wild type counterparts had enlarged), so that the total area occupied by CK8<sup>+</sup> cells in the soft palate was smaller by 96% relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters in the tongue, which are harbored in fungiform papillae and are still immature at this stage in wild type, were similarly atrophic in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Those of the circumvallate papilla were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To verify that the taste bud phenotype of <italic>Neurog2</italic> knockouts does not stem from a cell-autonomous action of <italic>Neurog2</italic> in taste placodes (through some undetected transient expression there), we devised a second genetic strategy to prevent visceral innervation of the soft palate.

Such clusters might thus represent the endpoint, in the absence of subsequent innervation, of taste bud organogenesis triggered by local Shh (endogenous to the taste placodes, or ectopically induced in the epithelium). Along the same lines (and barring a myriad of possible species differences), the most parsimonious reconciliation of our finding with the apparently opposite one in axolotl would be that the ectopic aneural taste buds obtained in that species are much smaller than normal ones — as appears from Figure 2B versus Figure 4D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlow et al. (1996)</xref>; or that in axolotl, taste buds would be so much smaller than in mouse as to not require a pool of progenitors.</p><p>All in all, we show that formation of taste buds in the mammalian embryo is as dependent on innervation as their renewal and regeneration are in the adult. In line with this, the time between the arrival of nerves and taste bud formation (2 to 3 days in the mouse palate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rashwan et al., 2016</xref>) is in the same range as that between re-innervation and taste bud regeneration in gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheal and Oakley, 1977</xref>) — the only species, to our knowledge, where the lag between regrowth of nerves and reformation of taste buds was measured. In light of our results, ‘maintenance’, in the case of taste buds, can be interpreted as an ongoing ontogeny. The developmental role that we document for nerves is neuron-type specific: exerted by visceral sensory neurons, derived from epibranchial placodes, not by somatosensory neurons, derived from the neural crest. This specificity makes less likely the possibility, that we cannot exclude however, that the nerve associated cells (Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells) would have the inducing role, rather than the nerve fibers themselves. At the molecular level, nerve-derived <italic>Shh</italic> has been implicated in the maintenance of adult taste buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castillo-Azofeifa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2018</xref>), with a proposed action, however, too slow and too limited to underlie the dramatic effect of nerve cutting on the integrity of taste buds — or on expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in taste bud cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miura et al., 2004</xref>). The nerve-derived trophic ‘hormone-like’ substance(s) postulated a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olmsted, 1920</xref>) to induce taste buds — in the adult for their continuous renewal, and, as we show here, in the embryo for their ontogeny — are likely yet to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

This raw number was used as an estimate of the number of CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters in the palate, without multiplying by two and performing the Abercrombie correction. Indeed, all the clusters we counted in the wild type spanned the whole height of the epithelium and/or had a visible pore, de facto excluding objects that would be tangentially sectioned. This amounts to a systematic loss of ‘caps’, an important source of errors in the Abercrombie correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hedreen, 1998</xref>). Our method makes it next to impossible that clusters (with an average width of 28 μm (E18.5) and 38 μm (E20.5), see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) would be counted more than once on alternate 20 μm sections. On the other hand, a few clusters were probably lost, if they were centered on one of the uncounted section. The accuracy of our method is verified by the fact that we found the same number of clusters at E20.5 and E18.5 despite the 36% increase in average diameter, and also that we found (not shown) the same number of clusters on alternate 30 μm sections (as opposed to 20 μm).</p><p>For each genotype, all CK8<sup>+</sup> clusters (if there were less than 10), or up to ten (if there were more) were imaged, for the wild type in 2 to 3 sections around the midline of the soft palate (where taste buds were the densest), for the mutants, in one out of two sections throughout the palate. Confocal imaging was performed on a Leica SP5 microscope or a LSM 880 Airyscan Zeiss microscope. The surface occupied by each CK8<sup>+</sup> cluster was automatically outlined and measured with the Fiji software, and the mean cross-sectional area was calculated for each genotype. To calculate the entire surface occupied by CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters on alternate sections of one half of soft palate, the mean value of the calculated surfaces of CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters was multiplied by the raw, uncorrected number of CK8+ clusters. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Results are expressed as mean ± SD. All graphs were performed with GraphPad Prism software. For the reason that we did not count ‘caps’ of wild type CK8+ clusters (see above), the decrease in total area is likely underestimated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Imaging Facility of IBENS, which is supported by grants from Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau, Région Ile-de-France DIM NeRF 2009 and 2011 and France-BioImaging.

Specifically, there are suggestions relate to the quantification of the data (reviewers 1 and 2), the over-simplification of the Title and Abstract (reviewers 2 and 3), and the Discussion section (all three reviewers).</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter.

The work is generally clear and well-written and offers a modicum of new information on the neural dependency of the sensory end organs for taste.</p><p>A major obstacle to clarity in this work is the lack of a clear definition of how the authors use the term &quot;Taste buds&quot;. As the MS describes, development in this system proceeds from non-innervated placodes through some intermediate stages culminating in a mature taste bud. The terminology used in this work seems inconsistent, sometimes referring to the intermediate stages as &quot;taste anlage&quot;, but never clearly defining the term. Does a taste anlagen contain elongate, differentiated taste cells? When does a small collection of elongate taste cells become a &quot;taste bud&quot;? For example, Figure 2 shows elongate differentiated taste cells in Neurog2 KO animals, but the caption suggests that taste buds do not form in this KO line. Since the bar graphs of this figure report on number of taste buds observed, it is essential that the authors define what structure was counted as a taste bud. If in fact the authors are counting as taste buds these small collections of differentiated elongate cells, then they should be correcting for the sampling bias comparing larger objects to smaller objects in histological sections, e.g. by Abercrombie correction. If not, this is essential. Crucial for this calculation is the section thickness and the spacing between sections in relation to the size of the objects being studied. For example, if the section thickness is 15um and the object is 50um in depth, then each object is guaranteed to be counted twice if alternate sections are measured. Conversely, in the same set of sections a 10um object will be counted only once giving the impression that there are twice as many large objects as small objects when in fact, there would be equal numbers.</p><p>Also missing from this report is any mention of the development of taste bud primordia (placodes?) in vitro - a situation entirely devoid of innervation. This would seem highly relevant to this paper.

Fan et al. exploited their genetic models to dissect the involvement of nerves in taste bud formation at different stages and in distinct locations.</p><p>Developmental defects in these mouse mutants include the absence of neurons that normally innervate the taste buds, and these unique neuronal knockouts therefore can be used to assess whether nerves are required in taste bud development. The authors showed that at early stages when nerves are just about to establish contacts with their peripheral targets, the circumvallate placode at the posterior of the tongue is unique in its nerve dependence for expression of certain early genes and for taste bud formation. Expression of some of the same genes during development of non-taste palatal placodes or lingual placodes giving rise to taste buds of the fungiform papillae in contrast remains largely unaffected. Nerves thus participate in taste bud formation at specific developmental windows that vary by location. This variation in nerve dependence for formation of distinct taste bud populations raises questions as to the choice of title, which understates the complexity of taste bud dependence on innervation.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could provide an overview describing taste bud development and maturation at each location and at distinct developmental stages. Using the Neurog2 knockout alone in palatal taste bud development, a previously unappreciated early involvement of nerves in taste bud maintenance was noted. The authors showed morphological defects in the number of K8+ cells and reduced proliferation and reduced expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> associated with progenitor cells. However, sample numbers and quantification of these observations were not provided in the current manuscript. A revision of the manuscript is recommended before acceptance for publication. Please see below for specific questions and suggestions.</p><p>1) The Abstract and Title do not include any reference to the complexity of nerve involvement in formation of taste buds at different locations and developmental stages.</p><p>2) Does circumvallate atrophy occur in the Neurog2 single knockout, as was noted for the Neurog1/2 double KO?</p><p>3) Please report the number of mutant animals examined in Figure 1.</p><p>4) One of the most interesting aspects of the paper is mutant effects on progenitor cells, however, more samples are needed to quantify <italic>Sox2Sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> progenitor cells and proliferative status as indicated by Ki67+. Additional time points at E16.5 and E17.5 would also be informative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This focused and strong study answers an important biological question addressing the importance of innervation in initial development of taste buds and putting the regeneration of taste buds into an ontogeny-like framework. The authors provide a clear and straightforward answer in the form of a short report.</p><p>I have very few comments:</p><p>1) I think that the abstract slightly over-exaggerates the real conclusions: not all taste buds depend on the nerve presence in their development.</p><p>2) It should be very briefly discussed why different taste buds demonstrate differential preferences for the specific visceral sensory nerves during their development. Why the embryonic environment is permissive for some buds that are not innervated at all in case of a double Neurog1/2 KO? Can it be connected to the extraordinary high levels of Shh in developing rugi of the palate? This would fit the results described in the paper from Linda Barlow lab: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4197660/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4197660/</ext-link></p><p>3) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1: In case of Neurog2 KO, Tuj1+ green fibers are very proximal to the CK8 staining and the location of forming taste bud. Are those nerves the remaining touch afferents? They stay in place in Neurog2 KO, although they do not support the development of fungiform papillae. It will be good if the authors clarify this in a figure legend for pedagogical purposes.</p><p>4) Can it be that nerve-associated cells (SCPs and Schwann cells) play a key role in signaling to the developing taste buds, and not the neurons, which support them (although I think this is unlikely)? Worth discussing in one or two phrases.</p><p>Overall, this is a good report that requires only some tuning of the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49226.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a nifty short report on genetic ablation of either somatosensory or visceral sensory neurons and the effects on development of taste buds.

When does a small collection of elongate taste cells become a &quot;taste bud&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>The referee rightly points to the lack of clear-cut transition during taste bud formation. Indeed, we don’t know of any morphological criterion or global gene expression event that sharply demarcates the three canonical stages of taste bud formation: “placode”, “papilla” (whose mesenchymal core forms progressively), and “taste organ” (i.e. a papilla equipped with a mature taste bud). The expression of <italic>Shh</italic> or <italic>CK8</italic> spans 3 and 2 of these phases, respectively, and their restriction to future taste bud cells is progressive. As for terminal differentiation markers (<italic>TRPM5, Pk2dL1</italic> etc.), the onset of their expression is not precisely known. So, to the question “When does a small collection of elongate taste cells become a &quot;taste bud&quot;?” there is, in our opinion, no rigorous answer.</p><p>This said, to homogenize the nomenclature as requested, we now call any group of elongated CK8<sup>+</sup> cells at E18.5 or later, “CK8<sup>+</sup> cells clusters” whether they are mature taste buds, immature taste buds (that we formerly called “taste bud anlagen” — there was never mention of “taste anlagen” —, i.e. not yet functional or not containing the full complement of cells), or taste buds which are atrophic in the mutants, to any extent. This common term reflects the fact that all such formations are not distinguished by dichotomous morphological or gene expression criteria, but distributed on a gradient of sizes (and we quantify the sizes).</p><p>This leaves undefined the nature of CK8<sup>+</sup> cells between E16.5 and 18.5, before they are clearly elongated or grouped in onion shaped structures, all the more so, since we show that some of these cells (on the dorsal aspect of the circumvallate papilla and on the rugae) never become taste cells.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have kept the word “taste bud” in the title of the paper and figures and in the Discussion section, because a large majority of CK8+ clusters have vanished in the mutants and the remaining ones are abnormally small, so that, despite the lack of definition of the exact moment where a collection of CK8+ cells qualifies as a “taste bud”, we feel justified in saying that “taste bud formation requires taste nerves” [see responses to criticisms of the title below].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, Figure 2 shows elongate differentiated taste cells in Neurog2 KO animals, but the caption suggests that taste buds do not form in this KO line. Since the bar graphs of this figure report on number of taste buds observed, it is essential that the authors define what structure was counted as a taste bud.</p></disp-quote><p>See explanation above. We have now replaced “taste buds” by “CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters” in the legend and in the figure. And we counted all CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters (down to single cells when that occurred in the mutants).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If in fact the authors are counting as taste buds these small collections of differentiated elongate cells, then they should be correcting for the sampling bias comparing larger objects to smaller objects in histological sections, e.g. by Abercrombie correction. If not, this is essential. Crucial for this calculation is the section thickness and the spacing between sections in relation to the size of the objects being studied. For example, if the section thickness is 15um and the object is 50um in depth, then each object is guaranteed to be counted twice if alternate sections are measured. Conversely, in the same set of sections a 10um object will be counted only once giving the impression that there are twice as many large objects as small objects when in fact, there would be equal numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that the Abercrombie correction, which was devised to count cell nuclei in a volume of tissue, is appropriate for the comparison of very different objects between a wild type and mutant condition, particularly because of the indirect estimate of H (the height of the object perpendicular to the plane of section) and the “lost caps” effect We now make this reasoning explicit in the Material and methods section: in the following way:</p><p>“This raw number was used as an estimate of the number of CK8<sup>+</sup> cell clusters in the palate, without multiplying by two and performing the Abercrombie correction. Indeed, all the clusters we counted in the wild type spanned the whole height of the epithelium and/or had a visible pore, de facto excluding objects that would be tangentially sectioned. This amounts to a systematic loss of “caps”, an important source of errors in the Abercrombie correction (Hedreen, 1998). Our method makes it next to impossible that clusters (with an average width of 28μm(E18.5) and 38μm (E20.5)) would be counted more than once on alternate 20μm sections. On the other hand, a few clusters were probably lost, if they were centered on one of the uncounted section. The accuracy of our method is verified by the fact that we found the same number of clusters at E20.5 and E18.5 despite the 36% increase in average diameter, and also that we found (not shown) the same number of clusters on alternate 30μm sections (as opposed to 20μm).”</p><p>In any case, this raw number is the only one relevant to the calculation of the total volume occupied by CK8+ cells, that we estimate through the proxy of the total surface occupied by CK8+ cells on the sections we count (one 20μm section out of two). The total surface occupied by taste cells is the total number of patches of CK8+ cells seen on sections, multiplied by the average size of the patches. If two patches on two sections happened to correspond to the same “CK8+ cell cluster”, it would be a realistic reflection of the fact that this cluster is big and occupies a large volume (which is what we evaluate, by a proxy). This is biologically the most important figure. If the number of CK8+ clusters was unchanged in the mutants, but their size decreased on average by 98%, the conclusion of our paper, i.e. that “taste bud formation depends on taste nerves” would remain unchanged.</p><p> <italic>Also missing from this report is any mention of the development of taste bud primordia (placodes?)</italic> in vitro <italic>- a situation entirely devoid of innervation.

This most important message would be jeopardized by the addition of what is basically a bonus, the idiosyncrasy of the circumvallate papilla (again, not of its taste buds).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Does circumvallate atrophy occur in the Neurog2 single knockout, as was noted for the Neurog1/2 double KO?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now show in a new supplementary figure that the <italic>Neurog2</italic> KO looks exactly like the double <italic>Neurog2/Neurog1</italic> knock out.

We believe that our short and clear abstract reflects the findings that we describe, without exaggeration, and that the field will benefit from that clear message [see response to referee #2].
