Facial features reflect the underlying geometry of the skeletal structures. Here, we reveal that cartilaginous nasal capsule (corresponding to upper jaw and face) is shaped by signals generated by neural structures: brain and olfactory epithelium. Brain-derived Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) enables the induction of nasal septum and posterior nasal capsule, whereas the formation of a capsule roof is controlled by signals from the olfactory epithelium. Unexpectedly, the cartilage of the nasal capsule turned out to be important for shaping membranous facial bones during development. This suggests that conserved neurosensory structures could benefit from protection and have evolved signals inducing cranial cartilages encasing them. Experiments with mutant mice revealed that the genomic regulatory regions controlling production of SHH in the nervous system contribute to facial cartilage morphogenesis, which might be a mechanism responsible for the adaptive evolution of animal faces and snouts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mammalian face</kwd><kwd>facial shaping</kwd><kwd>embryonic

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The shape of a face strongly depends on the geometry of skeletal elements directly under the skin, adipose tissue and muscles. Our adult cranial and, in particular, facial skeleton consists mostly of bony elements. Cartilaginous parts are rather minor. However, during embryonic development bone forms after the cartilage, and the initial phases of facial and skull shaping proceed with the cartilaginous skeleton only. The entire functional and evolutionary meaning of the chondrocranium, that is, the early cartilaginous elements of the embryonic skull, is not clear. Some parts of the chondrocranium will undergo endochondral ossification (for example, pre-sphenoid and basisphenoid, cribriform plate, Meckel´s cartilage, olfactory septum, nasal concha, labyrinth of ethmoid, vomer and tympanic bulla). However, the majority of the bones, especially in a facial compartment, will form in a close spatial association with the chondrocranium independently through dermal membranous ossifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carson, 1999</xref>). Many questions, including how and from where molecular signals control the complex chondrocranial shape, and whether the geometry of the chondrocranium directs the shape of facial bones, are still unanswered.</p><p>Achondroplasia, a rare disease due to cartilage insufficiency, includes craniofacial malformations such as protruding forehead, low nasal bridge, maxillary hypoplasia, problems in the otolaryngeal system and macrocephaly as well as foramen magnum stenosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shirley and Ain, 2009</xref>). Prominent human and mouse achondroplasia phenotypes based on <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mutations suggest that a correctly shaped chondrocranium is essential for proper facial bone geometry and general facial outgrowth. However, <italic>Fgfr3</italic> is expressed also at membranous ossification sites (please see <italic>Fgfr3</italic>(mRNA) expression at E15, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/">http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>), as well as in sutural osteogenic fronts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ornitz and Marie, 2002</xref>). Therefore, models involving <italic>Fgfr3</italic> do not allow for precise discrimination of cartilage or bone-dependent parts of the phenotype in affected subjects. Still, these effects strongly suggest that chondrocranium shape might be truly important for producing initial facial geometry and for influencing the formation of membranous bone on top of the cartilaginous template.</p><p>The facial chondrocranium is built by neural crest cells that populate the frontal part of the head and undergo multilineage differentiation. They give rise to cartilage, bone, fascia, adipose tissue, smooth muscle, pericytes, glia and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Snider and Mishina, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baggiolini et al., 2015</xref>). Paraxial mesoderm also contributes to the chondrocranium in posterior basicranial and occipital locations. Collective behavior and differentiation of the neural crest and neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme is largely responsible for the future shape of the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minoux and Rijli, 2010</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms governing this collective behavior, cartilage induction and shape-making are not fully understood, despite significant progress in the research field of cartilage and bone formation.</p><p>McBratney-Owen and Morris-Key with coworkers demonstrated that the complete chondrocranium (including the base of the skull) develops from 14 pairs of independently induced large cartilaginous elements that fuse together during later development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McBratney-Owen et al., 2008</xref>). Sculpting perfect geometries of such cartilaginous elements is a key developmental and regenerative process that accounts for the shape and integrity of our body. Current opinion holds that cartilage forms from condensing mesenchymal cells that are destined to become chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ornitz and Marie, 2002</xref>). Mesenchymal condensations emerge in specific locations. Here, they somehow become shaped, grow and turn into cartilage that later expands until the initiation of endochondral or membranous ossification.</p><p>The frontonasal prominence and other facial regions are enriched in signaling systems. Activity in these systems leads to progressive induction and shaping of craniofacial structures, including chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations that turn into cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minoux and Rijli, 2010</xref>). The signaling center located in the most anterior face, the so called FEZ (Frontonasal Ectodermal Zone), produces Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), which play important roles in facial shaping. FGF8, SHH and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) produced by FEZ regulate the behavior of ectomesenchymal tissue and participate in positioning of chondrogenic condensations inside of the embryonic face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foppiano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Young et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms of facial cartilage induction that involve these molecules have received particular attention during recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gros and Tabin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abzhanov and Tabin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhullar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griffin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another recent breakthrough brought up the fact that the brain itself can emit signals that influence facial shaping. Expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the forebrain turned out to be important for the correct formation of FEZ and early steps of facial shaping in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chong et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Still, how these and other signaling centers synchronize in order to build the 3D shape of facial cartilaginous elements is not understood. The cartilaginous nasal capsule is the most anterior part of the chondrocranium. Together with Meckel’s cartilage in the lower jaw, it constitutes an excellent model system to address questions concerning cartilage induction and shaping.</p><p>Here, using mild ablations of cartilage with tightly controlled genetic tools, we revealed that the shape of the nasal capsule is a key for the geometry and positioning of the facial bones and overall facial shape. Subsequently, with the help of numerous mouse mutants, specific contrasting techniques and micro-CT, we demonstrated that signaling centers in the developing brain and olfactory epithelium jointly and independently enable the induction of the nasal capsule in the embryonic face. Various genomic regulatory regions that direct the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> to the developing nervous system participate in the fine-tuning of the shape of the facial cartilaginous skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Taking into account known achondroplasia facial phenotypes, we hypothesized that even minor changes in the facial cartilaginous template may lead to significant or even major changes in the overlaying membranous bone geometry and the overall facial shape. Thus, we performed mild time-controlled genetic ablation of early chondrocytes employing <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2/R26DTA</italic> mice and analyzed their facial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We used a dose of 2.5 mg of tamoxifen administered at E12.5 and, in an alternative experiment, double injection at E13.5-E14.5 to avoid a strong phenotype with dramatic face shortening and brain shape distortion, and we analyzed the mutant embryos at E17.5 and E15.5 correspondingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2</italic> is a well-established tool to target facial chondrocytes and their immediate progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at early stages of facial development where no bone is present. Also, this <italic>CreERT2</italic> line does not recombine in osteoblasts or their progenitors in membranous ossification sites and, thus, cannot directly impinge on them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Despite only mild cartilage reduction (mean 30,7% of the cartilage surface decrease at E15.5 and mean 35,2% at E17.5), the facial compartment of the <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2<sup>+/-</sup>/R26DTA<sup>+/-</sup></italic>embryos appeared massively affected with short snout and distorted membranous ossifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–R</xref>). Interestingly, the forming mandibular bone appeared shortened and widened at the same time, which cannot be explained only by the shortening of Meckel’s cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This fact suggests an interplay between cartilage and membranous bone that might involve signal-guided rearrangements in skeletogenic tissues. Thus, genetic ablations of COL2A1-producing pre-chondrocytes and chondrocytes revealed a different degree of cartilage loss in the nasal capsule and Meckel’s cartilage, together with corresponding incremental dysmorphologies of membranous bones and face in general. These slight differences in the strength of the phenotype are likely attributed to the fine diversity of developmental stages within one litter receiving tamoxifen during a single injection into a mother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q–R</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the geometry of the face and corresponding bony structures depend on the correct induction and shaping of a facial cartilage. This, in turn, is largely established at the level of chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations, as we recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaucka et al., 2017</xref>). It is worth emphasizing that according to our previous study, the chondrogenic condensations are induced being pre-shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaucka et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34465.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Correct chondrocranium development is essential for shaping the embryonic face.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Genetic tracing induced at E12.5 in <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic> shows recombination in chondrocytes (<bold>B</bold>) only and not in a lineage of membranous bone osteoblasts and their progenitors (<bold>C</bold>), 25 µm cryo-sections (<bold>A–D, G–H</bold>) were imaged with a confocal microscope (<bold>A–C</bold>) or phase contrast microscope (<bold>D, G–H</bold>).

The microstructure of the cartilage stayed normal, with fine borders defining bent cartilaginous sheets forming the major structure of the nasal capsule. The thickness of the cartilaginous sheets forming the capsule also remained comparable to that found in littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). These observations strongly suggested that the early stages of cartilage induction must be affected.</p><p>We also investigated bone formation in the area of the nasal capsule at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We observed missing parts in maxillary bones from mutants, and malpositioned incisors that were found more posteriorly on top of instead of being in the anterior part of the maxilla. At this stage and in this particular location, there was no endochondral ossification ongoing. However, according to micro-CT data, the bone was forming in the proximity and on top of the existing cartilaginous shape template. Thus, the facial chondrocranium is important for the correct formation of the membranous facial bones.</p><p>Recently it has been shown that the brain can influence facial shaping via <italic>Shh,</italic> acting presumably on the frontonasal ectodermal signaling zone (abbreviated as FEZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chong et al., 2012</xref>). It is currently believed that FGF8, SHH and BMPs produced by FEZ regulate the behavior of ectomesenchymal tissue and participate in positioning of chondrogenic condensations inside of the embryonic face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foppiano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Young et al., 2014</xref>). However, our data show that SHH emitted from the forebrain mostly affects the basicranial, posterior and septal parts of the facial chondrocranium without strong effects on the most anterior nasal capsule (including other soft tissues in general), which could be expected if the effects of a brain-derived SHH are entirely mediated by FEZ. Importantly, the major geometric structure of the mutant brain stays largely unchanged although it appears reduced in size. Thus, changes in brain shape are not likely to cause very selective influences on forming facial structures due to mere mechanical interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the spinal column of the mutants and control embryos and found localized shape defects in the cervical vertebrae represented by incomplete transverse foramina (<italic>foramina transversariae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, the defects in the nasal septum stayed confined only to the cartilage as a tissue. The septal chondrogenic condensations and cartilage were missing as apparent E12.5 and E15.5, whereas the soft tissues of the septum stayed in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, despite the cartilage defects clearly identified in spinal column, the other tissue types that were in close proximity to the defects did not show any difference from control. For instance, the vertebral arteries traversing the distorted cartilage of the transverse foramina appeared unaffected in <italic>Nkx2.2-Cre/Shh <sup>floxed/floxed</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined the <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the forming olfactory epithelium and tested the role of the forming olfactory epithelium and olfactory neurons in the process of nasal capsule induction. The possibility that olfactory epithelium controls cartilage shaping is supported by the fact that the conchae of nasal labyrinth geometrically correlate with the folded structure of the olfactory epithelium, which they mechanically support.</p><p>A desired experimental setup that would allow us to target and genetically delete <italic>Shh</italic> from the olfactory epithelium does not exist. To define the importance of any signal derived from the olfactory epithelium we utilized <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Six4</italic> double knockout to specifically ablate the development of the olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). We analyzed <italic>Six1/4</italic> double mutant embryos at E18.5, that showed no olfactory structures, using the micro-CT method and performed a thorough comparison to wildtype littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> ‘Interactive PDF’). In these mutants which had markedly shortened noses, the roof of the nasal capsule was entirely missing. However, the septum and the posterior part of the capsule were relatively well-preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). An earlier analysis at E12.5, a stage when the majority of facial chondrogenic condensations come into place, showed that in double knockouts, the chondrogenic condensation corresponding to the nasal capsule roof is missing. The chondrogenic condensation corresponding to the nasal septum appeared non-fused at this stage and fused only later, as evident from E17.5 reconstructions. At the same time, the roof of the nasal capsule was never induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). This is consistent with the prediction that a lack of the olfactory epithelium will prevent the induction of olfactory cartilages. Analyses of the bones showed a major change in the overall geometry, with prominent shortening along the anterior-posterior axis (brachycephalic-like appearance).

The analysis of E18.5 <italic>Six1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos demonstrated the presence of the nasal capsule roof as well as a septum.

In these animals, major neurogenic transcriptional factor essential for olfactory neuron formation are missing, and very few olfactory sensory neurons are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guillemot et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cau et al., 1997</xref>). We analyzed craniofacial structures in these mutants and found out that they did not demonstrate any gross abnormality despite their inability to develop large amounts of olfactory neurons. Hence, the sensory olfactory neurons are not critical cartilage-inducing sources, while the early olfactory epithelium, before the neurogenesis, is important for the formation of chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations.</p><p>To check if SHH from the brain and presumably from the olfactory epithelium acts directly on facial mesenchyme inducing chondrogenic differentiation or during cartilage growth, we analyzed embryos carrying a SHH-activity reporter <italic>GBS-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>) at different developmental stages ranging from E9 to E14.5. The GFP signal was detectable as expected in the forming palate, brain, spinal cord and tissues that are known to receive SHH input. However, we did not observe GBS-GFP activity in the chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations from the earliest chondrogenic stages E11.5-E12.5 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistently with this, lineage tracing in <italic>Gli1-CreERT2/R26Tomato</italic> mice injected with tamoxifen at E11.5 and analyzed at E17.5 showed sporadic patches of traced chondrocytes in the facial cartilages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). If the injection of tamoxifen was performed at E12.5 or later, these sporadic patches of labeled chondrocytes disappeared; that is we observed only very rarely scattered chondrocytes in other locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Analysis of the rare individual clones of chondrocytes resulting from labeling at E11.5 in <italic>Gli1-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic> demonstrated that mesenchymal cells turn into chondroprogenitors that divide several times to generate clonal clusters of mature chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). At later stages of tamoxifen administration, this was not observed, which is consistent with analysis of <italic>Gli1-LacZ</italic> embryos at E12.5, where the X-gal staining was confined to whisker pads and other peripheral locations. In situ hybridization (RNAscope) for other components of the Hedgehog pathway (including <italic>Ptch1</italic>(mRNA)<italic>, Ptch2</italic>(mRNA)<italic>, Gli1</italic>(mRNA)<italic>, Gli2</italic>(mRNA)) showed no enrichment within potential and actual chondrogenic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

At the same time, we observed the absence of palate and concomitant abnormalities in whiskers distributions in E11.5-to-E15.5 and E12.5-to-E15.5 stages of treatment, but not in E13.5-to-E15.5 stages. Indeed, in embryos treated between E11.5 and E12.5, the palatal shelves were severely reduced or missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

Interestingly, this allele does not change the relative position to <italic>Shh</italic> of most known enhancers that could be responsible for SHH-dependent facial skeletal development.

For example, recognition of individual facial features assists social interaction and affects numerous important aspects of our everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vernon et al., 2014</xref>). Pathological conditions include a very wide spectrum of deficiencies, and may involve eating, breathing and speech impairments, emotional problems and low quality of life in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forbes, 2010</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that even fine and selective manipulations of a facial cartilage geometry and size (performed in <italic>Col2-CreERT2<sup>+/-</sup>/R26DTA<sup>+</sup></italic> embryos) result in significant changes of adjacent membranous bones and facial shape. In turn, the facial cartilage geometry is controlled by the signals coming from neurosensory structures such as brain and olfactory epithelium. Altogether, these results might provide a new explanatory framework revealing how the integrated development of neural and non-neural tissues results in the precise and evolutionary adapted shape of the bony cranium and corresponding facial appearance.</p><p>Previously, Marcucio and Hallgrimsson laboratories demonstrated the co-variation of brain and face as well as the impact of brain-emitted SHH on avian facial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu and Marcucio, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcucio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parsons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petryk et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, the role of such brain-derived signals in cartilage and bone shaping has not been extensively investigated. According to our results, SHH, a key signal enabling cartilage induction, arrives from the floorplate of the brain, and the selective ablation of <italic>Shh</italic> in that area by non-inducible <italic>Nkx2.2-Cre</italic> causes a highly selective loss of the nasal septum cartilage. The soft non-cartilaginous tissue of the nasal septum, however, remains intact, rendering this part of the phenotype highly cartilage-specific. The roof of the nasal capsule stays nearly unaffected. The analysis at E12.5 stage suggested that this phenotype must be related to pre-chondrogenic, early SHH-dependent patterning signals enabling cartilage formation.</p><p>This reasoning is further supported by the line of experiments involving ‘early on action’ <italic>Shh<sup>Hypo</sup></italic> embryos, which demonstrated a profound phenotype in the nasal capsule cartilage. This was in contrast to wild type embryos treated with the SHH-inhibitor Vismodegib strictly between chondrogenic stages (E11.5-E13.5). These embryos showed no significant phenotype in the nasal capsule cartilage. Correspondingly, lineage tracing with <italic>Gli1-CreERT2</italic> and expression analysis of SHH pathways members starting from E11.5 did not show any association with development of facial cartilages.</p><p>These cartilage-related results, where SHH-activity was not associated with facial chondrogenic differentiation, were dramatically different from those observed in palate-forming mesenchymal cells in the same experimental embryos. Unlike cartilage, the developing palate showed strong activity of the SHH-signaling reporter <italic>GBS-GFP.</italic> We also found high expression levels of SHH pathway members, including numerous traced progeny in <italic>Gli1-CreERT2/R26Tomato</italic> animals. As expected, in embryos treated with Vismodegib between E11.5-E12.5, the palate was almost missing, in contrast to contrary to the nasal capsule cartilage that stayed virtually intact. The presence of abnormal palate clefts in Vismodegib-treated and also in <italic>Nkx2.2-Cre/Shh <sup>floxed/floxed</sup></italic> embryos agrees with previous findings, which have established a general role of SHH in the patterning of the face and in development of pathological midfacial clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu and Helms, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, ciliopathies and their animal models often demonstrate similar defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brugmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus, according to our results, SHH is not involved into facial chondrogenesis at stages when chondrogenic condensations form and convert into mature cartilage. Hence, the role of SHH is most likely indirect. Presumably, it is involved in the early patterning of facial ectomesenchyme, to create proper conditions for the sophisticated facial chondrogenesis that will start at later developmental stages. In line with this reasoning, the mode of action of SHH on chondrogenesis in non-facial locations, for example, during the development of axial skeleton, is indirect and based on SHH-dependent alterations of cell responses to BMPs in potentially pre-chondrogenic mesenchymal cells. Murtaugh et al. demonstrated that even a transient SHH signal was able to ensure the competent chondrogenic response of mesenchymal cells to BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murtaugh et al., 1999</xref>). In the case of the axial skeleton, such competence-changing action of SHH depends on the initiated and sustained expression of the transcriptional repressor <italic>Nkx3.2</italic>, which renders cells responsive to pro-chondrogenic actions of BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murtaugh et al., 2001</xref>). As shown by Zeng et al., expression of <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> is sufficient to induce SOX9, a major chondrogenic master regulator, and in the presence of BMPs, NKX3.2 and SOX9 could induce the expression of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeng et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, the sequential action of SHH and BMPs could induce SOX9. According to the public in situ database Allen Developmental Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://developingmouse.brain-map.org">http://developingmouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>), <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> shows distinct expression in a range of cranial cartilages or their future locations at pre-chondrogenic (E11.5) and chondrogenic (E13.5) stages. The knockout of <italic>Nkx3.1</italic> and <italic>Nkx3.2</italic> yields changes in the facial shape, as evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Herbrand et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbrand et al., 2002</xref>). Similar patterning effects of SHH in relation to chondrogenesis have previously been demonstrated during the development of serial tracheal rings reinforced with cartilage. SHH inactivation in ventral trachea resulted in a lack of tracheal segmentation which coincided with the loss of cartilage, while the upregulation of <italic>Shh</italic> resulted in cartilage overproduction and similar segmentation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sala et al., 2011</xref>). Altogether, this may suggest an analogous or similar mechanism of an indirect action of SHH on craniofacial chondrogenesis, especially in light of our results showing only minor and sporadic activity of SHH-signaling reporter in facial chondrogenic condensations or cartilage. Determination of the mechanisms behind SHH action in facial chondrogenesis, with a special focus on the position of the SHH-signal in the hierarchy of events leading to chondrogenic differentiation, is a key future direction. We anticipate that Single cell transcriptomics approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>) will be applied to facial mesenchymal populations prior and during chondrogenesis. This should resolve cell signaling cascades with high precision along the developmental timeline, in similarity to pioneering studies utilizing this methodology in other tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furlan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Complementary to the ablation of <italic>Shh</italic> by <italic>Nkx2.2-Cre</italic>, the loss of the olfactory epithelium in <italic>Six1/Six4</italic> double knockout mutants leads to the absence of the nasal capsule roof, while the nasal septum cartilage stays largely in place. Our data indicate that the loss of a nasal capsule roof in the double knockout condition is driven by the loss of nasal placodes (requiring both SIX1 and SIX4), which causes a collapse of olfactory epithelium. Despite the specific loss of nasal capsule roof, other cartilages appeared intact in locations corresponding to the expression sites of <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Six4</italic> (including Meckel’s cartilage). The perfect match between the shape of cartilaginous olfactory turbines and the epithelium, as well as the coordinated time course of their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaucka et al., 2017</xref>), additionally support the notion that signals from the developing olfactory epithelium might enable the induction of adjacent cartilage. Still, these arguments cannot completely rule out the possibility that co-expressed <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Six4</italic> may have early roles during neural crest migration and early post-neural crest stages that might be important for the nasal roof formation. Taken together, our results provide strong support for the idea that a single solid cartilaginous element such as the nasal capsule can be induced by the combinatorial action of signals derived from several, in the present case, neural and neurosensory, locations. Notably, facial chondrogenic condensations are induced being ‘pre-shaped’. Already at the earliest steps, they are laid down as highly complex 3D-geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaucka et al., 2017</xref>). The induction of such 3D-shapes is unlikely to be achieved by signals from a single site and might require more sources including spatially opposed brain and olfactory structures. Since we were unable to validate that SHH from the olfactory placode or epithelium is the key factor that induces a nasal capsule roof, we cannot exclude that other signaling molecules participate during critical steps of facial cartilage induction. This will require further investigations.</p><p>During evolution of vertebrates, cartilages forming the neurocranium and the future upper jaw appear before Meckel’s cartilage attains a function of a lower jaw skeleton, and the animals acquire articulated hinged jaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimeld and Donoghue, 2012</xref>). Therefore, one of the primeval functions of the neurocranial and frontal cartilages could be the encasement and protection of the neural and sensory compartments such as brain, eyes, ears and olfactory neurons. If that is the case, it is logical to reason that these neurosensory structures could emit cartilage-inducing signals and coordinate cartilage growth and shaping. Our experimental results reveal the key role of SHH from the developing brain in enabling the induction of a nasal capsule and basicranial cartilages, and, thus, support the aforementioned evolutionary hypothesis. The capacity of the developing olfactory epithelium to shape the cartilaginous support also favors this reasoning. Genetics-based prevention of neuronal differentiation in the olfactory epithelium (vial <italic>Ascl1</italic> knockout) does not interfere with shaping of the nasal capsule and confines the shaping role of presumably olfactory progenitors to the developmental period before their differentiation into the mature olfactory neurons. Alternatively, other cell types in the olfactory epithelium may play a cartilage-inducing role (olfactory glia, non-neurogenic epithelium).</p><p>In addition to the evolutionary aspect, the role of different neurosensory structures (mainly the brain) in coordinated cartilage induction may suggest a new connection between neurological and craniofacial symptoms in numerous genetic syndromes. Examples of such conditions are Williams syndrome, Down syndrome and others that are manifested by behavioral and morphological abnormalities in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starbuck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vincent et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antshel et al., 2008</xref>) (and reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcucio et al., 2011</xref>]). Based on this reasoning, it is possible to envision a mechanistic connection between the fine aspects of a facial geometry and individual features of the human brain. An enormous facial variability is found among humans, which poses a question regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie this variability. In difference to humans, non-human primates generally use variations in colored facial hairs to express their species, social status and sex in addition to body movements, voice expressions and scent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Higham, 2015</xref>). This brings us to speculate whether the loss of dense facial hairs during evolution of humans led to the development of a very broad range of various facial tissue-related features in order to compensate for the loss of facial hair-related communication and individual recognition. We hypothesize that one of those shape-tuning mechanisms could include flexible and individual modulation of SHH, an important patterning and shaping agent during the embryonic development that comes from different spatial sources including the developing brain.</p><p>Previous research has established the existence and position of some of the specific regulatory elements that direct the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the craniofacial epithelial linings (<italic>MRCS1</italic> and <italic>MFCS4</italic>, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sagai et al., 2009</xref>) for details) as well as in the floor plate and anterior forebrain (<italic>SBE2</italic> ((Shh Brain Enhancer 2)), <italic>SBE3</italic> and <italic>SBE4 [</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>]). In order to find out fine effects in facial cartilages as a result of activity by site-specific enhancers, we analyzed a variety of mutants with deleted and inverted genomic regions containing such regulatory elements (mutants created by François Spitz’ laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Symmons et al., 2016</xref>]). The inversion of the <italic>−500</italic> C1 genomic region including known CBEs showed localized defects within the nasal septum that incrementally increased from heterozygous to homozygous state without influencing nasal capsule roof shape. Similarly, the inversion of (<italic>6b-C2)</italic> region in a heterozygous state caused minor defects in septum, whereas the same inversion on the background of deletion of the entire regulatory region (<italic>−90 C2</italic>) appeared similar to <italic>Shh<sup>Hypo</sup></italic> or even <italic>Shh</italic> knock out. This is explained by the translocation of TAD (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Symmons et al., 2016</xref>) for details) and resulting ‘isolation’ of <italic>Shh</italic> coding part from head-specific regulatory regions located between positions six and <italic>C2</italic>. In this latter case (<italic>INV(6b-C2)</italic>), <italic>Shh</italic> expression was dramatically reduced in the anterior forebrain as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Symmons et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis of more restricted <italic>Shh</italic> regulatory regions revealed that brain-specific and facial cartilage-related enhancers are confined within the region (<italic>5-8</italic>) and are at least partly responsible for the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the forebrain according to the loss of in situ hybridization signal in the forebrain of (<italic>DEL(5-8)</italic>) compared to controls. The deletion of this (<italic>DEL(5-8)</italic>) region resulted in severe facial malformation and collapse of the nasal capsule shape to the state resembling <italic>Shh<sup>Hypo</sup></italic>. Despite that we clearly observed the misshaped nasal capsule roof in these embryos, the septum was completely gone similarly to (<italic>DEL(−90 C2) x INV (6b-C2)</italic>) mutants. Taken together, these results provide strong support to the discrete role of genomic regulatory regions directing the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> to the forebrain and, through this, affecting the patterning of septal, basicranial and other cartilages in the head.</p><p>Importantly, all analyzed embryos carrying mutated regulatory regions never demonstrated missing nasal capsule roof including severe (<italic>DEL(−90 C2) x INV (6b-C2)</italic>), (<italic>DEL (5-8) HOMO</italic>) and <italic>Shh<sup>Hypo</sup></italic>. This might mean that we still do not know about the position of the corresponding regulatory regions targeting the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> to the olfactory epithelium or FEZ in the frontal face. The loss or inversion of regulatory regions resulting in mild septal defects did not affect the anterior nasal capsule, which might be independently patterned by FEZ. Similarly, the morphology of the anterior nasal capsule stayed relatively stable when septal cartilage disappeared in <italic>Nkx2.2-Cre/Shh <sup>floxed/floxed</sup></italic> animals. This suggests that the most anterior face including frontal facial cartilages might be indeed patterned by FEZ together with olfactory placodes independently from brain-derived signals. These results point towards the possibility that mouse FEZ can form and act independently of the CNS signaling center contrary to chick embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu and Marcucio, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, it is possible that enhancer-dependent spatial and temporal regulations of <italic>Shh</italic> expression could be evolutionary tools to achieve the impressive variety of facial cartilage shapes in humans - a basis for facial individuality. Indeed, much attention has been focused on the role of enhancers in craniofacial evolution. Recently, by applying a combination of morphometry, molecular biology and mouse genetics, Attanasio et al. described numerous enhancers that are differentially active and take part in the development of a facial shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attanasio et al., 2013</xref>). In line with this, mutations in the enhancers that control the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, another cartilage-inducing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abzhanov and Tabin, 2004</xref>), also result in geometrical abnormalities of the nasal capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marinić et al., 2013</xref>). It seems that many genes and pathways are involved in shaping the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Young et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foppiano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015b</xref>). This is not surprising, since the facial shaping includes many stages that are pre-chondrogenic, chondrogenic (including induction, growth, remodeling of the cartilage) and osteogenic. Processes of isotropic and anisotropic growth of the skeletal structures also play important roles in achieving the final geometry of the facial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaucka et al., 2017</xref>). Despite such complexity and the enormous degree of spatio-temporal integration, the initial induction of cartilage guided by the brain and olfactory epithelium represents a key moment of facial skeleton formation. It may well also be an evolutionary substrate driving the diversity of faces and snouts. Consequently, the fine-tuning of patterning and cartilage-inducing signals in neurosensory structures deserves further attention, including explorations of the diversity of corresponding genetic regulatory regions in human and animal genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type species <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain</td><td valign="top"> <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakamura et al.

After that the silver nitrate solution was removed, and slides were washed with distilled water for 3 times during 2 min. 2.5% sodium thiosulphate solution (w/v) was added to the sections and incubated for five mins. Slides were again rinsed for 3 times during 2 min in distilled water. The sections were then counterstained using Alcian blue. Alcian blue solution (0.1% alcian blue 8GX (w/v) in 0.1 M HCl) was added to the tissue for 3 min at room temperature and then rinsed for 3 times during 2 min in distilled water. Slides were then transferred rapidly into incrementally increasing ethanol concentrations (20%, 40%, 80%, 100%) and incubated in 100% ethanol for 2 min. Finally, the slides were incubated in two xylene baths (for 2 min and then for 5 min) before mounting and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry, histological staining and EdU analysis</title><p>Frozen samples were sectioned at 18–30 µm depending on specific experiment. If needed, sections were stored at −20°C after drying 1 hr at room temperature, or processed immediately after sectioning. Primary antibodies used were: chicken anti-GFP (Abcam, 1:500, ab13970), rabbit anti-SOX9 (Sigma Aldrich, 1:1000, HPA001758), sheep anti-ERBB3 (RnD Systems, 1:500, AF4518). For detection of above-mentioned primary antibodies, we utilized 405, 488, 555 or 647-conjugated Alexa secondary antibodies produced in donkey (Invitrogen, 1:1000).

The settings for the imaging of Confetti fluorescent proteins were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>). Image analysis has been performed using IMARIS Software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Before performing manual segmentations of cartilages and mesenchymal chondrogenic condensations on all representative samples, we assessed the phenotype and the stability of the phenotype using analysis of multiple embryos (typically 3–5 per condition) on histological sections as well as whole-mount assessments of facial morphology and including usage of tomographic slices. In case the phenotype was stable, the representative embryos underwent 3D segmentation process, otherwise we manually segmented facial cartilage and bone from all experimental embryos (in case of <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2/R26DTA</italic> or <italic>Shh<sup>Hypo</sup></italic>, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Other litter mates were analyzed using cryo-sections only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). Since we did not investigate fine differences in shape of the nasal capsule and rather concentrated on missing structures (septum or nasal capsule roof), we did not analyze fine shape differences morphometrically in a quantitative way. In special cases, where relevant, we utilized shape fitting analysis using GOM Inspect tool. We did not use any special randomization or masking of embryos during experimental and control group allocations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tissue contrasting for µ-CT scanning</title><p>Staining protocol has been adapted and modified from the original protocol developed by Brian Metscher laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metscher, 2009</xref>). After embryo dissection in ice-cold PBS, the samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS solution for 24 hr at +4°C with slow rotation. Subsequently, samples were dehydrated in incrementally increasing ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, 70%), 1 day in each concentration to minimize the shrinkage of the tissue. Samples were transferred, depending on the embryonic stage, into 1.0–1.5% PTA (phospho-tungstic acid) in 90% methanol for tissue contrasting. The PTA-methanol solution was changed every 2–3 days. E12.5 embryos were stained for 7 days, E15.5 embryos for 3 weeks and E18.5 embryos for 7 weeks. The contrasting procedure was followed by rehydration of the samples by incubation in ethanol series (90%, 70%, 50% and 30%) and shipped to the CT-laboratory for scanning. There the rehydrated embryos were embedded in 0.5% agarose gel (A5304, Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in polypropylene conical tubes (0.5, 1.5 or 15 ml depending on the sample size to minimize the amount of medium surrounding it) and to avoid the movement artifacts during X-ray computer tomography scanning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>µ-CT analysis (micro computed tomography analysis) and 3D analysis</title><p>The µ-CT analysis of the embryos was conducted using the laboratory system GE phoenix v|tome|x L 240 (GE Sensing and Inspection Technologies GmbH, Germany), equipped with a 180 kV/15W maximum power nanofocus X-ray tube and flat panel detector DXR250 with 2048 × 2048 pixel, 200 × 200 µm pixel size. The embryos were fixed in polyimide tubes by 1% agarose gel to prevent tomographic movement artifacts. The exposure time of the detector was 900 ms in every of 2000 positions. Three projections were acquired and averaged for reduction of the noise in µ-CT data. The utilized power of the tube was 11 W given by acceleration voltage of 60 kV and tube current of 200 μA. X-ray spectrum was filtered by 0.1 mm of aluminium plate. The voxel size of obtained volumes (depending on a size of an embryo head) appeared in the range of 5 µm - 7 µm. The tomographic reconstructions were performed using GE phoenix datos|x 2.0 3D computed tomography software (GE Sensing and Inspection Technologies GmbH, Germany). The cartilage in the embryo head was segmented by an operator with semi-automatic tools within Avizo - 3D image data processing software (FEI, USA). The 3D segmented region was transformed to a polygonal mesh as a STL file. The mesh of the embryo head was imported to VG Studio MAX 2.2 software (Volume Graphics GmbH, Germany) for consequent modification of the mesh, like a surface smoothing, and 3D visualization. The software GOM Inspect V8 (GOM, Braunschweig, Germany) was implemented for comparisons of full shapes of the head. The triangular meshes of the surface of the heads represented by STL models were imported into the software, aligned and compared with parameters of maximum searching distance 1 mm and maximum opening angle 30°.

The authors should examine <italic>Shh</italic> signaling activity in the nasal capsule either through the use of <italic>Gli1-LacZ</italic> reporter mice or by analyzing the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> pathway readouts (<italic>Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo, Gli1</italic>).</p><p>2) <italic>Col2a-DTA</italic> ablation experiments</p><p>The authors should define what they mean by &quot;mild chondrocyte ablation&quot;.

Therefore, it seems difficult to eliminate the possibility that there is an earlier effect of SHH loss (e.g. changes in patterning or availability of mesenchymal tissues prior to cartilage condensation.

There is a wealth of information in these animal models that is glossed over, in part because not enough detail is given for us to understand the different mutants (especially <italic>Shh</italic> enhancers). Furthermore, because there is never a direct comparison between the different lines, it is difficult to interpret the data in total. I think this is crucial because effectively, the conclusions are drawn upon a series of correlations – if this is the bulk of the data, it will help the reader if all of the correlations are laid out in one unified vision at the end. Instead, the authors discuss some thoughts rationalising the evolution of the structures, which is rather a distraction from the findings. I don't see that it is necessary to make any evolutionary arguments; instead, I would like a bit more scholarship and context in the Discussion and some thought toward future directions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34465.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Nkx2.2 ablation experiments</p><p>The genetic ablation of SHH in the floor plate with the Nkx2.2 driver is perhaps the most elegant experiment in the paper, resulting in a clear phenotype that includes truncation of the nasal capsule and other craniofacial defects.

For this we performed a number of experiments including:</p><p>1) The analysis of expression of SHH-pathway members using RNAscope (<italic>Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo, Gli1, Gli2, Gli3</italic>) and <italic>Gli1-LacZ</italic> reporter animals.</p><p>2) Lineage tracing with <italic>Gli1-CreERT2</italic> coupled to <italic>R26Tomato</italic> and <italic>R26Confetti</italic> reporters.</p><p>3) Analysis of SHH-pathway activity in mesenchymal chondrogenic condensations and cartilage by utilizing reporter <italic>GBS-GFP</italic> animals.</p><p>4) Injections of SHH-inhibitor vismodegib at chondrogenic stages (E11.5-E13.5) and comparison of the phenotype with “non-inducible” <italic>Shh hypomorphs (Shh<sup>Hypo</sup></italic>).</p><p>Altogether, the results of these experiments formed three new main figures (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7) as well as a number of corresponding supplementary figures (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3). These data demonstrated that SHH plays a pre-chondrogenic and, most likely, patterning role that is not directly involved in facial cartilage differentiation.</p><p>In the initial version of the manuscript we focused on the brain and olfactory epithelium as centers directing cartilage development, and did not claim that SHH has a direct and selective effect on the cartilage development in the face. With the new results that we incorporated in the revised version, we explicitly clarify that the time-window of <italic>Shh</italic> activity occurs prior to the chondrogenic stages. This new finding suggests that <italic>Shh</italic>-induced pattern or secondary signal is involved in cartilage differentiation – possibilities that can be investigated in future studies.</p><p>Here is how we describe new results in the text of the Results section:</p><p>“To check if SHH from the brain and presumably from the olfactory epithelium acts directly on facial mesenchyme inducing chondrogenic differentiation or during cartilage growth, we analyzed embryos carrying a SHH-activity reporter <italic>GBS-GFP</italic><sup>27</sup> at different developmental stages ranging from E9 to E14.5. […] These results are also consistent with the phenotype of <italic>Six1/Six4</italic> double knockout embryos at E12.5 (Figure 4), and corroborate the notion of an early pre-cartilage onset of the phenotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Col2a-DTA ablation experiments</p><p>The authors should define what they mean by &quot;mild chondrocyte ablation&quot;. It would be helpful to have a more quantitative and temporal understanding of how many cells are killed after the E12.5 induction in the DTA treatment and at what stage they are killed (as the difference between E13.5 to E15.5 can be dramatic). This would provide us with a better understanding of the precise stages at which the supposed SHH signal is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we followed the advice of the reviewers and defined the proportion of cartilage loss in presented nasal capsules from the DTA animals. We also performed new experiments (collecting embryos at earlier stage for the analysis – this time E15.5) and analyzed them. For this, we quantified the surface and volume of nasal capsule cartilage in control and DTA embryos analyzed at E15.5 and E17.5. For E17.5, the loss of cartilage in DTA sample was mean 30,7% of the cartilage surface decrease at E15.5 and mean 35,2% at E17.5. The new results can be found in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The cartilage of the nasal capsule is fully set for the first time only at E15.5 (before that different parts are generated from chondrogenic condensations, see our paper Kaucka et al., 2017), and, thus, in the new experiment with another scheme of treatment aimed at higher cartilage loss, we analyzed the nasal capsule at E15.5 and not at E17.5. The principal results were consistent with the original experiment and showed how bone development becomes affected. Despite the reduction of nasal capsule cartilage, the membranous bones were induced adjacently in a tight association with chondrocranial parts. Please see Figure 1P,Q,R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A timeline of the genetic perturbations</p><p>It would be helpful to consolidate all the data with a timeline scheme depicting the steps in facial cartilage formation and place all the different genetic variants onto this scheme – this would need to include the time point at which each set of mutants is first have an effect.

This will of course raise the question of what is happening in the other mutants from E8+ through E12.5, but worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>We generated an illustration (Figure 7) that depicts the timeline of all experiments and the beginning of effects. We cross-compare the phenotypes in Results and also in Discussion, so there is a clarity of when the action of mutation takes place and how different conditions are similar to each other or different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Shh expressing cells in the olfactory epithelium</p><p>The experiment involving the ablation of the olfactory epithelium is difficult to interpret given that the whole tissue is being targeted. Thus it is possible that other signals coming from these cells are required for the proper patterning of the nasal capsule. Furthermore, Six1/Six4 are expressed in the neural crest lineage and the head mesenchyme at earlier stages of development and thus we cannot rule out that the effects observed are indeed cell autonomous. This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and understand the reviewer’s concerns. This is indeed great advice, and we discussed this moment extensively. It might be good to mention that we never claimed that it is SHH from the olfactory epithelium that induces the nasal capsule roof. Targeting <italic>Shh</italic> exclusively in the nasal placode is currently impossible. In the revised version of the manuscript, we discussed this issue in a more clear way since we totally agree that other signals derived from olfactory placode in principle can guide the development of nasal capsule roof.</p><p>“The induction of such 3D-shapes is unlikely to be achieved by signals from a single site and might require more sources including spatially opposed brain and olfactory structures. […] This will require further investigations.”</p><p>We provided additionally new data by generating and checking the key early stage of <italic>Six1/Six4</italic> double knockout (E12.5) and also by exploring a single knockout of <italic>Six1 (Six4</italic> knockout showed no phenotype). Here is the new text that we have in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>“In addition to the expression in olfactory placodes, <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Six4</italic> are expressed in different parts of early facial mesenchyme (Kobayashi et a., 2007; Grifone et al., 2005. […] The phenotype in <italic>Six1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos mostly included a narrowing of the posterior nasal capsule with mild septal defects (Figure 4L,M and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E).”</p><p>“Complementary to the ablation of <italic>Shh</italic> by <italic>Nkx2.2-Cre</italic>, the loss of the olfactory epithelium in <italic>Six1/Six4</italic> double knockout mutants leads to the absence of the nasal capsule roof, while the nasal septum cartilage stays largely in place. […] Already at the earliest steps, they are laid down as highly complex 3D-geometries (Kaucka et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Enhancer experiment</p><p>The enhancer experiments are tantalizing but very preliminary. First, the authors should clarify where these enhancers were published and what expression domains they produce. Have they been published (I could not locate a reference)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is clarified in the main text. The initial discovery of these genomic regulatory regions is described in a recent manuscript from Francois Spitz laboratory (Symmons et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, they would have to show how enhancer deletions results in changes of SHH expression. Unless the authors bridge the enhancer experiments with the previous data showing regional regulation of the nasal capsule, this section seems disconnected from the rest of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We did our best to run more experiments and to show the plethora of the phenotypes that explain more clearly now how brain-specific <italic>Shh</italic> enhancers influence facial cartilage development. For the most critical mutations of <italic>Shh</italic> regulatory regions, we either report <italic>Shh-LacZ</italic> reporter data showing the shift of <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the forebrain or we cite the data of this kind obtained and published previously. In any case, we decided to move all data about enhancers to the supplementary information in this manuscript because of its accessory function.</p><p>Here are the major updated results also outlined in two supplementary figures (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2):</p><p>“Tissue-specific expression of <italic>Shh</italic> is known to be controlled by multiple enhancers. Some, which may regulate <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the cranial region, have been characterized (Yao et al., 2016; Jeong et al., 2006; Sagai et al., 2009). […] Taken together, local tuning of SHH expression by various enhancers (including brain-specific regulatory elements) seemingly controls discrete steps of chondrocranial patterning, which may represent a key evolutionary mechanism shaping animal snouts and faces.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Discussion does the data a great disservice. There is a wealth of information in these animal models that is glossed over, in part because not enough detail is given for us to understand the different mutants (especially Shh enhancers). Furthermore, because there is never a direct comparison between the different lines, it is difficult to interpret the data in total. I think this is crucial because effectively, the conclusions are drawn upon a series of correlations – if this is the bulk of the data, it will help the reader if all of the correlations are laid out in one unified vision at the end.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded on the direct comparisons between the relevant mutant lines and we also added a new whole figure outlining the phenotypes and timing of effects (see Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead, the authors discuss some thoughts rationalising the evolution of the structures, which is rather a distraction from the findings. I don't see that it is necessary to make any evolutionary arguments; instead, I would like a bit more scholarship and context in the Discussion and some thought toward future directions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we expanded the discussion towards molecular mechanism of SHH action on chondrogenesis, as well as provided some additional lines about future directions. We also kept the evolutionary tilt in the Discussion text since we hope that our findings will be considered important for EvoDevo aspect of craniofacial research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
