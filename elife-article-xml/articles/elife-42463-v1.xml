This genetic variability is affected by the adaptive immune response but the contribution of other host factors is unclear. Here, we examined the role played by interferon lambda-4 (IFN-λ4) on HCV diversity; IFN-λ4 plays a crucial role in spontaneous clearance or establishment of chronicity following acute infection. We performed viral genome-wide association studies using human and viral data from 485 patients of white ancestry infected with HCV genotype 3a. We demonstrate that combinations of host genetic variants, which determine IFN-λ4 protein production and activity, influence amino acid variation across the viral polyprotein - not restricted to specific viral proteins or HLA restricted epitopes - and modulate viral load. We also observed an association with viral di-nucleotide proportions. These results support a direct role for IFN-λ4 in exerting selective pressure across the viral genome, possibly by a novel mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group

people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>) and can lead to severe liver disease in chronically infected patients. The virus is highly variable and has been classified into seven distinct genotypes, and further divided into 67 subtypes, based on nucleotide sequence diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simmonds, 2004</xref>). The factors that have driven the evolutionary path of HCV are multifactorial but undoubtedly are also shaped by host genetics. Because of its major health burden, determining how both host and viral genetics contribute to the outcomes of infection is critical for a better understanding of HCV-mediated pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ploss and Dubuisson, 2012</xref>) and the immune response to viral infection.</p><p>Using a systematic genome-to-genome approach in a cohort of chronically infected patients, we recently reported associations between an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860 in the interferon lambda 4 (<italic>IFNL4</italic>) gene (CC vs. non-CC) and 11 amino acid polymorphisms on the HCV polyprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ansari et al., 2017</xref>) at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).

These associations between polymorphisms on the HCV polyprotein and host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes are further intriguing given that variants within the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus (including SNP rs12979860) contribute to HCV clinical and biological outcomes, including spontaneous virus clearance, response to IFN-based treatment, viral load and liver disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noureddin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suppiah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that the associations between the outcomes of HCV infection and the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus are directly linked to its impact on the viral genome and the encoded polyprotein.</p><p>The intronic <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 is in high linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs that may be more biologically relevant, including the exonic dinucleotide variant rs368234815 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.975 CEU population, 1000 Genomes dataset) in <italic>IFNL4</italic>. This variant [ΔG &gt; TT] causes a frameshift, abrogating production of functional IFN-λ4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, several amino acid substitutions within IFN-λ4 have been shown to alter its antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bamford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terczyńska-Dyla et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, a common amino acid substitution (coded by the SNP rs117648444 [G &gt; A]) in the IFN-λ4 protein, which changes a proline residue at position 70 (P70) to a serine residue (S70), reduces its antiviral activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terczyńska-Dyla et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the combination of alleles at rs368234815 and rs117648444 creates four potential haplotypes, two that do not produce IFN-λ4 protein (TT/G or TT/A; IFN-λ4-Null) and two that result in production of two IFN-λ4 protein variants (ΔG/G; IFN-λ4-P70 and ΔG/A; IFN-λ4-S70). Patients harbouring the impaired IFN-λ4-S70 variant display lower hepatic interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression levels, which is associated with increased viral clearance following acute infection and a better response to IFN-based therapy, compared to patients carrying the more active IFN-λ4-P70 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eslam et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report a large number of associations between HCV-encoded amino acids across the viral polyprotein and host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860, with 42 significant associations at a 5% FDR, increasing to 76 viral sites at a 10% FDR. The associations are observed in both structural and non-structural viral proteins and no enrichment of association signals is observed in any of the viral proteins or HLA restricted epitope regions. We also find an association with viral nucleotide content and certain dinucleotide frequencies, such as UpA (uracil base followed by adenine base). Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>IFNL4</italic> haplotypes coding for IFN-λ4-S70 and IFN-λ4-P70 variants differ in terms of their impact on viral load and viral amino acid polymorphisms, in agreement with the reduced antiviral activity of IFN-λ4-S70.

To control for both human and virus population structures, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on each of the host and viral genetic data (Materials and methods). The host PCA defined a largely homogenous group corresponding to self-reported white ancestry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

In effect we performed 500 viral GWASs, one for each of the 500 frequency-matched SNPs. Using a 5% FDR (calculated independently for each of the 500 viral GWASs), we observed no significant associations for 491 of the host SNPs tested against the HCV polyprotein. The remaining nine host SNPs were associated with one HCV amino acid each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). However, these associations are likely to be false positives as multiple testing corrections were performed for each viral GWAS independently. Additionally, the distribution of P-values for the association tests between HCV amino acids and the 500 frequency-matched SNPs followed the null distribution of no associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6a</xref>), confirming that there was no systematic bias in our analysis.

In the present study, we further stratified the analysis by <italic>IFNL4</italic> haplotypes. The viral serine (S) residue at site 2414 (S2414) was significantly enriched in patients coding for the IFN-λ4-P70 variant compared to IFN-λ4-S70 (p=3.39×10<sup>−03</sup>) and IFN-λ4-Null (p=5.94×10<sup>−09</sup>) coding patients. S2414 was present in 86% (211/244) of IFN-λ4-P70 carrying patients, 69% (38/55) of IFN-λ4-S70 carrying patients and 62% (114/185) of IFN-λ4-Null carrying patients. In HCV-infected patients with a serine residue at position 2414, we observed no significant difference in mean viral load between IFN-λ4-Null and IFN-λ4-S70 carriers (p=0.31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), but both groups had a significantly higher viral load than IFN-λ4-P70 carriers (p<sub>IFN-λ4-Null</sub>=2.7x10<sup>−9</sup>; p<sub>IFN-λ4-S70</sub>=1.6x10<sup>−10</sup>). However, no such association (p=0.49) was found in HCV-infected patients with a non-serine residue at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

We did not observe statistically significant enrichment of association signals in any specific HCV protein nor in HLA restricted epitope regions. This indicates that the host <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus, and hence the innate immune response, can influence the amino acid residues that are encoded at specific sites on the HCV polyprotein. The mechanism of action of IFN-λ4 in determining such selectivity is not known. We also report an association of the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus with synonymous codon variants, suggesting that this locus might also affect the HCV genome at the nucleotide sequence level. Finally, we report that the <italic>IFNL4</italic> haplotype coding for the IFN-λ4-S70 variant has a smaller impact on viral load and viral amino acid variation at associated sites compared to the haplotype coding for the more active IFN-λ4-P70 variant. This indicates that the <italic>IFNL4</italic> gene not only mediates HCV amino acid variation but also modulates viral load in patients. Hence, our findings extend the association between genetic variation in the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus and outcome of HCV infection as well as hepatic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noureddin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rauch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suppiah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eslam et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We selected patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 3a and of self-reported white ancestry to limit the impact of human and viral population co-structuring in our analyses. We observed that 2.5% of HCV-encoded amino acids across the polyprotein were significantly associated with host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP at a 10% FDR. No such association was observed for 500 host SNPs chosen from across the human genome with a MAF similar to that for <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860. This indicated that the observed impact of <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 on the viral sequences was not due to population structure or other systematic bias. Compared to our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ansari et al., 2017</xref>), the number of sites associated with <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotype increased from 11 to 42 at a 5% FDR. One of the 11 previously reported associations was not reproduced (position 2576) as it was not tested in this study, due to more stringent frequency filtering (an amino acid had to be present in at least 20 samples to be tested). Thus, we have identified a further 32 associated sites at a 5% FDR compared to our previous report. There are two key factors that have contributed to this increased number of associated sites. Firstly, only HCV genotype 3a sequences found in those of white ancestry have been included in the analysis; our previous report included HCV genotype 2 and other genotype 3 subtypes from a broader ethnic mix. Secondly, we have used logistic regression and accounted for population structure by including viral and host genetic PCs as covariates in the analysis. This approach has recently been shown to be more powerful to detect associations in genome-to-genome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Naret et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, focusing on a homogenous population (white ethnicity infected with genotype 3a) and using logistic regression has increased the power of our study to detect many more associations between the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus and amino acid variation in the HCV polyprotein.</p><p>To distinguish the effect of <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 on viral amino acid variation from nucleotide sequence variability, we investigated the association of the host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 with synonymous and non-synonymous codon changes in the HCV genome. <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes were associated with 35 non-synonymous codon changes at a 10% FDR, but we also observed four significant associations with synonymous codon changes. This indicated that in addition to a widespread impact at the amino acid level, the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus may also independently drive nucleotide diversity but to a lesser extent.</p><p>To further explore the impact of the <italic>IFNL4</italic> variants on HCV genomic sequences, we investigated viral dinucleotide frequencies. The HCV UpA dinucleotide frequency was significantly associated with the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes; interestingly, ribonuclease L (RNase-L), an ISG that cleaves viral RNA to control viral infections in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</xref>), targets both UpA and UpU dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wreschner et al., 1981</xref>). Moreover, HCV genotype 1, which is relatively resistant to IFN-based therapy, has a lower frequency of UpA and UpU dinucleotides than the more IFN-sensitive HCV genotypes 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dao Thi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the UpA dinucleotide is targeted by RNA-degrading enzymes and its presence in a RNA sequence accelerates its degradation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simmonds et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that the more stringent immune environment of non-CC patients (with higher hepatic expression of ISGs) selects virus with a lower UpA frequency. However, we note that the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 non-CC patients have a modest reduction (0.9%) in their viral UpA frequencies relative to the CC patients and that this reduction could be mediated by the widespread amino acid changes associated with the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 variants of IFN-λ4 protein have distinct phenotypes, both in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesized that if IFN-λ4 contributes to changes in the viral polyprotein, then the IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 variants should have different effect sizes on HCV-encoded amino acids and viral load. By imputing and phasing <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNPs in our cohort, we inferred the haplotypes consisting of the <italic>IFNL4</italic> rs368234815 (ΔG/TT) and rs117648444 (G/A) variants. Using these data, we observed that the haplotype coding for the IFN-λ4-S70 variant had a smaller effect on viral amino acid variability compared to the haplotype coding for the IFN-λ4-P70 variant. This observation agrees with previous independent studies showing the reduced antiviral activity for IFN-λ4-S70 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bamford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terczyńska-Dyla et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the mean viral load in IFN-λ4-Null carrying patients was similar to those carrying the IFN-λ4-S70 variant; by contrast, those carrying an IFN-λ4-P70 variant had a reduced viral load, which correlates with its higher antiviral activity. Taken together, these observations reinforce the hypothesis that <italic>IFNL4</italic> is a functional gene with a major role in HCV infection. We conclude that production of IFN-λ4 protein drives an altered immune response that mediates reduced viral load with a broad impact on viral amino acid diversity.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated by using paired host-HCV genomic data that host <italic>IFNL4</italic> gene, a cytokine that is part of the innate immune response and not expected to target specific viral residues, can mediate selection of amino acids at specific sites on the HCV polyprotein. We report that 1.4% (42/3021) of the HCV amino acids across the viral polyprotein are associated with host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 at a 5% FDR and that the impact on amino acid variation is spread across all viral proteins. In comparison, we previously reported that 0.7% of the HCV amino acids were associated with <italic>HLA</italic> class I and II alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ansari et al., 2017</xref>) at a 5% FDR. The only other major driver of HCV amino acid variation is the host B cell response, which is largely restricted to modifying amino acids in the envelope glycoproteins, in particular E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ball et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, although both arms of the adaptive immune system direct amino acid selection through pressure on epitopes recognised by T and B cell responses to infection, our results show that the innate immune response also has the capacity to drive particular polymorphisms in HCV-encoded proteins and that its impact is comparable to that of the T cell response (as indicated by HCV amino acid variants associated with HLA alleles).</p><p>Given that we did not observe any significant enhancement or depletion of association signals in a specific viral protein or in HLA-restricted epitopes, IFN-λ4 may exert its impact through a previously unknown mechanism or at more than one stage of the virus life cycle. We anticipate that this would result from distinct host responses in those who carry genetic variants that lead to IFN-λ4 synthesis as compared to individuals who carry the pseudogenized form of the gene. In common with other IFNs, IFN-λ4 induces a large number of ISGs, many of which are largely unstudied or poorly characterised. Within such an environment, it is possible that subtle selection of certain amino acids along the polyprotein will provide an advantage for viral entry, RNA replication, virion assembly and release.</p><p>Although there was no significant enrichment of associations comparing the structural with the non-structural proteins, the E2 glycoprotein contained the highest proportion of sites affected by <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860. From mapping these sites onto previously known functional domains on E2, we found that many residues were located either in hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) or on the surface of the protein. Indeed, some sites coincided with epitopes that are targets for the antibody response or have a role in virus entry (Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Since the host response to HCV genotype 3a infection induces pathways including those affecting B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>), we do not exclude the possibility that <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotype either influences B cell response to infection or the process of virus binding and entry. Indeed, a recent report has demonstrated the emergence of variants in E2 during establishment of chronic infection that give enhanced resistance to interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wrensch et al., 2019</xref>). One of the E2 residues that encoded a different amino acid as chronicity developed was at position 500, which is an <italic>IFNL4</italic>-associated site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Given that IFITM proteins potently inhibit virus entry, it is possible that differences in IFITM induction between those who do and do not produce IFN-λ4 may account for some of the footprint observed in the E2 protein sequence. Moreover, IFITM proteins cooperate with anti-HCV neutralising antibodies to enhance restriction of virus entry. Therefore, there may be interaction between genes differentially regulated between IFN-λ4 producers and non-producers and components of the adaptive immune system, which together influence the amino acids encoded at certain <italic>IFNL4</italic>-associated sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wrensch et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To reduce any confounding effects due to population stratification, we limited our analysis to a homogenous population of self-reported white origin infected with HCV genotype 3. Thus, our observations cannot directly be extended to other human populations or other HCV genotypes. This study provides a foundation for future analysis on whether <italic>IFNL4</italic> genetic variation also drives diversity in other HCV genotypes and subtypes across other ethnic populations (also see ‘Adaptation of hepatitis C virus to interferon lambda polymorphism across multiple viral genotypes’ by Chaturvedi <italic>et al.</italic> in this issue). Additionally, our observations were performed with in vivo data; further functional studies using appropriate in vitro model systems are needed to understand how the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus drives HCV amino acid variation and modulates viral load. Such studies may also help to inform the basis for diversity and evolution of HCV in the presence or absence of <italic>IFNL4</italic>.</p><p>There are now multiple studies suggesting that the <italic>IFNL3-IFNL4</italic> locus could be a key player in the defense against viruses other than HCV. In HIV-infected patients, the rs368234815 variant has been associated with long-term non-progressor HIV-1 controllers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominguez-Molina et al., 2017</xref>). In influenza virus infection, <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs8099917 was associated with increased sero-conversion after influenza vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egli et al., 2014a</xref>). <italic>IFNL4</italic> variants have also been associated with bronchiolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scagnolari et al., 2012</xref>), cytomegalovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egli et al., 2014b</xref>) and Andes virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angulo et al., 2015</xref>) infections. These observations suggest that <italic>IFNL4</italic> possibly plays a role in many viral infections and immune related diseases in the liver and other organs. Investigating how IFN-λ4 (a cytokine without epitope specificity) drives amino acid selectivity in the HCV polyprotein would add a new dimension to how the human innate immune system interacts with viruses and controls infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient cohorts</title><p>For this study, we used patient data from the BOSON and EAP cohorts that have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foster et al., 2016</xref>).

R (version 3.4.3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) was then used to perform the PCA using the prcomp function with default settings. PCA was performed using flashpca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Inouye, 2014</xref>) for human genotype data.</p><p>Whole-genome viral consensus sequences for each patient were aligned using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) with default settings. This alignment was used to create a maximum-likelihood tree using RAxML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>), assuming a general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution under the gamma model of rate heterogeneity. The resulting tree was rooted at midpoint.</p><p>We used treeBreaker software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ansari and Didelot, 2016</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ansariazim/treeBreaker">https://github.com/ansariazim/treeBreaker</ext-link>) to measure the association between the virus phylogenetic tree and the host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP (CC vs. non-CC) and with the cohort from which the viral sequence was obtained (BOSON vs. EAP). This software uses a Bayesian model to infer whether the phenotype of interest is randomly distributed on the tips of the tree and to estimate which clades, if any, have a distinct distribution of the phenotype of interest from the rest of the tree. This software also performs Bayesian model comparison. It provides a Bayes factor for the alternative model (there is at least one or more branches with distinct distribution of the phenotype of interest) to the null model (there are no branches with distinct phenotype distribution on the tree). Bayes factor is a summary of the evidence provided by the data in favour of one model compared to another. In other words, the higher the Bayes factor, the more support there is for one model against another. Assuming that we are testing an alternative model against a null model, it has been suggested that the Bayes factor can be divided into four categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kass and Raftery, 1995</xref>). Bayes factor: 1 to 3.2, very little evidence against the null model. Bayes factor: 3.2 to 10, substantial evidence against null model and in favour of the alternative model. Bayes factor: 10 to 100, strong evidence against null model and in favour of the alternative model. Bayes factor:&gt;100, decisive evidence against null model and in favour of the alternative model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Association tests</title><p>The univariate association between the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 (CC vs. non-CC) and the viral PCs was tested using logistic regression in R. We used the qvalue function from the qvalue package in R to perform the FDR analysis.</p><p>To choose 500 SNPs across the human genome with minor allele frequency (MAF) similar to the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 MAF, we used Fisher’s exact test to compare all SNPs against the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 (2 × 3 contingency table where the columns indicate the number of 0, 1 and 2 copies of the minor allele and the rows indicate the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP and the target SNP counts) and chose the 500 SNPs with the largest P-values (least significance). SNPs in the <italic>IFNL3-IFNL4</italic> region were not included.</p><p>To test for association between the virus amino acids and the host SNPs we used logistic regression in R including as covariates the first three host and the first two viral PCs. We investigated presence and absence of each amino acid at all variable sites, given that the amino acid was present in at least 20 HCV sequences in our dataset. The presence and absence of the viral amino acid was used as the response variable and the host SNP coded as 0 (homozygous for major alleles) and 1 (all other genotypes) as the explanatory variable (the same coding as the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 CC vs. non-CC).</p><p>To test for enrichment or depletion of the association signals in a viral protein or the epitope regions, we used Fisher’s exact test. Each tested site is either within the target region or not and it is either classified as significant or not. The resulting 2 × 2 contingency table was tested using fisher.test function in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Codon level analysis</title><p>To separate the impact of the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 on amino acids from nucleotides we investigated the nucleotide sequences at the codon level. At each codon site (where the most common codon had at least 20 synonymous and 20 non-synonymous codons) we used logistic regression to test for association between <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 (CC vs. non-CC) and the changes from the most common codon to synonymous and non-synonymous codons. The <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 was denoted as the response variable and the codons were used as a categorical explanatory variable with three levels. The effect sizes (log(OR)) and P-values were estimated for the synonymous and non-synonymous codons relative to the most common codon. We included the first two viral PCs and the first three host PCs as covariates in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Di-nucleotides analysis</title><p>To estimate the viral dinucleotide frequencies, the observed proportion of each dinucleotide was normalised by its expected proportion (assuming the nucleotides are independent the expected proportion can be calculated by multiplying the observed proportions for the relevant nucleotides). To test for association with <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotype we used a linear regression where the normalised dinucleotide proportions were used as the response variable and the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotype as a categorical explanatory variable. We included the first two viral PCs and the first three host PCs as covariates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Effect of the three IFN-λ4 protein variants</title><p>To estimate the effect of the IFN-λ4 protein variants on the encoded HCV amino acids, we used the 76 sites associated with <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 at a 10% FDR. HCV-infected patients were classified into three groups according to their predicted ability to produce IFN-λ4 protein: (i) no IFN-λ4 (two allelic copies of IFN-λ4-Null, N<sub>BOSON</sub> = 145, N<sub>EAP</sub> = 41), (ii) IFN-λ4–S70 (two copies of IFN-λ4-S70 or one copy of IFN-λ4-S70 and one copy of IFN-λ4-Null, N<sub>BOSON</sub> = 48, N<sub>EAP</sub> = 7), and (iii) IFN-λ4-P70 (at least one copy of IFN-λ4-P70, N<sub>BOSON</sub> = 218, N<sub>EAP</sub> = 26). We then used logistic regression to estimate the effect sizes (log(OR)) for IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 on the virus amino acids relative to IFN-λ4-Null. The presence and absence of the reported viral amino acid was used as the response variable and the host IFN-λ4 status was used as the explanatory variable with the IFN-λ4-Null used as the base level and the log(OR) for IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 were estimated relative to the IFN-λ4-Null base level. We included the first two viral PCs and the first three host PCs as covariates to account for host-virus populations co-structuring.</p><p>To test whether the effect sizes of IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 on viral amino acids are the same, we used the above estimated effect sizes and fitted a linear regression line to it. One viral site (position 2371) was excluded from this analysis as it had unreliable effect size estimate (log(OR) = −17) for IFN-λ4-S70 variant. Under the null hypothesis that IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 have the same effect sizes, we would expect that the linear regression line to have a slope of one. To test whether the slope of the fitted line is different from one, we used R to fit a linear regression line with intercept of zero. We used bootstrapping to account for the uncertainty associated with the estimated effect sizes of IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 on viral amino acids. We simulated 10,000 bootstrap datasets where the effect sizes of each IFN-λ4 variant on each HCV amino acid were simulated using a normal distribution with mean set to the estimated effect size of the variant on that HCV amino acid and standard deviation set to the standard error of the estimate. For each dataset we fitted a linear regression with intercept of zero and estimated the slope of the fit. The empirical bootstrap 95% confidence interval of the slope of the line was estimated as [2* best_estimate_slope – 97.5%_quantile_of_bootstrap_slopes, 2* best_estimate_slope – 2.5%_quantile_of_bootstrap_slopes]. The ‘best_estimate_slope’ is the slope of the line estimated from the effect sizes without accounting for uncertainty.</p><p>To assess whether the mean viral load was different in the three patient groups of IFN-λ4-Null, IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70, we used a Bayesian framework to perform model comparison (see Appendix 1 for further details). The models we considered comprised fixed and independent effects between the IFN-λ4 variants. We standardised the log10(viral load) so that it had a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. We used linear regression to get maximum likelihood estimates of the effects of IFN-λ4-S70 and IFN-λ4-P70 variants relative to the IFN-λ4-Null variant. The estimates were adjusted for cirrhosis status and population structure including the first two viral PCs and the first three host PCs in the regression as covariates. For each effect size, we assumed a normally distributed prior on the log(OR) of association with mean of zero. The prior covariance matrix determined the prior model assumptions. The elements of the covariance matrix were chosen such that the relevant prior model was set (see Appendix 1 for details).</p><p>To assess the evidence for interaction between host IFN-λ4 variants and viral amino acid site 2414, we used the same Bayesian framework detailed above. The patients were grouped into six categories based on the host IFN-λ4 variants and the presence or absence of serine at viral site 2414. We standardised the log10(viral load) so that it had a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. We used linear regression to get maximum likelihood estimates of the effects of ‘IFN-λ4-Null + 2414 not serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 not serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-S70 + 2414 not serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-S70 + 2414 serine’ groups relative to the ‘IFN-λ4-Null + 2414 serine’ group. The estimates were adjusted for cirrhosis status and population structure including the first two viral PCs and the first three host PCs in the regression as covariates. The prior covariance matrix determined the prior model assumptions. The elements of the covariance matrix were chosen such that the relevant prior model was set (see Appendix 1 for details).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Materials and correspondence</title><p>Correspondence and material requests should be addressed by contacting STOP-HCV <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stop-hcv.ox.ac.uk/contact">http://www.stop-hcv.ox.ac.uk/contact</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Gilead Sciences for the provision of samples and data from the BOSON clinical study for use in these analyses and HCV Research UK (funded by the Medical Research Foundation [C0365]) for their assistance in handling and coordinating the release of samples for these analyses.

rs12979860</title><p>The first two viral PCs were clustered with clades on the virus phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The other PCs changed more gradually and were grouped to a lesser degree with specific clades on the tree. To explore any specific role for <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 on viral diversity, we tested whether any viral PCs were associated with SNP rs12979860 genotypes in a univariate analysis and observed that the fifth and seventh PCs were associated with <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b–d</xref>) respectively explaining 0.7% and 0.5% of the total variance in the nucleotide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether the observed associations between <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes and viral PCs were due to host-virus population co-structuring, we selected 500 SNPs across the human genome with frequencies similar to the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 SNP and tested for association between these SNPs and the viral PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). If host-virus populations co-structuring was responsible for the observed association between viral PCs and host <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes, we would expect these 500 SNPs to also correlate with fifth and seventh viral PCs. At a 10% FDR, none of the viral PCs were associated with any of the 500 frequency-matched SNPs. Overall, these results indicate that the observed association between <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes and the two viral PCs is a consequence of biological interaction between the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus and the virus sequences and not due to population structure or other systematic bias.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Amino acids associated with <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 genotypes within the viral protein E2</title><p>Twenty-six of the 76 sites (34%) associated with the <italic>IFNL4</italic> locus at 10% FDR lie within the E2 glycoprotein that is involved in virus entry and directly interacts with two critical cell surface receptors, CD81 and SR-BI. Almost half of these IFN-λ4-associated residues are present in the solved E2 core structure. Interestingly, each of these amino acids is located on the surface of E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kong et al., 2013</xref>). Residues 438, 442, 521, 524 and 546 lie on the neutralizing face of E2; four are in regions targeted by neutralizing antibodies known as Epitope II (aa436-446) and Epitope III (aa523-549), which contain CD81-receptor binding residues. Five residues 576, 576d, 577, 578 and 580 are located within the intergenotypic variable region (igVR) that has a role in virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albecka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCaffrey et al., 2011</xref>).

This is supported by a study where mutation of igVR residues to alanine reduced binding of non-neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pierce et al., 2016</xref>). For sites that are not present in the structure, eight lie within hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) (aa384-411), an immunodominant region of E2, and two are in hypervariable region 2 (HVR2) (aa474-482). Residue 399 in the HVR1 has been implicated in receptor interaction with SR-BI and heparan sulphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dao Thi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bartosch et al., 2005</xref>).

Residue 741 lies within the transmembrane domain (718-742).</p><p>While it is well-documented that type I IFNs can impact the B-cell response via direct and indirect mechanisms, there is little information regarding any influence by type III IFNs.

(2013)</xref>. The ABF differs from the Bayes Factor in that it depends on a normal approximation of the regression likelihood (up to a constant) as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wakefield (2007)</xref>. For each model of association we assume a prior on the effect size which is normally distributed around zero. By changing the prior covariance (or correlation) of effect sizes we can formally compare models. The ABF for each model is calculated as the ratio of the approximate marginal likelihood of that model to that of the null model where all the prior weight is on an effect size of zero; note that the ABF for the null model is then equal to 1. Under the assumption that exactly one of the models is correct and all models are equally likely a priori, the posterior probability of a given model is calculated as the ABF for that model divided by the sum of the ABFs for all models under consideration.</p><p>Calculation of the marginal likelihood requires specification of a prior distribution for the effects as well as maximum likelihood (ML) point estimates of these effects with their asymptotic standard errors. As a concrete example, let us use the IFN-λ4 variants effects on viral load. Using a linear regression we estimate the two effect sizes for IFN-λ4-P70 and IFN-λ4-S70 relative to the IFN-λ4-Null variant and their asymptomatic standard error. These estimates are adjusted for cirrhosis status and population structure by including the fist two viral PCs and the first three host PCs. We then define the covariance prior matrix which in this case is a 2 × 2 matrix indicating the correlation and variances of effect sizes of IFN-λ4-S70 and IFN-λ4-P70 relative to the IFN-λ4-Null variant. The five tested models and their priors are as follows:</p><p>1) Both IFN-λ4-S70 and IFN-λ4-P70 have effect sizes of zero (their effects on viral load are identical to the IFN-λ4-Null

investigate the interaction between <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotypes (CC vs. non-CC), viral load and site 2414 in the NS5A viral protein, we used the Bayesian approach detailed above. We divided the patients into six groups (the three variants of IFN-λ4 and presence or absence of serine at viral site 2414). We then fitted a linear regression with standardised log10(viral load) as the response variable and a categorical variable with the six levels as the explanatory variable. Five effect sizes and their standard error were estimated for the groups ‘IFN-λ4-Null + 2414 not serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 not serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-S70 + 2414 not serine’, ‘IFN-λ4-S70 + 2414 serine’ relative to the ‘IFN-λ4-Null + 2414 serine’ group. We then used the prior covariance matrix (a 5 × 5 matrix) to define 58 models of association (from all effect sizes being zero to all being different). The posterior probability for each model was estimated as described above. Model five, where only the ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 serine’ group had an effect size different from the other groups was the most supported (posterior probability = 0.33). Twelve other models had posterior probabilities greater than their prior probabilities. In all these models, the ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 serine’ group had an effect size different from the base group. The marginal posterior probability of all the models in which the effect size of group ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 serine’ is different from the ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 not serine’ is 0.98. Furthermore the marginal posterior probability of all the models in which the effect size of the ‘IFN-λ4-P70 + 2414 serine’ is different from the ‘IFN-λ4-S70 + 2414 serine’ is 0.97.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42463.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>O'Brien</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previously, Ansari et al. reported results of a genome-to-genome study of 542 individuals who were chronically infected with HCV (predominantly viral genotype (VGT) 3, but also VGT 2; Ansari et al., 2017). Genotype for the <italic>IFNL4</italic> rs12979860 SNP marker associated with 11 amino acid polymorphisms on the HCV polyprotein (60, 109 [C]; 500, 501, 576d, 578, 741 [E2]; 2414 [NS5A]; 2570, 2576, 2991 [NS5B]) based on a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). The strongest association was for 2570 in NS5B; residue 2414 in NS5A associated with HCV RNA levels amongst patients infected with VGT 3a. The present paper, which is restricted to the 485 subjects who were infected with VGT 3a, contains important new data, but the analytical approach used to arrive at these conclusions is complicated and often confusing. A more focused and unified presentation of the results is needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Ansari et al. have now imputed genotype for <italic>IFNL4</italic> rs368234815, which controls generation of the IFN-λ4 protein, and <italic>IFNL4</italic> rs117648444, a non-synonymous polymorphism that defines a structural variant of the IFN-λ4 protein. Haplotypes comprised of these variants generate different versions of the IFN-λ4 protein. The authors report that variation in the HCV genome and HCV RNA levels associate with these different haplotypes, consistent with previous associations between these functional <italic>IFNL4</italic> haplotypes and HCV clearance. This finding is novel and potentially important, as it would provide additional support that the IFN activity of <italic>IFNL4</italic> affects the observed phenotype.</p><p>This finding raises some additional questions:</p><p>Re: the effect of the <italic>IFNL4</italic> loci on viral load, does that translate directly to a lower level of viral replication in patients with <italic>IFNL4</italic> P70? Might this be investigated from the diversity of the viral quasi-species found in the patient?</p><p>Re: the coupling between <italic>IFNL4</italic> P70 and S2414 in the HCV genome, is <italic>IFNL4</italic> P70 driving selection of a specific amino acid at this position?</p><p>In the Nature Genetics paper, <italic>IFNL4</italic> rs12979860 associated with 11 amino acid polymorphisms, but now, in a smaller cohort, that SNP apparently associates with 42 sites (both based on a 5% FDR). The authors should explain the reason for that striking difference and comment more generally about how findings from the current paper differ from the previous publication. Similarly, the paper should be clearer on which data and results are original to this paper with previously published data referenced to the Nature Genetics paper.</p><p>The value of including the Expanded Access Programme (EAP) subjects is unclear. EAP contributes only ~15% of the total subjects and differs from the BOSON group regarding important demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, prevalence of cirrhosis, HCV RNA levels), as well as genotype frequencies of rs12979860. If EAP subjects are retained in the revised paper, these differences should be considered in the analysis and addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>The reviewers have many questions and concerns about the statistical methods and the analyses.</p><p>Multiple testing: FDRs of either 5% or 20%, as well as Bonferroni correction are employed. Unless there are compelling reasons for these different approaches (which should be stated), a uniform approach to multiple testing adjustment should be used. The Abstract states rs12979860 genotype associated with 4% of viral amino acid sites across the HCV polyprotein. Based on the discussion (that finding does not appear in the results), this result is based on a 20% FDR, whereas findings presented in the Results (and the previous paper) are based on a 5% FDR. A 20% FDR seems very high and needs to be justified.</p><p>Genomic inflation factor for <italic>IFNL4</italic> rs12979860 and 500 SNPs with similar frequencies: The genome inflation factor (represented by λ) is used to examine assumptions re: cryptic relatedness when a large set of SNP markers are tested for association with a dichotomous trait in a GWAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11315092%20https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019416">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11315092 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019416</ext-link>), but it is unclear what is being analyzed here – association of viral variants with a trait (yes or no host SNP)? Are the assumptions about the distribution of viral variants the same as for distribution of host germline variants, for which this approach was developed? This is not a standard approach to test for unaccounted population structure or other biases and the logic for doing this is unclear.

While lower viral replication (i.e. replication of viral RNA) could contribute to reduced viral load, we would not exclude a contribution from other parts of the viral life cycle, especially since the <italic>IFNL4</italic> footprint extends across both structural and non-structural proteins. Studies on the effects on viral RNA replication would require further analysis. However, during the review process, we are aware of a new report from Thomas Baumert’s group which reveals interplay between the innate immune response (IFITM proteins) and neutralization antibodies (Wrensch et al., Hepatology in press) that affect virus entry. Moreover, their study shows there is a change in the amino acids encoded by E2 from acute to chronic infection that generates IFITM-resistance. One of the sites that changes is at position 500 in the E2 protein, which is a position associated with <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotype in our study (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Thus there could be differences in the interferon response dependent on <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotype (i.e. producers vs. non-producers) that affects stages of the virus life cycle other than RNA replication (e.g. virus entry as in the Wrensch et al. paper or also translation, assembly and release). All of the above is addressed in the Discussion. As to the second point raised by the reviewer about whether lower viral load may influence the diversity of quasispecies, our analysis has not investigated the viral quasispecies in individuals (i.e. intra-host viral diversity); all of our analysis has been conducted on the consensus sequences and in this way, we have examined inter-host viral diversity. We agree with the reviewer that any reduction in viral load mediated by <italic>IFNL4</italic>-P70 could influence the quasispecies at the intra-host level. However, this would require a deeper analysis of the sequence data, preferably combined with functional in vitro studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Re: the coupling between IFNL4 P70 and S2414 in the HCV genome, is IFNL4 P70 driving selection of a specific amino acid at this position?</p></disp-quote><p>Since there is a significant association between serine at position 2414 and <italic>IFNL4</italic>-P70 variant, our interpretation would be that <italic>IFNL4</italic>-P70 does exert selection of S2414. However, this is potentially true also for the other associated sites that have statistical significance. This point is made in the revised Abstract (see final sentence). However, specifically in relation to S2414, we have added the following sentence to the paper: “The viral serine (S) residue at site 2414 (S2414) was significantly enriched in <italic>IFNL4</italic>-P70 carrying patients compared to <italic>IFNL4</italic>-S70 (P = 3.39x10<sup>-03</sup>) and <italic>IFNL4</italic>-Null (P = 5.94x10<sup>-09</sup>) carrying patients. S2414 was present in 86% (211/244) of IFNL-P70 carrying patients, 69% (38/55) of <italic>IFNL4</italic>-S70 carrying patients and 62% (114/185) of <italic>IFNL4</italic>-Null carrying patients.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Nature Genetics paper, IFNL4 rs12979860 associated with 11 amino acid polymorphisms, but now, in a smaller cohort, that SNP apparently associates with 42 sites (both based on a 5% FDR). The authors should explain the reason for that striking difference and comment more generally about how findings from the current paper differ from the previous publication. Similarly, the paper should be clearer on which data and results are original to this paper with previously published data referenced to the Nature Genetics paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous analysis in the Nature Genetics paper used 542 samples from individuals with different ethnic backgrounds (the two main ethnic groups were white [n=452] and Asian [n=74]). Additionally these individuals were infected by HCV genotypes 2 (n=45) and 3 (n=496) with different subtypes (gt3a, gt3b and gt3c). That study was aimed mainly at identifying any human genes that may be associated with viral polymorphisms. Not surprisingly, we identified viral variants that were linked to HLA alleles. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotype was also associated with variants in the virus polyprotein. However, the depth of the study was limited by the mixture of ethnicities and viral genotypes/subtypes in the BOSON cohort. We believe that our current report does not simply confirm the findings in the Nature Genetics paper but expands and enhances the extent of the footprint of <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotype on variants in the viral polyprotein.</p><p>With regard to the increased number of associated sites, there are two major factors compared to our previous report that contribute to this enhancement. Firstly, in the current paper, we have limited the dataset to individuals with self-reported white ancestry infected with HCV gt3a to avoid potential bias due to co-structuring between host and virus populations. To increase the power of the study, we included 74 patients from another cohort, the EAP cohort, who were also of white ethnicity and infected with gt3a. This gave a total of 485 patients with identical ethnic background and infection with the same HCV genotype/subtype. As with any GWAS study, confidence in statistically significant associations is greater with more data and this was a major factor for inclusion of the EAP group. The EAP and BOSON cohorts do differ with regard to severity of liver disease; the EAP cohort consists largely of patients with decompensated cirrhosis while the BOSON cohort were recruited on the basis of milder disease. We did not find that differences in disease severity affected our analysis (see below). Therefore, the associations between <italic>IFNL4</italic> genotype and viral variants in gt3a apparently apply irrespective of the extent of liver disease.</p><p>The second important difference between the two studies is that in the Nature Genetics paper we used a different methodology to analyse the impact of SNP rs12979860 on the viral variants. In the Nature Genetics paper, we used phylogenetically corrected Fisher’s exact test to measure associations and account for population structure. For this method we inferred the phylogenetic tree of the viral sequence data, estimated ancestral viral sequences and compared them to the viral sequences at the tips of the tree. The presence and absence of changes was then tested for association with SNP rs12979860. However, in the current study we apply logistic regression and account for population structure by including viral and host genetic PCs as covariates in the analysis. This approach has recently been shown to be more powerful to detect association in genome-to-genome analysis (Correcting for Population Stratification Reduces False Positive and False Negative Results in Joint Analyses of Host and Pathogen Genomes; DOI=10.3389/fgene.2018.00266). Thus, focusing on a homogenous population (white ethnicity infected with gt3a) and using logistic regression has increased the power of our study to detect many more associations between the SNP rs12979860 and the HCV amino acids.</p><p>We have now expanded the second paragraph in the Discussion to compare the findings in this study with those in the Nature Genetics paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The value of including the Expanded Access Programme (EAP) subjects is unclear. EAP contributes only ~15% of the total subjects and differs from the BOSON group regarding important demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, prevalence of cirrhosis, HCV RNA levels), as well as genotype frequencies of rs12979860. If EAP subjects are retained in the revised paper, these differences should be considered in the analysis and addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the EAP group represents a lesser proportion of the cohort, our aim has been to gather as many well-characterised samples in terms of viral sequence and clinical data as possible. As stated above, increasing the scale of the group under study enhances the confidence in any statistical analysis for identifying associations. Moreover, the viral sequence data was generated by similar methods in Oxford and Glasgow using target enrichment probe sets and next generation sequencing. The viral sequence data generated does not use HCV-specific primers and so the sequences produced are not biased. Putting together such a large number of sequences covering almost the entire length of the viral genome is not a trivial task. Additionally, we tested and found no association between the HCV phylogenetic tree (which estimates the population structure of the virus) and the host INFL4 SNP rs12979860 (using treeBreaker as indicated in the subsection “Host and virus genetic structures” and Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). Furthermore, we also performed all of the analysis in the BOSON cohort alone and found similar association results that are reported in the Materials and methods. Finally, we have performed an analysis testing for association between the cohort of origin of the patient and viral amino acid variants and found no significant associations (see below). Therefore, we believe that there are sound reasons for combining the BOSON and EAP cohorts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have many questions and concerns about the statistical methods and the analyses.</p><p>Multiple testing: FDRs of either 5% or 20%, as well as Bonferroni correction are employed. Unless there are compelling reasons for these different approaches (which should be stated), a uniform approach to multiple testing adjustment should be used. The Abstract states rs12979860 genotype associated with 4% of viral amino acid sites across the HCV polyprotein. Based on the discussion (that finding does not appear in the results), this result is based on a 20% FDR, whereas findings presented in the Results (and the previous paper) are based on a 5% FDR. A 20% FDR seems very high and needs to be justified.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we have modified the Abstract to remove the statement on association with 4% of viral amino acid sites across the viral polyprotein. In addition, we have modified the text to use 5% and 10% FDR thresholds throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Genomic inflation factor for IFNL4 rs12979860 and 500 SNPs with similar frequencies: The genome inflation factor (represented by λ) is used to examine assumptions re: cryptic relatedness when a large set of SNP markers are tested for association with a dichotomous trait in a GWAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11315092%20https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019416">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11315092 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019416</ext-link>), but it is unclear what is being analyzed here – association of viral variants with a trait (yes or no host SNP)? Are the assumptions about the distribution of viral variants the same as for distribution of host germline variants, for which this approach was developed? This is not a standard approach to test for unaccounted population structure or other biases and the logic for doing this is unclear. Can the authors provide a reference to support use of this method?</p><p>A λ value of 2.16 is extremely high and indicates cryptic relatedness, but in this case that statistic is impossible to interpret it because the approach is not described adequately.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to simplify this section. We have tested presence and absence of each viral variant (amino acid or codon) against host SNPs (the rs12979860 SNP was converted to binary variables to indicate CC vs. non-CC genotypes and the other 500 SNPs with similar frequencies were similarly converted to binary variables to indicate homozygous for major allele vs. other genotypes). In other words we have performed 501 viral GWASs and in each GWAS the trait of interest is a host SNP (SNP rs12979860 and 500 other SNPs with similar frequencies).</p><p>In this revised version of the manuscript, we decided to present the results differently and to remove the genomic inflation factor. We have observed 42 association signals with <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 at a 5% FDR, whilst 491 of the 500 SNPs with a similar allele frequency showed no association signal and 9 showed only one association signal. If host-virus population co-structuring was contributing to our results, we would expect to observe similar patterns between HCV amino acid variants and the other host SNPs frequency-matched to <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP. Similarly, only the <italic>IFNL4</italic> SNP rs12979860 showed a distribution of observed P-values different from the distribution of P-values for a null hypothesis of no associations, as shown on the qqplots. We moved the qqplot figure to a figure supplement and added a Manhattan plot of the associations (Figure 1).</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s question, we detail as follows our assumptions for the genomic inflation factor as presented in the earlier version. For each of the viral GWASs against the 500 frequency-matched host SNPs, we calculated a genomic inflation factor. Only the viral GWAS with SNP rs12979860 as the outcome variable had inflated P-values, while none of viral GWASs with any other host SNP (outside of the IFNLs loci) as the outcome variable had inflated P-values. If co-structuring of host and virus populations or cryptic relatedness or other systematic biases were driving the inflation in the P-values of viral GWAS against host rs12979860 SNP, we would expect to observe the same effect for other host SNPs. As Figure 1—figure supplement 6A show, our viral GWAS P-values against all other host SNPs follow the expected null hypothesis of no association.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Principal component analysis: What is used for PCA in the host?

Choosing a low FDR will ensure that there are very few false positives, but setting a low FDR value also risks reducing the number of true positives. In the present version of the manuscript, we decided to report both 5% and 10% FDR thresholds. The reason for doing so is that a large number of associated viral amino acids were required for analyses to be performed with sufficient power. This could only be achieved with a 10% FDR. In our previous publication, we also used two different FDR thresholds (5% and 20%). The lower 5% FDR is applied in this present work to help with comparisons to our previous report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Normality of viral load data: It is not clear from a visual inspection of the Q-Q plot that these data are normally distributed.

However, in large data sets (which is the case for our study), most statistical methods rely on the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the average of a large number of independent random variables is approximately normally distributed around the true population mean. It is this normal distribution of an average that underlies the validity of the t-test and linear regression, but also of logistic regression and of most software for the Wilcoxon and other rank tests.</p><p>The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution (Lumley et al.
