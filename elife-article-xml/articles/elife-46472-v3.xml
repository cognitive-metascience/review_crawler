We nominated the trace amine-associated receptor 1 gene, <italic>Taar1</italic>, as the strongest candidate and identified regulation of the mu-opioid receptor 1 gene, <italic>Oprm1</italic>, as another contributor. This study exploited CRISPR-Cas9 to test the causal role of <italic>Taar1</italic> in methamphetamine intake and a genetically-associated thermal response to methamphetamine. The methamphetamine-related traits were rescued, converting them to levels found in methamphetamine-avoiding animals. We used a family of recombinant inbred mouse strains for interval mapping and to examine independent and epistatic effects of <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic>. Both methamphetamine intake and the thermal response mapped to <italic>Taar1</italic> and the independent effect of <italic>Taar1</italic> was dependent on genotype at <italic>Oprm1</italic>. Our findings encourage investigation of the contribution of <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> variants to human methamphetamine addiction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46472.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People who misuse drugs often do so partly in response to the environment they find themselves in, and partly because of their genetics. The genetic component of someone’s risk is influenced by many different genes, and most research has found that each gene has a small individual effect. A method called quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis can help find parts of the genome that influence someone’s risk of misusing drugs. In 2013, researchers found one region on chromosome 10 in mice has a particularly large influence on how much methamphetamine an individual mouse will ingest if the drug was available in one of its two water bottles. A gene called <italic>Taar1</italic> was particularly important in this region and another gene, called <italic>Oprm1</italic>, may also play a significant role.</p><p>When the <italic>Taar1</italic> gene is switched off, mice consume larger amounts of methamphetamine, have a heightened reward response from the drug, and are insensitive to the adverse effects – such as hypothermia. But whether <italic>Taar1</italic> directly caused these effects, and whether <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> interact, had not yet been determined. If these genes played a causal role, they could be useful targets for treatment of methamphetamine-use disorder.</p><p>Stafford, Reed et al. – who include several of the researchers involved in the 2013 work – now report that when a particular variant of <italic>Taar1</italic> was present in mice they consumed large amounts of methamphetamine. The variant codes for a faulty version of a receptor protein. When this variant was replaced with a working version using gene editing, the mice consumed less methamphetamine and also became sensitive to hypothermia induced by the drug. This confirms that this gene does play a causal role in methamphetamine consumption and hypothermia. Next, Stafford, Reed et al. tested mice with different combinations of variants of <italic>Oprm1</italic> and <italic>Taar1</italic> to see how the genes interacted. The results showed that the effects of <italic>Taar1</italic> on both consumption of the drug and hypothermia depended on the <italic>Oprm1</italic> variant present.</p><p>The findings suggest that variants of these two genes in humans could influence an individual’s risk of addiction to methamphetamine. It is possible that in future the disorder could be treated by drugs that modify the brain activity impacted by these receptors. But first, it will be important to find out if these genes play a similar role in humans as they do in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trace amine-associated receptor 1</kwd><kwd>mu-opioid receptor</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9</kwd><kwd>self administration</kwd><kwd>hypothermia</kwd><kwd>addiction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA046081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Tamara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 DA018165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janowsky</surname><given-names>Aaron J</given-names></name><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Tamara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DA041579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Tamara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DA044223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01BX002106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Tamara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01BX002758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janowsky</surname><given-names>Aaron J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01BX003279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neve</surname><given-names>Kim A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006668</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health &amp;

MA is the most widely abused psychostimulant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chomchai and Chomchai, 2015</xref>), and the consequences of MA addiction pose major societal and health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2019</xref>). MA-associated deaths in the United States were relatively stable between 2005 and 2013, but have since been on an increasing trajectory, rising from about 3600 individuals in 2013 to almost 11,000 in 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2018</xref>). Discovering and understanding genetic factors that contribute to MA addiction risk, and uncovering the linked molecular and cellular processes, may help to curb this trend and improve interventions and long-term treatment success.</p><p>Whereas use of large human cohorts is effective at mapping loci and nominating candidate genes, precise experimental control over genetic composition, development, and drug exposure history is practical only in animal models. Evidence that mouse models continue to contribute critical information to our understanding of pathological conditions was recently reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadeau and Auwerx, 2019</xref>). Selected lines of rodents have been derived to model genetic risk factors for drug use. These include, particularly, those bred for various drug intake phenotypes, such as our mice bred for different amounts of voluntary MA intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hitzemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). In previous studies, we demonstrated a strong genetic contribution to level of voluntary MA consumption using multiple replicate sets of mice that we bidirectionally, selectively bred for MA high drinking (MAHDR) and MA low drinking (MALDR), which for simplicity are also referred to here as the ‘high’ and ‘low’ lines. Multiple lines of evidence support the involvement of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 gene, <italic>Taar1</italic>, in differences in MA intake, including: quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in the high and low lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belknap et al., 2013</xref>); the direct agonist activity of MA at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunzow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolinsky et al., 2007</xref>); the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <italic>Taar1</italic> (<italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic>) that renders the receptor it expresses (TAAR1) non-functional in response to MA and to other direct agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2016</xref>); fixation of the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> allele in high line mice of all five replicates, and retention of the wildtype, <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> allele in all low line replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>); greater level of MA intake in <italic>Taar1</italic> knockout mice compared to wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>); strong association of <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype with MA intake in multiple genetic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>); and strong association of <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype with additional MA-related traits that correspond with level of MA intake, including level of sensitivity to MA-induced hypothermia and conditioned taste aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the current studies, to demonstrate a causal role for <italic>Taar1</italic>, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to replace the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> allele found in high line mice with the <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> allele, creating a knock-in with functional TAAR1. These mice were then tested for MA consumption in comparison to an unaltered high line control, with the prediction that knock-in of <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> would reduce MA intake. In addition, we tested knock-in and control mice for MA-induced change in body temperature to determine if this gene has a pleiotropic effect on this MA trait. We predicted that insertion of the <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> allele would increase sensitivity to MA-induced hypothermia in the knock-in mice.</p><p>Our existing data indicate that <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype has a major impact on MA consumption, and gene mapping results demonstrate that a chromosome 10 QTL, at the location of <italic>Taar1</italic>, accounts for as much as 60% of the genetic variance in risk for MA intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belknap et al., 2013</xref>). Other undefined variants must account for the remaining genetic variance. We previously examined the µ-opioid receptor 1 gene, <italic>Oprm1</italic>, as a quantitative trait gene (QTG) residing at the proximal end of mouse chromosome 10, but it was eliminated as a risk factor for MA intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eastwood et al., 2018</xref>). Although <italic>Oprm1</italic> variants do not predict risk, <italic>Oprm1</italic> is involved in MA consumption via regulation by a top-ranked transcription factor network of genes that is differentially expressed between the MA drinking lines. We found that <italic>Oprm1</italic> and its product, the µ-opioid receptor (MOP-r), are more highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex of low line mice, relative to high line mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belknap et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eastwood et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, when MOP-r agonists were given to high line mice to test the hypothesis that increased MOP-r-regulated activity reduces MA intake, the acquisition of MA intake was attenuated, simulating the voluntary intake phenotype of the low line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eastwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eastwood and Phillips, 2014a</xref>). High line mice possess the same mutant <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> genotype as their progenitor DBA/2J (D2) strain and are more likely to also possess the <italic>Oprm1</italic> variant from the D2 strain, due to the relatively close proximity of <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> on chromosome 10 (17 Mb apart). Due to this linkage, we have been unable to explore independent and interactive effects of the <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotypes on MA intake or other MA-related traits in the MA drinking lines. Instead, we explored this in the present studies, using a family of related recombinant inbred mouse strains derived from a C57BL/6J (B6) x D2 inbred strain intercross (collectively the BXD strains) in which the linkage is disrupted. We examined the independent and interactive effects of these genes on MA intake and sensitivity to MA-induced change in body temperature, and performed QTL mapping for both traits using the BXD strain data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knock-in of <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> converts high MA intake to low MA intake</title><p>We predicted that MA intake would be reduced in high line mice in which the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> allele was removed and replaced with the <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> allele.

Furthermore, oral consumption, like other routes of administration, can lead to dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galloway et al., 2010</xref>). On average, mice with absent TAAR1 function consume about 6 mg/kg/18h from a 40 mg/l MA solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hitzemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). High line mice will consume an average of as much as 14 mg/kg/18h, when MA is offered as a 140 mg/l concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shabani et al., 2016</xref>).

Whereas the half-life of MA is shorter in rodents compared to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2001</xref>), relevant levels of MA are attained in our mouse model, with locomotor stimulant effects observed in the high line mice at consumed doses as low as 0.4 mg/kg in 1h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shabani et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>In rats with functional TAAR1, TAAR1 agonists delivered systemically or to specific subregions of the mesocorticolimbic system, decreased MA seeking and cocaine seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pei et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that treatments that increase TAAR1 activity could be beneficial therapeutics. However, when TAAR1 is non-functional, receptor agonists are not an option, leaving us to consider downstream mechanisms of TAAR1 activation. Details of the mechanisms enlisted by TAAR1 activation remain elusive. Expressing TAAR1 using a heterologous expression system to identify its messenger system(s) has proved difficult, potentially due to the predominant intracellular localization of the receptor. Studying the function of TAAR1 is also complicated by the lack of good quality antibodies and selective antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rutigliano et al., 2017</xref>). There is one available TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradaia et al., 2009</xref>), but it has a high rate of clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rutigliano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stalder et al., 2011</xref>) and poor solubility, which limit in vivo use. Our attempts to develop better antagonists with chemist collaborators have not yet met with success, and other investigators in the field have had a similar experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One strategy that could be considered for reducing MA consumption is to target mechanisms that are impacted by the absence of TAAR1 function. For example, TAAR1 modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Espinoza et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindemann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Revel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xie and Miller, 2008</xref>), and recently has been implicated in glutamatergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Espinoza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Espinoza et al., 2015b</xref>). High line mice are hyperglutamatergic at baseline, compared to low line mice, in both the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). They also exhibit a larger glutamate response to MA in the NAc, but not mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lominac et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szumlinski et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, compared to low line mice, high line mice have blunted dopamine levels in both the NAc and mPFC, and exhibit a heightened dopaminergic response to MA in the mPFC, but not NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lominac et al., 2014</xref>). Whether these differences are related to <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype is unknown, but they suggest certain manipulations to be examined for their role in MA intake.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Genetic basis for MA-induced thermal response</title><p>Our previous findings in the MA drinking lines demonstrated that the thermal response to MA is genetically-correlated with level of MA consumption. Thus, high line mice are resistant to the hypothermic effect of MA, whereas low line mice are highly sensitive to this effect of MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we performed QTL analysis using data from the BXD strains and identified a significant QTL on chromosome 10 for the effect of MA on body temperature. This QTL is in the SNP-poor region of chromosome 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2016</xref>), where we mapped the QTL for MA consumption in the MA drinking lines and BXD strains. QTL mapping was previously performed in BXD strains for the effects of 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg MA on body temperature recorded 48 min after administration. Although a QTL was mapped on chromosome 10 for the 4 mg/kg dose, it was considerably distal to the current QTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grisel et al., 1997</xref>), and not likely to be the same one for several reasons. First, the MA doses and time after administration were considerably different from those in our studies. But, more importantly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grisel et al. (1997)</xref> paper was published well before the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> mutation arose in D2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>); therefore, all of the BXD strains in that study shared the common <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> genotype. We have confirmed the <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> genotype of many of the BXD strains that were derived prior to when the mutation appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relationship between MA consumption and body temperature</title><p>Sensitivity to MA-induced hypothermia corresponds with low levels of MA consumption in MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> knock-in mice, MALDR line mice, the wildtype littermates of <italic>Taar1</italic> knockout mice, and BXD strains with the <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> genotype. These data could indicate that <italic>Taar1</italic> has independent pleiotropic effects on the two traits. Another possibility is that the subjective experience of MA-induced hypothermia in mice with functional TAAR1 limits MA consumption, thereby playing a protective role. Not known is whether MA-induced hypothermia is subjectively unpleasant. However, hypothermia prolonged the associative period during which aversion could be conditioned in a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Misanin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Misanin et al., 2002</xref>), and mice with functional TAAR1 form MA-induced CTA, whereas those without functional TAAR1 do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shabani et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). Low line and high line mice voluntarily consume similar amounts of MA on the first day that MA is offered, but low line mice then decrease consumption on the subsequent day, and remain at low intake levels from then on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eastwood et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shabani et al., 2012a</xref>). It is possible that initial MA consumption induces hypothermia in low line mice, so that initial MA consumption is associated with this potentially unpleasant physiological effect, and reduces the desire to consume more MA. Additional research is needed to determine if MA drinking produces changes in body temperature, as occurs in response to an IP injection of MA.</p><p>Regardless of the chicken-egg question, the <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> allele replacement in high line mice produced MA intake levels like those found in low line mice, indicating that this gene has a major role in determining level of MA intake. Similarly, both the pattern and magnitude of hypothermic response to MA in the knock-in mice resembled those of low line mice. Low line mice had a maximal response of 1–2°C (depending upon replicate line) after treatment with 2 mg/kg MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>), and the response in the knock-in mice was also maximal at 30 min and of about 1.2°C. Therefore, <italic>Taar1</italic> appears also to have a primary role in the hypothermic response to MA. However, <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype does not impact basal body temperature, nor the hypothermic response to ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>). Further, the <italic>Taar1</italic> mutation does not appear to affect locomotor activity at baseline or in response to the 2 mg/kg dose of MA used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>), making it unlikely that differences in thermal response to MA in mice with different <italic>Taar1</italic> genotypes are due to differences in movement after treatment.</p><p>In addition to the significant QTL on chromosome 10 for MA intake and MA-induced thermal response, we identified other genomic regions at the suggestive level of significance.

There may be additional alleles that account for smaller amounts of genetic variance that our analysis did not have the power to detect.

For both traits, the <italic>Oprm1<sup>D2/D2</sup></italic> mice exhibited the more robust effects, compared to <italic>Oprm1<sup>B6/B6</sup></italic> mice, and <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype had an impact only in mice with the stronger MA trait. Thus, <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic>/<italic>Oprm1<sup>D2/D2</sup></italic> mice consumed more MA than <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic>/<italic>Oprm1<sup>B6/B6</sup></italic> mice, and <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>Oprm1<sup>D2/D2</sup></italic> mice showed greater MA-induced hypothermia compared to <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>/<italic>Oprm1<sup>B6/B6</sup></italic> mice. Low levels or absence of the MA-related phenotype could preclude the <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype from having an effect. This interaction between <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> was supported by composite interval QTL mapping for MA-induced body temperature change, in which controlling for <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype resulted in a significantly increased LOD score, specifically for the chromosome 10 QTL. For MA intake, the LOD score increase did not meet the significance threshold, but the strong statistical trend deserves further consideration, which could be accomplished by testing more BXD strains of appropriate genotypes, as they become available, to increase power.</p><p>When we assessed the independent associations of each genotype with these MA-related traits, significant correlations were found only with <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype.

One possible mechanism to explore relates to differential <italic>Oprm1</italic> expression. A polymorphism in the promoter region of <italic>Oprm1</italic> was related to promoter activity, in which D2 mice had greater <italic>Oprm1</italic> promoter activity compared to B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 2006</xref>).

Thus, the hypothesis that greater <italic>Oprm1</italic> expression results in greater MA-induced hypothermia in <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> genotype mice is consistent with these findings, but the hypothesis that greater <italic>Oprm1</italic> expression results in greater MA intake in <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> genotype mice is not consistent with the existing data. In fact, greater MA intake is associated with reduced prefrontal cortex <italic>Oprm1</italic> and MOP-r expression in the high line, and peripheral application of drugs that increase MOP-r activity reduced MA consumption in high line mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eastwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eastwood and Phillips, 2014a</xref>).

The total volume consumption difference between <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> and <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice was small, compared to their robust difference for MA intake. Furthermore, the interactive effect of <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> was specific to MA intake. We previously reported greater total fluid intake in high line mice, compared to low line mice, of about the same magnitude (~0.5 ml) in some, but not all, replicate sets of lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hitzemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shabani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). Locomotor behavior has been found to be positively associated with MA intake in the low and high lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shabani et al., 2012a</xref>), and larger intake volumes in mice consuming more MA could be related to stimulant effects that impact fluid needs. But, because a difference in total fluid intake has not always been found, another interpretation is that, due to greater reinforcing effects of MA in mice of the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> genotype, such as the high line mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shabani et al., 2012a</xref>), avidity for MA is greater, leading to larger intake volumes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Body temperature differences unrelated to MA exposure</title><p>We observed some differences in body temperature between the knock-in and control mice that were unrelated to MA treatment. However, these baseline differences did not appear to account for the genotype-dependent MA response. Although the knock-in mice had higher baseline temperatures and therefore, a greater opportunity to experience a reduction in body temperature when treated with MA, the difference at baseline was of about 0.5°C, whereas the difference at 30 min post MA treatment was over 1°C. This was, in part, because the MA responses were qualitatively opposite, with the knock-in mice exhibiting decreases in body temperature, similar to MALDR mice, and the controls exhibiting a time-dependent increase, similar to MAHDR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Sex differences</title><p>In our previous studies, sex differences for MA consumption and the thermal response to MA were inconsistently found, and some are summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al.

Generally, when there have been differences, females have consumed about 15% or 0.5 mg/kg more MA than males, but in no case were there differences between the MAHDR and MALDR lines or between mice with the different <italic>Taar1</italic> genotypes in only one sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eastwood and Phillips, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shabani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, sex did not have a significant impact on genotype-dependent differences in MA consumption in the present studies. Similarly, there were some sex effects in the body temperature studies, but sex did not determine the pattern of response to saline vs. MA in each genotype across time. Thus, these sex effects did not impact overall interpretations of data for either trait.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Potential limitations</title><p>One consideration regarding <italic>Taar1</italic> involvement in MA consumption and MA thermal response is the potential for differential potency of agonists interacting with the two TAAR1 isoforms. However, our analyses indicate that the receptor expressed by <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> is non-functional, rather than sub-functional. Thus, the D2-like isoform of TAAR1, expressed by <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic>, exhibits no cAMP response to a wide range of MA concentrations, or to TAAR1-specific agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). If the <italic>Taar1</italic> mutation reduces potency of agonists, we would expect a shift in the agonist dose-response curve for cAMP accumulation. Further, at doses of MA up to 16 mg/kg, high line mice fail to exhibit MA-induced hypothermia, whereas low line mice exhibit hypothermia at doses as low as 1 mg/kg that reverses toward hyperthermia at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the hypothermic effect of MA via TAAR1 may compete with the expression of MA-induced hyperthermia occurring via a non-TAAR1 mechanism in low mice.</p><p>The gRNA used to produce the MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> knock-in mice was a perfect match for the sequence on either side of the chromosome 10 <italic>Taar1</italic> SNP, with imperfect mapping to some additional chromosomes. In our original QTL analysis for MA drinking and in the current analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), there were no significant or suggestive QTLs mapped to those additional chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belknap et al., 2013</xref>; and data herein). This suggests that if off-target deletions or insertions occurred at these locations, they would be unlikely to have the profound impact on the MA-related traits that we have observed. The chromosome 10 QTL accounts for 60% of the genetic variance in MA intake, and <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype-phenotype correlations range from r = 0.81 to 0.96 for 40 mg/L MA intake, and r = 0.71 to 0.82 for 2 mg/kg MA-induced hypothermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>; and data herein). Therefore, the large effects we observed would be expected for replacement of <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> with <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic>. The high line mice possess a genetically heterogeneous background; thus, sequencing the CRISPR knock-in and control mice would not provide specific information about off-target effects, because the existing genetic variation would not be separable from such effects. Further, there appears to be some consensus that off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9 are rare and indistinguishable from the background rate of de novo mutation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mianné et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakajima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Willi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The knock-in and control mice used in our studies were produced by independent breeding pairs.

Genetic variation in the human <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene has been associated with MA dependence/psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ide et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ide et al., 2006</xref>), but additional research results in this area have not appeared in the literature. The potential impact of human <italic>TAAR1</italic> genetic variation on risk for MA use or on the magnitude of MA-related phenotypes is not yet known. There are over 200 non-synonymous SNPs with the potential for missense variants in human <italic>TAAR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rutigliano et al., 2017</xref>) Initial examination of some of these human <italic>TAAR1</italic> variants indicates that TAAR1 proteins with variable levels of function are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). The success of TAAR1 agonists in treatment is dependent upon at least partial receptor function that can be enhanced. Whether human TAAR1 variants are relevant to MA use and addiction in humans, and whether TAAR1 agonists are a viable treatment option, are important research questions to pursue. Further, research into potential interactive effects between human <italic>TAAR1</italic> and <italic>OPRM1</italic> variants for their impact on MA use risk and response would be valuable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, females)</td><td valign="top">CD1/NCrl</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">Strain code: 022</td><td valign="top">foster dams for generation of knock-in mice</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, females and males)</td><td valign="top">BXD recombinant inbred strains</td><td valign="top">University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">original breeders from Dr. Robert Williams; offspring for research produced by Dr. Tamara Phillips at VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, females)</td><td valign="top">MAHDR</td><td valign="top">VAPORHCS</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">methamphetamine high drinking mice; created by Dr. Tamara Phillips; all are homozygous for SNP rs33645709</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, females and males)</td><td valign="top">MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic> control</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">created by Oregon Health &amp; Science University Transgenic Mouse Models Shared Resource; offspring for research produced by Dr. Tamara Phillips at VAPORHCS</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, females and males)</td><td valign="top">MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> knock-in</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">created by Oregon Health &amp; Science University Transgenic Mouse Models Shared Resource; offspring for research produced by Dr. Tamara Phillips at VAPORHCS</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">tail snip</td><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">obtained from breeders and research animals to determine genotype</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>Taar1</italic> gRNA</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">designed by ThermoFisher Scientific; reagent for generation of knock-in mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">100b oligo single strand DNA for <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> (ossDNA)</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">MGI:MGI2148258</td><td valign="top">synthesized by ThermoFisher Scientific; reagent for generation of knock-in mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Cas9 mRNA</td><td valign="top">TriLink</td><td valign="top">Catalog number: L-7606</td><td valign="top">reagent for generation of knock-in mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">primers for genotyping <italic>Oprm1</italic></td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">original reference for these primers: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferraro et al.

Numbers of BXD mice with the four potential combined <italic>Taar1/Oprm1</italic> genotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were n = 22–45/genotype/sex for MA intake, and n = 14–25/genotype/sex/MA dose for the body temperature study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Genotyping and sequencing</title><p>We previously established and described genotyping methods for the <italic>Taar1</italic> SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). Genomic DNA was extracted from ear punch or tail snip samples, using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA). For samples from the BXD mice and the original mice created by the CRISPR-Cas9 procedure, the <italic>Taar1</italic> region was PCR amplified using a Hotstart DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), with sequence-specific primers surrounding the region of interest (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref> for details). PCR products were sequenced at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University Sequencing Core and aligned with the mouse <italic>Taar1</italic> sequence (NM_053205.1) to identify which allele(s) was present based on the rs33645709 SNP.

For the body temperature studies, saline and MA were administered by intraperitoneal injection at a volume of 10 ml/kg body weight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-bottle choice MA drinking</title><p>Methods were consistent with those we used to measure two-bottle choice MA intake during the production of the MA drinking lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hitzemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). During the initial two days of the study, mice had access to two tubes filled with tap water to familiarize them with the novel drinking apparatus. Starting on the third day, one water tube was replaced with a tube containing MA dissolved in tap water to which mice had access for 18h/day, beginning 3h before the lights turned off. The MA tube was removed for the remaining 6h of each day. Unpublished data (Phillips) indicate that the 6h forced abstinence periods between periods of 18h MA access are important for higher MA intake levels, compared to 24h MA access periods. The MA concentration was 20 mg/l for 4 days, and was increased to 40 mg/l for an additional 4 days. The MA and water tube positions were alternated every other day to account for potential side bias. MA consumption was indexed as the average intake on the second and fourth days of access to each MA concentration, as these days represent the day after the tube positions were switched, when mice should be familiar with the relative locations of the water and MA tubes. MA consumption was measured in ml (accuracy = 0.2 ml), and then converted to mg/kg, based on body weight measured every two days. Total volume consumed (ml) from the water and MA tubes during the 18h MA access periods was also measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MA-induced change in body temperature</title><p>Methods for determining MA-induced change in body temperature were consistent with those we established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were tested after injection of saline or 2 mg/kg MA at an ambient temperature of 21 ± 2°C, for 120 min beginning at 0800h, two hours after lights on. The MA dose was chosen from previous results demonstrating that mice with functional TAAR1 exhibit a robust hypothermic response to 2 mg/kg MA 30 min after administration that is absent in mice with non-functional TAAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). Treatment groups (saline or MA) were assigned so that males and females were equally represented, and mice from each family were distributed equally between the groups. Mice were weighed and then placed into individual perforated acrylic plastic cubicles (8 × 19×8 cm in W x H x L) that served to prevent huddling-associated effects on body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crabbe et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crabbe et al., 1989</xref>). Mice were undisturbed for 1h before a baseline rectal temperature was obtained at time 0 (T0) by inserting a glycerin-coated, 5 mm probe attached to a Thermalert model TH-8 digital thermometer (Sensortek, Clifton, NJ, USA) 2.5 cm into the rectum for 5 s. Saline or MA was then administered, and mice were returned to their cubicles. Rectal temperature was again measured at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-injection (T30-T120).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>QTL analysis</title><p>QTL analyses using BXD strain means were conducted using the WebQTL mapping module of GeneNetwork (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenetwork.org">www.genenetwork.org</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002388">SCR_002388</ext-link>). The traits mapped were: 1) MA intake when the 40 mg/l MA concentration was offered, which is the phenotype used for selective breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shabani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>), and 2) MA-induced body temperature change at 30 min post-treatment. The 30 min time point is when the hypothermic effect of the 2 mg/kg dose of MA is largest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). The change score was calculated by subtracting temperatures at 30 min from baseline temperatures taken immediately before treatment. QTL mapping was initially performed using the interval mapping function and then composite interval mapping was applied, with <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype at rs29351111 as a co-factor, to assess the potential interaction of <italic>Oprm1</italic> and <italic>Taar1</italic>. QTL significance was assessed using the LOD score obtained after 1000 or 2000 permutations, for interval or composite interval mapping, respectively, and was considered significant if the genome-wide <italic>p</italic>-value was &lt;0.05, and considered suggestive if the genome-wide <italic>p</italic>-value was &lt;0.63, which yields one false positive per genome scan on average. These are the standard settings used for GeneNetwork QTL mapping. R version 3.6.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/foundation/">https://www.r-project.org/foundation/</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>) was used to analyze changes in LOD scores computed from interval vs. composite interval QTL mapping with a Chi-squared test comparing additive vs. interactive models for the effects of <italic>Taar1</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype. MA consumption and MA-induced body temperature change means for the BXD strains are available in GeneNetwork.

(2017)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Statistica 13.3 (TIBCO Software, Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses other than QTL mapping. For MA drinking studies, MA consumption (mg/kg) and total volume consumed (ml) data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, with MA concentration as the repeated measure, and genotype (or strain) and sex as possible independent variables. Body temperature data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA, with time as the repeated measure, and genotype (or strain), sex, and MA dose as possible independent variables. For BXD MA drinking and body temperature data, initial analyses characterizing the strains did not include sex as a factor, due to group sizes that were too small. However, analyses examining associations between <italic>Taar1/Oprm1</italic> genotypes and MA-related phenotypes did examine the potential impact of sex. For these analyses, to examine potential interaction effects on the measured phenotypes, data for the entire BXD population were analyzed with sex, <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype, and <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype coded as separate independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>). Effects were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05. Complex interactions were simplified by ANOVAs at levels of a particular factor. Two-way interactions were further interpreted using simple main effects analysis, with Bonferroni correction. To compare body temperature data at post-injection time points (T30-120) to T0 within a particular genotype, Dunnett’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used. Pearson’s r was used to calculate correlations between phenotypes and <italic>Taar1</italic> or <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype. Sample sizes for these studies were based on our previous MA drinking and body temperature studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harkness et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reed et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Zhen Zhu and Nicholas Varra for assistance with data collection, and Jason Erk for assistance with data collection and mouse colony maintenance.

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Taar1</italic> gene variants have a causal role in methamphetamine intake and response and interact with <italic>Oprm1</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amelie Baud (Reviewer #1) and Bryan Yamamoto (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes experiments that demonstrate the role of a DBA/2J specific <italic>Taar1</italic> allele on methamphetamine consumption and methamphetamine-induced hypothermia. Drawing upon previous work, the authors test the involvement of a <italic>Taar1</italic> allele that arose spontaneously in the DBA/2J colony at the Jackson Laboratory. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology they generate a mouse line that replaced the DBA/2J Taar1 allele (<italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic>) with a wildtype allele (<italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic>) in mice selectively bred for high consumption of methamphetamine. The authors confirm the effects of <italic>Taar1</italic> on methamphetamine drinking as well as methamphetamine-induced hypothermia, and present evidence for an interaction between <italic>Taar1</italic> and a locus on chromosome 10 (<italic>Oprm1</italic>) using a set of BxD RI strains</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please use a significance threshold that takes into account the number of tests employed. This needs to be stated and the threshold justified.</p><p>2) The control line MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> was derived from mice in which the allele was not successfully altered during CRISPR experiments. However, it's not clear whether these lines are maintained separately or bred together – please state whether the controls are littermates of the MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>3) CRISPR can have off-target effects. The authors provide one sentence in the Materials and methods section saying there was an &quot;initial&quot; analysis of potential off-target sites but provide no further information. It's not clear whether any follow up studies of off-target effects were conducted. These details should be provided in the Materials and methods and Results and any potential caveats presented in the Discussion.</p><p>4) It seems a bit misleading to characterize the hypothermic effect of MA as prolonged in the <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup>/Oprm1<sup>D2/D2</sup></italic> mice (Figure 7B). The rate of increase in temperature AFTER the initial decrease seems fairly consistent between these mice and the <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup>/Oprm1<sup>B6/B6</sup></italic> mice. In comparison to T0, it may seem that the hypothermic effect is prolonged due to the significant difference in the temperature at T30, but the rate of increase wasn't measured so it's hard to conclude that Taar1<italic><sup>+/+</sup>/Oprm1<sup>B6/B6</sup></italic> mice recover more quickly.</p><p>5) Please can you explain whether the interaction of <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype with <italic>Taar1</italic> has been examined in the QTL studies for MA drinking and hypothermia – perhaps by using <italic>Oprm1</italic> genotype as a covariate? Although there may not have been enough power to study gene x gene interactions due to sample size, it would be good to see this effect confirmed (or if not explain if this is due to low power)</p><p>6) The discussion about the relationship between MA consumption and body temperature (section “Relationship Between MA consumption and Body Temperature”) is confusing. It makes sense that MA-induced hypothermia could result in reduced MA drinking due to aversion, but the alternative hypothesis that MA drinking somehow alters MA-induced hypothermia is not so obvious. More explanation would be beneficial as to how <italic>Taar1</italic> mutation might alter meth consumption. For example if these mutants cannot appropriately thermoregulate, do they have a depressed phenotype, or have an altered mesocorticolimbic pathway?</p><p>7) The authors make several comments in the discussion about the potential translational importance of <italic>Taar1</italic> in human MA use and as a potential therapeutic. They should include a few sentences in the discussion about MA drinking in rodents as a model for human MA use. Are the pharmacokinetics of MA following oral consumption similar to normal human routes of MA administration?</p><p>8) One consideration that was not addressed was whether the genetic modifications were simply affecting the potency of METH. If METH acts on <italic>Taar1</italic>, then it seems reasonable that a non-functional <italic>Taar1</italic> would require higher METH intake to produce a similar effect. Please comment on this suggestion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46472.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please use a significance threshold that takes into account the number of tests employed.

These corrections for multiple tests did not change our conclusions. The only changes from the initial submission involved the saline group in the BXD hypothermia study, and the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic>mice, which do not exhibit MA-induced hypothermia. Thus, none of the results for MA effects were impacted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The control line MAHDR-Taar1m1J was derived from mice in which the allele was not successfully altered during CRISPR experiments. However, it's not clear whether these lines are maintained separately or bred together – please state whether the controls are littermates of the MAHDR-Taar1+ mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The CRISPR knock-in and control lines were maintained as within-line breeding pairs in a shared colony room. This breeding of individuals with the same <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype is consistent with the maintenance of all other populations in which the <italic>Taar1</italic> SNP exists (e.g., MAHDR vs. MALDR; BXD strains; D2 mice from The Jackson Laboratory vs. D2 mice from other suppliers; Reed et al., 2018). We now state this in the section “Generation of MAHDR-<italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> knock-in mice”. Please note that when an F2 was created between the DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice, resulting in littermates with different <italic>Taar1</italic> genotypes, an equally strong association of <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype with MA intake was found (see Reed et al., 2018). We have added a discussion point in the section “Potential Limitations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) CRISPR can have off-target effects. The authors provide one sentence in the Materials and methods section saying there was an &quot;initial&quot; analysis of potential off-target sites but provide no further information. It's not clear whether any follow up studies of off-target effects were conducted. These details should be provided in the Materials and methods and Results and any potential caveats presented in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included more detailed methodological information in the paper. We have also included discussion regarding potential off-target effects. In our situation, in which the sequence change was created on a heterogeneous background, sequencing the rest of the genome of the CRISPR knock-in and control mice would not provide specific information about off-target effects. This is because the existing genetic variance would not be separable from CRISPR-induced effects. A study published in Nature Methods (Schaefer et al., 2017) reported extensive off-target effects of CRISPR and has since been retracted, due to significant concerns raised in multiple commentaries *(Kim et al., 2018; Lareau et al., 2018; Lescarbeau et al., 2018; Nutter et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2018). There appears to be some consensus that off-target effects are rare and indistinguishable from the background rate of de novo mutation (Anderson et al., 2018; Ayabe et al., 2018; Iyer et al., 2018; Mianne et al., 2016; Nakajima et al., 2016; Willi et al., 2018). We have mentioned this consensus in the paper. In addition, we describe our use of the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) to examine potential sequence identity for the guide RNAs generated by ThermoFisher and give details about the one that we chose that was a perfect match, except for the relevant SNP. The gRNA sequence had similarity to 9 additional regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, 11 and 19, but with 2-3 mismatches in each case (see t Design of the CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in of <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> and CRISPR reagents”). As can be seen in Figure 8 of the current paper, and in our published work (Belknap et al., 2013), there are no mapped QTLs for MA drinking or MA-induced hypothermia on any of these chromosomes. Therefore, even if there was a genetic change in any of these locations, it would be extremely unlikely that it would produce the large changes in both MA intake and MA-induced hypothermia that we observed. On the other hand, because the chromosome 10 QTL accounts for 60% of the genetic variance in MA intake and <italic>Taar1</italic> genotype-phenotype correlations range from r=0.81 to 0.96 for 40 mg/L MA intake and r=0.71 to 0.82 for 2 mg/kg MA-induced hypothermia (Reed et al., 2018; and data herein), the large effects we observed would be expected for replacement of <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic> with <italic>Taar1<sup>+</sup></italic>.

For example if these mutants cannot appropriately thermoregulate, do they have a depressed phenotype, or have an altered mesocorticolimbic pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unlikely that the difference in MA effect on body temperature is due to inability to thermoregulate for several reasons. Mice with the <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J/m1J</sup></italic>genotype do not differ in baseline temperatures or changes in those temperatures over time, compared to mice with the <italic>Taar1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>genotype (Harkness et al., 2015, and data in the current manuscript). In addition, mice of the 2 genotypes exhibit comparable time-dependent patterns of response to other drugs with hypothermic effects, including ethanol (Harkness et al., 2015) and cocaine (unpublished data). Thus, the mutants display a hypothermic response, and the lack of hypothermia in response to MA is a MA-specific effect. Further, the <italic>Taar1</italic> mutation does not appear to affect locomotor activity at baseline or in response to this dose of MA (Shabani et al., 2011; Wheeler et al., 2009), so it is not likely that <italic>Taar1</italic> effects are due to differences in movement after treatment. We now discuss this in the section “Relationship Between MA Consumption and Body Temperature”. Also, we discuss other possible mechanisms by which TAAR1 may affect MA consumption (including alterations in the mesocorticolimbic pathway) in the last paragraph of the section “Taar1 and MA Consumption”.</p><p>We have not yet examined body temperature changes occurring during the time that MA is being consumed. We have observed that low line mice consume similar amounts of MA as high line mice on the first day that MA is offered, but then decrease their consumption on the subsequent day, remaining at low intake levels from then on (Shabani et al., 2012a; Eastwood et al., 2014). It is possible that once MA reaches a high enough dose during the first drinking session, that the low line mice experience hypothermia and that this plays a role in their reduced intake on subsequent days. We are in the process of obtaining equipment to allow us to examine body temperature simultaneously with locomotor activity during drinking sessions, which will allow us to consider these questions. We now discuss this in the section “Relationship Between MA Consumption and Body Temperature”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors make several comments in the Discussion about the potential translational importance of Taar1 in human MA use and as a potential therapeutic. They should include a few sentences in the Discussion about MA drinking in rodents as a model for human MA use. Are the pharmacokinetics of MA following oral consumption similar to normal human routes of MA administration?</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss this in Shabani et al. (2012a), but agree that it is important to reiterate. Please see our discussion of the relevance of this mouse model in the section “<italic>Taar1</italic> and MA Consumption”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) One consideration that was not addressed was whether the genetic modifications were simply affecting the potency of METH. If METH acts on Taar1, then it seems reasonable that a non-functional Taar1 would require higher METH intake to produce a similar effect. Please comment on this suggestion.</p></disp-quote><p>If the mutation produced a sub-functional receptor, this would of course be possible. However, it appears that the receptor produced is non-functional. The D2-like isoform of TAAR1, expressed by <italic>Taar1<sup>m1J</sup></italic>, exhibits no cAMP response to a wide range of MA concentrations or to other TAAR1 agonists (Harkness et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016). We have shown that, even at high doses of MA (up to 16 mg/kg), high line mice fail to exhibit hypothermia, whereas MALDR mice express hypothermia at doses as low as 1 mg/kg (Harkness et al., 2015). Thus, we are fairly certain that the genetic modification did not simply affect potency. We now discuss this in the section “Potential Limitations”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
