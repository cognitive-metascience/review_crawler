from their hosts. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) scavenges lipids (cholesterol and fatty acids) to maintain infections in mammals but mechanisms and proteins responsible for the import of fatty acids in Mtb were previously unknown. Here, we identify and determine that the previously uncharacterized protein Rv3723/LucA, functions to integrate cholesterol and fatty acid uptake in Mtb. Rv3723/LucA interacts with subunits of the Mce1 and Mce4 complexes to coordinate the activities of these nutrient transporters by maintaining their stability. We also demonstrate that Mce1 functions as a fatty acid transporter in Mtb and determine that facilitating cholesterol and fatty acid import via Rv3723/LucA is required for full bacterial virulence in vivo. These data establish that fatty acid and cholesterol assimilation are inexorably linked in Mtb and reveals a key function for Rv3723/LucA in in coordinating thetransport of both these substrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26969.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26969.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mycobacterium</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>fatty acids</kwd><kwd>transport</kwd><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI118582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI067027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI099569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanderVen</surname><given-names>Brian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI119122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanderVen</surname><given-names>Brian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The integral membrane protein LucA facilitates fatty acid and cholesterol uptake into <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> by stabilizing the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters, respectively, and Mce1 functions as a fatty acid transporter in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the causative agent of human tuberculosis (TB), is responsible for more than 1 million deaths each year and the bacterium currently infects nearly ~1.5 billion individuals. A hallmark of TB is that infected individuals rarely develop active TB disease and most infections (~90%) remain in a latent or asymptomatic state. Mtb is exquisitely adapted to survive within the human host and the bacterium’s ability to metabolize host-derived lipids (fatty acids and cholesterol) is thought to enable bacterial persistence for long periods of time. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms involved in nutrient uptake and metabolism in Mtb will help us better understand important host-pathogen interactions and may identify new vulnerabilities for drug discovery.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that host lipids (fatty acids and cholesterol) serve as critical carbon sources for Mtb during infection. In the 1950s, it was determined that Mtb propagated in mammalian tissues preferentially metabolizes fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloch and Segal, 1956</xref>) and numerous studies since have repeatedly demonstrated that lipid metabolism promotes Mtb survival during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marrero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKinney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muñoz-Elías et al., 2006</xref>). Mtb also has the ability to metabolize cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van der Geize et al., 2007</xref>) and the utilization of this nutrient is critical for Mtb survival within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>) and in various in vivo infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nesbitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yam et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although Mtb’s remarkable capacity to assimilate and metabolize lipids is considered a defining characteristic of this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 1998</xref>), the mechanisms underlying fatty acid uptake by Mtb have remained unknown. The mycolic acid-containing cell envelope of Mtb constitutes a unique barrier for the import of hydrophobic molecules and likely explains why the Mtb genome does not encode canonical fatty acid transporters that are typically found in other bacterial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Theodoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>). Instead, it is thought that Mtb uses Mce proteins to import hydrophobic nutrients across the bacterial cell envelope. The Mce family of proteins in Mtb were originally associated with <underline>m</underline>ammalian <underline>c</underline>ell <underline>e</underline>ntry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 1993</xref>) and are classified as part of the MlaD superfamily (cl27420) based on the presence of one or more Mce domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali and Riley, 2007</xref>). Proteins containing Mce domains have been implicated in the transport of hydrophobic molecules in various bacteria and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roston et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sutterlin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). The aggregate data now indicate that Mce proteins mediate transport of hydrophobic molecules across double-membranous structures in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thong et al., 2016</xref>). Mtb imports cholesterol across the mycobacterial cell envelope via the multi-subunit Mce transporter, termed Mce4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>) and the Mtb genome contains four total unlinked <italic>mce</italic> loci (<italic>mce1-mce4</italic>). Although the functions of proteins encoded in the <italic>mce1-mce3</italic> loci are unknown, the similarities shared across the <italic>mce1-4</italic> loci suggest that all these loci encode transporters responsible for the assimilation of hydrophobic substrates in Mtb.</p><p>Most of the genes required for the growth of Mtb on cholesterol as a sole carbon source have been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffin et al., 2011</xref>) but, little is known about how Mtb utilizes cholesterol in the presence of other nutrients. Mtb can co-metabolize simple carbon substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests that the bacterium has the capacity to utilize fatty acids and cholesterol simultaneously in vivo. Mtb likely encounters both fatty acids and cholesterol during infection. For example, Mtb can induce foamy macrophage formation and can reside within these fatty acid and cholesterol-loaded cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>). It is also thought that Mtb is capable of persisting within the necrotic centers of human granulomas, an environment that is rich in fatty acids and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Mtb also has the capacity to metabolically integrate the utilization of fatty acids and cholesterol when growing in macrophages where Mtb utilizes fatty acids to balance the incorporation of cholesterol-derived metabolic intermediates into biosynthesis of bacterial cell wall lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify Mtb mutants defective in cholesterol utilization when the bacteria are grown in the presence of fatty acids. We identified Rv3723, a protein of unknown function and determined that this protein is required for the import of both fatty acids and cholesterol by Mtb during growth in macrophages and in axenic culture. Thus, we renamed this previously uncharacterized protein Rv3723, as LucA (<underline>l</underline>ipid <underline>u</underline>ptake <underline>c</underline>oordinator <underline>A</underline>). We determined that LucA facilitates fatty acid and cholesterol uptake in Mtb by stabilizing protein subunits of the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters. These studies also establish that the Mce1 complex transports fatty acids into Mtb and that LucA is required for full virulence in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate that fatty acid and cholesterol import in Mtb is integrated via LucA and that coordination of these activities is necessary to support Mtb pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identifying cholesterol utilization genes in Mtb</title><p>Using a forward genetic screen, we identified genes involved in cholesterol utilization when Mtb is grown in media containing a mixture of fatty acids and carbohydrates. To do this, we used the Mtb H37Rv mutant (Δ<italic>icl1</italic>::hyg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKinney et al., 2000</xref>) which has a synthetic lethal phenotype and fails to grow in rich media containing cholesterol. This growth inhibition is linked to the accumulation of one or more toxic cholesterol-derived intermediates produced by the methylcitrate cycle, which accumulate in the bacteria when <italic>icl1</italic> is nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eoh and Rhee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>). We reasoned that mutations in the cholesterol utilization pathway would rescue the growth inhibition of Δ<italic>icl1</italic>::hyg by preventing the formation of the cholesterol-dependent toxic methylcitrate cycle intermediate(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we isolated transposon rescue mutants in a Δ<italic>icl1</italic>::hyg background that gained the ability to grow on media containing cholesterol. In total, 133 clones were isolated and the mutations were mapped to 19 separate genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The rescue phenotype was further confirmed for 16 of the 19 mutants in liquid media containing cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Nine of the 16 identified genes had been predicted to be required for growth of Mtb on cholesterol as a sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffin et al., 2011</xref>). These include <italic>rv1130/prpD</italic> and <italic>rv1131/prpC</italic>, which encode enzymes of the methylcitrate cycle. Inactivating <italic>rv1130/prpD</italic> and <italic>rv1131/prpC</italic> most likely limits production of the toxic methylcitrate cycle intermediate(s) that accumulate in the absence of <italic>icl1</italic> and this allows growth of these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eoh and Rhee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>). This screen also identified mutations in genes encoding cholesterol catabolic enzymes <italic>rv3545c/cyp125, rv3568c/hsaC,</italic> and <italic>rv3570c</italic>/<italic>hsaA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dresen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yam et al., 2009</xref>). These mutations likely rescue growth by reducing the amount of propionyl-CoA released from cholesterol that can feed into the methylcitrate cycle. These findings are consistent with the observation that chemically inhibiting the PrpC or the HsaAB enzymes is sufficient to rescue growth of the Δ<italic>icl1</italic>::hyg mutant in cholesterol media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>lucA</italic> encodes a membrane protein involved in cholesterol metabolism</title><p>Seventeen sibling mutants carrying Himar transposon insertions in the <italic>lucA</italic> gene (Δ<italic>icl1</italic>::hyg<italic>, lucA::</italic>TnHimar) were identified with the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>lucA</italic> is required for cholesterol utilization by Mtb. Orthologs of <italic>lucA</italic> are restricted to <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> spp., and this gene encodes an uncharacterized putative integral membrane protein. Additionally, previous genetic epistasis studies implicated <italic>lucA</italic> in cholesterol utilization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>), but, the function of this gene/protein has not yet been described.

To ascertain subcellular localization, the LucA protein was fused to green fluorescent protein (LucA-GFP) and expressed in a wild-type strain of Mtb that constitutively expresses a cytosolic mCherry fluorescent protein. Confocal microscopy revealed a peripheral distribution for LucA-GFP, which is consistent with LucA having a cell membrane or cell envelope localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26969.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LucA facilitates cholesterol uptake in Mtb.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Complementation with <italic>lucA</italic> restores cholesterol toxicity in the Δ<italic>icl1</italic>::hyg <italic>lucA</italic>::TnHimar mutant. (<bold>B</bold>) The Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg and Δ<italic>yrbE4A</italic>::hyg mutants are defective in the catabolic release of <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> from [4-<sup>14</sup>C]-cholesterol.

The lack of Bodipy-493/503 staining in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant indicates that this strain does not accumulate fatty acids during infection in macrophages. Lipid inclusions in Mtb can also be visualized by transmission electron microscopy and we observed that only ~5% of the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant cells had identifiable lipid inclusions, while 25% of the wild type and 35% of complemented bacteria had visible cytosolic lipid inclusions during infection in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>The apparent decrease in cytosolic lipid inclusions within the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant during infection in macrophages could also be due to enhanced bacterial turnover of the intracellular TAG in the mutant strain.

Given that the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant is also defective in the import of fatty acids, we hypothesized that LucA could also interact with homologous subunits of the Mce1 transporter. We focused on the homologous Mtb proteins Rv0175/Mam1A, Rv0177/Mam1C, Rv0178/Mam1D and Rv0199/OmamA because these proteins are predicted to be part of the Mce1 transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casali and Riley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perkowski et al., 2016</xref>) and conserve a similar transmembrane topology as Rv3492c/Mam4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine if these subunits also interact with LucA, we engineered F<sub>1,2</sub> fusions with various homologs of Rv3492c/Mam4B. We found that co-expressing LucA-F<sub>3</sub> with full length (FL) versions of Rv0177/Mam1C and Rv0199/OmamA fused to F<sub>1,2</sub> conferred trimethoprim resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we found that LucA-F<sub>3</sub> with transmembrane domains (TM) of Rv0177/Mam1C and Rv0199/OmamA fused to F<sub>1,2</sub> conferred trimethoprim resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data indicate that LucA physically interacts with subunits of the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters and suggests that the LucA protein participates in the function of these complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Substrate binding and translocation by Mce4 are dissociable events</title><p>Next we saught to determine if Rv3492c/Mam4B is required for cholesterol import. We inactivated Rv3492c/Mam4B by allelic exchange (Δ<italic>mam4B</italic>::hyg) and quantified the rate of [4-<sup>14</sup>C]-cholesterol uptake in this mutant. We found that relative to the wild type and complemented strains the Δ<italic>mam4B</italic>::hyg mutant is still capable of importing [4-<sup>14</sup>C]-cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, we observed that the Δ<italic>mam4B</italic>::hyg mutant has an obvious cholesterol metabolism defect resulting in an 80% reduction in the mutants ability to metabolize [4-<sup>14</sup>C]-cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The phenotype of the Δ<italic>mam4B</italic>::hyg strain is specific to cholesterol given that the mutant has no defect in the uptake or metabolism of [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-oleate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Our interpretation of these observations is that the Rv3492c/Mam4B mutant binds and/or partly imports cholesterol across the Mtb cell envelope and this accounts for the uptake activity that we detect with this strain. Given that cholesterol is likely not metabolized by Mtb until the substrate reaches the bacterial cytosol we predict that the final translocation of cholesterol across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is defective in the Δ<italic>mam4B</italic>::hyg mutant and a blockade at this step prevents metabolism of cholesterol in this strain. Together these data indicate that Rv3492c/Mam4B is required to complete the process of Mce4-mediated cholesterol internalization by Mtb.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>LucA stabilizes subunits of the Mce1 and Mce4 complexes</title><p>Recently, it was demonstrated that Rv0199/OmamA is involved in cholesterol metabolism in Msm and stabilizes the Mce1 complex in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perkowski et al., 2016</xref>). Given that LucA interacts with Rv0199/OmamA and the related homologs Rv3492c/Mam4B and Rv0177/Mam1C, we hypothesized that both the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters may also be destabilized in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant. To test this, we generated whole-cell lysates from Mtb grown under the conditions used in the lipid uptake experiments. Gene expression analysis by qPCR confirmed that the <italic>mce1</italic> genes are expressed in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant to equivalent levels relative to the wild-type and complemented strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, analysis of bacterial lysates revealed that, at the protein level, the putative subunits of the Mce1 complex (Mce1A, Mce1D, Mce1E) were completely degraded in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Unfortunately, thus far we have been unable to raise antibodies specific to the analogous Mce4 subunits.</p><p>It is thought that MceG/Rv0655 functions as a common ATPase to hydrolyze ATP and facilitate nutrient uptake through the Mce transporters in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>). MceG is required for optimum growth of Mtb on cholesterol and a mutant lacking MceG displays a cholesterol import defect that is equivalent to the cholesterol import defect observed in a mutant lacking Mce4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>). Although the role of MceG in fatty acid uptake has not been confirmed, it has been previously established that the stability of MceG requires co-expression of the Mce1 and Mce4 permease subunits in mycobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>). To further explore the cholesterol and fatty acid uptake defect in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant, we hypothesized MceG may also be degraded or destabilized in this strain. Therefore, we quantified MceG levels in the bacterial lysates and observed a 30% decrease in amount of MceG in the whole-cell lysates of the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). It has recently been reported that synthesis of Mce proteins can exceed the rates of degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perkowski et al., 2016</xref>) and given that there is negligible difference in the expression of MceG at the RNA level across the strains we used chloramphenicol to suppress protein synthesis in the bacteria. Under this condition, the relative amount of MceG protein decreased by 75% in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These results demonstrate that, in the absence of LucA, not only subunits of the Mce1 transporter complex, but also shared MceG ATPase, are degraded, possibly due to activity of unknown specific proteases. These data provide an explanation for the linked defect in both fatty acid and cholesterol uptake observed in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant and that LucA serves to coordinate the uptake of these nutrients by protecting the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters from degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>LucA contributes to the in vivo fitness of Mtb</title><p>These data indicate that LucA is involved in the utilization of two critical host-derived lipid substrates. It is known that deletion of one or both of the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters leads to decreased survival of the pathogen in mouse model infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>), and we predict that both these transporters would be nonfunctional in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant.

These data shed new light on the coordination of fatty acid and cholesterol import and reveal that a network of proteins associates with the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters to integrate the uptake of both fatty acids and cholesterol.</p><p>Using an unbiased forward genetic screen, we discovered that transposon insertions in the <italic>lucA</italic> gene rescue cholesterol toxicity in an Mtb strain that lacks Δ<italic>icl1</italic>. Subsequent analysis confirmed that mutation of <italic>lucA</italic> (Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg) has a profound impact on cholesterol uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and that this cholesterol uptake defect confers growth rescue in the Δ<italic>icl1 lucA</italic>::TnHimar double mutant.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling revealed that genes normally activated by cholesterol are down-regulated in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant during infection in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is consistent with a defect in cholesterol uptake in this mutant. We were surprised to discover that the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant also produces a gene expression signature indicative of a fatty acid metabolism defect. Although the functions for many of these ‘fatty acid-induced’ genes are unknown, their expression pattern serves as a reliable indicator of a fatty acid uptake defect in Mtb. The majority of the 20 most highly expressed genes in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg during infection in macrophages map to the <italic>mce1</italic> locus. Up-regulation of genes encoding the Mce1 fatty acid transporter in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant during infection likely reflects an attempt by the bacterium to compensate for the absence of fatty acids that normally fuels Mtb’s metabolism. The mechanism that controls expression of the <italic>mce1</italic> locus in response to fatty acid depletion is unknown but we hypothesize that Mtb has an ability to sense metabolite pools to control synthesis of the Mce1 fatty acid transporter complex.</p><p>The Mtb cell envelope constitutes formidable barrier to the transport of any hydrophobic molecule. Actinomycetal bacteria with mycolic-acid-containing cell walls that are capable of metabolizing cholesterol use the Mce4 complex to import the sterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perkowski et al., 2016</xref>) and this has led to the idea that all four of the Mce complexes transport hydrophobic molecules across the Mtb cell wall. Various studies have linked Mce1 to Mtb virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gioffré et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimono et al., 2003</xref>) but the function of the Mce1 complex was hitherto unknown. It has been reported that inactivating Mce1 in Mtb induces a lipid homeostasis defect and the accumulation of free mycolic acids in the Mtb cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forrellad et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these observations, it was hypothesized that the Mce1 may transport fatty acids and/or mycolic acids across the cell wall/membrane of Mtb but it was reported that Mce1 mutant in Mtb displayed a minor defect in fatty acid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forrellad et al., 2014</xref>). We used assays comparable to those previously described and detected major perturbations in fatty acid assimilation in our Mce1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We cannot fully explain the discrepancy between these findings, but we have noticed that spontaneous mutants of Mtb unable to produce phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) assimilate less fatty acid compared to PDIM positive strains. Our work was conducted in a PDIM-positive strain of Mtb Erdman, and we think this has allowed us to detect Mce1-mediated fatty acid transport.</p><p>Studies with <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (Mlep) are consistent with the interpretation that Mce1 functions as a mycobacterial fatty acid transporter. The Mlep genome contains a single <italic>mce</italic> locus which is most similar to the <italic>mce1</italic> operon found in Mtb and Mlep is fully capable of importing and metabolizing palmitate when the bacteria are recovered from animal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzblau, 1988</xref>). The Mlep genome also encodes homolog of <italic>lucA</italic> (ml2337) suggesting that LucA could be central for Mce1 function in this bacterium. Given that the Mlep genome does not conserve genes that encode proteins for cholesterol import/metabolism and this bacterium does not metabolize cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marques et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that ml2337 has one role in Mlep. The finding that LucA facilitates fatty acid uptake and stabilizes components of the Mce1 transporter provides additional evidence that Mce1 functions as a fatty acid transporter. Therefore, the fatty acid uptake defect in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant is most likely a consequence of the degradation of Mce1 components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>mce1-4</italic> loci make up four separate operons in the Mtb genome and each operon encodes the putative protein subunits that likely comprise the individual Mce transporters. It is thought that each Mce transporter is substrate-specific and the individual subunits are predicted to perform discrete roles. Specifically, the <italic>mce4</italic> operon encodes two putative permease subunits (YrbE4A and YrbE4B), six cell-wall-associated Mce proteins (Mce4A-Mce4F), and two accessory subunits (Mam4A and Mam4B). We found that LucA interacts with Mam4B and that Mam4B is required for the metabolism of cholesterol; however, the mutant lacking Mam4B is still capable of binding cholesterol. Based on this observation, we propose that Mce4 imports cholesterol via a two-step process that involves cholesterol binding/shuttling across the cell wall followed by the final translocation through the cytoplasmic membrane delivering cholesterol into the cytosol. The accessory and permease subunits may participate in the final translocation of cholesterol across the cytoplasmic membrane while the Mce proteins likely participate in the binding/shuttling of cholesterol across the Mtb cell envelope. Binding/shuttling of lipids across the Mtb cell envelope may be analogous to what has been proposed for lipid trafficking by Mce proteins across the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malinverni and Silhavy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakayama and Zhang-Akiyama, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thong et al., 2016</xref>). This two-step mechanism of nutrient uptake may be a generalizable mechanism for all Mce transporters. Additional support for the two-step model comes from our observation that the Mce1 proteins (Mce1A, Mce1D, and Mce1E) are degraded in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant and this strain is unable to bind/shuttle fatty acids across the Mtb cell envelope. Lastly, we can detect a residual level of fatty acid and cholesterol uptake and metabolism in mutants lacking Mce1 and Mce4, respectively. It is very likely that compensatory systems function to import these lipids in the absence of Mce1 and Mce4 and we are currently testing this hypothesis.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that orphaned Mce associated protein Rv0199/OmamA facilitates cholesterol utilization in Msm and stabilizes the Mce1 complex in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perkowski et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we found that LucA is also required to stabilize subunits of the Mce1 transporter. This work demonstrates that LucA interacts with the Mce1 and Mce4 accessory subunits Rv0199/OmamA, Rv0177/Mam1C and Rv3492/Mam4A. Based on this, we predict that LucA is recruited to the Mce1 and Mce4 complexes to stabilize or assemble the transporters via interactions with the accessory subunits. Given that MceG is required for cholesterol uptake and is thought to facilitate the import of additional nutrients in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García-Fernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>), our finding that the MceG protein is also destabilized in the Δ<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg may explain the various nutrient uptake defects in this mutant. Homology searches based on three-dimensional structures identified a putative protease inhibitor domain within the N-terminus of LucA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that LucA may locally inactivate a protease to maintain the integrity of the transporter complexes. Regulating activity of the transport complexes through proteolysis could be a mechanism to rapidly halt nutrient uptake through the Mce transporters, however such a suggestion will require more research.</p><p>During growth in the presence of cholesterol Mtb shunts cholesterol-derived methylmalonyl-CoA (originating from propionyl-CoA) toward the increased synthesis of methyl-branched, cell wall polyketide lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griffin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). This metabolic shunting requires that sufficient fatty-acid-derived acyl-AMP primers are available to support biosynthesis of polyketide lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quadri, 2014</xref>). When excess fatty acids are supplied to infected macrophages, Mtb can enhance the flux of propionyl-CoA into polyketide lipids such as PDIM during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). It would be advantageous for Mtb to regulate fatty acid assimilation to maintain the acyl-AMP pools required for efficient synthesis of methyl-branched lipids. Thus, coordination of cholesterol and fatty acid uptake by LucA could ensure that balanced levels of these nutrients are maintained for optimized metabolism.</p><p>The central carbon and lipid metabolic pathways of Mtb have emerged as potential drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>); therefore, understanding the bottlenecks or weaknesses in these pathways will assist TB drug discovery. Additionally, the flux of fatty acids into TAG and central metabolism contributes to drug tolerance in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baek et al., 2011</xref>), a phenotype that is further enhanced by immune pressure during in vivo infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Targeting the specialized lipid metabolic pathways in Mtb that are involved in fatty acid and cholesterol utilization could be a viable strategy for the development of new drugs that reduce Mtb drug tolerance and augment current TB drug regimens. Our data have defined new participants in the complex processes of fatty acid and cholesterol assimilation by Mtb. A better understanding of the functional integration of Mtb’s specialized metabolic pathways is required to acquire a fuller appreciation of Mtb pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacteria and growth conditions</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains were routinely grown at 37°C in 7H9 (broth) or 7H11 (agar) media supplemented with OAD enrichment (oleate-albumin-dextrose-NaCl), 0.05% glycerol and 0.05% tyloxapol (broth).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Bavesh D Kana (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Heran Darwin (Reviewer #2) and William Jacobs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their submission, Nazarova and colleagues investigate cholesterol metabolism and transport in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Using a forward genetic screen, with an Icl1 deficient mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that is unable to grow on cholesterol, they identify genes for cholesterol utilization in media containing a mixture of fatty acids and simple carbohydrates. The premise of this gain of function assay is that secondary mutations in the Icl1 deficient background would rescue the growth defect by alleviating the accumulation of toxic metabolites. This analysis yielded 19 candidate genes, 16 were further confirmed using growth curve assays. Of the 16, 9 genes had already been previously identified as important for growth on cholesterol as the sole carbon source. Some of these directly alleviate methylcitrate toxicity and others reduce the flux of propionyl-CoA. One of the candidates identified was lucA, which has been implicated in cholesterol utilization in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but the mechanism remained unknown. The authors confirm that lucA is membrane associated and not cytoplasmic and further proceed to construct a mutant of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that is defective for lucA. As expected, the lucA mutant does not metabolize cholesterol, an effect due to reduced uptake of cholesterol. The authors then determine the transcriptional profile of the lucA mutant when infected in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and find reduced expression of the kstR regulon, which they attributed to reduced cholesterol uptake. To further confirm this, the authors construct a reporter to monitor the activity of the prpD promoter, which responds to the presence of cholesterol. The authors also identify a fatty acid utilization defect for the mutant when infected in macrophages. They confirm this defect using fluorescently labelled palmitate and Bodipy-493/503, the latter staining for triacylglycerides (TAGs). They also confirm that reduced TAG accumulation in the lucA mutant was not due to enhanced turnover of intracellular lipids. Using assays with labeled metabolites, the authors demonstrate that fatty acid uptake is reduced in the lucA mutant. As LucA lacks any structural resemblance to transporters, the authors further study the above mentioned defects by generating a mutant defective for Mce1, a putative transporter, and through this confirm that the Mce1 complex is responsible for fatty acid, but not cholesterol, transport. Using bacterial two-hybrid screens, the authors show that LucA interacts with subunits of the Mce1 and Mce4 transporters. Furthermore, this interaction seems to stabilize the Mce1 complex. Also levels of MceG – an ATPase required for transport – were reduced in the lucA mutant. The authors next demonstrate that a mutant defective for Mce4 could take up cholesterol but could not utilize it. Finally, the authors demonstrate that LucA is important for successful colonization of macrophages and is also required for successful infection in the murine model of tuberculosis infection. This an excellent tour de force that utilizes a clever forward genetic screen to identify mutants of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> defective in cholesterol utilization in the presence of fatty acids. Overall, the work identifies and characterizes a new player in an important metabolic pathway (lipid metabolism) and the authors provide a convincing and compelling set of arguments that validate their conclusion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is incredibly dense, with a diversity of methodological approaches and modalities of representing data. As it stands, it is not suitable for the broad readership base of <italic>eLife</italic> and requires substantive streamlining. There were many supplementary figures, the relevance of which was not always clear. Please reflect on how to integrate the supplementary material into the logic of the manuscript in a more careful and considered way. The last figure with mouse data should just be incorporated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> where lucA is first described. It fits better here as it obfuscates the manuscript when placed later on.</p><p>2) Related to the above, the authors need to strongly reassert their discovery of a previously unknown function of Rv3723. It needs to be clear that this work provides a rational basis for redefining Rv3723 a lipid utilization coordinator (LucA). Thus this needs to be changed in the Abstract. Furthermore, the definition of the gene should occur in the Results and not in the Introduction, and should be reiterated in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26969.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The manuscript is incredibly dense, with a diversity of methodological approaches and modalities of representing data.

Furthermore, the definition of the gene should occur in the Results and not in the Introduction, and should be reiterated in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>The original submission was compressed to adhere to the <italic>eLife</italic> word limit guidelines and we agree it was quite dense. For this submission we have added additional explanation around the rationale for the experiments. We have made the data more accessible to a broad readership and we have expanded our descriptions throughout.</p><p>Many different approaches are used in this research and some methods are described here for the first time. We described these methods in more detail and have streamlined the presentation of the data. In the Introduction we expanded on the role of MCE proteins in other bacteria and plants to help put our work in the context of other biological systems.</p><p>We carefully organized the supplementary data and linked the most relevant supplementary data to the main figures. The previous submission had 26 figures or supplements. This version has 13 figures and supplements that present the data in a more streamlined fashion.</p><p>We largely kept the original sequence of the data and kept the mouse data at the end. This way we can tell the story beginning with the screen all the way through determining the function of Rv3723 LucA in a single block. We believe that presenting mouse data after the screen disrupts the flow of the story. Going from a screen to finding an uncharacterized gene to a mouse study is awkward to justify and we feel that a broad readership is likely to be more interested in the mechanism/function of Rv3723/LucA while the TB research community will mostly care about a phenotype in animals.</p><p>In this submission we added some new data. The previous submission did not present complementation data for the <italic>Δmam4A::</italic>hyg or the <italic>Δmce1</italic> mutants in our biological assays. Although we were not asked to include this we added this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and a supplement for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> as additional bars in the graphs. We made a measured but stronger assertion that the function of Rv3723 was previously unknown in the abstract and throughout. We moved the definition of the gene from the Abstract to the Results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
