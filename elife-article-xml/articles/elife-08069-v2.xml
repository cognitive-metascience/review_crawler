programs have the fidelity to form neural circuits with the same structure and function among individuals of the same species. It is less well understood, however, to what extent entire neural circuits of different individuals are similar. Previously, we reported the neuronal connectome of the visual eye circuit from the head of a <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Randel et al., 2014</xref>). We now report a full-body serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) dataset of another larva of the same age, for which we describe the connectome of the visual eyes and the larval eyespots. Anatomical comparisons and quantitative analyses of the two circuits reveal a high inter-individual stereotypy of the cell complement, neuronal projections, and synaptic connectivity, including the left-right asymmetry in the connectivity of some neurons. Our work shows the extent to which the eye circuitry in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae is hard-wired.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08069.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08069.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic></kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>stereotypy</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant Agreement 260821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jékely</surname><given-names>Gáspár</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Randel et al., 2014), a comparison of the visual neuronal circuitry in two <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae, made using serial electron microscopic reconstructions, reveals a high level of stereotypy in the synaptic connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate stereotypical behaviors commonly observed in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) rely on the precise wiring of neuronal circuits during development. However, the stereotypy of neuronal circuits between individuals of the same species at the level of synaptic connectivity is not well known. Previously, several studies have addressed nervous system stereotypy at the level of single neurons, neuronal projection patterns, or neuronal activity. For example, in the zebrafish larval brain, neuronal spatiotemporal activity is highly stereotypical between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Portugues et al., 2014</xref>). The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has stereotypical neuron types, axonal projection patterns, neuronal activity patterns and patterns of synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mosca and Luo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). A recent connectomic study found that the connectivity of interneurons mediating rolling behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae were reproducible between two individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>). Nematodes also have a nervous system that is considered highly stereotypical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">White et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>Other studies that quantitatively addressed the stereotypy in connectivity patterns have found considerable variation among individuals. In the fly, inter-individual comparisons of local interneurons in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou et al., 2010</xref>), as well as comparisons of segmentally repeated motor neurons (MNs) in the same individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Couton et al., 2015</xref>) revealed considerable variation in finer-scale connectivity. Likewise, in mice, there is significant structural variation in connectivity patterns of MNs innervating the interscutularis muscles between the left and right sides of the same animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) to quantify the synaptic level inter-individual stereotypy of an entire sensory-motor circuit, the visual eye circuit of larvae of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Randel et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, we reported the neuronal connectome of this circuit, reconstructed from a 72 hr post fertilization (hpf) larva. <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae develop following a strict cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>) and different individuals of the same developmental stage have a stereotypical complement of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Tomer et al., 2010</xref>). However, whether synapse-level connectomes are reproducible among different <italic>Platynereis</italic> individuals is unclear. To test the stereotypy of the neuronal projection patterns and synaptic connectivity of individual neurons, we have reconstructed the visual eye circuitry of a second individual from the same batch, allowing the detailed comparison of two larval connectomes in <italic>Platynereis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstruction of the visual eye circuit from a full-body ssTEM dataset of a <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva</title><p>We acquired a full-body ssTEM dataset of a 72 hr post fertilization (hpf) <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva (HT9-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), derived from the same batch as the previously described larva (HT9-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Randel et al., 2014</xref>).

All MN cells, with the exception of MN<sup>r3</sup>, are strongly innervated by 2–3 ipsilateral, plus 2–3 contralateral, IN<sup>sn</sup> cells in both animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). MN<sup>r3</sup> is also unique in another aspect of its connectivity. This neuron in both animals consistently displayed a highly left-right asymmetric connectivity pattern. MN<sup>r3</sup> is anatomically similar to MN<sup>l1</sup>. Both cells are ciliomotor and muscle MNs, with strong connections to contralateral prototroch cells, to the longitudinal muscles and the paratrochs. However, MN<sup>r3</sup>'s connectivity is unique in forming several synapses on contralateral MN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), being thus the only MN to potentially influence both contralateral and ipsilateral effectors. We could detect this asymmetric connectivity pattern for MN<sup>r3</sup> in both individuals. These results show that synaptic stereotypy can be found at the single neuron level and also applies to left-right asymmetric motifs in the network.</p><p>Our analysis shows that the visual eye connectome in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae has strong stereotypy both globally and at the single-neuron level. We could demonstrate this for patterns of neural projections, synapse distribution along neurites, identity of synaptic partners, strength of connections, and left-right asymmetries in connectivity. These results place the visual eye circuitry in a full-body context and establish the cellular-level stereotypy of neuronal circuitry in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differences between the two datasets</title><p>The full-body dataset of HT9-4 allowed us to trace the projections of the ventral MNs in the trunk of the larva, a region that was not sectioned in HT9-3. This extended tracing revealed the presence of many more MN synapses to the trunk longitudinal muscles (maximum 68 synapses/MN) than were detected in HT9-3 (maximum 13 synapses/MN).</p><p>In HT9-4, we also identified a new interneuron type, which we named projection interneuron (IN<sup>pro</sup>). Like the MNs, IN<sup>pro</sup> cells receive input from IN<sup>sn</sup> cells and project to the trunk at a more medial position. In the trunk, IN<sup>pro</sup> cells form weak connections to a group of ventral nerve cord interneurons (IN<sup>vnc</sup>). The IN<sup>pro</sup> and IN<sup>vnc</sup> neurons are only weakly connected and likely represent a developing trunk circuitry. Based on new information from HT9-4, some of the cells previously described as MNs in HT9-3 have been reclassified as IN<sup>pro</sup>. IN<sup>pro</sup> cells have somas near the MN somas and also project to the larval trunk, as revealed by the full-body dataset of HT9-4. In HT9-3, we classified 11 cells as MNs based on incoming synapses, soma positions, and projection patterns, but five of these cells did not form synapses on effector cells. Initially, we assumed these missing connections likely occurred in trunk sections posterior to the first segment in HT9-3. However, based on the data from HT9-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), these neurons more likely represent incompletely reconstructed IN<sup>pro</sup> cells.</p><p>The new dataset also provides full coverage of all ciliated locomotor cells. The larva has 23 prototroch cells, organized into an anterior and a posterior tier, formed by 11 cell pairs and one unpaired cell (at position 11 o'clock). There are 8 ventral metatroch cells, and three bands of paratrochs<sup>I–III</sup>, one in each segment. The paratrochs have 8<sup>I</sup>, 14<sup>II</sup>, and 12<sup>III</sup> ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We analyzed the innervation of the ciliary bands by MNs in more detail. We found that only the posterior tier of the prototroch receives synapses by MN cells. We also found that several MNs projected to and formed synapses on the paratrochs both on the dorsal and the ventral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Source code 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Larval eyespot connectome reveals sensory-motor circuits of varying complexities</title><p>We also fully reconstructed the neuronal circuitry of the larval eyespots or ocelli (structures located ventrally in the head) in HT9-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The larval eyespots develop in early trochophore larval stages and mediate positive phototaxis in early larval stages by innervating adjacent ciliary band cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jékely et al., 2008</xref>). In trochophore larvae (24–48 hpf), each larval eyespot consists of one pigment cell and one PRC<sup>r3</sup>, the latter of which expresses a rhabdomeric opsin, <italic>r-opsin3</italic>. A preliminary ssTEM analysis in HT9-3 (72 hpf) identified a second PRC<sup>r1</sup> with an axon projecting towards the brain neuropil (a cerebral PRC), indicating changes in eyespot structure during development.

The two eyespot PRCs connect to very distinct downstream circuitries, suggesting functional specialization. PRC<sup>r3</sup> forms <italic>en passant</italic> synapses on ipsilateral ciliary band cells, as previously described for both trochophore and nectochaete stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jékely et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Randel et al., 2013</xref>). The distal part of the PRC<sup>r3</sup> axon then turns and meets the secondary optic neuropil, forming synapses on the ipsil- and contralateral MNs. PRC<sup>r3</sup> is therefore both a direct sensory-MN and a sensory neuron that connects to MNs.</p><p>The other eyespot photoreceptor, PRC<sup>r1</sup>, projects into the primary optic neuropil and forms a circuitry distinct from that of PRC<sup>r3</sup>. PRC<sup>r1</sup> differentiates shortly before 72 hpf, as demonstrated by the late onset of <italic>r-opsin1</italic> expression in this cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Randel et al., 2013</xref>). PRC<sup>r1</sup> is only weakly connected to its target neurons, suggesting that this circuit is not yet fully developed at 72 hpf. However, we identified three cells postsynaptic to PRC<sup>r1</sup>, including the IN<sup>1</sup> and IN<sup>int</sup> interneurons of the visual eye circuit and another interneuron, that we named arc interneuron (IN<sup>arc</sup>). IN<sup>arc</sup> cells synapse on ventral MNs of the visual eye circuitry and two newly identified anterior MNs (MN<sup>ant</sup>), which project to ciliary band cells. We also found 1 or 2 further PRC cells in both eyespots (PRC<sup>new</sup>). These cells had small rhabdoms and short axons with no synapses, indicating that they are still developing.</p><p>The connectome of the eyespots suggest that both PRCs share the same effectors with the visual eyes, yet connect to these effectors by distinct circuitry. The eyespots are not able to mediate phototaxis at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Randel et al., 2014</xref>), but their continued connection to the visual eye circuit suggests that they may play a role in modulating phototaxis or mediating a distinct sensory-motor response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have reconstructed the entire larval visual eye circuitry from a second <italic>Platynereis</italic> individual and compared inter-individual connectome stereotypy at the electron microscopic level. We found a high degree of inter-individual stereotypy in the two connectomes at every level of analysis. <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae develop via a highly stereotypic cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>) and the systematic comparison of gene expression patterns across individuals has revealed the stereotypical position of neuronal cell bodies in the 48 hpf trochophore and 72 hpf nectochaete larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Tomer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadulina et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have demonstrated the stereotypy of neuronal projections and synaptic wiring based on ssTEM reconstruction and anatomical comparisons.</p><p>The two connectomes are not identical and we could not compare every neuron at a single-cell level. Despite this, clearly identifiable groups of the same cell types could be analyzed. The differences we observed may be due to developmental variation or technical variation. ssTEM datasets are inherently noisy and both datasets contained several neurite fragments that we could not assign to a neuron. However, the fact that our reconstructions resulted in the same overall circuitry indicates that the reconstructions are robust against noise. Our study also demonstrates the benefit of a second dataset when employing an ssTEM approach. Inter-individual comparisons can increase the confidence in weak or asymmetric motifs.</p><p>In <italic>Platynereis</italic>, the different sensory-motor circuits of the visual eye PRCs and eyespot PRCs show different levels of complexity. We identified examples for all degrees of sensory-motor contact, from direct sensory-motor innervation through sensory-MN to sensory-IN-MN. The fine gradations in the connectome of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval and visual eyes suggest that circuit evolution may have proceeded through the intercalation of new layers of neurons between sensors and effectors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that the connectome of the larval visual system in <italic>Platynereis</italic> is highly stereotypical between individuals. These results support our previous findings on stereotypy through the intra-individual analysis of connectivity between neurons on the left and right body sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Randel et al., 2014</xref>).

Sato's lead citrate was used for contrasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hanaichi et al., 1986</xref>).

Imaging was performed with a resolution of (5.7 nm/pixel). We lost 1.9% of the sections (98 layers) and the three biggest gaps encompassed five sections. 113 layers distributed across the series were not imaged. We could trace across these gaps using a combination of local and global cues. Additionally, to help the tracing in the neuropil, we re-imaged some of the sections (1229 layers) at high resolution (2.22 nm/pixel) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

We traced neurons in synaptic paths downstream of the eye photoreceptors. Cells presynaptic to the eye circuit and weakly connected sensory neurons were not considered. 164 fragments could not be traced (100 fragments &lt; 4 µm, 46 fragments 4–40 µm, and 18 fragments &gt; 40 µm). Fragments are defined as neurons for which a soma could not be found.</p><p>We were able to identify the same interneuron and MN types that we reported previously based on the HT9-3 dataset. The stereotypy analysis is mainly based on neuronal groups. For grouped neurons, we used the average synapse number for the calculations. For the effectors, we used the sum of incoming synapses from a group of MNs. Connections were calculated separately for groups of cells with their soma on the left or right side of the body.</p><p>Only the primary interneurons and MNs could be compared on a single-cell basis. Anatomical features and neuronal connectivity data were imported into Blender 2.71. Neurons were smoothed such that short branches (&lt;2 µm) were not shown.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>For your information, we are including the initial reviews of the two reviewers almost in entirety. Please use these to guide your revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript follows up on their previous description of the connectome of the visual sensory-motor circuit in the <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Randel et al. 2014</xref>). Here the authors address an important issue that was not addressed in their previous work—the extent to which overall anatomical connectivity, as well as synaptic connections at the single cell level, are stereotyped from individual to individual.</p><p>The work is done nicely (and it's a lot of work!). Overall, the data suggest a high, but not completely invariant, degree of stereotypical connections between the two examined larvae. This is likely of interest and relevance to researchers involved in doing similar work in other systems, and definitely expands their previous work.</p><p>However, I had some difficulty parsing the manuscript. For the general reader interested in knowing how similar (or different) the connectomes of two related individuals are, it would be most useful to rework the manuscript so as to have individual sections highlight the similarities (on a global and local scale), differences (ditto) between the two connectomes, and then lay out the new findings they have made. This would serve to highlight the stereotypy, but also point out the differences clearly. Right now, all this information is buried in a more detailed description of the connectivities and is difficult to extract.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This work is part of the heroic effort by the Jekely lab to obtain a complete understanding of the function of the highly simple visual system in a simple marine organism, the larva of <italic>Platynereis</italic>. The same authors have recently published a complete EM reconstruction of the photoreceptors and the network of neurons that process visual information downstream of the different eyes, all the way to the muscles that control movement.</p><p>The authors undertook to redo the reconstruction of a similar (second) larva (this time the entire larva although only the visual system is discussed) in order to distinguish between real connectivity and spurious synapses due to mis-alignment or artifacts of the technique. The work, which was presumably initially done as a control, is now used to compare the connectome of two individuals in order to look at stereotypy of connectivity.</p><p>The work is of high quality and confirms quite precisely the previous connectome, with different circuits for different photoreceptors. As a byproduct, the authors can now say that the connectome is also highly reproducible, from its general organization all the way to the single cell level. The only differences can be explained by the incomplete reconstruction of the previous larva or to weak connections that were not significant.</p><p>The authors conclude that the stereotypy of the visual system is very high. This is not terribly surprising for the cell types/numbers in an animal that follows a very rigorous cell lineage for generating neurons; connectivity is obviously another story but it is accepted that most invertebrates have a highly hard wired nervous system that varies very little with activity or the environment, or even with genetic variations. For instance, there are only few examples of reconfigurations of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons in the larva in response to activity. It is true, however that olfactory interneurons and Kenyon cells show extensive random variability but this likely contribute to the sparse odor representation. The recent reconstruction of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> male nervous system does not really address this issue but the data point in this direction.</p><p>In conclusion, it is indeed important to check for reproducibility when reconstructing connectomes. The present paper confirms that the initial connectome of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva was of very high quality and that the simple network is highly similar in two different organisms. This is nice, but the opposite would have been quite bothersome for the previous paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08069.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] Overall, the data suggest a high, but not completely invariant, degree of stereotypical connections between the two examined larvae.
