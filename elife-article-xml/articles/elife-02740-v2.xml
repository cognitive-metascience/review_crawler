Despite recent progress in structure determination of these transporters, the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the work of substrate translocation remains undefined. Here, we have investigated the conformational cycle of BmrCD, a representative of the heterodimer family of ABC exporters that have an intrinsically impaired nucleotide binding site. We measured distances between pairs of spin labels monitoring the movement of the nucleotide binding (NBD) and transmembrane domains (TMD). The results expose previously unobserved structural intermediates of the NBDs arising from asymmetric configuration of catalytically inequivalent nucleotide binding sites. The two-state transition of the TMD, from an inward- to an outward-facing conformation, is driven exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These findings provide direct evidence of divergence in the mechanism of ABC exporters.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02740.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02740.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are surrounded by a membrane that acts like a barrier to many molecules. This membrane either stops molecules from entering or exiting the cell, or at least slows their movement. However, it is important that cells can remove some molecules, such as toxins, and that nutrients and certain other molecules can get into cells. As such, cells rely on ‘transporter’ proteins embedded within the membrane to move these molecules through the membrane.</p><p>Transporters called ‘Multidrug ABC exporters’ are found in almost all living things, and use the energy released by breaking down molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP for short) to pump toxins out of cells. Although the three-dimensional shapes of many transporters are known, it is not clear how the energy released from ATP molecules allows the transporter to move a toxin from one side of the membrane to the other.</p><p>Here, Mishra et al. have looked at how the shape of an ABC exporter from a bacterium called <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> changes as it interacts with ATP. Most bacterial ABC exporters are made from two copies of the same protein, but the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> exporter is made from two slightly different proteins, one of which is less able to bind to and break down ATP. Mishra et al. found that those parts of the two proteins that bind to ATP can adopt a range of different shapes that had not been seen before. Moreover, the parts of the proteins that extend across the cell membrane face into the cell when the ATP binds, and switch to face out of the cell when the ATP is broken down. This movement of the proteins would allow toxic molecules inside the cell to enter the exporter, and then be pushed to the outside of the cell.</p><p>The findings of Mishra et al. show that not all ABC exporters work by the same mechanism. Future work could extend this new understanding to multidrug ABC transporters from humans, which remove waste and harmful molecules from our cells and have been implicated in resistance to chemotherapy in cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02740.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02740.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ABC transporter</kwd><kwd>double electron electron resonance</kwd><kwd>ABC heterodimer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM077659, S10RR027091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Smriti</given-names></name><name><surname>Verhalen</surname><given-names>Brandy</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mchaourab</surname><given-names>Hassane S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Po-Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Po-Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-GM104601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Po-Chao</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conformational cycle of an ABC heterodimeric transporter reveals a divergence in the structural mechanism of ABC exporters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters harness the energy of ATP to traffic a wide spectrum of molecules across cell membranes. In prokaryotes, ABC importers drive accumulation of nutrients in the cytoplasm against their concentration gradients while ABC exporters remove toxic substrates out of the cytoplasm and may function as flippases of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>). Mammalian ABC transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), are exclusively of the exporter class, play critical physiological roles and are associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>). Importers and exporters share a modular molecular architecture featuring two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs or ATP binding cassettes) that turnover ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that are presumed to form a translocation pathway across the bilayer. The four modules of ABC transporters can be encoded by separate genes and assembled as homo- or hetero-dimers, or expressed as a single polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rees et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mapping the conformational motion that transduces the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs to the mechanical work of substrate translocation in the TMDs is central to understanding the mechanism of ABC transporters. Crystallographic snapshots of ABC importers have revealed inward- and outward-facing states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Locher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korkhov et al., 2012</xref>) in the nomenclature of Jardetzky's alternating access model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>). Determined in the presence of substrates, substrate binding proteins and/or nucleotides, these structures were cast as representing catalytic intermediates in the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. In contrast, the proposed structural mechanism of ABC exporters is less elaborate invoking two states captured by crystallography: Inward-facing devoid of substrates and/or nucleotides (referred to as apo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2012</xref>) and outward-facing with bound nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>). While these structures highlight the possible range of conformational motion, there is no consensus regarding the suite of conformational steps that couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The quest for a unified mechanism of transport by ABC exporters has been hampered by seemingly conflicting structural and biochemical models. Inward-facing structures of the bacterial homodimer MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>) and eukaryotic Pgp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2012</xref>) have inverted V-shapes wherein the two leaflets of the transporters are separated by a large chamber open to the cytoplasm and the bilayer. In these nucleotide and substrate-free structures, the two NBDs are disengaged and separated by 10–50 Å. In contrast, nucleotide-bound, outward-facing structures of MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>) and its homolog Sav1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2007</xref>) have the two NBDs in close contact, bringing together the ABC signature motif from one subunit and the Walker A and Walker B sequences from the other subunit to form the nucleotide binding sites (NBSs). Inward- and outward-facing exporter structures were interpreted to imply that transport entails cycles of association and dissociation of the NBDs powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In this model, substrate partitions into the large chamber cradled by the two TMDs and is pushed along to the outer membrane leaflet by ATP-induced alternating access of the chamber. However, central elements of this model are considered inconsistent with mechanistic studies, primarily of the mammalian ABC exporter Pgp, implying catalytic asymmetry between the two NBSs and constant contact between the NBDs during transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siarheyeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it would appear that an apo state, devoid of nucleotides, is unlikely to be populated or is transient under cellular ATP concentrations which are typically an order of magnitude above the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of ATP. The ‘alternating site hydrolysis’ model posits that the two NBSs turnover ATP in an alternating manner constantly holding an intact ATP molecule in one of the NBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>). The conjecture that the large inward-facing cavity observed in the apo structures is required to accommodate the large substrates of exporters has also been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George and Jones, 2012</xref>) by the observation of smaller openings in the outward-facing conformations of MsbA and Sav1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Further confounding the structural perspective, a recent structure of an ABC heterodimer TM287/288 from the hyperthermophile <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> offered the first view of an ABC exporter in an inward-facing conformation where the two NBDs are partially engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike MsbA, Sav1866 and Pgp, TM287/288 is a heterodimeric ABC transporter with non-canonical sequences in the Walker B and switch motifs of one subunit resulting in a catalytically impaired NBS. In the TM287/288 structure, the impaired NBS, also referred to as the degenerate NBS, is bridged by an AMP-PNP molecule while the intact NBS, referred to as the consensus NBS, is more open creating an asymmetric NBD interface. Despite the partially engaged NBDs, the TMDs still form a chamber open to partitioning of substrates from the cytoplasm but does not appear to be accessible from the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>). This structure is consistent with biochemical studies of bacterial ABC heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lubelski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>) that suggest catalytic asymmetry between the NBSs. However, while the TM287/288 structure provides a structural basis for asymmetric nucleotide binding, it does not elucidate the mechanistic role of such an intermediate in the transport cycle in the presence of substrate and under conditions of ATP turnover. Importantly, the broader question of how the mechanism of homodimers and heterodimers differ as a consequence of impairment of an NBS remains unanswered. In addition to their importance to understanding the fundamental mechanism of transport, addressing these questions provides insight into the role of catalytic asymmetry in mammalian ABC transporters such as CFTR and TAP1/2, which play fundamental physiological roles and have been directly associated with diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abele and Tampé, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrov et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have investigated the conformational changes associated with specific steps in the substrate-coupled ATPase cycle of an ABC heterodimeric transporter, BmrCD from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torres et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galián et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to other ABC heterodimers, sequence modifications in the consensus motifs of the NBDs, including the replacement of the Walker B catalytic glutamate by an aspartate in BmrD, suggest that ATP turnover is impaired. <italic>BmrC</italic> and <italic>BmrD</italic> genes are upregulated in the response of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to antibiotics exposure and BmrCD confers multidrug transport activity on inside-out <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torres et al., 2009</xref>) and in reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dezi et al., 2013</xref>). Spin label pairs were introduced at strategic locations to monitor the movement of the NBDs and TMDs by Double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeschke and Polyhach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mchaourab et al., 2011</xref>). The experimental design reconstructs the conformational dynamics of the transporter by comparing distance distributions obtained under turnover conditions with those measured in trapped catalytic intermediates. Our results reveal structural asymmetry at the NBSs presumably reflecting asymmetric binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase cycle proceeds through multiple conformations of the NBD dimer while the TMDs undergo an inward- to outward-facing transition powered exclusively by ATP hydrolysis. These are distinct mechanistic steps compared to ABC homodimers where a two-state association/dissociation cycle of the NBD is tightly coupled to the transition of the TMD from inward- to outward-facing conformations with ATP binding providing the power stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zou and Mchaourab, 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to define the structural dynamic consequences of the selective impairment of an NBS and to uncover divergence in the conformational cycles within the ABC exporter superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To monitor conformational changes in BmrCD as it cycles between different states driven by substrate binding and ATP turnover, we introduced pairs of spin labels, consisting of one spin label in BmrC and one spin label in BmrD, at surface-exposed sites in the NBDs and TMDs. The native cysteines of BmrD were replaced by alanines to yield a cysteine-free construct. To guide in the selection of residues for spin labeling, a homology model of BmrCD was built using the crystal structure of AMP-PNP-bound TM287/288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>) as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A subset of the spin label pairs was designed to be structurally similar to MsbA pairs previously demonstrated to ‘fingerprint’ the transition between inward- and outward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2009</xref>). We verified that cysteine-free and spin-labeled BmrCD mutants hydrolyze ATP in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) micelles and in lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importanly, the rates of ATP turnover are stimulated by the transport substrate Hoechst33342 (hereafter referred as Hoechst) except for the 533/625 pair. Therefore, this pair will be interpreted only in the context of the overall data set describing the movement of the NBDs as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conformational states of BmrCD NBDs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of BmrCD homology model showing the spin label pairs at symmetric sites across the NBD dimer interface (the transporter is rotated 90° and NBD interface is viewed from cytoplasm).

Three distinct conformations for apo, AMP-PNP-bound and the HES intermediates are deduced from the shifts in distance distributions at the NBSs for all the pairs.

The breadth of the AMP-PNP distribution at the consensus NBS demonstrates that ATP binding enables a range of conformations to be populated that includes the HES. In contrast, ATP hydrolysis is required to observe an HES population at the degenerate NBS as inferred from the predominantly distinct distributions in the presence of AMP-PNP and ADP-Vi.

This finding suggests relative flexibility between the NBD and TMD that allows large independent movement of the former upon ATP binding. In contrast, when ATP is hydrolyzed and ADP subsequently trapped by the addition of Vi, we observed concomitant shifts in the average distance at the intra- and extracellular sides of the transporter. Coupled to the formation of the NBD closed dimer, ATP hydrolysis induces closing of the intracellular side and opening of the extracellular side consistent with an alternating access mechanism involving inward-facing and outward-facing conformations.

However, the differences in the population amplitude of these states reveal that the two NBSs do not have to concurrently be in the same catalytic intermediate. For example, while a significant population of the consensus NBS is in apo-like conformation, the degenerate NBS is predominantly in either the nucleotide-bound or HES-like conformations. Such an asymmetric disengagement of the signature and Walker A motifs at the consensus NBS, which requires their separation by more than 20–40 Å, is not structurally compatible with an HES-like conformation at the degenerate NBS. Therefore, the distributions under turnover conditions imply the existence of a transporter intermediate wherein the degenerate NBS is ATP-bound while the consensus NBS assumes an apo-like conformation. Similarly, we can infer the presence of another state of the transporter wherein the degenerate NBS is in a HES-like state and the consensus NBS is in the ATP-bound conformation.</p><p>Longer incubation times shift the distribution towards the ATP/ADP-bound population at the degenerate NBS (compare 1 and 5 min time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) while at similar incubation times, the consensus site shows a considerably larger population in the ATP-bound and the apo states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Pairs of spin labels were introduced in each MsbA protomer with the purpose of monitoring the two NBSs following the design principles described above for BmrCD. Because MsbA is a homodimer, this strategy introduces four spin labels in the functional unit related by six distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). If the NBD interface is twofold symmetric, three of these distances are unique (d1, d2, d3, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Two distances relate labels at distinct sites: one is short range (d1) arising from pairs monitoring the NBS while the other represents symmetry-related sites that interact across the dimer interface and is considerably longer (d2). Therefore, in addition to considerations of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and surface localization, the two sites, 350 and 471, were selected to maximize the differences between spin labels reporting on the NBS conformation vs those reporting the distance between symmetry-related spin labels in the dimer. These selection criteria simplify the interpretation of the distance distributions and allow for the identification of the components that arise from dipolar coupling between spin labels across the NBS. However, the projection of the spin labels relative to the Cα breaks the symmetry leading to distinct distances in the 350/350 and 471/471 pairs. This complication does not affect the interpretation of the short component which monitors the NBSs.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>MsbA conformational dynamics under turnover conditions reveal a two-state equilibrium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of the AMP-PNP structure of MsbA (PDB:3B60) showing the spin-labeled pairs.

In contrast to the ATP-induced association/dissociation cycle of NBDs in bacterial homodimers reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2009</xref>) and further confirmed here, the NBDs of heterodimers form structurally asymmetric dimers as a consequence of ATP binding and its subsequent hydrolysis. We uncovered conformations wherein the impaired NBS holds on to an ATP molecule while the consensus NBS disengages enabling product release and rebinding of ATP. Asymmetric NBD conformations were hypothesized from the elegant mechanistic analysis of Pgp by Senior et al. but were not directly detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline and Senior, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tombline et al., 2005</xref>). We propose that the distinct mechanism of heterodimers requires a less efficient coupling between the NBD and TMD, a ‘conformational leak’, to enable NBD movement without transmission to the TMDs. This would require a tuning of the sequences and interactions of the IH1 and IH2 coupling loops and possibly the cytoplasmic extension of TMs, regions hypothesized to form the transmission interface between the NBDs and TMDs of ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oancea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loo et al., 2013</xref>). There is a substantial impact of lipids on the coupling between the NBD and TMD. Transmission of the conformational changes to the TMD is more stringently dependent on the presence of substrate in lipid bilyaers. This finding is consistent with previous work revealing that lipids can shift the conformational preferences of ion-coupled transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanelt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This novel insight was derived from experiments that monitor transporter conformational states under turnover conditions. Unlike previous studies, which investigated exclusively stable intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zou et al., 2009</xref>), here the mechanistic implications of these intermediates were challenged under substrate and nucleotide conditions that mimic those of the cell. Another unique experimental design is the selective monitoring of individual NBSs rather than the NBD interface facilitated by the heterodimeric nature of BmrCD. NBS distance distributions capture the interconversion of the transporter between conformations corresponding to those observed under trapped conditions, thereby establishing the direct relevance of the trapped conformations to the substrate-coupled ATPase cycle. Furthermore, the observation of a steady state population of apo-like conformation of the consensus NBS, even in the presence of excess ATP, prompts us to conclude that disengagement of this NBS is required for ADP-Pi dissociation and subsequent binding of ATP, thereby establishing the mechanistic significance of a local apo-like conformation.</p><p>Our results can be framed in a model of how asymmetric ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs drive transition of the TMDs between inward- and outward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Distinguishing features of this model include the formation of structurally asymmetric conformations of the NBDs and the association of the transporter power stroke with ATP hydrolysis. In the presence of cellular ATP concentrations, BmrCD will have at least one ATP molecule bound, most likely at the degenerate NBS as evidenced by the fact that an apo-like conformation was nearly undetectable at this NBS in the presence of excess ATP. Such an ATP-bound resting state does not hinder substrate access to the putative binding chamber at the TMD interface, since ATP binding does not induce closure of the cytoplasmic side of BmrCD. ATP binding to the consensus NBS yields an intermediate with two ATP molecules bound (‘1’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We refer to this conformation of the NBD dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as a pre-hydrolysis intermediate reminiscent of the pre-hydrolysis complex observed in a crystal structure of the maltose transporter, MalK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oldham and Chen, 2011</xref>). In this conformation, the NBDs are engaged but the NBSs have not formed the canonical configuration and are therefore not catalytically competent. ATP turnover is initiated by fluctuations at the consensus NBS which enables transition to a hydrolysis-competent configuration (HES-like) as deduced from the overlapping distance distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. This is a relatively minor population of the transporter which likely explains the relatively slow ATP turnover by BmrCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). ATP hydrolysis switches TMD accessibility thereby catalyzing the extrusion of the substrate. Turnover rates are stimulated if the substrate binds prior to hydrolysis but there is a considerable basal consumption of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While there is evidence of ATP turnover by impaired NBSs, consideration of the reaction mechanism as well as previous biochemical studies of ABC heterodimers support an intrinsically slower rate at the degenerate NBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Procko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncoeur et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, ADP and Pi are released from the consensus site prior to hydrolysis at the degenerate site enabling multiple rounds of asymmetric ATP hydrolysis without the complete disengagement of the NBDs to an apo conformation.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02740.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Distinct mechanisms of ABC heterodimers and homodimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Asymmetric hydrolysis of ATP in an ABC heterodimer.

However, the negligible population of apo-like degenerate NBS and the fact that ADP-bound NBDs form a partially engaged dimer argue against significant population of an apo state of the transporter where the two NBDs are separated by more than 50 Å. Thus, this ‘global’ apo state (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) appears not to be mechanistically relevant in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of ABC heterodimers.

Although it was anticipated that the inward- to outward-facing transition of ABC exporters would follow the structural mechanics defined by the structures of MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ward et al., 2007</xref>), we show in this work that coupling of the TMD transition to the ATPase cycle is not identical between subclasses of exporters. Evidence of more variation in the coupling mechanism has emerged recently from a structure of a human ABC homodimer where the NBSs are disengaged even in the presence of AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shintre et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, if indeed TMD conformational changes require hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule in heterodimers, it raises the conundrum of why two molecules are hydrolyzed in ABC homodimers to achieve what would appear to be similar type of mechanical work. Addressing these questions is the next frontier in understanding the mechanism of ABC exporters.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Homology modeling of BmrCD</title><p>A homology model of the inward-facing BmrCD was constructed with MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marti-Renom et al., 2000</xref>), using the crystal structure of the asymmetric ABC transporter TM287/288 (PDB: 3QF4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012</xref>) as the template. In order to correctly map the consensus and degenerate nucleotide-binding sites, TMD287 was chosen as the template for BmrC and TMD288 as a template for BmrD. The alignment between BmrC and TM287 was directly generated by pairwise Blastp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, due to low sequence identity, the homology of the first ∼150 amino acids of BmrD could not be determined through direct pairwise alignment. The BmrD/TM288 alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) was instead obtained by manually optimizing a multiple alignment involving sequences of BmrC, BmrD, TM287, TM288, and SAV1866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dawson and Locher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which was generated using Clustal-Ω (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>). In the multiple alignment, the N-terminal region of BmrD (Met1-Leu48) is aligned to the elbow helix and the TM1 of other ABC transporters, followed by a heterologous insertion of ∼100 residues. Assuming the aligned sequence within a transmembrane helix is ungapped, the BmrD alignment near the heterologous insertion was then manually optimized by ungapped extension from the aligned sequence immediately C-terminal to the inserted region, which covers most of the TM2 of TM288. Similarly, the alignment of BmrD/TM288 near the TM5 (Asn333-Gly365 of BmrD) was also manually optimized due to its lower local sequence identity and the presence of inserted residues in the transmembrane region of the BmrD sequence. The inserted region of BmrD (Cys49–Ile146) was not modeled due to the lack of homologous sequence in any protein structure. The final sequence alignment used for homology modeling is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To maintain the structural stability and the global conformation during the refinement of the initial homology model, Cα atoms in ungapped aligned regions (Tyr15-Asp46, Leu57-Gly84, Leu93-Asp124, Leu137-Leu316, Gly335-Gln573 of BmrC; and Met1-Ile47, Phe162-Arg328, Ser368-Glu411, Arg429-Ala673 of BmrD) were excluded from the refinement, that is, their positions remain fixed in the final model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cloning, expression, purification and labeling of BmrCD</title><p>Cysteine-less BmrCD (BmrCD-WT*) was constructed from wild type BmrCD (BmrCD-WT) in pET21b(+) (a kind gift of Dr JM Jault) by substitution of three native cysteines of BmrD by alanines using QuikChange site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA).

The software implements a number of well-established approaches to DEER data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandon et al., 2012</xref>). The motivation for developing this software was to carry out global analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beechem, 1992</xref>) of the DEER decays obtained under different conditions for the same spin label pair. The distance distribution is assumed to consist of a sum of Gaussians, the number of which is determined based on a statistical criterion. The optimal number of Gaussian components and the center, width and amplitude of each component were allowed to vary between conditions. The slope of the background was assumed to be uniform across the data set but was fit rather than set by the user. Care was taken to ensure that the concentration of samples for the same spin label pair were identical within experimental error. The statistical significance between fits with increasing number of Gaussian distributions was determined using an F test. The root-mean squared difference between the data and fit was minimized using the trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented in the MATLAB routine ‘lsqnonlin’. We compared results from this analysis to those obtained by using the package DeerAnalysis 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeschke et al., 2006</xref>) for data obtained in the trapped conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1–3</xref>) and found that the resulting distributions are very similar. The main advantage of this approach is the accurate determination of changes in the amplitude of distance components under turnover conditions where a subjective determination of the background in DeerAnalysis can distort these changes.
