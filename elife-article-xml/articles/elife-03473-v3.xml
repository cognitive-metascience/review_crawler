production. After import, it is unclear how these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to the ribosome assembly site in the nucleolus. Here, we report the discovery of a conserved nuclear carrier Tsr2 that coordinates transfer of the r-protein eS26 to the earliest assembling pre-ribosome, the 90S. In vitro studies revealed that Tsr2 efficiently dissociates importin:eS26 complexes via an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism that terminates the import process. Subsequently, Tsr2 binds the released eS26, shields it from proteolysis, and ensures its safe delivery to the 90S pre-ribosome. We anticipate similar carriers—termed here escortins—to securely connect the nuclear import machinery with pathways that deposit r-proteins onto developing pre-ribosomal particles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03473.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03473.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03473.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The production of a protein in a cell starts with a region of DNA being transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA. A large molecular machine called ribosome then reads the information in the messenger RNA molecule to produce a protein. Ribosomes themselves are made of RNA and several different proteins called r-proteins. The construction of a ribosome starts with the assembly of a pre-ribosome inside the cell nucleus, and the ribosome is completed in the cytosol of the cell.</p><p>A yeast cell will divide about 30 times during its lifetime, and before each division event a single yeast cell needs to import about 14 million r-proteins into its nucleus in order to make about 200,000 ribosomes. However, many details of this process are mysterious. In particular, many r-proteins are known to be unstable: meaning that, left to their own devices, r-proteins are highly likely to aggregate, which would prevent them becoming part of a ribosome.</p><p>Now, Schütz et al. have figured out how a carrier protein called Tsr2 makes sure that an r-protein called eS26 does indeed become part of a ribosome. The human disorder known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia is caused by a mutation in the gene for eS26.</p><p>The eS26 proteins are ferried to the cell nucleus on specialized transport vehicles. Schütz et al. have now shown that the Tsr2 carrier protein unloads the r-protein from the transport vehicle in the nucleus, and then binds it. This means that the r-protein does not form an aggregate. Finally, the Tsr2 carrier protein transfers the r-protein to the pre-ribosome. This is the first time that a carrier protein that unloads an r-protein cargo from its transport vehicle, to ensure safe delivery to the pre-ribosome, has been identified.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03473.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03473.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>rRNA processing</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>Tsr2</kwd><kwd>eS26</kwd><kwd>Diamond-Blackfan anemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant EURIBIO260676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panse</surname><given-names>Vikram G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlenstedt</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universität des Saarlandes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Homburger Forschungsförderung</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlenstedt</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant 233226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schubert</surname><given-names>Olga T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIME-XS 262067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schubert</surname><given-names>Olga T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Tsr2 carrier protein connects the nuclear import machinery with the ribosome assembly pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribosome assembly is an essential process that is tightly connected to cellular growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Warner, 1999</xref>). In the eukaryotic model organism budding yeast, this universal translating machine is built of two subunits: a large subunit (60S) consisting of three different rRNAs (25S, 5.8S, 5S) and 46 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and a small subunit (40S) that contains a single rRNA (18S) and 33 r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klinge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome takes place in three distinct cellular territories: the nucleolus, the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Woolford and Baserga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gerhardy et al., 2014</xref>). RNA polymerase I drives production of the 35S pre-rRNA transcript in the nucleolus, which initiates the assembly process. The emerging 35S pre-rRNA transcript undergoes co-transcriptional modification and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Osheim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kos and Tollervey, 2010</xref>), and associates primarily with 40S subunit r-proteins and ∼50 assembly factors to form the earliest pre-ribosome, the 90S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schäfer et al., 2003</xref>). Cleavage of 35S pre-rRNA releases the pre-40S particle, permitting the remaining pre-rRNA to associate with r-proteins of the 60S subunit and ∼200 additional assembly factors to undergo further maturation and pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fatica et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nissan et al., 2002</xref>). Nuclear maturation of pre-ribosomal particles also requires the release of assembly factors, a process thought to require &gt;50 energy consuming enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Strunk and Karbstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>). Export competent pre-ribosomal particles are separately transported through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) into the cytoplasm by multiple export factors. In yeast, export factors include the exportin Xpo1, which recognizes nuclear export sequences (NESs) in a RanGTP-dependent manner, and additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>). Export factors bind pre-ribosomal particles and interact simultaneously with FG-repeat nucleoporins lining the NPC channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oeffinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradatsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yao et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hackmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altvater et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Faza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Occhipinti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Following export, pre-ribosomal particles undergo final maturation prior to initiating translation. This involves the release of shuttling assembly factors, transport factors, incorporation of the remaining r-proteins and final pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Panse, 2011</xref>). Within the pre-40S particle, immature 20S pre-rRNA is endonucleolytically cleaved into mature 18S rRNA by the nuclease Nob1 rendering the subunit translation competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fatica et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>). Although, Nob1 is recruited to 40S pre-ribosomes in the nucleus, it is activated in the cytoplasm within an 80S-like pre-ribosomal particle formed upon interaction with a mature 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, multiple conserved ATPases Prp43, Rio2, Rli1 and Fap7, the Prp43-activator Pfa1, the kinase Rio1, the assembly factor Ltv1 and the r-protein uS11 (yeast Rps14) are implicated in this cleavage step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geerlings et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanrobays et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jakovljevic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granneman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hellmich et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the identification of a plethora of factors and their general order of action, how nuclear and cytoplasmic assembly steps are coordinated remains largely unknown.</p><p>In addition to the tremendous energy required to assemble ribosomes, this process also accounts for the major proportion of the nucleocytoplasmic transport in a growing yeast cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rout et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sydorskyy et al., 2003</xref>). All mRNAs encoding r-proteins must be exported into the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. Nearly all newly synthesized r-proteins are then imported into the nucleus. In yeast, the importin Kap123 has been shown to be an important mediator of r-protein import, but the related importin Pse1 can functionally substitute Kap123 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rout et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schlenstedt et al., 1997</xref>). Unlike other cargos, r-proteins contain large unstructured regions that form intricate interactions with rRNA within the mature ribosome and are prone to non-specific interactions with nucleic acids, aggregation and proteolytic degradation in their non-assembled state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jäkel and Görlich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jäkel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klinge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to typical protein transport events, nuclear import of r-proteins and subsequent transfer to the ribosome production site pose logistical challenges. In addition to their transport role, importins have been implicated to chaperone basic r-proteins during their transport to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jäkel et al., 2002</xref>). How these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to assembling pre-ribosomal particles after dissociating from importins remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we report the discovery of a carrier Tsr2 that coordinates transfer of the eukaryote specific r-protein eS26 (yeast Rps26; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2014</xref>) after nuclear import to the assembling 90S pre-ribosome. Tsr2 extracts eS26 from its importins to terminate its import process. Hereby, we reveal an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism to dissociate an importin:cargo complex. Tsr2 binds and protects the released eS26 from aggregation and proteolysis thereby ensuring its safe transfer to the 90S pre-ribosome. Our data raise the possibility of a yet unidentified fleet of carriers that securely link the nuclear import machinery with the ribosome assembly pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tsr2 is required for cytoplasmic processing of 20S pre-rRNA to mature 18S rRNA</title><p>Previous genome-wide studies revealed a strong accumulation of immature 20S pre-rRNA in a <italic>TSR2</italic> (20 <underline>S</underline> r<underline>R</underline>NA accumulation <underline>2</underline>) deficient yeast strain (<italic>tsr2Δ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peng et al., 2003</xref>).

These cell-biological studies revealed that both fusion proteins predominantly localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A similar location for the Tsr2-3xGFP fusion protein (expressed from a CEN plasmid under its natural promoter and terminator regions) was observed in a Tsr2-depleted strain. The strains expressing the various fusion proteins were not impaired in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) suggesting that addition of the -GFP, -TAP, and -3xGFP tags did not affect Tsr2 function.

To this end, we monitored localization of 40S subunits in Tsr2-depleted cells using the established reporter uS5-GFP (yeast Rps2-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milkereit et al., 2001</xref>).

To this end, we monitored the localization of the 5′ portion of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) that is present within immature 20S pre-rRNA, but not in mature 18S rRNA, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In a WT strain, due to efficient nuclear export of pre-40S subunits, Cy3-ITS1 (red) is detectable only in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After nuclear export, ITS1 is cleaved from 20S pre-rRNA by the endonuclease Nob1 and degraded by the exonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stevens et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moy and Silver, 2002</xref>). Tsr2-depleted cells exhibited strong cytoplasmic accumulation of Cy3-ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that cytoplasmic processing is impaired in these cells.</p><p>Two studies proposed that 20S pre-rRNA processing occurs within an 80S-like particle formed via interaction between a mature 60S subunit and a pre-40S subunit in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). One possibility is that formation of this particle is impaired in Tsr2-depleted cells, thereby indirectly interfering with 20S pre-rRNA processing. To test this, we performed polysome analyses. Cell extracts from WT and Tsr2-depleted cells prepared under polysome preserving conditions were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In agreement with a role in the 40S biogenesis pathway, the polysome profile of Tsr2-depleted cell extracts revealed strongly reduced levels of free 40S subunits and polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panel). Northern analyses revealed that mature 25S rRNA and immature 20S pre-rRNA co-peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom panel), indicating accumulation of 80S-like particles, similar to the one seen upon Fap7-depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granneman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, pre-40S subunits that are exported into the cytoplasm in Tsr2-depleted cells interact with mature 60S subunits, but fail to undergo 20S pre-rRNA processing. We conclude that Tsr2 is required for cytoplasmic maturation of pre-40S subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tsr2 directly binds the eukaryote specific r-protein eS26</title><p>Next, we analyzed the sedimentation behavior of Tsr2 on sucrose density gradients. Cell extracts from WT cells were subjected to polysome analyses. The gradient was fractionated and analyzed by Western analyses. Unexpectedly, Tsr2 did not co-sediment with the 40S peak or with heavier fractions, but was found exclusively in lighter fractions at the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data indicate that Tsr2 does not stably associate with pre-ribosomal particles in the 40S biogenesis pathway.</p><p>To identify interaction partners of Tsr2, we isolated Tsr2-TAP. In agreement with the sedimentation studies above, Tsr2-TAP did not isolate a pre-40S particle.

Using this strain, we investigated whether eS26 is required for nuclear export of pre-40S subunits and/or cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing by monitoring the localization of uS5-GFP and Cy3-ITS1. eS26-depletion did not induce nuclear accumulation of uS5-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating no apparent impairment in pre-40S subunit nuclear export. However, these cells showed a strong cytoplasmic accumulation of Cy3-ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating impairment in final 20S pre-rRNA processing. Further, polysome analyses of eS26-depleted cell extracts revealed strongly reduced levels of free 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top panel). Northern analyses revealed that mature 25S rRNA and immature 20S pre-rRNA co-peaked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, bottom panel), indicating an accumulation of 80S-like particles. Thus, as observed in Tsr2-depleted cells, eS26-depleted cells contain pre-40S subunits that fail to process 20S pre-rRNA in the cytoplasm.

Co-enrichment of eS26 with pre-ribosomal particles was assessed by (1) Western analyses using antibodies that recognize eS26 and (2) selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS). SRM-MS is a reliable tool that overcomes stochastic under sampling of peptides, a critical deficit in shotgun mass spectrometry which complicates the reproducible detection and precise quantitation of proteins in a complex mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</xref>). SRM relies on the development of specific mass spectrometric-based assays for every target protein and their subsequent application to the relative or absolute quantification within multiple biological samples. We developed a set of SRM assays that enabled us to simultaneously monitor the co-enrichment of eS26 and different r-proteins: uS7 (Rps5), eS28 (Rps28), eS1 (Rps1) and uS11 (Rps14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) with multiple pre-ribosomal particles.

The r-protein eS26 is assembled into the 90S pre-ribosome and is then rapidly transported to the cytoplasm as part of the 40S pre-ribosome. To investigate eS26 nuclear uptake in vivo we uncoupled its import from its export. Structural analyses of the 40S subunit showed that the N-terminus of eS26 is embedded within the rRNA framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>). We fused GFP to the N-terminus of eS26 with the aim to impair its incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosome. Sucrose gradient analyses showed that GFP-eS26 co-sediments only in lighter fractions at the top of the gradient suggesting that it is not incorporated into pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In vitro binding studies showed that like eS26, GFP-eS26 interacts with Kap123, Kap104 and Pse1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, the GFP-eS26 fusion protein is functional to recruit the import machinery, although it does not complement the eS26-depleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Further, GFP-eS26 directly binds Tsr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and importantly, like eS26, GFP-eS26 is degraded upon Tsr2-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We exploited the GFP-eS26 fusion protein as a tool to monitor the nuclear uptake of eS26 in different importin mutants. Consistent with in vitro binding assays, nuclear uptake of GFP-eS26 was reduced in <italic>kap123Δ</italic> and <italic>kap104Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that eS26 import requires these importins. Nuclear localization of GFP-eS26 in the <italic>pse1-1 ts</italic> mutant at restrictive temperature remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) indicating that impairment of this importin alone does not inhibit the nuclear import of eS26. The <italic>pse1-1 kap123Δ</italic> mutant showed only a slight increase in cytoplasmic staining of GFP-eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Nuclear import of GFP-eS26 was unaffected in the <italic>kap114Δ sxm1Δ</italic> double mutant and <italic>sxm1Δ kap120Δ nmd5Δ</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated which region of eS26 contributes to its nuclear uptake. For this, we monitored the localization of different truncated versions of eS26 fused to -GFP at the N-terminus. These cell-biological analyses revealed that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain is required for efficient nuclear uptake of eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>). If eS26 were imported into the nucleus in complex with Tsr2, then we reasoned that depletion of eS26 would induce Tsr2 mislocalization to the cytoplasm. However, localization of Tsr2-3xGFP was not affected upon eS26-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These studies together with the observation that Tsr2:eS26 complex is unable to recruit importins argue against the idea that eS26 is transported to the nucleus in complex with Tsr2. We conclude that Kap123 and Kap104 target eS26 to the nucleus and that Tsr2 is not a component of this import complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Kap123 targets Tsr2 to the nucleus</title><p>Next, we investigated how Tsr2 is targeted to the nucleus in vivo. For this, we monitored the location of Tsr2-3xGFP in different importin mutants. We found that Tsr2-3xGFP mislocalizes to the cytoplasm in the <italic>kap123Δ</italic> mutant, but not in other importin mutants for e.g. <italic>kap104Δ</italic> and <italic>pse1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, Kap123 seems to be the major import receptor for Tsr2. However, we did not observe a direct interaction between Tsr2 and Kap123 or any other importin in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). One possibility could be that import of Tsr2 by Kap123 is regulated by post-translational modification. Alternatively, Tsr2 might be transported into the nucleus via a ‘piggy bag’ mechanism bound to another yet unknown Kap123 cargo. We can exclude the possibility that eS26 serves as an adaptor to import Tsr2 since (1) Tsr2 does not mislocalize to the cytoplasm in a eS26-depleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and (2) in vitro binding assays show that the Tsr2:eS26 complex does not interact with Kap123 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Tsr2 dissociates importin:eS26 complexes in a RanGTP-independent manner</title><p>After transport of an importin:cargo complex into the nucleus, RanGTP binds to the N-terminal region of the importin, triggering cargo release and allowing recycling of the importin to participate in subsequent import cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kobayashi and Matsuura, 2013</xref>). To test whether the release of eS26 from the importins is RanGTP-dependent, we performed in vitro dissociation assays. A pre-formed importin:eS26 complex was incubated with 1.5 µM Gsp1Q71L-GTP (equivalent to the human RanQ69L mutant that cannot efficiently hydrolyze GTP, hereafter Gsp1Q71L-GTP is termed RanGTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischoff et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maurer et al., 2001</xref>). Although RanGTP was able to dissociate the Kap104:eS26 complex, and partially dissociate the Pse1:eS26 complex, we did not observe dissociation of the Kap123:eS26 complex even after 1 hr incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It was reported that both RNA and RanGTP are required to release of the mRNA binding proteins Nab2 and Nab4 from Kap104 and the mRNA export factor Npl3 from Mtr10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Senger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee and Aitchison, 1999</xref>). Because eS26 directly interacts with the 3′-end of the 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right panel), we tested if this region of the 18S rRNA is required to release eS26 from Kap123. However, eS26 remained stably bound to Kap123 in the presence of this RNA, either alone or in combination with RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Since the Tsr2:eS26 complex was unable to interact with importins, we tested whether Tsr2 stimulates the release of eS26 from importins. Surprisingly, Tsr2 alone efficiently removed eS26 from Kap123, Pse1 and Kap104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B,C</xref> and data not shown). This release was specific, since only RanGTP, but not Tsr2, was able to remove the 40S assembly factor Slx9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Faza et al., 2012</xref>) from the Pse1:Slx9 complex under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Moreover, Tsr2 specifically releases eS26 from the importin:eS26 complex, since it did not dissociate other tested importin:r-protein complexes (Kap123:uS14, Kap123:eS31 and Kap123:eS8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Since eS26 was inefficiently removed from the Pse1:eS26 complex after 1 hr incubation with RanGTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we investigated the dissociation kinetics of importin:eS26 complexes in the presence of RanGTP or Tsr2. For this, the importin:eS26 complex was incubated with 1.5 µM of either RanGTP or Tsr2 and the release of eS26 from the importin was monitored over time. We found that the amount of eS26 bound to Kap123, Pse1 or Kap104 was only slightly reduced after 8 min, even though RanGTP was efficiently recruited to the different importins:eS26 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>, left panel). In contrast, Tsr2 completely removed eS26 from these importins within 1 min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, right panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>, right panel). Notably, even at lower concentrations (375 nM) Tsr2 was able to release eS26 from the importin:eS26 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Moreover, Tsr2 stably associated with the released eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Tsr2 shields eS26 from proteolysis and aggregation, and promotes a safe transfer to the 90S pre-ribosome</title><p>The observation that Tsr2 is able to extract eS26 from importins, prompted us to investigate whether Tsr2 plays a role in the transfer of eS26 to the assembling pre-ribosome. To test this, we isolated Enp1-TAP, which purifies both the 90S pre-ribosome and an early pre-40S subunit, from WT and Tsr2-depleted cells and assessed co-enrichment of eS26 by Western analyses. Consistent with a role for Tsr2 in supplying eS26 to the 90S pre-ribosome, we found that eS26 does not efficiently co-enrich with Enp1-TAP in Tsr2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This was specific for eS26, since the recruitment of uS7 and uS3 to Enp1-TAP particles was not affected in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This lack of enrichment was due to decreased eS26 protein levels, since Western analyses of whole cell extracts derived from Tsr2-depleted cells revealed strongly reduced eS26 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data led us to test whether eS26 becomes susceptible to proteolysis in Tsr2-depleted cells.

This process requires the import of ∼14 million r-proteins into the nucleus through ∼200 NPCs. Such a process entails rapid transport of importin:r-protein complexes into the nucleus, and necessitates an efficient mechanism to dissociate these complexes to terminate the import process. This permits rapid recycling of importins back to the cytoplasm for subsequent rounds of import. Although it is recognized that r-proteins employ multiple import pathways to reach the nuclear compartment, it remains unclear how these intrinsically unstable and aggregation-prone proteins are targeted to the assembling pre-ribosome. It is assumed that, like a typical import cargo, RanGTP releases the r-protein from the importin and the r-protein somehow finds its way to its cognate rRNA site. Here, we reveal that Tsr2 extracts eS26 from importins and ensures its safe transfer to the 90S pre-ribosome. These data implicate an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism that terminates the import process, and uncovers an unanticipated link between the nuclear import machinery and the ribosome assembly pathway.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>eS26 is recruited to the 90S pre-ribosome</title><p>Using Western analyses and targeted SRM assays, we found that untagged eS26 is recruited to Noc4-TAP and co-enriches with nuclear pre-40S subunits that contain 20S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, eS26-GFP accumulated in the nucleus of <italic>yrb2Δ</italic> cells that are specifically impaired in 40S pre-ribosome export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that eS26 can be transported to the 90S pre-ribosome. Our findings contrast a previous report wherein a FLAG-tagged eS26 immunoprecipitated mainly 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, eS26 was not identified in mass spectrometry studies of a pre-40S subunit, and was suggested to replace the assembly factor Pno1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strunk et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">2012</xref>). However, we found that Pno1-TAP efficiently co-enriched eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Further, Tsr2-depletion impaired recruitment of Pno1 to pre-40S subunits, suggesting that eS26 helps to recruit Pno1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). eS26-depletion impaired only 20S pre-rRNA processing in the cytoplasm, suggesting that eS26 does not apparently affect 90S assembly per se, but is specifically required for final maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although the precise timing of eS26 recruitment remains unclear, based on our data, we propose that it is a late event during 90S assembly.</p><p>eS26 clamps the 3′-end of mature 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>), precisely at the site where the endonuclease Nob1 cleaves the 20S pre-rRNA. Pre-40S subunits that lack eS26 escape nuclear proofreading and are efficiently transported into the cytoplasm. These incompletely assembled pre-40S subunits recruit the endonuclease Nob1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and form 80S-like particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1D and 2C</xref>). However, they fail to process 20S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1C and 2B</xref>), an essential pre-requisite to form a mature 40S subunit. Thus, 20S pre-rRNA within an 80S-like particle becomes an optimal substrate for Nob1 only when the pre-40S subunit has satisfied a checklist that assesses its potential to translate, including the incorporation of eS26. We propose that the cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA cleavage functions as one of the checkpoints that prevent incompletely assembled, pre-40S subunits from entering translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RanGTP-independent dissociation of importin:eS26 complexes by Tsr2</title><p>eS26 is targeted to the 90S pre-ribosome and therefore must reach the nucleolus. Unlike the Kap104 adaptor Syo1 that co-imports uL18 (yeast Rpl5) and uL5 (yeast Rpl11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>), Tsr2 does not mediate interactions between eS26 and importins. Instead, our data identified Kap123 and Kap104 as the major importins that directly bind and transport eS26 into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Recruitment of RanGTP did not efficiently trigger the dissociation of importin:eS26 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). One possibility could be that eS26 engages in a novel interaction with the importins, thereby delaying its release. Such a delay may ensure the coordinated handover to the next binding factor, Tsr2. Structural analyses of the importin:eS26 complex should provide clues into why eS26 is inefficiently released from importins by RanGTP.</p><p>In contrast to RanGTP, Tsr2 efficiently removed eS26 from its importins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), identifying an atypical RanGTP-independent mechanism to terminate the import cycle. The observation that Tsr2 prevents proteolysis and aggregation of eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) indicates an additional ‘private’ chaperone function. Thus our study adds Tsr2:eS26 to the growing list of known chaperones:r-proteins pairs (Sqt1:uL16; Rrb1:uL3; Yar1:uS3) required for ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iouk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schaper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koch et al., 2012</xref>). Tsr2 may prevent eS26 from undergoing non-specific interactions with nucleic acids during its journey towards the 90S pre-ribosome. How eS26 is transferred from Tsr2 to 90S pre-ribosomes remains unclear. It is tempting to speculate that posttranslational modifications and/or energy consuming enzymes couple the extraction of eS26 from Tsr2 and subsequent incorporation.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model in which eS26 is transported to the nuclear compartment predominantly by importins Kap123 and Kap104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Inside the nucleus, eS26 is removed from its importins in a RanGTP-independent mechanism mediated by Tsr2. The released eS26 forms a stable complex with Tsr2. After Tsr2:eS26 complex formation, Tsr2 guarantees a safe transfer of eS26 to the 90S pre-ribosome. Although RanGTP is able to inefficiently release eS26 from its importin, failure to immediately bind Tsr2 results in eS26 degradation. Therefore, in absence of Tsr2, only a smaller fraction of eS26 may reach the 90S pre-ribosome, providing a possible explanation as to why Tsr2-deficient cells are severely impaired in growth but are still viable, although the r-protein eS26 is essential. Notably, human Tsr2 can rescue the severe growth defect of the Tsr2-depleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), strongly suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of Tsr2 in 40S assembly.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03473.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for the transport of eS26 to the 90S pre-ribosome.</title><p>Newly synthesized eS26 is transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus by importins.

For dissociation kinetics, 1.5 µM RanGTP (His<sub>6</sub>-Gsp1Q71L-GTP) or Tsr2 were added to pre-immobilized importin:eS26<sup>FLAG</sup> complexes and samples were withdrawn at 1, 2, 4 and 8 min. Bound proteins were eluted in twofold LDS/SDS-sample buffer by incubating at 70–95°C and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or by Western analyses using antibodies against Tsr2 and eS26.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Aggregation assay</title><p>The aggregation assay was performed in a 384-well plate (Polystyrene, clear bottom, low volume, Corning, USA). In each well 33 µM GST-eS26 and a given concentration of Tsr2 (0 up to 266 µM) in PBSKMT was pre-incubated for 1 hr at 4°C (final volume: 90 µl). 250 nM of PreScission protease was added to initiate aggregation. Aggregation of free eS26 was measured at 450 nm using a Multiskan GO plate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA). As controls, scattering intensities of individual components used in the aggregation assay such as 33 µM of GST-eS26 alone, 266 µM of Tsr2 alone, PreScission protease and buffer were measured. Four replicates were performed for each sample measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SRM assay development, quantitation and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Affinity purified pre-40S particles were processed for mass spectrometric analysis as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altvater et al., 2012</xref>). Affinity-purified protein samples were denatured and cysteine residues were reduced and alkylated. After tryptic digest the peptides were purified with C18 columns. Before mass spectrometric analysis, 11 retention time calibration peptides (iRT peptides, RT-kit WR, Biognosys) were added to every sample at a ratio of 1:20.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>SRM assay development</title><p>To develop SRM assays, peptide samples of the affinity purified pre-40S particles were analyzed on a nanoLC 1Dplus system (Eksigent) connected to a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (ABSciex). Peptides were separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a 20-cm fused silica microcapillary (75 µm inner diameter, New Objective) packed in-house with 3 µm C18 beads (Magic C18 AQ, 200 Å pore size; Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA, USA) with a linear gradient from 98% solvent A (98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic) and 2% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 35% solvent B over 120 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode. MS1 spectra were recorded in the range of 360–1460 m/z for 500 ms. Up to 20 precursor ions with charge state 2–5 were selected for fragmentation and MS2 spectra were recorded in the range of 50–2000 m/z for 150 ms in high sensitivity mode. Selected precursor ions were excluded for 20 s after one occurrence. Raw data files were centroided and converted to mzML format using the ABSciex Data Converter and then converted to mzXML format using ProteoWizard MSConvert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kessner et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>MS2 spectra were searched with Sorcerer-SEQUEST (SageN Research) against a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein database (SGD, May 2013) to which the sequences of the 11 spiked-in iRT peptides and various common contaminants were added. Reversed sequences of all proteins were appended to the protein database to assess the number of false positive peptide-spectrum matches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elias and Gygi, 2007</xref>). Tryptic cleavage was defined to occur after lysine and arginine, unless followed by a proline residue, and peptides were allowed to have up to one non-tryptic end and up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was added as static modification and methionine oxidation as variable modification. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 50 ppm. Resulting peptide-spectrum matches were statistically assessed using PeptideProphet and iProphet as part of the TPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shteynberg et al., 2011</xref>). The iProphet output was processed with MAYU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reiter et al., 2009</xref>), which has been modified to work with iProphet probabilities. Peptide-spectrum matches were selected at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.07% to obtain a protein FDR of 1%. An in-house written script was used to convert all retention times into iRT values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escher et al., 2012</xref>). SpectraST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lam et al., 2008</xref>) was used to generate a consensus spectral library from which the six most intense fragment ions (b- or y-ions) per peptide precursor were selected in Skyline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>).

After removing non-detectable peptides and interfered transitions, peptide intensities (sum of integrated transition peak area) were exported for further processing in Excel. All peptides were normalized on the protein abundance of uS7 (Rps5). Peptides of each protein were ranked by their average intensity over all samples and the three most intense peptides were averaged to obtain an abundance value for every protein. The standard deviation was calculated assuming that the values are a sample of the entire population.</p><p>The SRM data can be viewed in and downloaded from Panorama: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://daily.panoramaweb.org/labkey/project/Aebersold/schubert/2014_Schuetz_Ribo-40S/begin.view">https://daily.panoramaweb.org/labkey/project/Aebersold/schubert/2014_Schuetz_Ribo-40S/begin.view</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to M Peter, E Michel, G Braus, K Karbstein, M Seedorf for generously sharing plasmids, strains and antibodies.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the function of the ribosome assembly factor Tsr2 as a chaperone for the essential ribosomal protein eS26 in yeast. Originally identified in a RNA processing screen as needed for 20S rRNA processing, the function of Tsr2 was poorly understood. Through a series of systematic analyses, the authors trace its role to pre-40S maturation and subsequently to ribosomal protein eS26 incorporation. Biochemical experiments illustrated a direct physical interaction between Tsr2 and eS26 that was mutually exclusive of the eS26-importin interaction. Further analysis showed that Tsr2, and not Ran-GTP, efficiently disassembles the eS26-importin complex in a substrate-specific reaction. These findings, together with the observation that eS26 is both aggregation prone and degradation prone in the absence of Tsr2, lead the authors to an interesting model whereby Tsr2 represents a new functional family of proteins that mediate the exchange of ribosomal proteins from importins to the preribosome.</p><p>The referees agreed that the data are of very high technical quality, represent a large body of work, and are nicely organized and clearly described in the paper. The primary criticism centers around the issue of solidifying the central conclusion that Tsr2 is localized to and acting in the nucleus after eS26 import. Since earlier studies have suggested that eS26 is loaded onto the preribosome in the cytosol, it is worth more rigorously excluding this possibility. In this alternative interpretation of the authors' data, Tsr2 would bind to eS26 in the cytoplasm to prevent its interaction with karyopherins and to promote its late assembly, possibly in the cytoplasm.

The authors monitored the localization of Tsr2 coupled to 3 copies of GFP and expressed on top of WT protein. The higher expression level due to the extra copies from the CEN vector could lead to a mislocalization artifact. The authors should nail down the localization of functional/endogenous Tsr2 by either using an integrated GFP-tagged functional protein or indirect IF using anti-Tsr2. This would strengthen their model regarding its site of action.</p><p>2) It is unclear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> why GFP-eS26 accumulates in the nucleus in WT cells. It should be incorporated into ribosomes and exported. Its accumulation in the nucleus suggests that it may not load efficiently into ribosomes.

The authors should clarify whether GFP-eS26 is functional and incorporated into ribosomes.</p><p>3) If the argument is that free eS26 is unstable when not bound by TSR2 or Kaps, then why do we apparently see a strong eGFP-eS26 signal in the cytoplasm in the absence of Kap123 (assuming identical imaging conditions for all panels).

Addressing the following points would help discriminate these models</italic>.</p><p>A) Where is endogenous Tsr2 localized?</p><p>We have localized endogenous Tsr2 using an integrated -TAP and -GFP tag at the genomic locus. These studies show that Tsr2-TAP and Tsr2-GFP predominantly localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>B) Is eS26 targeted to the 90S pre-ribosome?</p><p>Tsr2-TAP co-enriches stoichiometric amounts of eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further, Western analyses using antibodies directed against eS26 and selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) showed that eS26 co-enriches with multiple nucleolar/nuclear pre-ribosomal particles in the 40S maturation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data strongly suggest that eS26 can be targeted to the nucleus for incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosome.</p><p>To strengthen the biochemical data above, we have performed an additional experiment. The ribosomal protein uS5 is transported to the nucleus and then assembled into the 90S pre-ribosome, the precursor for the 40S pre-ribosome. If nuclear export of the 40S pre-ribosome is impaired, uS5 accumulates in the nucleus: for e.g. in the <italic>yrb2Δ</italic> mutant, uS5-GFP accumulates in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1–figure supplement 1B</xref>). Likewise, if eS26 were loaded on the 90S pre-ribosome in the nucleus, then it should also accumulate in the nucleus in the <italic>yrb2Δ</italic> strain. To test this, we monitored localization of C-terminally GFP tagged eS26 (eS26-GFP) in WT and <italic>yrb2Δ</italic> cells. In WT cells, eS26-GFP localizes to the cytoplasm. In agreement with the nuclear loading model, the <italic>yrb2Δ</italic> mutant accumulates eS26-GFP in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These cell-biological data support the idea that eS26-GFP is targeted to the 90S pre-ribosome. We have incorporated these findings in the Results Section and included these cell-biological data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p><italic>1) Tsr2 has previously been reported to be both nuclear and cytoplasmic.

The following observations argue against this possibility:</p><p>We have localized endogenous Tsr2 using an integrated -TAP and -GFP tag by immunofluorescence. Tsr2-TAP and Tsr2-GFP localize predominantly to the nucleus as determined by the co-localization of the Alexa Fluor 568 (red) and DAPI (blue) signals and GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Tsr2-TAP and Tsr2-GFP strains are not impaired in growth like the Tsr2-depleted strain suggesting that the fusion proteins are functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Tsr2-3xGFP produced from a CEN plasmid (under its natural promoter and terminator) also localizes predominantly to the nucleus in Tsr2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and rescues the severe growth phenotype of a Tsr2-depleted strain indicating it is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>why GFP-eS26 accumulates in the nucleus in WT cells.

The authors should clarify whether GFP-eS26 is functional and incorporated into ribosomes</italic>.</p><p>Different lines of evidence (stated above) support the idea that eS26 is targeted to the 90S pre-ribosome. <italic>In vitro</italic> binding studies revealed that amongst the 11 yeast importins Kap104, Kap123 and Pse1 directly interacted with eS26. To verify these interaction data <italic>in vivo</italic> we have used the GFP-eS26 fusion protein as a tool to monitor the nuclear targeting of eS26. We apologize to the reviewers for not explaining the use of this fusion protein.</p><p>It is complicated to monitor the nuclear uptake of eS26 <italic>in vivo</italic> (and other ribosomal proteins) since it finally resides in the cytoplasm. One strategy is to uncouple nuclear import of eS26 from its export. This would mean: to allow eS26 import, but selectively impair eS26 recruitment to the 90S pre-ribosome. We took advantage of the crystal structure of 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1198308">10.1126/science.1198308</ext-link>). In contrast to the C-terminus, the N-terminus of eS26 is deeply embedded within the 18S rRNA framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2A</xref>). We therefore fused GFP to the N-terminus of eS26, with the aim of constructing an eS26 that fails to be incorporated into the 90S pre-ribosome. Sucrose gradient analyses showed that GFP-eS26 co-sediments in lighter fractions at the top of the gradient suggesting that it is not incorporated into pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2B</xref>). Binding studies showed that like eS26, GFP-eS26 interacts with Kap123 and Kap104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, like eS26, GFP-eS26 is functional to recruit specific components of the import machinery. Consistent with these studies, GFP-eS26 is efficiently targeted to the nucleus in a Kap123 and Kap104 dependent manner. Therefore, we do not think the nuclear location of GFP-eS26 is aberrant.</p><p>Further, GFP-eS26 directly binds Tsr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2C</xref>) and, like eS26, the stability of the GFP-eS26 depends on Tsr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2E</xref>), i.e. GFP-eS26 is degraded upon Tsr2-depletion. Although the GFP-eS26 fusion does not complement the eS26-depleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2D</xref>), in combination with the biochemical data it serves as a valuable tool to investigate the nuclear uptake of eS26.

Intriguingly, yeast deficient for the ribosome associated NAC and SSB-RAC chaperone systems that associate with newly synthesized polypeptides accumulate ribosomal protein aggregates (including eS26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koplin et al., 2010</xref>, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200910074">10.1083/jcb.200910074</ext-link>).

The eS26D33N mutant is not impaired in binding importins and Tsr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As expected, nuclear uptake of GFP-eS26D33N is not impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, like GFP-eS26, the <italic>in vivo</italic> stability of the nuclear-targeted GFP-eS26D33N also depends on Tsr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the eS26C77W mutant weakly interacts with importins <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

The inability of eS26 to coordinate the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion might trigger cytoplasmic degradation of the GFP-eS26C77W fusion protein. As a complementary experiment, we investigated which region within eS26 contributes to its nuclear uptake. For this, we monitored the location of several truncations of eS26 fused to GFP. These studies suggest that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain is required for efficient nuclear uptake of eS26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The title is not a very good description of what is actually discovered.
