Here we find, unexpectedly, that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) contain only six TAFs (TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11), whereas following differentiation all TAFs are expressed. Directed and global chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal an unprecedented promoter occupancy pattern: most active genes are bound by only TAFs 3 and 5 along with TBP, whereas the remaining active genes are bound by TBP and all six hESC TAFs. Consistent with these results, hESCs contain a previously undescribed complex comprising TAFs 2, 6, 7, 11 and TBP. Altering the composition of hESC TAFs, either by depleting TAFs that are present or ectopically expressing TAFs that are absent, results in misregulated expression of pluripotency genes and induction of differentiation. Thus, the selective expression and use of TAFs underlies the ability of hESCs to self-renew.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00068.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00068.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00068.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryonic stem cells have two characteristic properties: they are able to differentiate into any type of cell, a property known as pluripotency, and they are able to replicate themselves indefinitely to produce an endless supply of new stem cells. Different genes code for the various proteins associated with these two properties, and understanding the behaviour and properties of stem cells in detail is a major challenge in developmental biology. In human embryonic stem cells that have not yet differentiated, the genes that code for the transcription factors involved in the self-renewal process are expressed, whereas the genes associated with differentiation are not active. However, if the expression of the genes for self-renewal is reduced, the process of differentiation will begin, and the embryonic stem cells will be able to produce any one of the 200 or so different types of cell found in the human body.</p><p>All of this activity is orchestrated by proteins that oversee the transcription of specific regions of DNA into messenger RNA. Transcription is the first step in the process by which genes are expressed as proteins, and it cannot start until the relevant transcription factor binds to a stretch of DNA near the gene called the promoter. These transcription factors are complex structures that contain a central protein called TBP, which binds to the promoter, and 14 or so other proteins called TAFs.</p><p>Maston et al. now report that the transcription machinery that regulates gene expression and self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells is different from that found in other types of cells, including embryonic stem cells taken from mice. In particular, they found that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells contain only 6 of the 14 TAFs observed in other cells, although all 14 are present after differentiation. Moreover, for many active genes the transcription factors contained only two of these TAFs. There was also evidence for a new complex that contained the other four TAFs plus TBP.</p><p>Maston et al. also demonstrated that the removal of just one of the six TAFs, or the addition of just one extra TAF, caused the process of differentiation to begin. This shows, they argue, that the unusual transcription machinery they have discovered is essential for the proper workings of human embryonic stem cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00068.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00068.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>TATA-box-binding protein</kwd><kwd>pre-initiation complex</kwd><kwd>human embryonic stem cell</kwd><kwd>TBP-associated factor</kwd><kwd>pluripotency gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM033977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>068101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription machinery used to regulate gene expression and self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells is different from that found in other cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The specification of tissues and organs in development depends upon the spatially and temporally accurate execution of gene expression programs, much of which is regulated at the level of transcription. The factors involved in the accurate transcription of eukaryotic structural genes by RNA polymerase II can be classified into two groups. First, general (or basic) transcription factors (GTFs) are necessary and can be sufficient for accurate transcription initiation in vitro (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomas and Chiang, 2006</xref>). These basic factors include RNA polymerase II itself and at least six GTFs: TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH. The GTFs assemble on the core promoter in an ordered fashion to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC).</p><p>Transcriptional activity is greatly stimulated by the second class of factors, promoter-specific activator proteins (activators). In general, activators are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins whose recognition sites are typically present upstream of the core promoter. Activators work in large part by increasing PIC formation but can also act through other mechanisms, such as accelerating the rate of transcriptional elongation, promoting multiple rounds of transcription and directing chromatin modifications (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weake and Workman, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A long-held view of transcription activation is that specificity arises from the differential expression and activity of activators, which function through the common basic transcription machinery. However, it is now clear that the differential expression and use of basic transcription factors can also contribute to eukaryotic gene regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hochheimer and Tjian, 2003</xref>). This notion is most dramatically illustrated by a variety of studies focused on the GTF TFIID, a multi-subunit complex composed of the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and a set of â¼14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs).</p><p>One of the earliest clues about the differential function of TFIID came from studies in yeast demonstrating distinct classes of protein-coding genes that differ by their dependence on and recruitment of TAFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, similar classes of TAF-dependent and -independent genes were identified in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tokusumi et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with the existence of TAF-independent promoters, more recent studies have found that TAFs are depleted upon terminal differentiation of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato et al., 2008</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Alessio et al., 2011</xref>). TFIID diversity is also promoted by tissue-specific variants of TAFs as well as TBP derivatives referred to as TBP-related factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Alessio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MÃ¼ller et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a good example of a specialized cell type that is regulated by a unique transcriptional network. Two characteristic properties of hESCs, pluripotency, a capacity to differentiate into all fetal and adult cell lineages, and the ability to undergo symmetrical self-renewing divisions, are largely controlled at the transcriptional level (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Daley, 2008</xref>). In undifferentiated hESCs, pluripotency genes such as <italic>OCT4</italic> (also called <italic>POU5F1</italic>), <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic> are expressed, whereas genes involved in differentiation are transcriptionally inactive (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan and Thomson, 2007</xref>). Decreased expression of pluripotency genes induces differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>), and thus proper transcriptional regulation is essential for self-renewal of undifferentiated hESCs.</p><p>Despite intense efforts to identify hESC-specific activators involved in the transcriptional regulatory network of pluripotency, there has been relatively little analysis of GTFs in general and TFIID in particular. Here we find that both the composition and promoter occupancy patterns of hESC TAFs are highly unusual. We go on to show that this selective expression and use of TAFs establishes a transcriptional program required for hESC self-renewal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Undifferentiated hESCs express only a subset of TFIID TAFs</title><p>In a search of published expression datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeyta et al., 2004</xref>), we found that several TAFs of the canonical TFIID complex were apparently not expressed in hESCs. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed expression of 13 TAFs by immunoblotting lysates from H9 cells, a well-characterized hESC line. As a control, we also analyzed TAF expression in HeLa cells, which have been extensively used to study TFIID composition and function. The immunoblot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows, as expected, that all 13 TAFs were expressed in HeLa cells. By contrast, hESCs clearly expressed TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11, whereas expression of TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 was undetectable. Interestingly, TAF6 is expressed in both cell types, but the isoform present in H9 cells is predominantly the short delta form, whereas in HeLa cells, the major TAF6 isoform is the larger, alpha/beta form. The specificity of each TAF antibody was confirmed by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). We observed a similar TAF expression pattern in a second hESC line, H1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis comparing <italic>TAF</italic> mRNA levels in HeLa and H9 cells correlated with the immunoblotting results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike the TAFs, all other GTFs analyzed were comparably expressed in HeLa and H9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Based upon these results we conclude that only six of the canonical TFIID TAFs are present in hESCs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00068.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Undifferentiated hESCs express only a subset of TFIID TAFs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis showing TAF levels in HeLa cells and H9 hESCs.

To investigate this issue, we performed a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. In the first set of experiments we selected 10 transcriptionally active genes and performed ChIP analysis to monitor promoter occupancy by the six hESC TAFs. As a normalization standard, we also monitored occupancy of TBP and RNA polymerase II large subunit (POL2) on these 10 promoters. As expected, we found that TBP and POL2 were present at comparable levels at each of the 10 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the absolute level of TBP and POL2 bound to each promoter significantly varied among the 10 genes. Therefore, in this experiment and those presented below, TAF recruitment was normalized to the level of TBP occupancy. The ChIP results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> revealed two groups of genes with distinct TAF promoter occupancy patterns. The first group, which we refer to as class I genes, were bound by TAFs 3 and 5 but not by TAFs 2, 6, 7 and 11, whereas the second group, class II genes, were bound by all six hESC TAFs.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00068.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Two classes of hESC genes based on TAF promoter occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recruitment of TBP and POL2 to the promoters of 10 transcriptionally active genes (<italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>INTS6</italic>, <italic>MORF4L2</italic>, <italic>SLC25A3</italic>, <italic>TBP</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>FSCN1</italic>, <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>PCNA</italic>, <italic>SFPQ</italic>), each represented by a data point, were monitored by ChIP in H9 cells.

Notably, all but one of our experiments were performed in another hESC line, H9 cells. In the one experiment performed in H1 cells, we compared TAF levels in H1 and H9 cells by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The pattern of TAF expression in H1 and H9 cells was qualitatively similar but the experiment could not rule out the possibility that TAF1 was present at low levels in H1 cells, which could explain the ENCODE ChIP-Seq results.</p><p>It is also possible that in the H9 cells used in our studies TAF1, as well as TAFs 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13, are not entirely absent but rather present at low levels, which are below that we can detect in an immunoblotting assay. However, if H9 cells do contain low levels of TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 our biochemical experiments indicate that they are below that required to stably associate with TBP and the TAFs that are detectably present in H9 cells to form the much larger TFIID complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we could not detect significant binding of TAFs 1, 8 and 9 on the promoters of seven transcriptionally active genes in H9 cells in a ChIP assay, although binding was readily detected on the same promoters in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, our conclusion that H9 cells contain no (or very low levels of) TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 is based not only on expression data but also on biochemical results and promoter binding experiments.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A novel TBP-containing TAF complex in undifferentiated hESCs</title><p>The absence of seven of the conventional TFIID TAFs suggested that hESCs contain an alternative TBP-containing complex. Our ChIP and biochemical experiments confirmed this possibility and revealed a model in which a stable complex containing TBP and TAFs 2, 6, 7 and 11 is recruited to active class II genes, and TAFs 3 and 5 are recruited independently to all active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Notably, this novel TBP-containing complex lacks TAF1, which in the canonical TFIID complex interacts directly with TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 1994</xref>), and TAF4, which is essential for assembly of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wright et al., 2006</xref>). However, consistent with the existence of a TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex, previous studies have described interactions between TBP and TAF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verrijzer et al., 1994</xref>), TAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinzierl et al., 1993</xref>) and TAF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavigne et al., 1996</xref>), and between TAF7 and TAF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavigne et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that nine of the 14 TFIID TAFs contain a sequence motif homologous to histones, called the histone fold domain (HFD), which mediates proteinâprotein interactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papai et al., 2011</xref>). These nine TAFs can form five specific heterodimers: TAF3â10, TAF6â9, TAF4â12, TAF8â10 and TAF11â13. Several of these heterodimers are thought to be important for the assembly and structure of TFIID. hESCs contain only three HFD-containing TAFs (3, 6 and 11), which cannot form any of the five known heterodimers. This observation strongly suggests there are major differences in assembly and structure of TFIID and the TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex.</p><p>An important question raised by our results is the basis by which TAFs are differentially recruited to class I or class II promoters. Studies in yeast have shown that differential recruitment of TAFs can be due to promoter-bound activators, core promoter elements, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shen and Green, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2002</xref>). In this regard, TAF2 and TAF6 have been shown to interact with promoter sequence elements (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maston et al., 2006</xref>), which may contribute to differential promoter recognition by the TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex. In addition, TAF3 contains a PHD finger domain that can bind to the H3K4me3 chromatin mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vermeulen et al., 2007</xref>), which is enriched at class I promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the basis by which basic transcription factors are differentially recruited to promoters on a genome-wide scale appears to be a particularly challenging problem. For example, it is still not understood what distinguishes TAF-dependent and TAF-independent promoters in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuras et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2000</xref>), why some basic transcription factors, such as mediator, are bound at only some promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2006</xref>), or the basis by which chromatin-modifying complexes are selectively recruited to promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ng et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Another question arising from our findings is whether there are functional differences that distinguish class I and class II genes. Gene ontology analysis did not reveal any functional category that was differentially enriched in either class I or class II genes (data not shown). For example, although several pluripotency factors including OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and NANOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) are encoded by class II genes, we found other pluripotency factors, such as SOX2, DPPA4 and KLF4, that are encoded by class I genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). There was, however, a statistically significant increase in alternative promoters at class II genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, alternative promoter use has been suggested to play a role in generating tissue-specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pal et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00068.025</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Classification of additional pluripotency genes as either class I or class II.</title><p>ChIP analysis monitoring TAF recruitment to the promoters of four pluripotency genes in H9 cells.

The core promoter sequence is identical in every cell, raising the possibility that in hESCs differences in activators or epigenetic signatures may be coordinated with the alterations in core promoter complexes. For example, in the myogenic program, core promoter recognition complex changes correlates with the presence of developmentally regulated activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deato et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The selective expression and use of TAFs is required for hESC self-renewal</title><p>We have found that altering the composition of hESC TAFs, either by RNAi-mediated knockdown of TAFs that are present or ectopic expression of TAFs that are absent, results in loss of pluripotency gene expression and induction of differentiation. Thus, the unusual composition of TAFs described here is required for the ability of hESCs to properly regulate gene expression, maintain an undifferentiated state, and self-renew. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the TAFs that are absent from undifferentiated hESCs are expressed following differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The transcriptional induction of several differentiation markers, which are not normally expressed in hESCs, following knockdown of an hESC TAF can be explained either by the dispensability of the TAF for transcription of the marker, or incomplete knockdown enabling transcription to occur at reduced TAF levels.</p><p>A characteristic feature of the switch of undifferentiated hESCs to the differentiated state is the loss of pluripotency gene expression. We have shown that ectopic expression of TAFs that are not present in undifferentiated hESCs results in transcriptional inactivation of pluripotency genes. Thus, the transcriptional induction of TFIID TAFs that are absent from undifferentiated hESCs may be at least part of the mechanism by which pluripotency genes are silenced following differentiation.</p><p>As discussed above, previous studies have shown that terminal differentiation of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deato and Tjian, 2007</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Alessio et al., 2011</xref>) is accompanied by loss of TFIID TAFs. These and other findings have prompted speculation that during differentiation the canonical TFIID complex becomes progressively specialized (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Alessio et al., 2009</xref>). However our results reveal a more complex model. Rather than starting from a complete, canonical TFIID and progressing to more restricted forms, undifferentiated hESCs start with a specialized, highly unique general transcription machinery, then switch to a period of complete TFIID before specialization of the transcription machinery again in some terminal differentiation programs. Collectively, these findings suggest that altering the composition of the basic transcription machinery in general and TAFs specifically may be a particularly powerful mechanism for developmental reprogramming.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>H9 (WA09) and H1 (WA01) hESCs were obtained from the UMass Human Stem Cell Bank and Registry.

Statistical significance of differences in occurrence was determined using Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA interference</title><p>For transient siRNA transfections, 30 pmol of siRNA duplexes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>) was mixed with 5 Âµl Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and OptiMEM Reduced-Serum media (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 500 Âµl, incubated for 20 min, and added to H9 cells 1 day after plating in a six-well plate (i.e., at â¼25% confluency) along with 2.5 ml fresh media. After 48 hr, RNA was isolated or nuclear extract prepared. For stable shRNA knockdowns, H9 cells seeded in a six-well plate to 25% confluency were stably transduced with 200-Âµl lentiviral particles expressing shRNAs (obtained from Open Biosystems through the UMMS RNAi Core Facility; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>) in a total volume of 2 ml of mTesR1 media supplemented with 6 Âµg/ml polybrene. Media was replaced after overnight incubation to remove the polybrene and viral particles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Alkaline phosphatase staining</title><p>Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using the Alkaline Phosphatase Staining Kit (Stemgent, Cambridge, MA). To assess differentiation, 500 colonies were evaluated for AP staining and the percent positively stained was calculated. All assays were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ectopic TAF expression</title><p>Full-length open reading frames of human <italic>TAF</italic> genes were PCR-amplified from HeLa cDNA and cloned in-frame into pECFP vector (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). Junctions were sequenced to confirm the construction. For transfection, 2 Âµg plasmid was mixed with 6 Âµl FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche) and OptiMEM in a total volume of 100 Âµl, incubated for 15 min, and then added to H9 cells in a six-well plate at 25% confluency. After 48 hr, RNA was isolated or nuclear extract prepared.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank R. Roeder and I.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, two of whom are members of <italic>eLife's</italic> Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Jim Kadonaga; Danny Reinberg.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and two other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigated the function of the TAFs (TBP-associated factors) in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The conventional/canonical TFIID complex comprises TBP and about 14 TAF subunits. In this work, it was found that TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 11 - but not TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 - are expressed in hESCs, and that TAFs 2, 6, 7, and 11 appear to form a novel complex with TBP. By ChIP analysis, two classes of transcriptionally active genes were identified in hESCs. Class I genes are regulated by TAFs 3 and 5, whereas Class II genes are regulated by all six TAFs in hESCs. RNAi depletion of TAF 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 11 as well as overexpression of TAF1 caused a decrease in pluripotency. These findings suggest that the proper regulation of TAFs is important for the maintenance of hESCs.</p><p>These results reveal that a subset of the pol II TAFs are expressed in hESCs, and that the specific expression of these TAFs is important for the maintenance of pluripotency. The analysis was rigorous, comprehensive, and convincing. The findings are novel, and of high impact and general interest. This work will be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the following points are suitably addressed.</p><p>1. Fig. 5. Does the knockdown of one TAF affect the occupancy of other TAFs and RNA pol II at the genes analyzed? If such information is available, it would be a useful addition to the paper.</p><p>2. Fig. 6E. The range of the Y axis should be from 0 to 100 percent. This would give a better perspective on the data.</p><p>3. Fig. 6F. The range of the Y axis should be from 0.0 to 1.0. The authors should also explain what criteria were used to determine whether or not a gene has alternate promoters.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00068.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1. The reviewer commented that, if the information were available, the results of RNA polymerase II and TAF recruitment would be a useful addition to the shRNA-mediated knockdown experiments of Figure 5</italic>.</p><p>For different reasons, as explained below, neither of the two datasets mentioned by the reviewer is available.</p><p>With regard to RNA polymerase II recruitment, a number of previous studies by our laboratory and others have analyzed the relationship between TAF dependence and RNA polymerase II occupancy in vivo. Notably, these studies have been carried out in a wide range of eukaryotes including yeast, Drosophila S2 cells and mammalian cells. The results of these studies have clearly demonstrated that when a TAF is required for transcription of a gene, loss-of-function of that TAF (resulting from mutational inactivation, RNA interference-mediated depletion or decreased expression) results in diminished transcription that is accompanied by decreased RNA polymerase II occupancy in a chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Representative examples of such studies include those performed in yeast (Shen et al. 2003, <italic>EMBO J</italic>. 22:3395; Sharma et al. 2003, <italic>Genes Dev</italic>. 17:502), Drosophila S2 cells (Vorobyeva et al. 2009, <italic>PNAS</italic> 106:11049) and mammalian cells (Deato and Tjian 2007, <italic>Genes Dev</italic>. 21:2137; Zaborowska et al. 2012, <italic>Transcription</italic> 3:92). In addition to these in vivo examples, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a role for TAFs in RNA polymerase II recruitment (see, for examples, Wu and Chiang 2001, <italic>J. Biol. Chem</italic>. 276:34235; Felinski and Quinn 2001, <italic>PNAS</italic> 98:13078).</p><p>Therefore, because the relationship between TAF dependence and RNA polymerase II occupancy had been well established, this issue was not investigated in our current study.</p><p>With regard to TAF recruitment, we are in fact actively studying the requirement of specific TAFs for recruitment of other TAFs and TBP at class I and class II promoters. We believe that when these results are completed they may provide insights into the roles of specific TAFs in transcription of class I and class II genes and shed light on the differences between class I and class II promoters. However, our preliminary results indicate that the requirement of specific TAFs for recruitment of other TAFs and TBP is complex, differs among the TAFs, and may also differ between promoters of the same class. Therefore, until we have performed a comprehensive analysis, which will require considerably more experimentation and time and may necessitate genome-wide studies, we think it would premature to publish a limited set of results, which could be potentially non-representative and misleading.</p><p><italic>2. The reviewer requested that we revise Figure 6E so that the Y-axis ranges from 0 to 100 percent to provide a better perspective on the data</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the figure as requested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>3. The reviewer requested that we revise Figure 6F so that the Y-axis ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. He/she also asked that we explain the criteria used to determine whether or not a gene has an alternative promoter</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the figure as requested by the reviewer. The criteria we used to determine whether a gene has an alternative promoter is described in detail in the Materials and Methods section. Prompted by the reviewer's comment, we have revised the main text describing Figure 6F to briefly state that alternative promoters were identified based on UCSC Genome browser annotations, and refer the reader to the Materials and Methods section for additional details.</p></body></sub-article></article>
