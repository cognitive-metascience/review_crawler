for gas-exchange and is key to the physiological function of the lung. Alveolar epithelial cells, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergo coordinated morphogenesis to generate epithelial folds (secondary septa) to form alveoli. A mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. We found that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is required in alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts for alveologenesis in mammals. Our studies uncovered a <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> cascade that endows cellular properties and novel mechanisms of alveologenesis. This includes PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts. All these cellular properties are conferred by changes in the cytoskeleton and represent a new facet of PCP function. These results extend our current model of PCP signaling from polarizing a field of epithelial cells to conferring new properties at subcellular levels to regulate collective cell behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The lungs enable the exchange of gases between inhaled air and the bloodstream. This exchange happens in structures called alveoli, which have a large surface area that aids in efficient gas exchange. Shortly after birth in mice, or during the last few months before birth in humans, alveoli develop folds called secondary septa that increase their surface area and improve the efficiency of gas exchange.</p><p>Several types of cells work together to form secondary septa. Surface cells called epithelia and underlying “myofibroblast” cells and small blood vessels must both communicate and move together to build the septa. The processes that control the formation of septa have not been fully studied. In other cases, a cell signaling pathway known as the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway has been shown to help coordinate cell movements. The PCP pathway works by changing the cytoskeleton of cells, which is the series of protein fibers that give cells their shape and structure and the ability to move.</p><p>Zhang et al. have now studied septa in mouse lungs and revealed how three genes – <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Ror2</italic> and <italic>Vangl2</italic> – in the PCP pathway control this process. This pathway oversees changes to the cytoskeleton in both epithelial cells and myofibroblasts, helping the cells to change shape and move together to form septa. Unusually, the PCP pathway has different effects in different cells, rather than affecting all cells similarly. This is partly due to so-called PDGF signals from the epithelial cells that help to guide the growth and movement of myofibroblasts. This process is helped by the epithelial cells changing their shape to accommodate myofibroblasts during septa formation.</p><p>Further analysis also showed reduced PCP signaling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD. This could be a factor in the extensive lung damage seen in these patients. These findings help to explain a key lung development process and may provide new insights to understand lung diseases such as COPD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>alveolus</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>myofibroblast</kwd><kwd>alveolar epithelial cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL142876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Pao-Tien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulation of cellular properties such as ligand secretion and migratory ability through changes in the cytoskeleton mediated by a <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis is a major determinant of alveolar formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gas exchange, the essential function of the lung, depends on the production of a sufficient number of functional alveoli to provide surface area for gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whitsett and Weaver, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2016</xref>). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which alveoli are formed remains a major unresolved question. Lung branching morphogenesis is followed by the construction of primary saccules at the distal end of the branching lung tree. The smooth wall of the primary saccules is further modified by the generation of secondary crests or septa, which divide the saccules into alveoli. As a result, the surface area of gas exchange is greatly increased to meet the high demand of oxygen consumption in terrestrial, warm-blooded animals. Uncovering the molecular basis of alveolar development will also provide insight into diseases that affect the alveoli. For instance, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in which maturation of alveoli fails to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2015</xref>), is prevalent in premature babies. Moreover, insults to the lung in adult life such as infectious diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can lead to destruction of alveoli and respiratory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). A mechanistic understanding of alveolar formation will offer new therapies to regenerate alveolar surface area and treat diseases caused by loss of alveoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodríguez-Castillo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The most important step in alveolar development is the formation of epithelial folds (secondary septa) within the saccules, in which thin and flat alveolar type I (AT1) cells cover a core of myofibroblasts, connective tissue and capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>). Compared to AT1 cells, alveolar type II (AT2) cells contribute to a much smaller surface area for gas exchange but they play a central role in lung expansion after birth by secreting pulmonary surfactants. During the first 2–3 days of postnatal life, the smooth wall (the primary septa) of saccules in wild-type mouse lungs is modified by epithelial folding, which is termed rudimentary secondary crests or septa, to increase the surface area for gas exchange. Secondary septa consist of alveolar type I cells that cover a core of myofibroblasts, connective tissue and capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2016</xref>). Elongation of secondary septa is associated with deposition of elastin by myofibroblasts and maturation of capillaries. At around postnatal day 5, many of the primary saccules have been subdivided into alveoli by secondary septation although this process will continue for another 25 days and beyond. Secondary septa formation greatly increases the surface area for gas exchange in mammals and is the most critical event during alveolar formation.</p><p>The current model posits that interstitial fibroblasts respond to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling and migrate to the prospective secondary septa to form alveolar myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao et al., 2016</xref>), which express smooth muscle actin (SMA). It is postulated that myofibroblast migration and elastin deposition by myofibroblasts provide the driving force for secondary septa elongation. However, the molecular mechanisms that control cell migration remain poorly understood. Similarly, the molecular processes that mediate interactions between alveolar epithelial cells and prospective myofibroblasts during secondary septa formation are unknown. Importantly, whether alveolar epithelial cells also play an active role in promoting alveologenesis has not been determined. New insight into these key issues is pivotal to our mechanistic understanding of alveolar formation.</p><p>We reasoned that signaling pathways that control the actomyosin cytoskeleton likely play a crucial role in cell migration and interaction during secondary septa formation. The planar cell polarity (PCP; also known as tissue polarity) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Torban et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campanale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davey and Moens, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sokol, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zallen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair and McNeill, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peng and Axelrod, 2012</xref>) has been shown to regulate the actomyosin cytoskeleton. In this study, we employed PCP signaling as a tool to reveal the molecular basis of secondary septation and alveolar formation in mice. PCP (a non-canonical Wnt pathway) is a fundamental, conserved mechanism for polarizing a field of cells within the plane of an epithelial cell sheet and is essential in many tissues. PCP signaling is initiated by the binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled (Fz) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The signal is relayed by a set of core PCP components that include cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. The outcome of PCP signaling is an altered actomyosin cytoskeleton that is local and is associated with polarized cellular function in a field of cells. The role of PCP components in lung development has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yates et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poobalasingam et al., 2017</xref>), but its molecular mechanisms are unknown. Other well-characterized systems that require PCP include convergent extension in neural tube closure, hair cell orientation in the cochlea of the inner ear, hair follicle orientation, and motile cilia positioning in the trachea. It is somewhat surprising that, in each system, the molecular mechanisms that mediate PCP’s effects on cellular behavior are largely underexplored.</p><p>Our work described in this report has discovered a new mechanism of PCP signaling in which a <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis controls tissue patterning through regulating cellular properties and not tissue polarity. Specifically, PCP signaling controls PDGF ligand secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, instructs cell shape change of alveolar type I cells, and regulates myofibroblast migration. All of these are mediated though the actomyosin cytoskeleton. These novel insights significantly extend our current understanding of alveolar formation and PCP signaling in tissue patterning. They not only provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the alveolus is generated during development but also have a major impact on advancing disease mechanisms caused by alveolar malformation or destruction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inactivation of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in the distal lung epithelium disrupts alveolar formation</title><p>To understand how PCP pathway components control alveolar formation, we eliminated PCP signaling in the distal lung epithelium by generating <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice.

To our surprise, we found no apparent asymmetric localization of VANGL2 in alveolar type I cells, alveolar type II cells or myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This led to our new model in which a <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis controls cellular properties of individual lung cells regardless of asymmetric activation of PCP components. We speculate that this cascade sets in motion PDGF signaling from alveolar type I and type II cells, morphological changes of alveolar type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts, all of which are required for alveolar formation. We will test these hypotheses in subsequent sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of epithelial <italic>Vangl2</italic> leads to defective PDGF signal reception in mesenchymal myofibroblasts</title><p>Lack of secondary septa in <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice was associated with thin primary septa.

(<bold>D</bold>) A new model of alveolar formation through control of cellular properties by PCP signaling. We propose that epithelial PCP signaling via the <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis (colored green) controls PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells to promote proliferation of mesenchymal fibroblasts. In this process, a positive feedback loop between WNT5A and PDGF leads to expansion of the fibroblast pool required for subsequent alveologenesis. The expanded fibroblast population expresses SMA and becomes myofibroblasts, which continue to proliferate. In addition, myofibroblasts migrate to the prospective site of secondary septation in response to PCP signaling (colored blue). Likewise, epithelial PCP signaling (colored green) instructs cell shape changes of alveolar type I cells necessary for encasing myofibroblasts that migrate toward the site of secondary septation. All of these cellular events (orange-colored boxes) are due to modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton via the <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53688-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is interesting to note that SERPINA3 (a protease inhibitor), SAA3 (serum amyloid A) and CD14, whose expression was increased in <italic>Vangl2</italic>-deficient murine lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), are activated in COPD patients and are biomarkers for COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozinovski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">von Scheele et al., 2011</xref>).

Through genetic and molecular approaches, we decipher PCP signaling through a <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis as a key element in mediating cell-cell interactions between alveolar cells (type I and type II) and myofibroblasts. The PCP pathway controls PDGF signaling from alveolar type I and II cells to fibroblasts/myofibroblasts to promote their proliferation. This essential step ensures the production an adequate number of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts required for alveologenesis. A positive feedback loop between WNT5A and PDGF facilitates expansion of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Subsequently, orchestrated movement between alveolar type I cells and myofibroblasts is regulated by PCP signaling, including cell shape change of alveolar type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts. As a result, they come in close proximity to each other and undergo coordinated morphogenesis to produce secondary septa and alveoli. In this process, myofibroblasts also send out cellular processes to form a network that likely functionally connects alveoli. These critical events require changes in cellular properties mediated by PCP signaling and reflect a novel facet of PCP function. We speculate that this new insight can serve as a paradigm for understanding PCP function in other tissues beyond the classical tissue polarity. Moreover, our findings suggest that the developmental programs executed by PCP are utilized for tissue repair in the lung. This establishes the foundation for elucidating disease mechanisms of BPD and COPD caused by alveolar loss.</p><p>Genetic and molecular analyses of <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Ror2</italic> and <italic>Vangl2</italic>-deficient lungs demonstrate a critical role of these PCP components in controlling the actomyosin cytoskeleton, which underlies ligand secretion/delivery, and cell migration and interaction during secondary septa formation. Surprisingly, these processes do not appear to involve the classical tissue polarity, in which asymmetric distribution of PCP components is associated with polarization of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, the primary function of the <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis is to modulate the cellular properties of lung cells required for alveolar formation. Thus, while the PCP pathway functions in many cellular processes that rely on the actomyosin cytoskeleton, our studies revealed that PCP activity is not confined to tissue polarity. Our work shows that PCP signaling exerts its effects at the subcellular levels via controlling the cytoskeleton in alveolar type I, type II cells and myofibroblasts. This notion is consistent with studies that reported a purported function of PCP in axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zou, 2012</xref>) or postsynaptic compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagaoka and Kishi, 2016</xref>), in which PCP was proposed to also operate at the subcellular level. Moreover, our findings suggest that the PCP pathway controls important cellular processes beyond epithelial layers as demonstrated by the involvement of PCP signaling in myofibroblast migration. Hence, our investigation establishes novel modes of PCP function in tissue patterning. We anticipate that additional cellular processes that utilize similar modes of PCP signaling as reported here will be uncovered in other tissues.</p><p>Loss of <italic>Ror2</italic> in either lung epithelium or mesenchyme recapitulates phenotypes due to lack of <italic>Vangl2</italic>. This supports a crucial role of ROR2 in activating VANGL2 and downstream events. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a Fz receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) is also involved in relaying the WNT5A signal to VANGL2. In this case, Fz and ROR2 would cooperate in a non-redundant manner to transduce the WNT5A signal. Identifying the putative Fz receptor and elucidating its functions would significantly increase our understanding of the signaling cascade that regulates secondary septa formation.</p><p>Our genetic and molecular studies support a new model in which morphological changes of AT1 cells induced by PCP signaling are required for secondary septa elongation. An active role of AT1 cells in secondary septation contrasts their passive role implied from the existing models in which myofibroblasts drive secondary septa formation. Nevertheless, further studies are required to define the functional consequence of PCP signaling in AT1 cells and delineate the relative contributions of AT1 and AT2 cells to alveologenesis. We also showed that morphological changes in myofibroblasts are also critical for secondary septa formation. Thus, secondary septa development relies on coordinated cell shape changes in both alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts. A key element in this process is an altered actomyosin cytoskeleton controlled by the <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis. How this axis is integrated with other regulators of the cytoskeleton requires further investigations. We also do not have the cellular resolution to discern the exact sequence of events. This would rely on improved microscopy and the ability to image lung slices for an extended period of time. New culture conditions are also needed to recapitulate alveolar formation in ex vivo lung explants or lung slices. Future development of fluorescent probes that enable monitoring lung development in vivo would be an important step forward to validate these models.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on AT1/2 cells and myofibroblasts in secondary septa formation. A third component of the secondary septa is endothelial cells. It is unclear whether PCP signaling controls capillary morphogenesis during alveolar development. This would require additional genetic and molecular studies, similar to those described in this work. Interestingly, PCP signaling has been implicated in network organization of vessels in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sewduth and Santoro, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of <italic>Vangl2</italic>-deficient lungs revealed that PDGF ligands produced in alveolar cells fail to signal to myofibroblasts. Our data point to defective delivery of the PDGF ligand due to disrupted cytoskeleton in the absence of PCP signaling. Additional cell biological and biochemical studies are required to pinpoint the defects in PDGFA trafficking in alveolar type I and type II cells. We propose that PDGF signal reception is compromised by loss of cell-cell contacts between alveolar cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts. Further validation of this model would require direct visualization of ligand–receptor interactions on juxtaposed membranes between ligand-producing and –receiving cells, for instance, using split GFP technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>) where GFP signal is reconstituted at sites of ligand–receptor contact. An alternative possibility of cell-cell contacts between alveolar cells and mesenchymal myofibroblasts involves actin-based filopodia. This is similar to the cytonemes described in other systems including the mouse limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). The function of cytonemes has been debated but recent data show that they are required for mediating ligand-receptor signaling for major signaling pathways in lieu of diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>). Cytonemes originate from ligand-producing and receptor-producing cells, but cytonemes have not been reported in lung cells likely due to technical issues.</p><p>In conclusion, our work has provided key new insights into the cellular and molecular basis of secondary septation and alveolar formation. Moreover, we have revealed a novel mode of PCP signaling beyond tissue polarity. These studies set the stage for further investigation to obtain a complete mechanistic understanding of alveolar development and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Mouse strains used in this study are listed in the Key Resources table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

After centrifugation, the upper aqueous layer was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol. RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq4000. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (version 7.1). Differential gene expression and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were performed with RStudio. The barplot of gene ontology enrichment was created in order to visualize differentially expressed genes that are associated with a certain biological process (BP). Datasets have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus database and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE140779.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>qPCR analysis</title><p>RNAs extracted from lung tissues were reverse-transcribed with the Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out on the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Primers for qPCR are listed in the Sequence-based reagent table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cell migration (wound recovery or healing) assay</title><p>The migratory capacity of lung myofibroblasts was determined using the Culture-Insert 2 Well system (ibidi). Briefly, lungs from control and <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Pdgfra<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice at P3 were dissected and digested in dispase (1.2 U/ml) and collagenase B (0.5 mg/ml) at 37°C to release single cells. After incubation for 1 hr, an equal volume of culture medium (DMEM with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin) was added to dissociated cells. The mixture was then passed through a 40 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl culture medium and seeded into wells (100 μl per well). Myofibroblasts were allowed to attach to fibronectin–coated plates for 2–3 hr. Non-adherent cells were washed out and myofibroblasts were cultured to reach 100% confluence in ~2–3 days. Confluent myofibroblasts were switched to starvation medium (DMEM with 0.2% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 16 hr prior to removal of the insert. Migration of myofibroblasts into the wounded area (insert) was allowed to continue for another 36–48 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Human lung tissues</title><p>Lung samples were obtained at the time of lung transplantation performed for severe emphysema (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Criteria, stages III or IV) during the study period 2015‐2019. Control lung tissues were obtained from donor lungs not utilized for lung transplantation. Our studies indicate that these lungs are physiologically and pathologically normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ware et al., 2002</xref>). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the study was approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board (IRB approval # 13–10738).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Both technical replicates and biological replicates (using different cell lines and mice) were performed. All results were presented as mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to calculate the P values. Statistical significance was considered only when the P value was less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Yingzi Yang, Mark Krasnow, Maya Kumar and Johanna Andrae for sharing mouse strains; Monica Nagendran and Tatsuya Tsukui for advice on PLISH; Jau-Nian Chen and Andy Chang for critical reading of the manuscript.

formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, while the reviewers acknowledged the merits in your study, there were many concerns related to both lack of data for the conclusions made and the confusing manner in which the manuscript is organized. All of the reviewers felt that the current manuscript should be pared down to focus on the points that can be substantiated with data. Please note in particular the concerns raised by reviewer #1 in relation to data needed to support the major conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In Zhang et al., the authors investigate the role of <italic>Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2</italic> in alveologenesis and alveoli injury repair. They show extensive data from both epithelium and mesenchymal knockouts of a number of genes in this pathway, as well as Pdgfa mutants. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated, including affecting cell signaling, morphology, migration, cell-cell junction, ER and Golgi morphology. The findings do demonstrate a role for <italic>Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2</italic> in alveologenesis. However, many of the conclusions on mechanisms are not well supported. There is lack of logic in the organization of the results, which jump from epithelium to mesenchyme and back, from bleomycin in mice and then to COPD patient samples.</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, there is an overall paucity of quantification, of MLI, of protein expression level, etc.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1, <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre;<italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant was not really described in the text. Where is the cre active, and how results from this mutant fit in with the rest of the data is unclear.</p><p>3) <italic>Vangl1;2;Sox9<sup>cre</sup></italic> mutant, it will be informative to know lung phenotype, on whether the defects are in branching or sacculation.</p><p>4) Why <italic>Shh<sup>cre</sup></italic>, a robust cre, is unable to recombine <italic>Vangl2</italic>-fl is not explained. Is there a change in RT-PCR? Why is <italic>Sox9<sup>cre</sup></italic> able to recombine <italic>Vangl2</italic>-fl but not <italic>Shh<sup>cre</sup></italic>?</p><p>5) Does inactivation of Porc in the epithelium lead to a defect?</p><p>6) Figure 3E<italic>Pdgfa</italic> expression in AT1 and AT2 cells, not convincing.</p><p>7) &quot;….levels of PDGFRa were unaffected (Figure 3G)&quot;. However, by RNAseq, &quot;<italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression was downregulated.&quot; Discrepancy?</p><p>8) The specificity of p-PDGFRa antibody needs to be demonstrated.</p><p>9) Decrease in AKT signaling needs to be shown.</p><p>10) The secretion assay, double null mutants were used. It is unclear what cells were isolated.</p><p>11) Given that ER and Golgi are affected, is protein processing/secretion a general defect, or is PDGFA signal specifically affected?</p><p>12) Figure 3J, 3L, need to show a field of cells before zooming in. Quantification is needed.</p><p>13) The finding that <italic>Vangl;Spc-<sup>cre</sup></italic> mutants showed simplification phenotype suggests that Vangl is required in AT2 cells. It does support that the phenotype is due to secretion defect, as concluded in subsection “Alveolar epithelial cells lacking <italic>VANGL2</italic> fail to present the PDGF ligand to mesenchymal myofibroblasts”.</p><p>14) Figure 3K, only show histology, not &quot;areas of defective alveolar development that was associated with loss of <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>&quot;. Antibody staining is needed to link mosaic inactivation to regional phenotype.</p><p>15) Subsection “Alveolar epithelial cells lacking <italic>VANGL2</italic> fail to present the PDGF ligand to mesenchymal myofibroblasts”, unclear how the defect in cell contact is needed for PDGF secreted signaling.</p><p>16) &quot;Conversely, loss of PDGF ligand resulted in depletion of WNT5A-producing fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. These results support a positive feedback loop between WNT5A and PDGFA…&quot; The staining shows in Pdgfa mutants the expression of PDGFRA expression. It does not show regulation of WNT5A. To demonstrate feedback, Wnt5a expression needs to be assayed in PDGF pathway mutants.</p><p>17) Aside from in vitro migration assay, there is no other support for migration defect of Vangl mutants. Myofibroblast migration defects shown in <italic>Pdgfa</italic> mutant was found during sacculation stages. Is there an in vivo defect during sacculation of altered distribution of myofibroblasts?</p><p>18) Figure 6A, it is unclear how AT1 that lack GFP, which presumably is not cre-recombined, show increase of p-Cofilin.</p><p>19) To really demonstrate AT1 wrapping of other cell types, thick section and 3D rendition is needed.</p><p>20) In the smaller spheres, are there fewer cells, or smaller AT1 cells?</p><p>21) For bleomycin experiment, het mutant control needs to be used. What is the phenotype on fibrosis?</p><p>22) It is not clear why fibrosis was studied in mouse, but COPD was studied in patients.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, &quot;A <italic>Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2</italic> axis controls the cytoskeleton and confers cellular properties required for alveolar formation&quot; by Kuan Zhang and colleagues, the authors examine the role of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in alveologenesis. The authors identify a <italic>Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2</italic> cascade that involves PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, and results in cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts due to changes in the cytoskeleton.</p><p>The studies presented in the manuscript are comprehensive, well-designed and presented, and provide novel insights into the role of the PCP pathway in alveologenesis. These findings are an important and useful addition to the field. However, there are several issues that could be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) It is interesting that the <italic>Shh-Cre</italic> did not result in deletion of <italic>Vangl2</italic>, particularly given that the authors appear to show excellent recombination of the <italic>ROSA26-mTmG</italic> allele, and that is Cre is known to be strongly expressed in the lung epithelium. Do the authors have any explanation why?</p><p>2) Although SOX9 is well known to be expressed in the distal lung epithelium during development, it is also expressed in the lung mesenchyme. Because the authors use the SOX9-Cre to characterize the effects of epithelial-specific loss of <italic>Vangl2</italic>, they should provide (ideally quantitative) data about the degree of recombination that the <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> induces in the lung mesenchyme. One straight forward way to do this would be to add data using their <italic>Sox9-Cre;ROSA26-mTmG</italic> mice co-stained with a pan-epithelial marker such as <italic>Cdh1</italic> or <italic>Nkx2-1</italic>. Significant recombination in the mesenchyme could significantly impact the interpretation of their data.</p><p>3) Why did the authors choose to use the <italic>Sox2</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> when they were primarily interested in the distal epithelium (Figure 3E) – why not just stick with the <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> (especially since these data are shown in the next panel, Figure 3F)</p><p>4) I don't understand the rationale for using whole-lung as the samples for RNA-Seq instead of FACS-sorted cells, especially when the authors had <italic>Sox9-Cre;ROSA26-mTmG;Vangl2</italic> mice available, which would of easily permitted isolation of epithelial (and if desired, separate mesenchymal) cell population for RNA-Seq. The problem with a whole-lung bulk-seq analysis in this case, particularly when the authors have showed that epithelial loss of <italic>Vangl2</italic> results in decreased proliferation in the mesenchyme is that the differential expressed gene list will be dramatically skewed by the alterations in cell types. I don't think the authors necessarily need to re-do these experiments for publication, but they should significantly limit the conclusions that they draw from these data. FACS-sorted cell populations or scRNA-Seq would have been preferred.</p><p>5) In Figure 1—figure supplement 4, the alveoli appear somewhat compressed for P7-P30, particular P12-P30. Are these samples inflation-fixed? If not, this would be ideal, as this will impact the appearance of the alveolar structure, especially the relative thinness or thickness, as is trying to be illustrated. This may impact the authors’ conclusion about how the relative thinness/thickness changes throughout alveolar development.</p><p>6) The organoid data are somewhat difficult to interpret and doesn't seem to add much to the paper, but probably no harm in showing it either. While the organoids appear to be smaller, none of the organoid data provides any direct evidence why this would be. The fact that AT1 and AT proliferation appeared to be unaffected is probably the most useful observation. It may be worth just showing this directly in their knockout mouse model.</p><p>7) Although the authors showed that AT1 and AT2 cell proliferation seemed to be unaffected following loss of VANGL1/VANGL2, it is probably a bit of a stretch (without additional data) that the reason for the impaired lung regeneration following bleomycin injury with <italic>Vangl1/Vangl2</italic> deletion induced by <italic>SPC-<sup>Cre</sup>-ERT2</italic> is an AT1 mediated defect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a very timely and informative work. The authors have done a great and quite extensive analysis of the role of Wnt5a in the lung. The results will be of general interest and citable by other investigators in the field.</p><p>There are some problems:</p><p>1) The manuscript is unnecessarily extensive and diffused. The authors have piled up a vast amount of experimental designs some of which were just negative findings that lead them to the next set of studies, which turned out to be positive. The authors need to cull these extra data out of the manuscript and make it cogent as the alternative (the present form) reduces the impact of their findings.</p><p>2) The bulk of the genetic experiments used conventional knockout models. To be able to use the title that refers to alveologenesis, the authors had the option of using conditional (temporal) KO models, or they will have to show that the phenotypes they observe is not due to secondary causes of early development caused by the KO. This requires examining the KO mice in the embryonic stage.</p><p>Aletrnativel the authors may choose to change the title.</p><p>3) If no &quot;No obvious difference in the gross morphology of the lungs was noticed between control and <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>mice prior to postnatal day 3&quot; what was the reason for death on PN2?</p><p>4) The authors claim that Vangl1 plays a minor role in</p><p>alveolar formation and loss of Vangl1 is compensated by <italic>Vangl2</italic> in alveologenesis&quot;. As these were conventional KO mice, how can the authors know that Vangl1 has a role in alveolar formation?</p><p>5) It is interesting, as the authors state, that a small number of <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice survived beyond postnatal day 7.&quot; What was the histology of these lungs?</p><p>6) In <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> embryos, is there a phenotype?</p><p>7) In the studies using cells from control and <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>-deficient cells, what type of cells were isolated and how?</p><p>8) Figure 3E is supposed to show the level of PDGFA (LacZ). But, B-gal staining is not quantifiable. Nor is there an apparent significant difference.</p><p>9) In the bleo model in which <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>-deficient AT1 cells were compromised in their ability to form new alveoli, the authors should use a quantifying method such as MLI in areas of destroyed alveoli.</p><p>10) The authors state: &quot;We noticed that the primary septa in control lungs became visibly thinner during the first three days of postnatal life likely due to flattening of AT1 cells&quot;. Better and more convincing data would be required to include here.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A mammalian <italic>Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2</italic> axis controls the cytoskeleton and confers cellular properties required for alveologenesis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

While we do not anticipate additional experiments are required to address these issues, please be advised that accuracy and rigor are important hallmarks of all <italic>eLife</italic> papers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors made a tremendous effort in revision. The study is much improved and is now suitable for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript &quot;A mammalian <italic>Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2</italic> axis controls the cytoskeleton and confers cellular properties required for alveologenesis&quot;, Dr. Zhang and colleagues present exciting and timely data from their studies of the role of PCP signaling during alveologenesis. In response to reviewers, they have made a number of significant improvements to the manuscript, including the additional of substantial new data. However, the manuscript itself continues to be limited by a number of conclusions that are either over-stated or not well supported by the data, and benefits from further revision.</p><p>1) Given the mortality timeline described in the manuscript, including some long-term survivors, in <italic>Sox9 <sup>Cre</sup>/wt; Vangl2 <sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice, the addition of a Kaplan-Meier survival curve would be more robust than a text description of their observations.</p><p>2) The authors state that the &quot;initial expansion of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts was unaffected (Figure 5A)&quot; (in <italic>Pdgfra <sup>Cre</sup>/wt; Vangl2 <sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice) and that &quot;the primary role of mesenchymal PCP signaling is to control myofibroblast migration and function.&quot; In Figure 5A, while there appears to be no affect on proliferation of these cells at P3, there is a dramatic reduction in the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells at P5.</p><p>3) The authors state that &quot;abnormal myofibroblast development first appeared on day 2…&quot; What exactly do they mean by this? If it’s decreased proliferation then this should be stated. If they mean something else, then the data to support it should be directly referenced.</p><p>4) The authors state (in regards to the mesenchymal conditional knock-out of Porcupine), that &quot;these results support the notion that non-canonical Wnt signaling in the lung mesenchyme initiate PCP signaling for alveolar development.&quot; Although the paper as a whole presents a variety of data that supports this concept, the manuscript contains a number of statements like this over-interpreting individual experiments. As the authors themselves state, porcupine is required for the release of all Wnt ligands, so this particular experiment does not differentiate between the roles of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in alveolar development.</p><p>5) Similarly, from the same set of experiments the authors conclude that there is &quot;no effect on differentiation of AECs.&quot; The only data presented to support this statement are two images from T1a/SPC double-stains of wild-type versus conditional KO lungs. At most, from these data you could say that there was no obvious difference in the number of type 1 and type 2 AECs, but even that statement would require counting cell numbers across a number of animals and sections.</p><p>6) The inclusion of the SPC conditional knockout seems out of place. The rest of the manuscript focuses on type 1 AECs, so these data do not seem to add much to an already long manuscript.</p><p>7) In the earlier portion of the manuscript, the authors focus on conditional knockouts of <italic>Vangl2</italic> in various cellular compartments, but then for the intracellular trafficking studies, used cells derived from <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/gt</sup>; Vangl2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos. Why was the double-knockout studied instead cells deficient in Vangl2 only? Did the <italic>Vangl2</italic> deficient cells not have the same phenotype?</p><p>8) The images shown do not really seem to support the conclusion that PGFA-GFP is trapped within the ER. In Figure 3J, the PDGFA expression seems to be in a fairly uniform peri-nuclear distribution (not in the same punctate loci as the ER stain), and in the images in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 the PDGFA seems to just be uniformly distributed through the cytoplasm rather than &quot;trapped in the ER.&quot;</p><p>9) Although I don't think there is anything wrong with the RNA-Seq data presented, I think is value to the manuscript continues to be significantly limited by the fact that it is derived from whole lung tissue in a knockout where the authors have already shown has dramatic alterations in the ratios of certain cell populations (e.g. depletion of myofibroblasts). In this situation, the conclusions that can be drawn a gene ontology analysis of these data are very limited (the GO categories will largely represent biological functions of cell populations that are enriched or depleted in the cKO relative to control). It really adds little to the data already presented in the paper, and doesn't really address the question that set out to answer with the experiment (e.g. &quot;…to reveal the pathways controlled by epithelial PCP signaling.&quot;).</p><p>10) The manuscript could benefit from more clarity about what the authors think is happening in their injury model. Looking at the two images shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the airspaces appear to be larger. However, the measured MLI for the conditional knockout is smaller. Do the authors think the alveoli are smaller after injury? If so, why? Also, their conclusions that &quot;AT1 cells were compromised in their ability to form new alveoli&quot; is a dramatic over-interpretation of these data, particularly given that the <italic>Sftpc-<sup>CreER</sup></italic> driver was used. While I agree there definitely appears to be an affect on injury repair, whether the defect is with type 1 or type 2 AECs or both, and what exactly the defect is remains entirely unclear.</p><p>11) Again, the organoid data are intriguing but I'm not sure how much it really adds to the story. I suppose it supports the general concept that <italic>Vangl2</italic> is required for general cellular organization, but again exactly what is happening is pretty difficult to really understand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This was a work that in my first review, I found to be very timely and significant. I was impressed by the number of approaches and the volume of the obtained data. I had concerns about the way the data were presented. The authors have rewritten the manuscript and it is now in much shape. I also had concern as to whether the authors were actually examining the process of alveologenesis or rather the events prior to it that ultimately lead to defects in this process.</p><p>The authors have responded to my concerns and I am satisfied with their response. They have additionally added data that strengthens their conclusions. I am still not absolutely convinced that their findings are directly relevant to postnatal alveologenesis, but I admit this is splitting hair.

For instance, PDGFRA is expressed in airway smooth muscle cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and alveolar myofibroblasts. The mutants we study in this manuscript selectively affect alveolar myofibroblasts. Thus, western blots of the whole lungs will not reveal changes in PDGFRA in these mutants. Also, there is no easy way to sort alveolar myofibroblasts away from airway smooth muscle cells and vascular smooth muscle cells for protein analysis. As a result, we have relied on quantification of immunoreactivity (<italic>e.g.</italic>, PDGFA, PDGFRA) in individual lung cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Sox2-cre;Vangl2 mutant was not really described in the text.

In this context, our mouse studies have direct relevance to our findings that COPD patients displayed reduced levels of PCP pathway components.

Do the authors have any explanation why?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised that <italic>Shh-Cre</italic>, which is broadly expressed and widely used, was unable to effectively remove VANGL2 in the lung. The <italic>ROSA26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> allele is known to undergo recombination by even low levels of Cre activity; GFP was efficiently induced from the <italic>ROSA26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> allele by <italic>Shh-Cre</italic>.

We also won't be surprised if <italic>Shh-Cre</italic> is unable to effectively convert other floxed alleles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although SOX9 is well known to be expressed in the distal lung epithelium during development, it is also expressed in the lung mesenchyme. Because the authors use the SOX9-Cre to characterize the effects of epithelial-specific loss of Vangl2, they should provide (ideally quantitative) data about the degree of recombination that the Sox9-Cre induces in the lung mesenchyme. One straight forward way to do this would be to add data using their Sox9-Cre;ROSA26-mTmG mice co-stained with a pan-epithelial marker such as Cdh1 or Nkx2-1. Significant recombination in the mesenchyme could significantly impact the interpretation of their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included data on analysis of <italic>Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup>; ROSA26<sup>mTmG</sup>/<sup>+</sup></italic> lungs in Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We found that GFP induced by <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> was not found in the mesenchyme of the distal lung and was detected in few scattered mesenchymal cells in the large airway. The only place where a substantial number of mesenchymal cells expressed GFP was the trachea. This piece of information in conjunction with the alveolar phenotype induced by <italic>Sftpc<sup>CreER</sup></italic> or <italic>Aqp5<sup>CreER</sup></italic> support our model in which epithelial <italic>Vangl1/2</italic> plays a key role in controlling alveolar formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why did the authors choose to use the Sox2-Cre when they were primarily interested in the distal epithelium (Figure 3E) – why not just stick with the Sox9-Cre (especially since these data are shown in the next panel, Figure 3F)</p></disp-quote><p>It turned out that <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> was less efficient in inducing recombination of the <italic>Pdgfa<sup>ex4COIN</sup> </italic>allele than <italic>Sox2-Cre</italic>. In Figure 3E, we aimed to uncover the site and level of PDGFA expression in the lung and <italic>Sox2-Cre</italic> was more suitable for this purpose. As such, we were able to conclude that (1) PDGFA is expressed in both AT1 and AT2 cells and (2) not only more AT1 cells express PDGFA but AT1 cells also harbor higher levels of PDGFA than AT2 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I don't understand the rationale for using whole-lung as the samples for RNA-Seq instead of FACS-sorted cells, especially when the authors had Sox9-Cre;ROSA26-mTmG;Vangl2 mice available, which would of easily permitted isolation of epithelial (and if desired, separate mesenchymal) cell population for RNA-Seq. The problem with a whole-lung bulk-seq analysis in this case, particularly when the authors have showed that epithelial loss of Vangl2 results in decreased proliferation in the mesenchyme is that the differential expressed gene list will be dramatically skewed by the alterations in cell types. I don't think the authors necessarily need to re-do these experiments for publication, but they should significantly limit the conclusions that they draw from these data. FACS-sorted cell populations or scRNA-Seq would have been preferred.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer about the pitfalls of using the whole lung as the source for RNA-Seq and have limited the conclusions that we can draw from these data. In the future, we will sort epithelial cells for RNA-Seq. Ideally, we also would like to sort myofibroblasts for RNA-Seq. However, this is complicated by the fact that it would be difficult to sort myofibroblasts away from airway smooth muscle cells and vascular smooth muscle cells since they express a similar set of markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1—figure supplement 4, the alveoli appear somewhat compressed for P7-P30, particular P12-P30. Are these samples inflation-fixed? If not, this would be ideal, as this will impact the appearance of the alveolar structure, especially the relative thinness or thickness, as is trying to be illustrated. This may impact the authors’ conclusion about how the relative thinness/thickness changes throughout alveolar development.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not inflate the lungs when we fixed the tissues except for those used for EM studies. We have provided quantification of the relative thickness of the primary septa at different stages of development in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 (the old Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The organoid data are somewhat difficult to interpret and doesn't seem to add much to the paper, but probably no harm in showing it either. While the organoids appear to be smaller, none of the organoid data provides any direct evidence why this would be. The fact that AT1 and AT proliferation appeared to be unaffected is probably the most useful observation. It may be worth just showing this directly in their knockout mouse model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the organoid data added little insight into how <italic>Vangl1/2</italic> controls alveologenesis. The organoid system does not fully recapitulate alveologenesis in vivo. While AT1/2 proliferation does not seem to be affected in the organoids, AT1/2 proliferation was affected in mice. We should add that in control spheres, HOPX<sup>+</sup> AT1 cells are located inside the spheres and are surrounded by SPC<sup>+</sup> AT2 cells. This organization was not observed in spheres, in particular medium and small alveolospheres, derived from <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>-deficient cells. This is consistent with defective cellular properties in <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>-deficient AT1 cells required for morphogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Although the authors showed that AT1 and AT2 cell proliferation seemed to be unaffected following loss of VANGL1/VANGL2, it is probably a bit of a stretch (without additional data) that the reason for the impaired lung regeneration following bleomycin injury with Vangl1/Vangl2 deletion induced by SPC-<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> is an AT1 mediated defect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional studies are required to elucidate the molecular basis of impaired alveolar repair in the absence of <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>. We have modified our description to acknowledge this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>There are some problems:</p><p>1) The manuscript is unnecessarily extensive and diffused. The authors have piled up a vast amount of experimental designs some of which were just negative findings that lead them to the next set of studies, which turned out to be positive. The authors need to cull these extra data out of the manuscript and make it cogent as the alternative (the present form) reduces the impact of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the manuscript and culled the extra data as much as possible as suggested by the reviewer. We have to admit that this manuscript delivers so many new points that there is no easy way to present them without giving the impression that some are out of place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The bulk of the genetic experiments used conventional knockout models. To be able to use the title that refers to alveologenesis, the authors had the option of using conditional (temporal) KO models, or they will have to show that the phenotypes they observe is not due to secondary causes of early development caused by the KO. This requires examining the KO mice in the embryonic stage.</p><p>Alternatively the authors may choose to change the title.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission, we showed that postnatal removal of <italic>Vangl2</italic> by <italic>Sftpc<sup>CreER</sup></italic> induced alveolar phenotypes (Figure 3K). In the revised manuscript, we have added analysis of alveolar phenotypes induced by postnatal removal of <italic>Vangl2</italic> via <italic>Aqp5<sup>CreER</sup></italic> (Figure 6I). Together, these studies on conditional knockouts further support the conclusions from conventional knockouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If no &quot;No obvious difference in the gross morphology of the lungs was noticed between control and Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>;Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice prior to postnatal day 3&quot; what was the reason for death on PN2?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, there was no lethality at P2.

As these were conventional KO mice, how can the authors know that Vangl1 has a role in alveolar formation?</p></disp-quote><p>We suggest that <italic>Vangl1</italic> plays a minor role in alveolar formation and loss of <italic>Vangl1</italic> is compensated by <italic>Vangl2</italic> in alveologenesis. This is based on the following observations: (1) <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/gt</sup></italic> mice have no apparent phenotypes; (2) <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice display alveolar defects; (3) a fraction of <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/+</sup>; Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice exhibit more severe alveolar defects than <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice; (4) no survivors beyond four weeks carry the genotype of <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/+</sup>; Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>.

If they mean something else, then the data to support it should be directly referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our statement to indicate that “decreased myofibroblast proliferation first appeared on day 2…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state (in regards to the mesenchymal conditional knock-out of Porcupine), that &quot;these results support the notion that non-canonical Wnt signaling in the lung mesenchyme initiate PCP signaling for alveolar development.&quot; Although the paper as a whole presents a variety of data that supports this concept, the manuscript contains a number of statements like this over-interpreting individual experiments. As the authors themselves state, porcupine is required for the release of all Wnt ligands, so this particular experiment does not differentiate between the roles of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling in alveolar development.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have removed “non-canonical” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Similarly, from the same set of experiments the authors conclude that there is &quot;no effect on differentiation of AECs.&quot; The only data presented to support this statement are two images from T1a/SPC double-stains of wild-type versus conditional KO lungs. At most, from these data you could say that there was no obvious difference in the number of type 1 and type 2 AECs, but even that statement would require counting cell numbers across a number of animals and sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the statement to “…differentiation of alveolar type I and type II cells” as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The inclusion of the SPC conditional knockout seems out of place. The rest of the manuscript focuses on type 1 AECs, so these data do not seem to add much to an already long manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the SPC conditional knockouts to support the involvement of type II AECs in alveolar formation and to respond to critiques from the other reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the earlier portion of the manuscript, the authors focus on conditional knockouts of Vangl2 in various cellular compartments, but then for the intracellular trafficking studies, used cells derived from Vangl1<sup>gt/gt</sup>; Vangl2<sup>-/-</sup> embryos. Why was the double-knockout studied instead cells deficient in Vangl2 only? Did the Vangl2 deficient cells not have the same phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>Our genetic studies suggest that <italic>Vangl1</italic> plays a minor role in alveolar formation (due to the presence of <italic>Vangl2</italic>). To ensure a complete removal of signaling through <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>, we only derived cells from <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/gt</sup>; Vangl2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The images shown do not really seem to support the conclusion that PGFA-GFP is trapped within the ER. In Figure 3J, the PDGFA expression seems to be in a fairly uniform peri-nuclear distribution (not in the same punctate loci as the ER stain), and in the images in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 the PDGFA seems to just be uniformly distributed through the cytoplasm rather than &quot;trapped in the ER.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that ER trapping occurred in a significant fraction of but not all of <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>-deficient cells. We have removed “trapped in the ER” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Although I don't think there is anything wrong with the RNA-Seq data presented, I think is value to the manuscript continues to be significantly limited by the fact that it is derived from whole lung tissue in a knockout where the authors have already shown has dramatic alterations in the ratios of certain cell populations (e.g. depletion of myofibroblasts). In this situation, the conclusions that can be drawn a gene ontology analysis of these data are very limited (the GO categories will largely represent biological functions of cell populations that are enriched or depleted in the cKO relative to control). It really adds little to the data already presented in the paper, and doesn't really address the question that set out to answer with the experiment (e.g. &quot;…to reveal the pathways controlled by epithelial PCP signaling.&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have deleted “To discover pathways that are affected by epithelial PCP signaling…” and also revised this section to indicate the limitation of RNA-Seq of whole lungs without cell sorting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The manuscript could benefit from more clarity about what the authors think is happening in their injury model. Looking at the two images shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the airspaces appear to be larger. However, the measured MLI for the conditional knockout is smaller. Do the authors think the alveoli are smaller after injury? If so, why? Also, their conclusions that &quot;AT1 cells were compromised in their ability to form new alveoli&quot; is a dramatic over-interpretation of these data, particularly given that the Sftpc-<sup>CreER</sup> driver was used. While I agree there definitely appears to be an affect on injury repair, whether the defect is with type 1 or type 2 AECs or both, and what exactly the defect is remains entirely unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We should emphasize that the two images in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A were derived from mice that received tamoxifen treatment alone without bleomycin. The enlarged airspaces in <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/gt</sup>; Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sftpc<sup>CreER/+</sup> </italic>lungs were due to removal of <italic>Vangl1/2</italic>. The MLI measurement in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B was conducted on mice that received both tamoxifen and bleomycin. The reduced MLI in <italic>Vangl1<sup>gt/gt</sup>; Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>; Sftpc<sup>CreER/+</sup> </italic>lungs indicates a reduced distance between two primary or secondary septa in the regenerating alveoli, consistent with the definition of smaller alveoli. We suspect that smaller alveoli are related to alterations in the cytoskeleton in the absence of <italic>Vangl1/2</italic> but this notion would require additional investigation.</p><p>We have revised our statement to indicate that the observed effect on injury repair could be due to AT1 or AT2 or both.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Again, the organoid data are intriguing but I'm not sure how much it really adds to the story. I suppose it supports the general concept that Vangl2 is required for general cellular organization, but again exactly what is happening is pretty difficult to really understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the organoid data supports the general notion that the <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> axis is required for cellular organization. However, the molecular mechanism by which <italic>Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2</italic> signaling confers cellular properties requires additional studies, which are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
