We have developed a theory called Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS) based on the hypothesis that GRNs are organised so that they remain robust in the face of unpredictable environmental and evolutionary changes. BQS makes strong and diverse predictions about the network features that allow stable responses under arbitrary perturbations, including the random addition of new connections. We show that the GRNs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, yeast, mouse, and human all verify the predictions of BQS. BQS explains many of the small- and large‐scale properties of GRNs, provides conditions for evolvable robustness, and highlights general features of transcriptional response. BQS is severely compromised in a human cancer cell line, suggesting that loss of BQS might underlie the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells, and highlighting a possible sequence of GRN alterations concomitant with cancer initiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02863.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02863.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genomes of living organisms consist of thousands of genes, which produce proteins that perform many essential functions. Cells receive signals from both their internal and external environments, and respond by changing how they express their genes. This allows a cell to make the right amount of different proteins when needed. The proteins that a cell produces can then, in turn, influence how the cell's genes are expressed. This set of interactions between genes and proteins is called a gene regulatory network, and is akin to a computer program that the cell runs to define its behaviour. At present, we understand very little about why these networks take on the forms seen in living cells.</p><p>A remarkable feature of living organisms is their ability to withstand an extremely wide variety of predicaments, such as DNA damage, physical trauma or exposure to toxins. This ability, generally called robustness, requires a cell to rapidly activate different gene sets and maintain their activity for as long as necessary. However, very little is known about how cells are programmed to respond appropriately, whatever happens, and keep themselves in a stable state.</p><p>Albergante et al. propose that a fully robust gene regulatory network should be able to stabilize itself. This means that the robustness of a gene regulatory network should only depend on how it is wired up, and not on quantitative changes to any features that may change unpredictably—for example the concentration of a protein.</p><p>By analysing data that is already available about gene regulatory networks in a wide selection of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, Albergante et al. show that all known gene regulatory networks are wired up in a way that any quantitative change to the network will not cause the state of network to change. In addition, gene regulatory networks tend to remain stable even if new regulatory links are randomly added. Albergante et al. call this property Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS): the network is <italic>qualitatively stable</italic> because its state does not change when the activity of particular regulatory links in the network changes, and it is <italic>buffered</italic> against its stability being compromised by the random addition of new links.</p><p>Albergante et al. also found that the gene regulatory network of a cancer cell does not match up with the predictions of BQS, suggesting that the robustness of the network is compromised in these cells. This could explain why cancer cells are able to easily change their characteristics in response to changes in the environment. In addition, using BQS to analyse the gene regulatory network of bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> reveals points in the network that, if disrupted, would make the network unstable, potentially harming the cell. Therefore, in the future, an understanding of BQS could help efforts to design new drugs to treat a range of infections and diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02863.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02863.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>robustness</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>antibiotics resistance</kwd><kwd>evolvability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP-0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albergante</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C303/A7399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blow</surname><given-names>J Julian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT096598MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blow</surname><given-names>J Julian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scottish University Life Science Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Physical Sciences in Oncology Centers, U54 CA143682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>083524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albergante</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name><name><surname>Blow</surname><given-names>J Julian</given-names></name><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The theory of Buffered Qualitative Stability uses the importance of biological robustness to explain many features of gene regulatory networks in a wide range of organisms, and has implications for diverse biological phenomena including the ability of bacteria and cancer cells to ‘loosen’ their robustness and hence evade treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At every level of organisation, biological entities, such as genes, proteins and cells, function as ensembles. Interaction networks are therefore a fundamental feature of biological systems, and a vast amount of analysis exploring the organisation of biological networks has been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchanan et al., 2010</xref>). This analysis has provided interesting insights into the features of these networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tyson and Novák, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowan et al., 2012</xref>), and has led to new methodologies for characterizing their topologies. However, one might argue that this work has had less impact on our understanding of the reasons underlying the network topologies observed and on the possible selective pressures leading to the emergence of common network features. Here we present a simple theory, Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS), motivated by biological robustness, which has strong explanatory power and provides a number of hard, readily verifiable predictions for the topological structure of interaction networks, at both global and local scales. Besides leading to new predictions—that are consistently verified—BQS provides a theoretical justification for the ubiquitousness of network features already observed. BQS is therefore an important step in providing a general mechanistic explanation for the overall structure of GRNs at different scales and in shedding new light on previous observations.</p><p>Robustness is a remarkable feature of living organisms allowing them to tolerate a wide variety of contingencies, such as DNA damage, limitations in nutrient availability, or exposure to toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopez-Maury et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacNeil and Walhout, 2011</xref>). Although much is now known about how cells respond to particular stresses or environmental cues, little is known about how cells remain stable and respond appropriately whatever the contingency. Over evolutionary time it is also advantageous for organisms to be robust to genetic changes, including those that occur as a consequence of the shuffling of genes during sexual reproduction. In order for cells to be fully robust, changes to any of the thousands of individual quantitative parameters—for example the concentration of a transcription factor or its affinity for its cognate DNA sequence—cannot be critical because contingencies may cause these to change. We propose that the robustness of a biological system should therefore depend on qualitative, not quantitative, features of its response to perturbation.</p><p>Robustness is a complex and fundamental feature that can be formalised in many ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silva-Rocha and de Lorenzo, 2010</xref>). Features commonly associated with robustness include resistance to noise, redundancy and error-correction. Here we will focus on an important component of robustness: the ability of a system at equilibrium to respond to a perturbation by returning to its equilibrium state. Such a feature, generally called ‘stability’, is essential to allow a system to properly operate in noisy conditions and withstand unexpected environmental challenges.</p><p>This type of robustness has been studied before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quirk and Ruppert, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Puccia and Levins, 1985</xref>) and has been applied to economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quirk and Ruppert, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hale et al., 1999</xref>), ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">May, 1973a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Puccia and Levins, 1985</xref>) and chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tyson, 1975</xref>). However, this notion has never been used to predict network features beyond simple topological properties required by the ‘rules’ that allow such stringent robustness and has not previously been applied to molecular cell biology, or the evolutionary pressures shaping the behaviours of living organisms.</p><p>Transcriptional regulation plays a central role in the behaviour of cells in response to environmental cues and is aberrant in many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Young, 2013</xref>). Moreover, networks representing transcriptional interactions have been derived for diverse organisms. These networks, termed ‘gene regulatory networks’ (GRNs), comprise directed links between pairs of genes. For a given pair of linked genes, one encodes a transcription factor (TF) that regulates the expression of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchanan et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the GRN of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with TFs coloured red and the arrows colour-coded according to the number of genes regulated by the source TF. Systematic network analysis of GRNs is possible because comprehensive and high quality GRN datasets are available for different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luscombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacIsaac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galan-Vasquez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salgado et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN.</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salgado et al.

The type of robustness that we hypothesize ensures that the transcriptional state of a cell remains largely stable in response to random perturbations. We show that published GRNs, including those of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, mouse and humans are robust in this way, a property we term ‘Buffered Qualitative Stability’ (BQS). Remarkably, the only published GRN of a cancer cell line deviates strongly from BQS, suggesting that the loss of BQS may play an important role in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GRNs are qualitatively stable</title><p>Interaction networks are ubiquitous in biology, and robustness in their response to perturbation is a desirable property in many circumstances. A mathematical theory called ‘Qualitative Stability’ has determined how the topological structure of a network is related to robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quirk and Ruppert, 1965</xref>). This theory, discussed in ‘Materials and methods’, shows that certain network topologies remain stable even if the strength of any of the network interactions is varied in an arbitrary way. Qualitatively Stable GRNs would be robust, for example, to changes in the concentration of a transcription factor or its affinity for its cognate DNA sequence.</p><p>A primary requirement for Qualitative Stability is the absence of long feedback loops (meaning, in the case of GRNs, feedback loops involving three or more genes) regardless of whether the connections comprising the loops are stimulatory or inhibitory. In addition, 2-node feedback loops can be Qualitatively Stable depending on the precise nature of their interactions (see ‘Materials and methods’). The danger inherent in feedback loops was first analysed by James Clerk Maxwell who showed that mechanical governors regulating the output of steam engines can fail if the input changes faster than the system response, causing ‘an oscillating and jerking motion, increasing in violence till it reaches the limit of action of the governor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maxwell, 1868</xref>). Because there is an inevitable time lag between a transcription factor (TF) binding to the promoter of a gene and the production of the protein product of that gene, this form of instability can occur if GRNs contain feedback loops consisting of three or more TFs. This concept is supported by the behaviour of the repressilator, a well-known gene circuit consisting of a 3-gene feedback loop, which has been shown to produce oscillations of increasing intensity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elowitz and Leibler, 2000</xref>).</p><p>We therefore examined the structure of organisms for which system-wide GRNs have been published, including three bacteria—<italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salgado et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanz et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galan-Vasquez et al., 2011</xref>)—the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbison et al., 2004</xref>), and human (represented by the GM12878 cell line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>). The main Figures present data from <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human, whilst analysis of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> plus additional confidence levels for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and additional yeast datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luscombe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacIsaac et al., 2006</xref>) are reported in the Figure Supplements and confirm our main results. A review of available datasets and the rationale for our selection is given in ‘Materials and methods’.</p><p>On studying feedback loops in the GRNs of these organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, lightly shaded bars), we find that <italic>P. aeurginosa</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human GRNs have no feedback loops comprising three or more genes. The <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN has no feedback loops comprising four or more genes, and only two 3-gene feedback loops. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has two 3-gene feedback loops and one 4-gene feedback loop. Notably, all the 3-gene feedback loops observed in real GRNs share the same peculiar structure, with implications discussed below. In contrast, when networks of the size and connectivity of the biological GRNs are constructed with randomly placed links, they display an exponential increase in feedback loops consisting of three or more genes, which number in the thousands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, heavily shaded bars, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Each of 1000 randomly simulated <italic>E. coli</italic> networks had at least one long feedback loop. The vastly different abundances of feedback loops clearly demonstrate the profound difference in topologies between real and random networks. Statistical analyses suggest that there is an extremely small probability (&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>) that the absence of long feedback loops with &gt;3 genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> is a chance event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

The dataset was constructed by adding to the network derived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al. (2002)</xref> new interactions derived under different experimental conditions, and the absence of a measure of confidence for the interactions makes it difficult to assess the strength of the experimental support for the interactions that form the feedback loops. The above considerations suggest that a moderate rate of false positives may be present in the dataset. The sensitivity of loop count to noise in the data therefore suggests that loop counting may not provide a good indication of the role of BQS by itself in this case. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacIsaac et al.

(yeast) datasets under different statistical conditions.</title><p>RegulonDB reports, for each interaction, a list of evidence codes indicating which experimental techniques reported a particular interaction. Some of these codes (called `strong’) are associated with particularly reliable biological techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salgado et al., 2012</xref>). The information provided by RegulonDB can be used in different ways to assess the statistical validity of our analysis. A first approach is to use the number of evidence codes as an indicator of the confidence level of an interaction: the larger the number of evidence codes, the greater the confidence. A second approach is to restrict the network only to those interactions supported by strong evidence codes. We decided to study the effect of varying the number of general or strong evidence codes on the results discussed. ‘kEc’ indicates the network constructed using only those interactions supported by at least k evidence codes, while ‘kSEc’ indicates the network constructed using only those interactions supported by at least k strong evidence codes. The number of genes (<bold>A</bold>), TFs (<bold>B</bold>), and interactions of the networks (<bold>C</bold>) vary with the number of evidence codes. However, the edge density (<bold>D</bold>) is rather stable, suggesting that the global properties of the GRN are mostly preserved in the different types of network. The number of feedback loops is very limited regardless of the number of evidence codes used (<bold>E</bold>). 2Ec and 2SEc have similar edge density (<bold>D</bold>) and number of illegal feedback loops (<bold>E</bold>), thus suggesting that taking two evidence codes gives a network similar to the one obtained by considering only strong biological evidence. In the yeast dataset derived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbison et al. (2004)</xref> each interaction is associated with a p-value that measures the probability that such an interaction has been detected due to experimental error. Selecting a large threshold p-value increases the probability of false positives, but decreases the probability of false negatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al. (2002)</xref> reported that a threshold p-value of 10<sup>–3</sup> provides a good trade-off for this kind of data. However, a reliable theory would be expected to display a limited sensitivity to a small variation of the threshold. The number of genes (<bold>F</bold>), TFs (<bold>G</bold>), and interactions of the network (<bold>H</bold>) change with different thresholds. Nevertheless, the edge density is quite stable (<bold>I</bold>). As with the RegulonDB data (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>), these results suggest that the main characteristics of the network are mostly preserved under different statistical constrains. The number of feedback loops remains low for reasonable variations around the selected threshold (<bold>J</bold>), and the increase in number is compatible with the expected increase in the rate of false positives. Interestingly, looking at feedback loop number, a ‘phase transition’ becomes apparent for large thresholds. This behaviour suggests the use of great care when performing this type of analysis on very noisy data.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02863.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02863.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02863-fig2-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.008</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>General properties and number of feedback loops under different random model for RegulonDB (<italic>E. coli</italic>).</title><p>The different constraints (and algorithms) disused in ‘Materials and methods’ result in different networks properties.

This stability provides a type of ‘damping’, which will tend to restore the state of the GRN when challenged with contingencies that might otherwise induce chaotic or unpredictable behaviour. Notably, the damped oscillatory response expected from a stable system has been observed in single cell experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tay et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BQS predicts large-scale properties of GRNs</title><p>In principle the Qualitative Stability observed in GRNs might be easy to break by addition of another link to the network. For example, a long feedback loop can be created by the addition of a feedback connection from a TF lower down in a network path to a TF higher up in that path. This could occur, for example, through a mutation in the promoter of the target gene allowing it to be bound by a new TF. It is also possible that stress conditions could cause TFs to act inappropriately at promoters they do not normally regulate. In this way Qualitative Stability could be lost, and GRNs could become unstable. Thus, we predict that if long feedback loops are detrimental because of their instability, then GRNs would be configured to minimize destabilization via the addition of new connections. We call network paths that can be transformed into loops by the addition of a single new link ‘incomplete feedback loops’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). The abundance of incomplete feedback loops in the GRNs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> (lightly shaded bars). Data for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>. For each of these GRNs there are &lt;2000 incomplete feedback loops and they tend to be of a relatively small size. A similar empirical observation has been made regarding transcriptional cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosenfeld and Alon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">The modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>).

Statistical analyses suggest that there is an extremely small probability (&lt;10<sup>−19</sup>) that the absence of long incomplete feedback loops is a chance event in the three organisms considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).

In addition, these topologies efficiently prevent random mutations from introducing possible sources of destabilization. Note that feedback loops involving more than three genes are also highly susceptible to the creation of additional long feedback loops making them strongly disadvantageous to stability. We say that networks configured to minimize the number of real and incomplete long feedback loops possess Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS). Networks having this property are <italic>stable</italic> to perturbations and are also <italic>buffered</italic> against the potentially destabilising effects that occur when new links are added.

The <italic>E. coli</italic> TF with the largest number of ‘outgoing regulatory connections’ regulates 38 other TF genes, but is itself regulated by only one TF; the TF with the largest number of ‘incoming regulatory connections’ is regulated by nine other TFs but itself regulates only one TF gene. There are no <italic>E. coli</italic> TFs that are both highly regulated and highly regulating (in fact, there are no TFs regulating &gt;2 other TFs that are themselves regulated by &gt;2 TFs).</p><p>BQS does not even allow central control to be split by connecting highly regulated TFs to highly regulating TFs, as this would create a large number of incomplete loops.

These results show that BQS strongly favours distributed control over central control, and provide another example of BQS being a key determinant of the topology of GRNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BQS predicts small-scale properties of GRNs</title><p>Our discussion so far has focused on the effect of BQS on large- and intermediate-scale global properties of GRNs. BQS also makes strong predictions about the small-scale local structure of GRNs. To investigate this, we dissected each of the GRNs into a series of small motifs comprising three or four genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milo et al., 2002</xref>). A single motif can, in principle, break Qualitative Stability by forming a feedback loop composed of three or more genes. As we have shown above, such motifs are essentially absent from real GRNs. However, motifs may be susceptible to feedback loop formation through the addition of a link, and we can therefore speak of ‘buffered motifs’ as motifs that are resilient to this, and therefore enhance BQS locally. Note that, to prevent possible biases introduced by the large number of non-TF genes, only motifs completely formed by TFs were considered. Using symmetry arguments, we grouped 3- and 4-gene motifs into buffered and non-buffered categories, which are equi-probable in a random network (confirmed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B,E,F,H,K,L</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref> show that in the real GRNs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human, buffered motifs (blue) are much more abundant than would be expected by chance, while unbuffered (green and violet) motifs are much less abundant; and indeed, unbuffered motifs which are particularly susceptible to breaking BQS (violet) are rare.

Indeed, the most buffered 3- and 4-gene motifs studied here are, respectively, latent feed-forward loops and latent bi-fans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Measuring BQS</title><p>When a network uses only a subset of the possible edges in a motif, new connections can be added to expand the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In general, some of these connections will create long feedback loops (red dashed arrow), while others will not (green dashed arrow). As we have shown, robustness appears to exert a strong selective pressure on the topology of GRNs. To assess the extent of this pressure we used an extensive computational approach to estimate the probability that a random edge addition between two TFs creates a long feedback loop in the GRNs. All the possible edge insertions were tested in the real GRNs of <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human, and the values were compared with those estimated in the corresponding random networks. The extent of buffered stability is quite remarkable: 4363 new interactions can be added to the human GRN, but only 48 of them will create long feedback loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By contrast, addition of single extra links to random networks would lead to the creation of approximately 2000 different feedback loops on average: a hit rate of approximately 50%. The probability that real GRNs will gain long feedback loops by random edge additions is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, lightly shaded bars), and is significantly smaller than that found for comparable random networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, heavily shaded bars). Nevertheless, these probabilities are non-zero, indicating a trade-off between stability and the need for cells to regulate gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>BQS highlights critical network modules</title><p>Qualitative Stability is compromised to a very small degree in the GRN of <italic>E. coli</italic> by the two small, but ‘illegal’ feedback loops shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> and highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Three aspects are noteworthy. Firstly, of the seven 2-node feedback loops in the <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN, four are embedded into the two potentially unstable motifs depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, whilst the other three are isolated from other feedback loops and so are either stable or likely to act as switches. Secondly, the genes comprising the two illegal motifs are involved in drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ariza et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin and Rosner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nishino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keseler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and/or acid resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sayed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keseler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This raises the possibility that limited instances of deviation from BQS may arise through evolution as a short-term expediency allowing survival in a changing environment. Thirdly, both loops share a remarkably similar sub-structure: two linked 2-gene feedback loops connected by one link into a 3-node feedback loop. It has been previously shown in chemical networks that such a configuration can display chaotic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sensse and Eiswirth, 2005</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that these illegal motifs act as localized sources of chaos, allowing a cell population to quickly explore very diverse gene expression levels, thus accelerating the emergence of resistant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopez-Maury et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, compatible with the idea that chaotic behaviour should be tightly controlled, most of the genes depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> are highly regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.025</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The two ‘illegal’ feedback loops in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</title><p>The figure shows connections between TFs in the two motifs in <italic>E. coli</italic> that contain feedback loops with &gt;2 links (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>).

JUNB and FOSL1 are proto-oncogenes that are components of the AP-1 transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kouzarides and Ziff, 1989</xref>) and have been reported to be part of a long feedback loop in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stelniec-Klotz et al., 2012</xref>); EGR1 is a regulator of tumour suppressor genes and an oncogene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baron et al., 2005</xref>); and the TFs of the C/EBP family have been described as both tumour promoters and suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nerlov, 2007</xref>). These genes are also active in the non-cancer cell line GM12878, yet their destabilizing role in cancer arises from a rewiring of the network. GM12878 satisfies BQS whilst K562 comparatively does not, and yet the two GRNs have similar numbers of genes and regulatory connections (in fact, the K562 TF network has a lower link density than that of GM12878). Finally, the probability of introducing long feedback loops by random edge additions is significantly larger in the cancer cell line than in non-cancer cells, but still lower than the value expected in a random network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). These findings suggest that cancer cells break BQS and have a vastly less stable GRN than normal cells, which is however less unstable than expected in a random network.</p><p>Certain features of GRNs, such as rare, long incomplete feedback loops, make them more susceptible to the formation of long feedback loops when new regulatory connections are added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–G</xref>). Therefore, we investigated how many of the long feedback loops observed in K562 cancer cells could have originated from these relatively unbuffered network structures in non-cancerous GM12878 cells. We find that the three genes that contribute the most to the formation of long feedback loops in the cancer cell line (EGR1, FOSL1, and JUNB) are all involved in the formation of the longest incomplete feedback loops observed in the non-cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). As highlighted earlier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), single insertions of a new connection into the non-cancer human cell line can create 48 different long feedback loops. Of these 48 potentially destabilising interactions of the non-cancer cell line, three are actually observed in the cancer cell line, namely JUNB-BCLAF1, BATF-EBF1, and JUNB-EBF1. The likelihood of these potentially destabilising interactions occurring in the cancer cell line is 3/48 = 0.063. In comparison, there are a total of 4363 additional links that could be made between the TFs of the non-cancer cell line. Of these potential links, 56 are observed in the cancer cell line. Hence, the links observed represent 56/4363 (0.013) of all the possible ones. Therefore, the destabilizing interactions are five times more abundant than would be expected by chance (0.063 vs 0.013), consistent with the idea that destabilizing interactions were positively selected for during the microevolution process underlying cancer progression. This suggests that, despite the diverse biological histories of these two cell lines (the networks of GM12878 and K562 share only four common links between TFs), the progression of K562 into a cancerous state has involved changes to regions of the GRN in the progenitor normal cells that displayed weaker BQS. Such genetic factors are therefore likely to play a pivotal role in the process of cancer progression in other cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>BQS and transcriptional response</title><p>The eukaryotic GRNs analysed so far are static ‘snapshots’ of potential transcriptional interactions of a population of cells under rich media growth. As discussed in ‘Materials and methods’, such conditions are ideal to minimize cell heterogeneity and to obtain high quality equilibrium networks that are ideally suited for theoretical analysis. However, during the lifetime of an organism GRNs are dynamic and the set of actual transcriptional regulations can change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luscombe et al., 2004</xref>). GRNs transitioning from one transcriptional program to another are unlikely to be at steady state and, under these circumstances, transcriptional robustness may be less important. We decided to test if BQS could provide new insights into the role of robustness during such structural changes. To this end, we used the data presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garber et al. (2012)</xref> to reconstruct the GRN of murine dendritic cells at four different time points after stimulation by pathogens: at the time of stimulus application (marked as ‘0 hr’) and after the cells have been exposed to the stimulus for 30 min (‘0.5hr’), 1 hr (‘1 hr’), and 2 hr (‘2 hr’). Since the number of TFs studied in these networks is much smaller than the number considered previously, a different simulation algorithm has been used (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>The ‘0 hr’ GRN was obtained under conditions comparable with the organisms discussed previously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows that all the predictions of BQS are met at this time. As indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the GRN has a very limited number of long feedback loops (only three with three or more genes), in striking contrast with the hundreds observed in randomly generated networks of the same link density. Interestingly, all of the long feedback loops depend on the transcriptional interaction between SFPI1 and E2F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Notably E2F1 plays a crucial role in the cell cycle and is only transiently activated at commitment to cell division at the end of G1. Therefore, all of the long feedback loops detected are likely to be transient. Similarly, the number of incomplete feedback loops is very small, and much lower than would be expected in random networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Motif analysis is also consistent with BQS: there is a much higher proportion of unregulated transcription factors than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), and the proportion of stable 3- and 4-node motifs is heavily biased towards the buffered stable forms that enhance BQS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). Additionally, the mode of cross regulation—with transcription factors tending to be either highly regulating or highly regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>)—also follows the distribution predicted by BQS. Finally, the probability of creating additional long feedback loops in the network by randomly inserting a new regulatory connection is only 0.18, much lower than the value of 0.74 expected in a comparable random network.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.033</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>BQS in homeostatic murine dendritic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Number of feedback loops and incomplete feedback loops compared to the corresponding random network.

Indeed, the ‘0.5 hr’ network still satisfies all the predictions of BQS and strongly resembles the ‘0 hr’ network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B,G</xref>). In contrast, at 1 and 2 hr after the stimulus, a marked deviation from BQS is observed. A significant number of new long loops are created, peaking at 1 hr and declining slightly by 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,E</xref>). 22 long feedback loops remain at 2 hr, but interestingly all depend on the transcriptional interaction between RUNX1 and CEBPB. The probability of creating additional long feedback loops is noticeably larger at 1 and 2 hr than in the previous networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). There is also a significant increase in the number of 4-node unbuffered motifs at 1 hr, though this does not persist in the ‘2 hr’ GRN.

Moreover, evidence of evolutionary pressures acting primarily on the topology of biological networks has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cross et al., 2011</xref>). The biological principles and selective pressures underpinning the emergence of these characteristics are an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosenfeld and Alon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tyson and Novák, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) and the identification of general principles is of pivotal importance for the progression of our understanding. By hypothesizing that GRNs must retain stability under a wide variety of circumstances, and so display Qualitative Stability, we provide a novel, simple and powerful explanation for numerous new and previously observed features of GRNs at different scales. We show that the GRNs of six different organisms display a remarkable lack of long feedback loops, which makes them Qualitatively Stable. This means that perturbations in the strength of any individual interaction—the extent to which a TF activates one of its target genes—will not disturb the state of the network. Thus, GRNs are robust to a very wide range of perturbations. Indeed, the selective pressure for Qualitative Stability appears to be so strong that GRNs are heavily buffered to retain this property under the random addition of new network connections, a property we term Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS). BQS is revealed in numerous different features of GRNs: the lack of long incomplete feedback loops, the high proportion of unregulated TFs, the lack of TFs that are both highly regulated and highly regulating, and the preponderance of buffered over unbuffered motifs. As well as providing stability to immediate disturbances (such as insults that cause a TF to regulate a promoter that it does not normally interact with), BQS also provides robustness to genetic changes that occur as a consequence of sexual recombination of alleles and to mutations that occur over evolutionary time. BQS therefore enhances the evolvability of GRNs, allowing them to function reproducibly in different genetic and environmental contexts. It is worth noting that the scarcity of feedback loops in <italic>E. coli</italic> has been remarked before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>), but the selective pressures underpinning this fact were not explored.</p><p>It is important to consider whether the potential under-sampling of GRNs (i.e., false negatives) and the inherent noise in data generation lead to an underestimation of the true link density in the networks, thus jeopardising the strength of our conclusions that networks satisfy BQS. However, defects in the GRN data are very unlikely to undermine our conclusions, for various reasons. First, as we have clearly shown, random networks with the same link density as the real GRNs do not satisfy BQS, whereas the real GRNs do. Second, as illustrated thoroughly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–X</xref>, the compliance of real GRNs to BQS is essentially preserved when the rates of false positives and negatives are varied in the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GRN datasets. Third, the non-cancer (GM12878) and cancer (K562) cell lines show very different BQS properties, despite having similar link densities. Since the data from both sets of cells were derived under similar conditions and with the same algorithmic tools, they would presumably have similar rates of false positives and negatives. A similar comparison can also be made between the stimulated and unstimulated dendritic cells.</p><p>Robustness is a key feature of cellular behaviour, but an appropriate response time is also critical. Changes in the transcriptional profile of cells are generally slow, requiring from tens of minutes to hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alon, 2006</xref>). As a consequence, it may be unhelpful for a cell to propagate transcriptionally a signal in a long cascade, and this might also explain the limited number of long incomplete feedback loops observed. While it is likely that timing effects play a role in the organization of GRNs, there are several reasons for believing that robustness is still fundamental. First of all, certain transcriptional changes take place over very long time scales, indicating that a fast response time is not always necessary. Moreover, each TF in a transcriptional cascade is potentially post-transcriptionally controlled (e.g., from signalling pathways), and therefore the signal need not proceed linearly from the top to the bottom of the pathway, but instead genes at the bottom of a cascade could be activated independently. Additionally, it should be remembered that BQS still allows a long pathway (for example A-B-C-D-E) to have a short link between the start and end (A–E in this example); when we enumerated incomplete feedback loops we considered all the possible transcriptional paths through the network, whilst a fast transcriptional propagation may only involve the shortest path. Finally, we note that several key features of BQS that we observe in GRNs, including the prevalence of buffered 3- and 4-node motifs, the lack of transcriptional hubs with similar numbers of incoming and outgoing links, and the high prevalence of unregulated TFs are independent of signaling pathway length.</p><p>While our analysis suggests multiple possible connections between the breaking of BQS and the cancerous state of the K562 cell line, it is worth pointing out that K562 was derived from a stem cell population. This raises the possibility that some amount of the breaking of BQS observed may be connected with the K562 cell line's original stemness. Further experimentation on the robustness of other cell lines will allow to assess the aetiology of the lack of robustness observed, and whether the loss of BQS is associated to stem-like properties of cells.</p><p>Although BQS has been developed here in the context of GRNs, it provides general principles that can be used to analyse or manipulate robustness in any regulatory system, biological or otherwise. These principles are summarised by five simple rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>): 1. Avoid long feedback loops to minimize instability arising from perturbations in network interactions (the basic principle of Qualitative Stability); 2. Favour constitutive (unregulated) nodes to reduce the potential number of loops; 3. Avoid long paths to minimize the number of ‘incomplete feedback loops’ and the emergence of instability due to addition of new network connections; 4. Favour buffered motifs over unbuffered motifs to reduce the potential number of loops; 5. Avoid centralized control hubs with a large number of both regulatory and regulating connections to reduce potential instability (necessitating the use of distributed control). These rules can be used to devise highly stable networks that minimize the ‘hyper-risk’ inherent in global networks that are difficult to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helbing, 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.037</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>BQS Rules.</title><p>BQS provides five general design principles applicable to any regulatory system.

As we have demonstrated here, BQS demands that GRNs are free of long feedback loops, even under the addition of new links. The question remains, to what extent feedback operates in post-transcriptional regulation rather than the purely transcriptional networks we have examined here. It was not possible for us to perform a similar analysis of post-transcriptional regulation because strongly validated system-wide data describing such interactions are not currently available. However, the biological literature provides some clues. Motif analysis of post-transcriptional networks reveals that BQS-compliant feedforward loops are overrepresented, while BQS-breaking feedback loops are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">The modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joshi et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that Qualitative Stability may still be an important principle governing the topology of these networks. Additionally, it has been noted that stable motifs are more common than unstable ones even in post-transcriptional signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milo et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting again a role for Qualitative Stability in these networks. Nevertheless, the existence of feedback loops in post-transcriptional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris and Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsang et al., 2007</xref>) supports the idea that the severe constraints of BQS are ‘loosened’ to allow more responsive dynamic functionalities in post-transcriptional regulation. Consistent with these expectations, short feedback loops involving two or three genes appear to be present in some developmentally regulated gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peter et al., 2012</xref>). This raises the hypothesis that the different levels of gene regulation (transcriptional vs post-transcriptional) provide a way of segregating control modules with different robustness properties.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for active transcriptional response</title><p>The robustness provided by BQS allows a transcriptional network to filter out internal or external disturbances. Such robustness is desirable under normal conditions, but can be detrimental during a transcriptional response that requires effective and fast changes in the set of transcribed genes. Consistent with this idea, our analysis indicates that a certain level of instability builds up during a response to a stimulus that produces a transcriptional response. Quite remarkably our results also suggest that two hours after such a stimulus the GRNs considered are ‘on the verge of stability’, as the deactivation of just one transcriptional interaction will make the network robust according to the BQS rules. It is worth pointing out, however, that each cell in a population is responding to a stimulus independently and potentially at a different pace. Therefore, the apparent post-stimulus instability observed may be the result of sampling transcriptional occupancy of cells at different stages of the transcriptional response. Future experimentation focused on the robustness property of cells and single cell GRN reconstruction will likely clarify which interpretation is correct.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for evolvability and drug design</title><p>The molecular bases of evolutionary innovations are complex and poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wagner, 2011</xref>).

This might provide <italic>controlled instability</italic> allowing bacteria to explore new gene expression levels in response to environmental stresses, thus achieving a short-term evolutionary advantage. While other mechanisms are likely to be in play to achieve longer-term adaptations, therapeutic targeting of unstable motifs may provide a novel systems approach to drug discovery.</p><p>The deviation of the human cancer cell line K562 from BQS is also very striking. This deviation allows a cancer cell, in principle, to readily change its phenotype in response to internal or external stresses, so it can explore different phenotypic states, which might help its proliferation in otherwise challenging tissue environments, or even to survive drug treatment. Nevertheless, the cancer cell line still possesses a degree of BQS far greater than that observed in a random network. This is consistent with the role of the unstable motifs in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and supports the idea that a small breakdown of BQS might be a hallmark of recent or rapid selection pressure. We note that single-cell experiments report large changes in protein abundance occurring in individual cancer cells after drug treatment, consistent with our theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that BQS adds a powerful new weapon to the arsenal of network medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barabasi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Noh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pe’er and Hacohen, 2011</xref>). The discovery that the transcriptional interactions most critically involved in the formation of long feedback loops in the cancer cell line K562 are also present in the longest incomplete feedback loops in the non-cancer cell line GM12878 may provide clues to mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression. Our theory suggests that random perturbations to the GRN of normal cells will probably leave its stability unchanged. Destabilization of the GRN is likely to involve those genes that are on the edge of stability, for example genes participating in long incomplete loops. It is striking that the two gene families with the highest <italic>destabilization potential</italic> in the non-cancer cell line (JUN and FOSL) are actually found to be the two gene families with the highest <italic>destabilization role</italic> in the cancer cell line. These observations are consistent with the notion of cancer as a ‘systems disease’ that involves changes that lead to destabilisation of the GRN. If network instability is a general feature of cancer cell GRNs, analysis of this kind can potentially be used to design new anti-cancer strategies that exploit the unique weaknesses of cells lacking BQS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conditions for Qualitative Stability of networks and its applicability to GRN</title><p>The study of stability in qualitative networks of interacting entities was introduced in the seminal work of Quirk and Ruppert in economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quirk and Ruppert, 1965</xref>). Since then, the idea has been applied to different disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">May, 1973b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tyson, 1975</xref>) and the theory has been slightly enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeffries, 1974</xref>). It has also been studied within the broader field of qualitative matrix theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maybee and Quirk, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hale et al., 1999</xref>). While the theory developed by Quirk and Ruppert is probably the most well-known tool to study Qualitative Stability, a similar formalism is provided by the work of Puccia and Levins on loop analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Puccia and Levins, 1985</xref>). The theory deals with systems at equilibrium and considers the effect of small perturbations. Stable systems are characterized by the ability to react to these perturbations by returning to their original equilibrium state. In qualitative networks, each node is associated with a quantity or concentration and the presence of an arrow from node A to node B indicates that changing the concentration of A has an effect on B. The sign of the arrow indicates whether increasing A increases (positive arrow) or decreases (negative arrow) B. The absence of an arrow indicates that increasing the concentration of A does not directly affect the concentration of B. Note that self-regulation, represented by an arrow from a note to itself, is also possible.</p><p>In its original form, the theory states four conditions for qualitative stability:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Absence of positive self-regulation</p></list-item><list-item><p>Absence of double positive or double negative two-node feedback loops</p></list-item><list-item><p>Absence of feedback loops longer that two</p></list-item><list-item><p>Invertibility of the sign matrix</p></list-item></list></p><p>Condition 1 prevents unlimited autocatalysis. Condition 2 prevents unlimited ‘collaborative autocatalysis’ (double positive) and switches (double negative), <italic>but note that positive/negative two-node feedback loops are allowed</italic>. Condition 3 is less intuitive, and disallows feedback systems that may go ‘out-of-sync’ for example as a consequence of non-linearities in the interactions. Condition 4 forbids the presence of two or more nodes that are being affected, or affect, the same nodes in the same way.</p><p>While conditions 1, 2 and 4 are very important from a theoretical point of view, they are of limited relevance to our analysis. For autocatalytic positive self-regulation, saturating effects on transcription (for example due to limiting numbers of RNA polymerases) along with protein degradation means that autocatalytic TFs will reach a stable steady-state rather than increasing to arbitrarily high values. Therefore condition 1 is of questionable relevance to GRNs. This argument of finite resources obviating positive self-regulation has also been applied to the study of Qualitative Stability in ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">May, 1973a</xref>).</p><p>GRNs breaking condition 4 have no biologically plausible incarnation. In order for this condition to be violated, two different TFs must act on the network in the same way, that is, they need to regulate each other and promote and inhibit exactly the same set of genes, as this would make the columns of the sign matrix linearly dependent and therefore the matrix non-invertible. If two TFs act in the way described, they would be biochemically indistinguishable. Due to the methodology used to derive GRNs, two such genes would be collapsed into the same node. Condition 4 is therefore trivially verified.</p><p>The case of double positive and double negative feedback loops is more complex. Under biological constraints relevant for GRNs, isolated double negative feedback loops (i.e., not connected with other feedback loops formed by two or more nodes) are unstable only to the extent that they form switches that can exist in one of two stable states. Double positive feedback loops are potentially capable of a more complex behaviour. However, when considered in isolation with negative self-regulation under constraints relevant to GRNs, they are likely to display a switch-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee and Bose, 2008</xref>). Remarkably, in both GRNs for which sign information is available these conditions are verified: in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> the only double positive feedback loop is isolated and in <italic>E. coli</italic> all non-isolated two-gene feedback loops are part of the potentially chaotic motifs discussed above, and are therefore not relevant for these particular 2-node stability arguments. Hence, the only scenario in which condition 2 potentially threatens Qualitative Stability in GRNs is a ‘daisy chain’ of linked 2-node feedback loops; in the single case where such a daisy chain is observed (in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) both 2-node feedback loops are of the positive/negative type and so result in a form compatible with Qualitative Stability. Taken together, the above considerations indicate that condition 3 is the most significant in a rigorous comparative study on the GRNs.</p><p>The introduction of a time delay into a system generally leads to an increased dimensionality. It is therefore not surprising that a delay introduced into feedback loops can lead to oscillations and instability, and this is one additional reason contributing to feedback loops containing &gt;2 nodes not being Qualitatively Stable. Gene expression is a complex multi-step process and the role of regulatory mechanisms as potential sources of delay is an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gorgoni et al., 2014</xref>). The complexity of the problem, and the difficulty in obtaining quantitative information, limit our ability to assess the role of delays on our model. A delay that is fast compared to transcriptional regulation can be ignored due to the separation of the time-scales. When this is not the case, delays are potential sources of instability, especially in the presence of feedbacks of any size. Delays may be stronger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, as transcription and translation are spatially separated. This may partially explain why the GRNs of yeast and GM12878 have a remarkably limited number of feedback loops of any size.</p><p>A final aspect of the theory is worth noting. The theory of Qualitative Stability has been developed by means of differential equations and the conditions discussed above properly apply only to deterministic autonomous systems. This results in our model being a simplification when compared to biological networks such as GRNs. It has been observed that cells limit the noise in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>), suggesting the existence of biological mechanisms that reduce the extent of stochasticity. Therefore, whilst our model is likely to be largely compatible with the biological behaviour, noise may play a role in triggering GRN reorganization in response to strong stimuli.</p><p>It also is worth stressing that while stability is generally of pivotal importance, particular situations may require a fast, rather than stable, response. Therefore, when GRNs must be able to undergo changes of state, for example during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peter et al., 2012</xref>), or must be able to respond to external stimuli, for example to mount an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciofani et al., 2012</xref>), the role of stability may be more limited.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>A brief review of available datasets and a rationale for those chosen</title><p>The reconstruction of the GRN of an organism is a challenging task, and an active field of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim and Park, 2011</xref>). Different methodologies have been developed and each of them presents advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, certain techniques, such as PCR and ChIP-Seq, are generally regarded as more reliable.</p><p>Besides the technical problems, additional complications arise from the intrinsic working of gene interactions. The GRN is dynamic and changes according to external and internal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luscombe et al., 2004</xref>). The sources of this variability are probably diverse and additional work will be needed to assess the cellular mechanisms that shape the GRN.</p><p>Moreover, the different molecular responses observed at a single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tay et al., 2010</xref>) suggest that the different stages of the cell cycle and different stress conditions may result in structurally different GRNs. Single-cell GRN reconstruction is currently beyond experimental reach, and stress is known to promote intra-population diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lopez-Maury et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, where possible, we preferred to analyse GRNs obtained under rich media growth. These conditions result in a low cellular stress and thus are more likely to promote homogeneity in transcriptional response. This homogeneity minimizes the errors in GRN reconstruction due to <italic>superpositions</italic> of possibly different GRNs.</p><p>No GRN currently available should be expected to be a completely faithful representation of the real interactions among the genes. However, it is reasonable to assume that networks obtained with direct biological methodologies under controlled conditions are not biased towards certain topological features, and therefore provide a good representation of the topology of the real GRN.</p><p>Given these premises, it is not surprising that different GRNs are available in the literature for the same organism, and a choice had to be made to determine the datasets better suited for our analysis. We tried to select high quality datasets characterized by a statistical assessment of the interactions, a low rate of false positives, and public availability of the data.</p><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RegulonDB dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salgado et al., 2012</xref>) is probably the most validated GRN available in the literature. This dataset is regularly updated to incorporate new data, and is consistently used as a basis for theoretical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alm and Arkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milo et al., 2004</xref>). In its current state the dataset does not report the environmental conditions associated with each interaction. Therefore, it is likely that under any specific conditions only a subset of the interactions is active.</p><p>Recently, the GRNs of two other prokaryotes have been published: <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galan-Vasquez et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanz et al., 2011</xref>). Since these organisms are less well studied than <italic>E. coli</italic>, their GRNs should be expected to be less complete.</p><p>Data on human GRNs are limited and the recent work by the ENCODE consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>) provided a unique opportunity to compare the GRNs of a non-cancerous and a cancerous cell line, studied under similar experimental conditions. Moreover, the methodology used to construct these networks (ChIP-Seq) and the carefully engineered protocol suggest a high degree of biological reality.</p><p>The situation for yeast is more complex.

Different constraints can be built into a simulation to obtain different types of random networks. To assess the role of different types of randomness on the properties of Qualitative Stability, we generated different types of random networks with different constraints using a variable number of characteristics of the <italic>E. coli</italic> network discussed in the main article.</p><p>We focused our attention on four characteristics of the real networks:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The number of genes (the number of vertices of the random network)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of interactions among the genes (the number of edges of the random network)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of transcription factors (the number of vertices allowing an out-degree larger than zero)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The absence of isolated genes (the absence of non-connected vertices)</p></list-item></list></p><p>Enforcing the number of vertices and edges of random graph is a common feature of random graphs: these random graphs are called Erdős–Rényi random graphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bollobás, 2001</xref>). However, it is less common in the literature to enforce additional characteristics. We stress that <italic>including additional constraints results in a network that is less ‘random’</italic>.</p><p>The types of random networks that we considered are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The algorithms used to generate the different types of random networks have been implemented in R and are available as Source code. The functions used are listed by <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Note that TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V1 and TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V2 use different algorithms to generate the networks:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V1 generates an initial random network constructed by connecting each gene to one TF (selected at random).

At this point, if the number of edges used is less than the number required, edges are added at random until the expected number of edges is reached. Alternatively, if the number of edges is more than the number required, edges are removed at random, in such a way as not to create isolated genes, until the expected number of edges is reached.</p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.039</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Properties of the different random models used</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02863.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02863.039</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Model name</th><th># of genes</th><th># of interactions</th><th># of TFs</th><th>Isolated genes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TF<sup>Variable</sup>IG<sup>Allowed</sup></td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Variable</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Allowed</sup></td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Variable</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup></td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Variable</td><td>Not allowed</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V1</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Not allowed</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V2</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Fixed</td><td>Not allowed</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.040</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Functions used to produce the different random networks</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02863.040">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02863.040</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Model name</th><th>Function used</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TF<sup>Variable</sup>IG<sup>Allowed</sup></td><td>GenerateRandomNetwork.IG.Allowed()</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Allowed</sup></td><td>GenerateRandomNetwork.IG.Allowed()</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Variable</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup></td><td>GenerateRandomNetwork.IG.NotAllowed.V1()</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V1</td><td>GenerateRandomNetwork.IG.NotAllowed.V1()</td></tr><tr><td>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V2</td><td>GenerateRandomNetwork.IG.NotAllowed.V2()</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>TF<sup>Fixed</sup>IG<sup>Not Allowed</sup>V1 should be expected to be less biased, but is computationally extremely intensive, as a large number of edges usually needs to be removed.

As indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A–L</xref>, the conclusions of the main text remain valid under all the conditions considered.</p><p>In our analysis we focused on a minimal number of constraints, in such a way to be able to assess the selective pressure of robustness at all scales. A detailed analysis of the adherence to BQS of different types of random networks is beyond the scope of this article and will be the subject of future investigations. However, given the existence of widely used more advanced models, it is important to justify our choice.</p><p>BQS provides predictions on GRNs at many scales, including degree distribution and motifs abundance, and the clear compliance of GRNs to such predictions indicates that robustness has left striking and detectable signatures. Therefore, using a method designed to preserve features such as degree distribution is likely to result in a network carrying the seed of robustness. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of the degree-preserving model commonly used in motif analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milo et al., 2002</xref>) for the <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN. This model, implemented by the function ‘rewire’ of igraph, reshuffles the original network in such a way to completely preserve the original in-degree and out-degree <italic>for each single node</italic>. Our results (not shown) indicate that feedback loops are relatively uncommon in degree-preserving random networks, regardless of the number of rounds of rewiring. However, incomplete feedback loops were more abundant and longer when compared to the real GRNs, even though to a lesser extent than purely random networks. Finally, the distributions of 3- and 4-node motifs were perturbed in such a way as to decrease the number of buffered motifs and to increase the number of unbuffered ones. However, the degree-preserving algorithm was unable to generate networks displaying an equal number of the 3- and 4-node motifs for the classes highlighted in the article, in stinking difference from a purely random model, even after 70,000 rounds of rewiring. Taken together, these observations support the idea that GRNs carry a strong signature of BQS and that random models constrained to be similar to GRNs will inherit, at least in part, many features of BQS. Our results also support the idea that purely random models may be the ideal null models to explore and highlight pervasive features of networks.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Paul Campbell and Alessandro de Moura for helping to initiate this project.

The number of long feedback loops created and the length of the longest feedback loops are also indicated. Supplementary file 1 lists all the 48 edge insertions that result in the creation of long feedback loops when inserted in the GM12878 GRN. Note the high participation of JUNB and BATF as sources and of FOSL1/2 as targets. Three of these destabilizing interactions are actually observed in the K562 cancer cell line: from JUNB to BCLAF1, from BATF to EGR1, and from JUNB to EGR1. These interactions are highlighted in a bold character. The GRN of the GM12878 cell line contains 67 TFs and 59 interactions among them. Since in a network with 67 nodes there are 67*(67-1) = 4422 possible directed links with different source and targets, 4422-59 = 4362 additional regulations can be inserted between the TFs in the GM12878 GRN. Four regulatory connections between TFs are observed both in GM12878 and in K562: BCLAF1–&gt; BHLHE40, CTCFL–&gt; BHLHE40, EGR1–&gt; JUNB, FOSL1–&gt; JUNB. Of all the potential additional regulatory connections among the TFs of the GM12878 cell line, 56 are observed in the K562. Therefore, the likelihood of observing in K562 one of the 4362 potential regulations of GM12878 is 56/4362 ≈ 0.013. The likelihood of observing in K562 one of the potentially destabilising regulations of GM12878 is 3/48 = 0.062. Finally, two of the potentially destabilising interactions of the GM12878 have a particularly strong destabilization potential: an additional transcriptional regulation from JUNB to FOSL2 will create five long feedback loops and an additional transcriptional regulation from JUNB to E2F1 will create 3. Once again, our analysis highlights genes that may play a key role in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kouzarides and Ziff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

This is also critical with respect to the influence of time delays. In this context, one needs to know how the size of the GRN in this work compares with that in other studies.</p><p>Another critical aspect of the work is the comparison to randomized networks. The naive randomization used has been shown to yield networks that are fundamentally different from real networks. Why did you not use a degree-preserving model? The Alon lab has already reported on the apparent lack of cycles in the GRN of E. coli, but found it to be non-significant when using degree-preserving randomization (Shen-Orr et al., Nature Genet. 31:64, 2002).</p><p>Similarly, while three stability rules are mentioned, it seems that only one is tested, and another one, that the sign matrix should be invertible, is not considered. In addition, it should be shown why this one property is sufficient for robustness. Along these lines, stability is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for robustness. This should be discussed as well.</p><p>In general, the reviewers found the work in places difficult to follow; it is recommended to show at least one large GRN in E. coli in some detail, and explain how exactly you determine that there are at most three links in any loop.</p><p>Some aspects of cellular physiology certainly require destabilizing motifs (e.g. oscillations, switches). Have you by any chance found physiologically significant destabilizing motifs?</p><p>Finally, please correct the figures about numbers of IFLs (any IFL of size k should also be an IFL of size k-1), or clarify the definition of an IFL.</p><p>Comments in full:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The authors analyze GRNs for stability using rules from the theory of qualitative stability, particularly verifying that they do not contain directed cycles of length &gt;= 3 and derivatives of this property. They conclude that GRNs under normal conditions are designed for stability.</p><p>The authors mention three stability rules, however they test only one (the third) and seem to omit a fourth one (the sign matrix should be invertible – see e.g. the May 1973 ref). The authors should justify the omission and better argue for not testing the other two. Their arguments about further (post-transcription) forces beyond regulation are not convincing as they would also imply that testing for the third rule (no cycles with &gt;= 3 vertices) ignores such post-transcriptional effects (in fact Shen Orr et al justify the lack of cycles in this way exactly in their Nature Genet 31:64, 2002 paper). Not less important would be to prove why the network could be robust (under the qualitative stability theory) if only this one property is satisfied.</p><p>The observation that GRNs contain very few long paths underlies many of the results in this paper. Could this property follow from the observation in the Luscombe et al. ref. that most regulatory interactions are involved in “exogenous” conditions in which the transcriptional response should be fast and the underlying paths are very short?</p><p>A critical aspect of the manuscript is the comparison to randomized networks. The authors use a naive randomization (ER) which has been shown to yield networks that are fundamentally different from real networks. Instead I recommend the authors use the more-or-less standard degree-preserving model as e.g. used in the publications of the Alon lab. Notably (see also above) the Alon lab has already reported on the lack of cycles in the GRN of E. Coli, but found it to be non-significant when using the degree-preserving randomization (Shen-Orr et al., Nature Genet. 31:64, 2002).</p><p>Regarding the networks themselves <italic>–</italic> no details are given about their sizes <italic>–</italic> could it be that the larger the network the more it deviates from the stability criterion just by mere chance (and regardless of biological considerations)?</p><p>There is a rich literature on network motifs and the results of this paper should be contrasted to it, clarifying what are the new observations here and how they relate to previous ones. For example, the authors claim to find no cycles in the yeast GRN. However, the Luscombe et al. paper also studied this network and reports on a cell-cycle related cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) where the TFs of each phase regulate the subsequent one. Another example is the Shen-Orr paper mentioned above.</p><p>There seems to be a problem with counting IFLs in random networks as an IFL of size k is also an IFL of size 2...k-1, hence the bars should decrease in height as happens for real networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The authors should backup their claim about constitutively expressed TFs with gene expression data showing that this is the case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>First, let me say that I want <italic>eLife</italic> to publish this paper ultimately. It is one of the few papers that make a serious physics-based approach to a fundamental biological problem, the stability of biological networks, I think <italic>eLife</italic>, if it is supposed to represent a new approach to biology, needs these kinds of papers. You should accept it.</p><p>That said, I also do appreciate that it is essential that physics-based approaches to biology problems have to reach out to biologists. Although I am an experimental physicist doing biological problems, I found this paper a tough read and I think the authors could make more of an effort to make this accessible to both biologists and physicists.</p><p>In the course of teaching a grad level course on biological physicist I deliberately went off the beaten path to look at areas that are not normally covered by biological physics textbooks but are actually very important to biology. The subject of this paper, gene regulatory networks and their fundamental stability, is something I dipped into, before I had seen this MS. I don't think the present MS. really does justice to the already quite extensive literature out there, very physics based, on GRN and this needs to be addressed at the outset. The authors might claim too much credit for what they have discovered. I found that the review in Nature Genetics by Albert-László Barabási and Zoltán N. Oltvai “Network Biology: Understanding the cell’s functional Organization” to be an excellent introduction and to have it characterized as “predominantly descriptive, rather than predictive” to be rather harsh. Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS) may be an interesting subject (since it is qualitative and not quantitative really I could lump it into the “predominantly descriptive” category as well). I think more credit has to be given to the ideas of scale-free networks, hierarchical architecture and hub connectivity.</p><p>Next, the results here somewhat appear by magic from some huge (I guess huge) computer code which I don't think the authors really explain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is really makes quite remarkable claims, saying that real biological networks have far-far fewer feed-back loops than a randomly generated graph. But when I look at the biological networks that I am familiar with, such as the SOS network in E. coli, an organism which is one of the test cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it is by no means obvious to me that there are just 3 at most links to that network: it is quite complicated. We looked at some other networks, and again we found many links to a loop. Large loops actually seem common to the naive eye.</p><p>So, it would be extraordinarily useful if the authors slowed down a bit and showed one large GRN in <italic>E. coli</italic> in some detail, and explain how exactly they determine that there are under 3 links to the loop! I am not sure that the SOS response qualifies as a GRN, but I am curious how this works out, and I think that giving a test example in some detail would help what seems to be a powerful idea which seems to be actually new works out in practice.</p><p>It would be great if BQS could be applied to cancer cells, as the authors’ claim. But they are frank to admit that the data isn't really there. But I don't think you need analysis of ALL the GRNs, I think that is hopeless. Certainly a critical stress-response like p53 must have a huge data set in various cells. Why not examine that and tell us if it actually is compromised for stability via BQS in cancer cells? And show us how the analysis is done, so we can try to repeat it?</p><p>In sum, a fascinating and potentially very important paper, but maybe a bit too boastful, and not very clear to the pedestrian, so that may really blunt it's impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript which analyses the robustness and the evolvability of Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRN) in bacteria, yeast and human cells including a transformed one. The authors use the theory of qualitative stability analysis developed originally in economics. The theory summarized briefly in the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript provides necessary conditions for stability of a system of interacting components based on the sign of the elements in the 'community matrix'. Briefly, the system is stable against perturbations if it lacks positive, double-negative and long feedback loops. By comparative and statistical analysis of cellular and random networks, the authors show that GRN's seem to avoid the destabilizing network motifs. The only exception to this rule is the analysed transformed cell line. The paper is well written and I recommend it for publication but I would like to hear the comments of the authors for the following points:</p><p>1) The authors’ argument somehow implies that stability equals robustness. I think that stability is a necessary requirement for robustness but not sufficient. After perturbation the system might move to a completely different state even if it is stable. It would be useful to comment on this issue.</p><p>2) The theory of qualitative stability analysis is developed for autonomous systems. The cellular GRN has characteristic time-delays because of transcription and translation. It is true that in bacteria these two processes are overlapping but in eukaryotes the time-delay could be very significant. There is a short note about time-delay in the manuscript, but it would be useful to expand how it could influence these results.</p><p>3) Certain aspects of cellular physiology certainly require destabilizing motifs (e.g. oscillations, switches). I wonder whether the algorithm used by the authors has found any physiologically significant destabilizing motif</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02863.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Specifically, a major condition for ultimately accepting the work would be to demonstrate that the observation of GRNs in the current setup containing very few long paths does not simply follow from the observation in the Luscombe et al. reference, that most regulatory interactions in response to a change in “exogenous” conditions will be fast and the underlying paths thus very short.

The naive randomization used has been shown to yield networks that are fundamentally different from real networks. Why did you not use a degree-preserving model? The Alon lab has already reported on the apparent lack of cycles in the GRN of E. coli, but found it to be non-significant when using degree-preserving randomization (Shen-Orr et al., Nature Genet. 31:64, 2002)</italic>.</p><p><italic>Similarly, while three stability rules are mentioned, it seems that only one is tested, and another one, that the sign matrix should be invertible, is not considered. In addition, it should be shown why this one property is sufficient for robustness. Along these lines, stability is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for robustness. This should be discussed as well</italic>.</p><p><italic>In general, the reviewers found the work in places difficult to follow; it is recommended to show at least one large GRN in E. coli in some detail, and explain how exactly you determine that there are at most three links in any loop</italic>.</p><p><italic>Some aspects of cellular physiology certainly require destabilizing motifs (e.g</italic>. <italic>oscillations, switches). Have you by any chance found physiologically significant destabilizing motifs?</italic></p><p><italic>Finally, please correct the figures about numbers of IFLs (any IFL of size k should also be an IFL of size k-1), or clarify the definition of an IFL</italic>.</p><p>The first point was to discuss whether the absence of loops feedback does not simply follow from the need for regulatory interactions to be fast and thus the underlying paths to be very short. Although we agree that this may be an additional selection pressure reducing the number of long loops, we think it is unlikely to be the primary explanation, for various reasons. First of all, certain transcriptional changes take place over very long time scales, indicating that a fast response time is not always necessary. Moreover, each transcription factor of a transcriptional cascade is potentially post-transcriptionally controlled (e.g. from signalling pathways), and therefore the signal need not proceed linearly from the top to the bottom of the cascade, but instead genes at the bottom of a cascade could be activated independently. Additionally, it should be remembered that BQS still allows a long pathway (for example A-B-C-D-E) to have a short link between the start and end (A-E in this example); when we enumerated incomplete feedback loops we considered all the possible transcriptional paths through the network, whilst a fast transcriptional propagation may only involve the shortest paths. Finally, we note that several key features of BQS that we observe in GRNs, including the prevalence of buffered stable 3- and 4-node motifs, the lack of transcriptional hubs with similar numbers of incoming and outgoing links, and the high prevalence of unregulated TFs are independent of signal pathway length. We added a paragraph to the Discussion (new paragraph 3) explaining this point. We also added a paragraph in the “Condition for Qualitative Stability of networks and its application to GRN” subsection of Materials and methods (new paragraph 9) discussing the possible effect of time delays.</p><p>With respect to the second point, i.e. to clarify why we decided not to use a degree-preserving model, we have included two new paragraphs to the end of the subsection “Effect of different constraints on the generation of random networks” in Materials and methods to better justify the null model used and to clarify the connections between BQS and previous works on degree-preserving models. Since a detailed analysis would be too extensive for an article focused on robustness, we decided to not to include a graphical representation of our results, but we can provide such a representation to the editors and reviewer if desired. As discussed therein, a degree-preserving model is strongly constrained by the original network considered and, in the case of GRNs, is likely to result in a network carrying the seed of robustness. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of the degree preserving model commonly used in motif analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milo et al., 2002</xref>) for the <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN. This model reshuffles the original network in such a way to completely preserve the original in-degree and out-degree <italic>for each single node</italic>. Our results (not shown) indicate that feedback loops are relatively uncommon in degree preserving random networks, regardless of the number of rounds of rewiring. However, incomplete feedback loops were more abundant and longer when compared to the real GRNs, even though to a lesser extent than purely random networks. Finally, the distributions of 3- and 4-node motifs were perturbed in such a way as to decrease the number of buffered motifs and to increase the number of unbuffered ones. However, even after 70,000 rounds of rewiring, the degree-preserving algorithm was unable to generate networks displaying an equal number of the 3- or 4-nodes motifs for the classes highlighted in the article, in striking difference from a purely random model. Taken together, these observations support the idea that GRNs carry a strong signature of BQS and that randomised models seeded by the real GRNs, and constrained to be very similar to GRNs will inherit, at least in part, many features of BQS. Our results also support the idea that purely random models may be the ideal null models to explore pervasive features of networks and that when the property under examination is strongly embedded into the system the use of highly constrained models may be disadvantageous. As we have demonstrated throughout our article, by comparison to random networks and by the analysis of the degrees of single TFs, robustness is strongly embedded in GRNs, since not only they are practically free from long feedback loops, but they are also configured in such a way that this property is preserved under quite extensive perturbation of their topology.</p><p>The third point was to clarify why the absence of long loops is the single fundamental property for robustness out of the 4 rules for Qualitative Stability. To address this we have expanded the explanation presented in the “Conditions for Stability for networks and its applicability to GRN” subsection of Materials and methods. The rule requiring invertibility of the sign matrix is not a relevant feature due to its implication of biochemical identity. The rule prohibiting autocatalytic positive self-regulation is not relevant to systems with finite resources such as GRNs, since saturating effects on transcription (for example due to limiting numbers of RNA polymerases) along with protein degradation means that autocatalytic TFs will reach a stable steady-state rather than increasing to arbitrarily high values. This argument of finite resources obviating positive self-regulation has also been applied to the study of Qualitative Stability by May in ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">May, 1973a</xref>). The rule requiring the absence of double positive and double negative feedback loops requires more attention. Under biological constraints relevant for GRNs, isolated (i.e. not connected with other feedback loops formed by two or more nodes) double negative feedback loops are unstable only to the extent that they form switches that can exist in one of two stable states. Double positive feedback loops are potentially capable of a more complex behaviour. However, when considered in isolation with negative self-regulation, they generally display a switch-like behaviour. Remarkably, in both GRNs for which sign information is available these conditions are verified: in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> the only double positive feedback loop is isolated and in <italic>E. coli</italic> all non-isolated two-gene feedback loops are part of the potentially chaotic motifs discussed above, and are therefore not relevant to this particular stability arguments. Therefore the only scenario in which condition 2) potentially threatens Qualitative Stability in GRNs is a ‘daisy chain’ of linked 2-node feedback loops; in the single case where such a daisy chain is observed (in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) both 2-node feedback loops are of the positive/negative type and so are compatible with Qualitative Stability. Since this analysis further supports the concept of BQS in GRNs, we have added a more extensive discussion on 2-node motifs to the subsection “BQS highlights critical network modules” in Results. We also agree that stability is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for robustness. We thank the reviewer and editors for pointing this out and have added a new paragraph in the Introduction to clarify this point (new paragraph 3).</p><p>The fourth point was to make the arguments easier to follow and to include one large GRN. We have amended the text to make our reasoning as transparent and simple as possible, which has also been helped by responding to the reviewers’ other comments. We have included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which shows the full GRN of <italic>E. coli</italic>. We also added the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref> which show all the transcriptional interactions between TFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the human cell lines, with the interaction forming long feedback loops highlighted in red. We also included the code of the R function used to determine the number of feedback loops found in a network in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary File 1</xref>.</p><p>The fifth point was whether we have found physiologically significant motifs, which are connected with aspects of cellular physiology that require destabilization (e.g. oscillations, switches). Such motifs are observed and discussed throughout the manuscript. In our analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> we highlighted how unstable motifs with a peculiar structure are connected with stress responses (subsection “BQS highlights critical network modules” of Results) and discussed the possible implications of this discovery (subsection “Implication for evolvability and drug design” of Discussion). Moreover, in analyzing dendritic cells responding to a pathogen (subsection “BQS and transcriptional response” of Results), we see that a potentially stable network moves into a less stable configuration. Although we see the appearance of some interesting potentially unstable motifs in this response, the data set is too small to make any confident prediction about them. In the updated “Conditions for Qualitative Stability” subsection of Materials and methods we also detail more extensively the possible sources of switches (new paragraph 5 and 6) and highlight how post-transcriptional control may contribute to instability (new paragraph 8). It is our plan to further investigate the sources of instability in GRN, but this will require a more dynamic approach and will be the subject of future work.</p><p>The sixth point concerned the number of incomplete feedback loops and their definition. We want to clarify that the figures are correct. The distribution of incomplete feedback loops is tightly interlocked with the topology of the network under consideration and is monotonically decreasing only for specific network topologies. The methodology used to derive the number of incomplete feedback loops is detailed in the “Derivation of the networks and statistical analysis” subsection of the Materials and methods. However, we appreciate that such a concept leads to counter-intuitive results when applied to complex network topologies. Therefore, to better illustrate how the number of incomplete feedback loops depends on the topology of the network under consideration, we included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3–figure supplement 5</xref>, which shows how three networks, labeled A, B and C, with the same number of nodes and edges, but with different topologies, have different distributions of incomplete feedback loops. In particular, the figure highlights how the number of incomplete feedback loops of length 3 can be smaller (A), equal (B), or larger (C) than the number of incomplete feedback loops of length 2. We also included an additional sentence in “Derivation of the network and statistical analysis” subsection of the Materials and Methods to highlight how the results on the distribution of incomplete feedback loops must be treated with particular care.</p><p><italic>Comments in full</italic>:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors analyze GRNs for stability using rules from the theory of qualitative stability, particularly verifying that they do not contain directed cycles of length &gt;= 3 and derivatives of this property. They conclude that GRNs under normal conditions are designed for stability</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors mention three stability rules, however they test only one (the third) and seem to omit a fourth one (the sign matrix should be invertible – see e.g. the May 1973 ref). The authors should justify the omission and better argue for not testing the other two</italic>.</p><p>As illustrated above, in response to the reviewer’s question we have revised and strengthened our arguments in the “Conditions for Stability for networks and its applicability to GRN” subsection of Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>Their arguments about further (post-transcription) forces beyond regulation are not convincing as they would also imply that testing for the third rule (no cycles with &gt;= 3 vertices) ignores such post-transcriptional effects (in fact Shen Orr et al justify the lack of cycles in this way exactly in their Nature Genet 31:64, 2002 paper). Not less important would be to prove why the network could be robust (under the qualitative stability theory) if only this one property is satisfied</italic>.</p><p>As we mention, preliminary analysis of post-transcriptional networks suggests that long loops are under-represented but are not absent in the way they are with GRNs. We also subscribe to the idea suggested in Shen-Orr et al. about the separation of timescales for transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks and we suspect that this represents a fundamental difference between the way that transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks are regulated. Our analysis of mouse dendritic cells also suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms are employed by the cells to introduce transient instabilities that would speed up the response of the cell. We would also like to point out that for similar reasons as described in Shen-Orr et al. the motif distributions highlighted would be preserved under moderate augmentation of the network by post-transcriptional modifications. Additionally, due to the nature of the randomization process used, the results presented in Shen-Orr et al. are compatible with a network configured to strongly limit the creation of long feedback loops even when as much as 25% of the network is perturbed. Additionally, while we agree that in the general case all the rules of Qualitative Stability must be considered, as discussed in the Materials and methods section, the absence of long feedback loops appears to be the most relevant for GRNs. In future, we would like to analyse the extent that</p><p>BQS applies to post-transcriptional networks, but this has to be the subject of another paper.</p><p><italic>The observation that GRNs contain very few long paths underlies many of the results in this paper</italic>. <italic>Could this property follow from the observation in the Luscombe et al. ref. that most regulatory interactions are involved in “exogenous” conditions in which the transcriptional response should be fast and the underlying paths are very short?</italic></p><p>This is an interesting alternative (or possibly complementary) explanation for some of the features predicted from our BQS model. As discussed above, we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion (new paragraph 3) to consider this point.</p><p><italic>A critical aspect of the manuscript is the comparison to randomized networks. The authors use a naive randomization (ER) which has been shown to yield networks that are fundamentally different from real networks. Instead I recommend the authors use the more-or-less standard degree-preserving model as e.g. used in the publications of the Alon lab. Notably (see also above) the Alon lab has already reported on the lack of cycles in the GRN of E. Coli, but found it to be non-significant when using the degree-preserving randomization (Shen-Orr et al., Nature Genet. 31:64, 2002)</italic>.</p><p>We performed degree-preserving analysis as requested by the reviewer and report the results in the last paragraph of Materials and methods. Our results (not shown, but which we can provide to the reviewer if desired) have been described above. Additionally, we would like to stress the even though the lack of long feedback loops was observed previously, to our knowledge, this observation has never been connected to the robustness properties of the networks, and has not led to a uniform treatment of network topology.</p><p><italic>Regarding the networks themselves – no details are given about their sizes – could it be that the larger the network the more it deviates from the stability criterion just by mere chance (and regardless of biological considerations)</italic>?</p><p>We have added a table to Materials and methods to provide the information requested. There is no evidence to suggest that larger networks show an increased instability; if anything it is the other way around as the larger networks are slightly less dense.</p><p><italic>There is a rich literature on network motifs and the results of this paper should be contrasted to it, clarifying what are the new observations here and how they relate to previous ones. For example, the authors claim to find no cycles in the yeast GRN. However, the Luscombe et al. paper also studied this network and reports on a cell-cycle related cycle (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) where the TFs of each phase regulate the subsequent one. Another example is the Shen-Orr paper mentioned above</italic>.</p><p>The results of the analysis of the GRN derived by Luscombe et al. is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>. As highlighted in the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, Luscombe et al. generated their GRN by combining information derived from different methodologies and experimental conditions. While we fully appreciate the importance of Luscombe et al. in shedding light on the changes associated with different transcriptional responses, as shown by the Garber et al. data discussed in our paper, the GRN is reorganized in response to stimuli. Therefore, the GRN derived by Luscombe et al. is likely to be a superimposition of the GRNs active under different conditions. This suggests a perceivable level of false positives. Consistent with this idea, the loop structure observed in Luscombe et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1D</xref>) is very similar to the loop structure of Harbison et al. with a p-val threshold of 3*10^-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplements 3J</xref>), and, as remarked by Lee et al. such a threshold is associated with a moderately high level of false positives. Additionally, while long feedback loops are present in the GRN derived by Luscombe et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1D</xref>), the BQS-supported motif distribution is still observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplements 2I and 2J</xref>), consistent with a noisy GRN following BQS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, such penetrance of long feedback loops is observed neither in the Lee et. al. dataset, from which the Luscombe et al. dataset has been derived, nor in Harbison et al., which is the most recent ChIP-Seq dataset derived. We have also added a new sentence to the Discussion to highlight how Shen-Orr et al. reports that no feedback loops are observed in the GRN studied, consistent with our observations.</p><p><italic>There seems to be a problem with counting IFLs in random networks as an IFL of size k is also an IFL of size 2...k-1, hence the bars should decrease in height as happens for real networks (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>Due to the methodology used (sub-isomorphisms counting) the distribution of incomplete feedback loops is directly connected with the topological structure of the network and it is not always true that their number is monotonically decreasing.

The subject of this paper, gene regulatory networks and their fundamental stability, is something I dipped into, before I had seen this MS. I don't think the present MS. really does justice to the already quite extensive literature out there, very physics based, on GRN and this needs to be addressed at the outset. The authors might claim too much credit for what they have discovered. I found that the review in Nature Genetics by Albert-László Barabási and Zoltán N. Oltvai ``’Network Biology:Understanding the cell’s functional Organization’ to be an excellent introduction and to have it characterized as ``predominantly descriptive, rather than predictive' to be rather harsh. Buffered Qualitative Stability (BQS) may be an interesting subject (since it is qualitative and not quantitative really I could lump it into the ``predominantly descriptive' category as well). I think more credit has to be given to the ideas of scale-free networks, hierarchical architecture and hub connectivity</italic>.</p><p>We accept that in our enthusiasm we were perhaps a little dismissive of previous analyses. We have modified the Introduction as suggested to give more credit to previous work, particularly in the first paragraph of the Introduction and the first paragraph of the Discussion.

But when I look at the biological networks that I am familiar with, such as the SOS network in E. coli, an organism which is one of the test cases (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>), it is by no means obvious to me that there are just 3 at most links to that network: it is quite complicated. We looked at some other networks, and again we found many links to a loop. Large loops actually seem common to the naive eye</italic>.</p><p><italic>So, it would be extraordinarily useful if the authors slowed down a bit and showed one large GRN in E. coli in some detail, and explain how exactly they determine that there are under 3 links to the loop! I am not sure that the SOS response qualifies as a GRN, but I am curious how this works out, and I think that giving a test example in some detail would help what seems to be a powerful idea which seems to be actually new works out in practice</italic>.</p><p>To prevent readers feeling our data appears ‘by magic’ we have added as suggested a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, showing the <italic>E. coli</italic> GRN with TFs coloured red and the arrows colour-coded according to the number of genes regulated by the source TF, a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows the interaction among TFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> and a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref> which contrasts the interactions among TFs in the GM12872 and K562 cell lines. Readers can trace links between TFs and confirm the absence of long feedback loops. As the reviewer concedes, loops such as those occurring in the SOS network involve post-transcriptional links rather than the purely transcriptional links that we analyse here. In addition, we provide a description of the algorithms used in Materials and methods and have included the R source code (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Source code 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>It would be great if BQS could be applied to cancer cells, as the authors’ claim.

We think that such an investigation and the analysis of GRNs derived by methodologies less reliable than ChIP-Seq would be an interesting follow-up work for a further publication.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The authors’ argument somehow implies that stability equals robustness.
