advanced rapidly, yet there is still no spatio-temporally resolved method to measure the release of neuropeptides in vivo. Here we introduce Neuropeptide Release Reporters (NPRRs): novel genetically-encoded sensors with high temporal resolution and genetic specificity. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model, we provide evidence that NPRRs recapitulate the trafficking and packaging of native neuropeptides, and report stimulation-evoked neuropeptide release events as real-time changes in fluorescence intensity, with sub-second temporal resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>dense core vesicle</kwd><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21EY026432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA031389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS091546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickman</surname><given-names>Dion K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A series of genetically-encoded fluorescent reporters that allow imaging of neuropeptide release in vivo, with sub-second temporal and nerve terminal-level spatial resolution are developed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropeptides (NPs) exert an important but complex influence on neural function and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hökfelt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Insel and Young, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nässel and Winther, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>). A major lacuna in the study of NPs is the lack of a method for imaging NP release in vivo, with subcellular spatial resolution and subsecond temporal resolution. Available techniques for measuring NP release include microdialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kendrick, 1990</xref>), antibody-coated microprobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schaible et al., 1990</xref>) and GFP-tagged propeptides visualized either by standard fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van den Pol, 2012</xref>), or by TIRF imaging of cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xia et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a fusion between rat Atrial Natriuretic Peptide/Factor (ANP/F) and GFP was used to investigate neuropeptide trafficking at the fly neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rao et al., 2001</xref>). Release was measured indirectly, as a decrease in ANP-GFP fluorescence intensity at nerve terminals reporting residual unreleased peptide, on a time-scale of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). None of these methods combines NP specificity, genetically addressable cell type-specificity, high temporal resolution and applicability to in vivo preparations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A major challenge is to develop a tool that encompasses all these features for direct, robust measurement of NP release in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Neuropeptides are synthesized as precursors, sorted into dense core vesicles (DCVs), post-translationally modified and cleaved into active forms prior to release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taghert and Veenstra, 2003</xref>). We reasoned that an optimal in vivo real-time NP release reporter should include (1) a reporter domain that reflects the physico-chemical contrast between the intravesicular milieu and the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>); and (2) a sorting domain that ensures its selective trafficking into DCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The NP precursor may function as the sorting domain, suggested by studies of DCV fusion using pIAPP-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barg et al., 2002</xref>) and NPY-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>) in cultured neurons, or ANP-GFP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rao et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore developed a pipeline to screen various transgenes comprising NP precursors fused at different sites to fluorescent reporters, in adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). A total of 54 constructs were tested. We found that optimal trafficking was achieved by substituting the reporter for the NP precursor C-terminal domain that follows the final peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In order to maintain covalent linkage with the reporter domain, we removed the dibasic cleavage site C-terminal to the final peptide.</p><p>The DCV lumen has lower pH and free calcium (pH = 5.5–6.75, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]~30 µM) compared to the extracellular space (pH = 7.3, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]~2 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sturman et al., 2006</xref>). These differences prompted us to test validated sorting domains in a functional ex vivo screen using either pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>) or genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin and Schnitzer, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Reporters based on pHluorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>) did not perform well in our hands, therefore we focused on GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The calcium sensitivity threshold of GCaMP6s is below the calcium concentration in both DCVs and the extracellular space. However, GCaMP6s fluorescence is quenched in the acidic DCV lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barykina et al., 2016</xref>), enabling it to function as a dual calcium/pH indicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These key properties should boost the contrast between GCaMP6s fluorescence in unreleased vs. released DCVs, potentially allowing us to trace NP release at the cellular level in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and Synaptic Localization of an NPRR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the principle of NPRRs (Neuropeptide Release Reporters).

Initially for proof-of-principle experiments, we used the Dro<italic>sophila</italic> larval NMJ to test NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>, a GCaMP6s fusion with rat ANP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 1997</xref>). NMJ terminals are large, individually identifiable, and easy to image and record. In particular, boutons on muscle 12/13 are diverse -- Type Ib and Type Is boutons contain mostly synaptic vesicles and few DCVs, while Type III boutons contain an abundance of DCVs but no synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menon et al., 2013</xref>); moreover, Type III-specific GAL4 drivers are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koon and Budnik, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Expression of NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> pan-neuronally (under the control of nsyb-GAL4) followed by double immuno-staining for ANP and GCaMP (anti-GFP) indicated that the sorting domain and the reporter domains showed a similar localization in Type III neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the distribution of NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> overlapped that of Bursicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), an NP that is endogenously expressed in Type III neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loveall and Deitcher, 2010</xref>). Both GCaMP and Bursicon immunoreactivity were strongest within boutons, consistent with the known subcellular localization of DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gorczyca and Budnik, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Glutamate is the only known canonical neurotransmitter used at the larval NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menon et al., 2013</xref>). This allowed visualization of the subcellular localization of small synaptic vesicles (SV) by immuno-staining for vGluT, a vesicular glutamate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fremeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kempf et al., 2013</xref>). In Type Ib neurons (which contain relatively few DCVs relative to SVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Menon et al., 2013</xref>]), vGluT staining was observed as patches with a dim center, which may reflect clustered SVs, while NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> immunoreactivity was seen in dispersed, non-overlapping punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, α-GFP, inset). In Type III neurons, NPRRs were strongly expressed but no vGluT immunoreactivity was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The subcellular distribution of this NPRR in larval NMJ neurons, therefore, is similar to that of other DCV-targeted markers previously used in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shakiryanova et al., 2006</xref>), and appears to reflect exclusion from SVs.</p><p>The diffraction limit of light microscopy precluded definitive co-localization of NPRRs in DCVs. Therefore, we employed Immuno-Electron microscopy (Immuno-EM) to investigate the subcellular localization of NPRRs at the nanometer scale. To maximize antigenicity for Immuno-EM, we generated constructs that replaced GCaMP6s with GFP (NPRR<sup>ANP-GFP</sup>;). NPRR<sup>ANP-GFP</sup> showed dense labeling in association with DCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, arrows), where the average number of gold particles/µm<sup>2</sup> was substantially and significantly higher than in neighboring bouton cytoplasm (DCV/Bouton ~ 14.26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that NPRR<sup>ANP-GFP</sup> is localized to DCVs. By extension, they suggest that NPRR<sup>ANP-GCaMP6s</sup> (which has an identical structure to NPRR<sup>ANP-GFP</sup> except for the modifications that confer calcium sensitivity) is similarly packaged in DCVs. While these two reporters show indistinguishable distributions by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), we cannot formally exclude that the substitution of GCaMP for GFP may subtly alter subcellular localization of the NPRR in a manner undetectable by light microscopy.</p><p>To measure the release of NPRRs from DCVs, we next expressed NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> in Type III neurons using a specific GAL4 driver for these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koon and Budnik, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We delivered 4 trials of 70 Hz electrical stimulation to the nerve bundle, a frequency reported to trigger NP release as measured by ANF-GFP fluorescence decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shakiryanova et al., 2006</xref>), and used an extracellular calcium concentration that promotes full fusion mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alés et al., 1999</xref>). This stimulation paradigm produced a relative increase in NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> fluorescence intensity (ΔF/F), whose peak magnitude increased across successive trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, red bars and 2D; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, A<sub>1</sub> vs. A<sub>7</sub>). Responses in each trial showed a tri-phasic temporal pattern: (1) In the ‘rising’ phase, NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> ∆F/F peaked 0.5–5 secs after stimulation onset, in contrast to the virtually instantaneous peak seen in positive control specimens expressing conventional GCaMP6s in Type III neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> latency to peak was similar to the reported DCV fusion latency following depolarization in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xia et al., 2009</xref>). This delay is thought to reflect the kinetic difference between calcium influx and DCV exocytosis due to the loose association between DCVs and calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xia et al., 2009</xref>). (2) In the ‘falling’ phase, NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> ∆F/F began to decline 1–5 s before the termination of each stimulation trial, presumably reflecting depletion of the available pool of releasable vesicles. In contrast, GCaMP6s fluorescence did not return to baseline until after stimulation offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). (3) Finally, unlike GCaMP6s, NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> exhibited an ‘undershoot’ (∆F/F below baseline) during the post-stimulation intervals, followed by a ‘recovering’ phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C,I1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This undershoot may reflect dilution of released fluorescent NPRR molecules by diffusion into the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van den Pol, 2012</xref>), while recovery may reflect DCV replenishment in the boutons from vesicles proximal to the imaged release site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NPRR specifically reports neuropeptide release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trace from a representative experiment showing changes in NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> fluorescence intensity (∆F/F) in Type III motor neurons at the larval NMJ evoked by electrical stimulation.

By exploiting the fluorescent change of GCaMP in response to a shift in pH and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], we visualized the release of neuropeptides by capturing the difference between the intravesicular and extracellular microenvironment. NPRR responses exhibited triphasic kinetics, including rising, falling and recovering phases. In the falling phase, a post-stimulus ‘undershoot’, was observed in which the fluorescent intensity fell below pre-stimulation baseline. This undershoot presumably reflect the slow kinetics of DCV replenishment relative to release.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms of NP release are incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu and Xu, 2008</xref>). It is possible that individual DCVs only unload part of their cargo during stimulation, in which case many DCVs that underwent fusion may still contain unreleased NPRR molecules following a stimulus pulse. Although we are convinced that NPRR signals do indeed reflect NP release, due to the presence of the recovering phase, we cannot formally exclude that unreleased NPRRs may contribute to the signal change due to their experience of intravesicular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]/pH changes that occur during stimulation. To resolve this issue in the future, an ideal experiment would be to co-express an NPRR together with a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]/pH-invariant NP-reporter fusion. Multiple attempts to generate such fusions with RFP were unsuccessful, due to cryptic proteolytic cleavage sites in the protein which presumably result in degradation by DCV proteases during packaging.</p><p>To test if NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> ∆F/F signals are dependent on NP release, we expressed the light chain of tetanus toxin (TNT), a reagent shown to effectively block NP release in many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McNabb and Truman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zandawala et al., 2018</xref>), if not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Umezaki et al., 2011</xref>), systems. We observed a striking difference in NPRR kinetics in flies co-expressing TNT vs. its proteolytically inactive ‘impotent’ control form TNT<sup>imp</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The strong reduction of NPRR signals by TNT-mediated n-syb cleavage is consistent with the idea that these signals reflect the release of NPRRs from DCVs.</p><p>We have tested the generalizability of the principles used to generate NPRRs by (1) constructing a surrogate NP reporter NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> as well as a multi-peptide-producing endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> NP reporter NPRR<sup>dTK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>); (2) characterized NPRR signals in response to varying intensities of electrical stimulation; and (3) recorded NPRR signals in two different classes of NMJ motor neurons containing DCVs with or without SVs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These experiments revealed, to our surprise, that NPRR responses exhibit cell-type specific characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The application of NPRRs to measuring NP release dynamics in awake, freely behaving animals may yield answers to these important long-standing questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">UAS-NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> (attp2)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, subsection Construction of transgenic animals.</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">UAS-NPRR<sup>dTK</sup> (attp2)</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>Same as above.</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">UAS-TNT<sup>imp</sup></td><td>Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:28840; FLYB:FBti0038575; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_28840">BDSC_28840</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">Flybase symbol: w[*]; P{w[+mC]=UAS TeTxLC.(-)V}A2</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">UAS-TNT</td><td>Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:28838; FLYB:FBti0038527; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_28838">BDSC_28838</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">Flybase symbol: w[*]; P{w[+mC]=UAS TeTxLC.tnt}G2</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>w; +; UAS-GCaMP6s (su(Hw)attp1)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP (chicken polyclonal)</td><td>Aveslab</td><td>Aveslab: GFP-1020; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2307313">AB_2307313</ext-link></td><td>(1:250:Immuno-EM, 1:1000: IHC)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ANP (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>abcam</td><td valign="bottom">abcam #14348</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>All experimental flies were reared on a 12/12 hr day-night cycle at 25°C.

Cross-sections through boutons were recorded and the following parameters were measured: total image area, total number of gold particles, number of visible dense core vesicles (DCV), number of gold particles within a 50 nm radius of the DCV center, bouton area (grid intersection estimate), gold within the bouton cytoplasm, gold within 20 nm of the bouton plasma membrane, gold outside of the bouton (mainly sER). Background labeling was estimated using internal controls (labeling on blank resin and on muscle fibers) and a biological control (non-GFP expressing genotype). Occasional obvious, large gold aggregates were disregarded. Background was consistently below 0.6 gold/µm<sup>2</sup> in independently repeated labeling experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrical stimulation</title><p>The dissection of third-instar larvae was performed in zero-calcium HL3 saline. The CNS was removed to avoid spontaneous motor neuron activity. To minimize muscle contraction induced by electrical stimulation of motor neurons, the larval body walls were slightly stretched and incubated in HL3 saline supplemented with 10 mM glutamate for 5 mins after dissection to desensitize postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Samples were then shifted to HL3 saline containing 1 mM glutamate and 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Motor nerves were sucked into a glass micropipette with a stimulation electrode. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, to induce maximum dense core vesicle release at type III motor neuron terminals, four repetitive bursts (70 Hz stimulation for 18–20 s with pulse width of 1 ms) with intervals of 40–42 s were programmed and triggered with a Master-9 stimulator (A.M.P.I., Israel) connected to an iso-flex pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I., Israel). The stimulation intensity was tested and set to double the intensity required to induce muscle contraction by a single pulse stimulation.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, stimulation trials were delivered with the same duration, but with a series of frequencies spanning 1 Hz to 70 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>A Nikon A1R confocal microscope with resonant scanner and NIS Element software were used to acquire live Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging on third instar larvae, bathed with 1 mM glutamate added in 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> HL3 saline. Type III motor neuron terminals in abdominal segments from A2 to A5 were imaged using a 60x APO 1.4 N.A. water immersion objective with 488 nm excitation laser. A 5 min period was used for time-lapse imaging at a resonance frequency of 1 fps (512 × 512 pixels or 1024 × 1024 pixels), with z-stacks (step length varying from 1 to 1.5 μm) covering the depth of entire type III motor neuron terminals. The repetitive electrical stimulation of 70 Hz was delivered during the imaging session. Samples with severe muscle contractions were abandoned due to imaging difficulties. Maximum intensity projection (MIP) and image registration were conducted using Image J. Plugins including Image Stabilizer (K. Li, CMU) and Template Matching (Q. Tseng) were used for compensating drifting and correcting movement induced by electrical stimulations. ROIs were manually selected by tracing the outer edge of each neuron based on the baseline fluorescence. If the fluorescence was too weak to trace, we established a reference stack by empirically adjusting the contrast on a duplicate of the raw image stack. We used the reference stack for ROI selection and projected the selected ROIs back onto to the raw image stack for measurement. For frames in which the sample movement could not be automatically corrected, we manually outlined the ROIs used for measurements. Preparations with severe movement or deformation artifacts were abandoned to avoid unreliable measurements. Each ROI represent a traceable neuronal branch except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, in which the ROIs were further manually partitioned into boutons and IBIs (Inter-Bouton Intervals) based on morphology. Fluorescence change were normalized to the pre-stimulation background except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, for which the data in each trial was normalized to the average ∆F/F during a 5 s period just before stimulation was initiated.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leslie C Griffith as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Paul Taghert (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper develops a new set of tools for looking at release of peptides in real time. The idea is a good one and there is a need in the field for such tools. The authors describe a genetically encoded reporter system for dense core vesicle (DCV) fusion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They generate a host of fusions of GCaMP6 to ANF and DTK neuropeptides and identify a specific fusion event that localizes well to DCVs by both immunocytochemistry and immuno-EM. The authors show the sensor can respond to strong stimulation and compare the response to cytosolic GCaMP6 as a read-out of intra-terminal calcium changes. Overall, it's a potentially useful tool for the field, but the study could add a bit more quantification to demonstrate how well the sensor is actually working.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major issue the reviewers had with the feasibility of this approach for dissecting DCV release is the conditions needed to trigger these changes – 70 Hz stimulation for 18 secs. These motor neurons would never experience such extreme stimulation in vivo. Peptidergic neurons typically fire in the 1-5 Hz range and while motor neurons fire at higher rates, natural stimulation is not of the duration used here. The signal-to-noise ratio (δ F changes) of this DCV sensor (compared to GCaMP alone which appears to be at least 5-10x more sensitive) is also rather poor. As such, it would be informative to have more information on the dynamics of their new reporter.</p><p>a) Provide a dose response curve to demonstrate both the required stimulation frequency (only 70 Hz is reported), the required length of stimulation (only 18 seconds is reported) and the calcium response curve. What does 1 Hz look like? Or 5 Hz?</p><p>b) The authors only report changes in the Type 3 terminals. What did the authors see in the Type 1 terminals that have fewer DCVs? Was DCV release detectable in these neurons, as has been reported in the field for the classical ANF-GFP DCV sensor? These data may be more useful than Type III data for investigators contemplating using this tool in neurons that do not have huge numbers of DCVs.</p><p>c) It would be helpful to use a benchmark to compare the methodology described here to that currently used in the field – the loss of ANF-GFP signal following stimulation. Is the current system actually an upgrade over that? There is unique value here in the potential to endogenously target specific neuropeptides for this technique, but if the sensitivity is far below that of ANF-GFP, the older system might still be the one of choice for dissecting the biology of DCV fusion overall. Without these data it is hard to claim an advance.</p><p>2) It would be helpful for the authors to further clarify in discussion what they actually think the sensor is reporting over time. It was not clear to reviewers exactly what the rise/falling/undershoot/recovery phases actually represent. The recovery phase is especially mysterious since the soma is gone so it cannot be replenishment via transport. DCVs are known to only release part of their cargo during stimulation, so presumably many of these DCVs still contain GCaMP-tether neuropeptide within them. Do the DCVs that have fused become less acidic and take up come extracellular calcium and thus activate the remaining GCaMP within them? Or do the authors think that the DCVs release all their content, or not take up calcium or lose their acidity during partial fusion events? This seems a potential confound – the authors are measuring a transient rise in calcium influx and pH change within the lumen of the DCV, not the actual release of the neuropeptide-GCaMP.</p><p>While the reviewers did not feel that it was required that this point be addressed with new experiments, it would be incredibly informative to assay their sensor in animals concurrently expressing an ANF-mCherry, ANF-mOrange (or other red-shifted tagged neuropeptide) where loss of the neuropeptide is directly reported in addition to the neuropeptide-GCaMP signal. That would really help clarify what is likely to be happening with their sensor during these phases of DCV release or partial fusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46421.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p> <italic>1) The major issue the reviewers had with the feasibility of this approach for dissecting DCV release is the conditions needed to trigger these changes – 70 Hz stimulation for 18 secs.

In response to points 1a and 1b, we have added a new Figure 4, where we present stimulation frequency titrations of NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>, NPRR<sup>dTK</sup> and GCaMP6 responses in both Type III neurons and Type Ib neurons. Because 70 mM potassium or 70 Hz electric stimulation were reported necessary for inducing maximum dense core vesicle release events in <italic>Drosophila</italic> type III motor neurons <sup>1</sup>, we covered stimulation frequencies from 1 Hz to 70 Hz as the reviewer requested (<italic>1a</italic>). To compare and contrast the results between preparations and genotypes, for each preparation we normalized the ∆F/F peaks to responses obtained at 70Hz. We did not change the duration of stimulation, as it adds an additional dimension of complexity to the experiments.</p><p>Type III motor neurons contain primarily DCVs and exhibit a distinct morphology compared to type Ib motor neurons. As reviewer requested (1b), we have applied the same electric stimulation series to the glutamatergic type Ib motor neurons, which contain both SVs and DCVs <sup>2</sup>.</p><p>To answer the reviewers’ questions in reverse order:</p><p>1b) NPRR responses can be observed in Type Ib as well as in Type III neurons (new Figure 4).</p><p>1a) In Type Ib neurons, no statistically significant NPRR responses could be observed at 1 Hz (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.2817; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.0723) or 5 Hz (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.0727; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.3467). However, responses at 10 Hz were statistically significant (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.0108; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.0124). GCaMP responses were statistically significant at 5 Hz (P=0.0152) but not at 1 Hz (P=0.1194). Importantly, unlike the case in Type III neurons, we did not observe significant differences in the performance of the NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> and NPRR<sup>dTK</sup> reporters in Type Ib neurons (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In Type III neurons, no statistically significant responses were observed at 1 Hz (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.3304; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.0719), 5 Hz (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.3699; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.3467) and 10 Hz (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.3084; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.5660). We observed a statistically significant increase in ∆F/F at 30 Hz for NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> but not NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>; at 50 Hz and above we observed significant responses with both reporters. (NPRR<sup>ANP</sup>: P=0.0021; NPRR<sup>dTK</sup>: P=0.034). The difference between both NPRRs at 30 Hz or 50 Hz was also statistically significant ((Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>(*Statistical methods: For in-sample comparison, one-sample T-test was used to compare response at a given stimulation frequency to 0. For between-sample comparison at the same stimulation frequency, Mann-Whitney U test was used.)</p><p>These results reveal two important new findings: (1) the difference between the performance of the two NPRRs we tested in Type III neurons is not a general property of these reporters, but a peculiarity of Type III neurons; (2) the high threshold for detection of NPRR responses in Type III neurons (30-50 Hz) is also not a general property of these reporters, since significant responses can be observed at frequencies as low as 10 Hz in Type 1b neurons. 10 Hz is well within the range of physiological rates for many neurons. These observations should allay concerns that NPRRs will have limited applicability.</p><p>Indeed, these new results reveal a novel application for NPRRs: they can be used to compare the relationship between stimulation and neuropeptide release between different types of neurons. In the present case, the difference in NPRR release detection thresholds between Type Ib and Type III neurons appears to be correlated with differences in the overall responses of these two cell types to electrical stimulation, as revealed by conventional GcaMP imaging (Figure 4C, F). However further studies will be necessary to substantiate this. To our knowledge, such a comparison of NP release thresholds between different neuronal cell types has not been performed previously. These data therefore illustrate a new area of investigation that is opened up by this technology.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment that the signal-to-noise ratio of this sensor is rather poor, in comparison to that of GCaMP6, we would respectfully point out that the signal-to-noise ratio of the first-generation GCaMPs were also rather poor (max ∆F/F ≪100%). It took a managed team of protein engineers at Janelia 5 years and $10 million to optimize GCaMP from version 1.3, to version 6 (the first version with single-spike sensitivity). We would respectfully submit that the expectation that a first-generation reporter of a new class would perform as well as the 6th generation GcaMP is unrealistic. We anticipate that there will be multiple iterations of NPRRs to optimize their performance, but such optimization is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It would be helpful to use a benchmark to compare the methodology described here to that currently used in the field – the loss of ANF-GFP signal following stimulation.

While both methods showed comparable decreases in fluorescence in response to 70 mM KCl (see below), in response to electrical stimulation, we failed to observe any decrease in ANP-GFP signals in Type Ib or Type III neurons (Author response image 1A<sub>1,2</sub>). In contrast, under the same stimulation conditions NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> clearly exhibited an increase in dF/F (Author response image 1A<sub>3,4</sub>). In other words, in our hands the ANPGFP method yielded no signal (decreased fluorescence) in response to electrical stimulation, whereas the NPRR clearly did so. Therefore rather than it being the case that the sensitivity of NPRRs is “far below that of ANF-GFP,” it appears that NPRRs are far more sensitive than ANF-GFP, in the context of electrical stimulation.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Benchmarking NPRR with ANP-GFP.</title><p>Trace from a representative experiment showing changes in fluorescence intensity (∆F/F) of ANP-GFP and NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> evoked by electrical stimulation (Red bar, frequency shown in A1).

In this case, we observed a significant decrease in ANP-GFP fluorescence (36.04% decrease, N=7) after 10 mins, consistent with published work from the Levitan laboratory <sup>1,3</sup>. In parallel, NPRR<sup>ANP</sup> underwent a comparable level of fluorescent loss (33.57% decrease, N=7), suggesting a similar sensitivity of the two reporters under these conditions of bath depolarization.</p><p>We cannot explain our failure to observe any fluorescent loss of ANP-GFP in response to tenable electrical stimulation, in contrast to published results from the Levitan laboratory <sup>1,3</sup>. Whatever the explanation, our results demonstrate the superiority of the NPRR methodology. In addition to being able to visualize specific neuropeptides, the ultimate objective of generating NPRRs is to be able to measure NP release in behaving animals over time. For this purpose, a positive signal would be more optimal than a negative signal (ANP-GFP), as fluorescent loss could be confounded by other technical issues, such as photobleaching or movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful for the authors to further clarify in discussion what they actually think the sensor is reporting over time. It was not clear to reviewers exactly what the rise/falling/undershoot/recovery phases actually represent.

As we stated in the original submission, we interpret the rising phase as reflecting epochs of NP release. The falling phase where an undershoot was observed suggests that the overall decrease of GCaMP fluorescence represents a reduction of total DCV NPRR cargo in the bouton area following vesicle fusion.</p><p>The reviewers state that the recovery phase is mysterious, because replenishment via transport cannot occur in the absence of the soma, which is removed in these preparations. The reviewer’s statement is partially incorrect: recent studies have demonstrated that axonal transport indeed occurs during short-term presynaptic protein remodelling with<sup>4</sup> or without<sup>5</sup> the ventral verve cord (i.e., somata) removed, over a time course ranging from 10 – 30 min <sup>6,7</sup>, a timeframe similar to that in our experimental design. Thus, replenishment of DCVs via continuous transport from unstimulated axon segments contained within our preparation seems the most parsimonious explanation for the recovery phase.</p><p>DCV release occurs in several modes. At this point, we are unable to determine whether an individual DCV unloads all or a portion of its content in our experiments, although as mentioned above (response to point 1c) we detected an ~36% decrease in overall GCaMP fluorescence following high potassium stimulation. Furthermore, the ∆F/F undershoot observed in the recovery phase supports the idea that at least some, if not all, NPRR molecules are released to the extracellular space, since a purely intravesicular change in calcium/pH would not cause such an undershoot. Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that some fraction of NPRR increased ∆F/F signal is contributed by unreleased NPRR molecules, and now acknowledge this in the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the reviewers did not feel that it was required that this point be addressed with new experiments, it would be incredibly informative to assay their sensor in animals concurrently expressing an ANF-mCherry, ANF-mOrange (or other red-shifted tagged neuropeptide) where loss of the neuropeptide is directly reported in addition to the neuropeptide-GCaMP signal. That would really help clarify what is likely to be happening with their sensor during these phases of DCV release or partial fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ suggestion to have an additional channel to report neuropeptide loss directly. In fact, we initially generated sixteen different neuropeptide precursor-Red Fluorescent Protein fusions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Unfortunately, all 16 red NPRRs exhibited 1) nearly invisible baseline fluorescence; and 2) no fluorescence change following high potassium challenge (unlike GFP fusions). We tried to investigate the reason for this failure using Neuropred (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stagbeetle.animal.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/neuropred.py">http://stagbeetle.animal.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/neuropred.py</ext-link>), an online algorithm that predicts potential peptidergic cleavage sites within a given protein. This analysis revealed that RFP and tdTomato have 10 and 25 predicted cleavage sites, respectively, as opposed to 3 sites in GCaMP6s, mainly reflecting the high abundance of positively-charged residue repeats (Lys-Lys, Lys-Arg) in RFPs. If these cleavage sites are accessible to DCV proteases that processes packaged NP precursors, it would explain why no red fluorescence was observed with these reporters. We have now mentioned this in the text. Apparently, generating such RFP-based reporters would require mutagenizing all such sites to avoid cleavage, while retaining red fluorescence. Such protein engineering is desirable, but outside the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion to use orange fluorescent proteins such as mOrange or mKO as a fusion alternative. Although it was not included in our first round of design, we would be glad to try it in the future.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Levitan, E. S., Lanni, F. and Shakiryanova, D.
