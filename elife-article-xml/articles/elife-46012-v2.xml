Here, we report that CCN1 is a key regulator of endothelial tip cell activity in angiogenesis. Microvessel networks and directional vascular cell migration patterns were deformed in <italic>ccn1</italic>-knockdown zebrafish embryos. CCN1 activated VEGFR2 and downstream MAPK/PI3K signalling pathways, YAP/TAZ, as well as Rho effector mDia1 to enhance tip cell activity and CCN1 itself. VEGFR2 interacted with integrin αvβ3 through CCN1. Integrin αvβ3 inhibitor repressed tip cell number and sprouting in postnatal retinas from endothelial cell-specific <italic>Ccn1</italic> transgenic mice, and allograft tumours in <italic>Ccn1</italic> transgenic mice showed hyperactive vascular sprouting. Cancer patients with high <italic>CCN1</italic> expression have poor survival outcomes and positive correlation with <italic>ITGAV and ITGB3</italic> and high <italic>YAP/WWTR1</italic>.

The ECM is important for dynamic and multifunctional regulation of cell behaviours and can modulate the bioavailability and activity of growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aszódi et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, ECM proteins directly interact with cell surface receptors to activate signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bornstein and Sage, 2002</xref>). Matricellular proteins are ECM proteins that do not contribute directly to the formation of these structures in vertebrates but are involved in cell–matrix interactions and other diverse cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bornstein, 1995</xref>). Such proteins include thrombospondin-1, osteonectin, and members of the CYR61/CTGF/NOV (CCN) family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lau and Lam, 1999</xref>). Within the CCN protein family, cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61, also known as CCN1) is a secreted protein that is a target of the YAP/TAZ Hippo signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). CCN1 has been reported to mediate a variety of cellular processes, including adhesion, chemotaxis stimulation, survival, and angiogenesis, in a cell type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grzeszkiewicz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). CCN1 also regulates the expression and activities of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in fibroblasts and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ivkovic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athanasopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dean et al., 2007</xref>). It is required for re-endothelialisation and wound repair in contexts where angiogenesis is indispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athanasopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bär et al., 2010</xref>). The angiogenic behaviour of CCN1 has been attributed to its binding to integrin αvβ3, a major integrin expressed in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leu et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Ccn1</italic>-null mice suffer embryonic lethality due to insufficient placental and embryonic blood vessel integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babic et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>Ccn1</italic>-knockdown in mouse embryos causes atrioventricular valve and septal defects due to apoptosis in the cushion tissue and reduction in gelatinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mo and Lau, 2006</xref>); this phenotype overlaps with VEGF-knockout phenotypes in the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dor et al., 2001</xref>). However, CCN1 is not expressed much in ECs but is rather expressed in other parenchymal or mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Su et al., 2004</xref>), and thus, an EC-specific knockout strategy is likely not suitable for identification of the role of CCN1 in sprouting angiogenesis.</p><p>YAP/TAZ are overexpressed in various cancer tissues and have been identified as prognostic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of tumours has revealed prominent expression and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ in correlation with malignant features and poor patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>CCN1</italic> is a well-known transcriptional target of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), is secreted in cancer cells, and induces extensive tumour angiogenesis, underscoring its paracrine angiogenic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maity et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, targeting abnormally activated YAP/TAZ is a promising strategy for the suppression of tumour progression, metastasis, and cancer relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corvaisier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Warren et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, activation of YAP/TAZ by VEGF, a known angiogenic factor, facilitates expression of CCN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of YAP in embryonic retinal vessels, along with reduced retinal vascular sprouting and decreased numbers of vascular branches upon EC-specific deletion of embryonic YAP/TAZ, has further emphasised the importance of YAP/TAZ in vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi and Kwon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakabe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Three types of functionally different ECs participate in the angiogenic process: tip cells, stalk cells, and phalanx cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>). All of these are engaged in the processes of vascular maturation and the maintenance of vascular integrity, thereby optimising blood flow, tissue perfusion, and oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>). Tip cells are characterised by their position at the very tops of angiogenic sprouts and have extensive filopodial protrusions directed toward angiogenic attractants. Tip cells have a specific molecular signature, characterised by the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), VEGFR3, and DLL4. It has been reported that the VEGF gradient is important in the selection and induction of endothelial tip cells. Binding of VEGFR2 induces a signalling cascade that enables the activation of Notch-Delta signalling via DLL4 expression in ECs, converting them into tip cells; however, mechanism of sustained tip cell activity other than VEGF-mediated signalling has not yet been elucidated.</p><p>Here, we report that CCN1 plays crucial role as an auto-inducer of tip cell fate that stimulate angiogenesis through the interplay of YAP/TAZ signalling with the integration of integrin αvβ3-VEGFR2, suggesting a promising approach for the treatment of pathological angiogenesis facilitated by extensive stimulation of tip cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCN1 promotes sprouting angiogenesis in zebrafish</title><p>Secreted CCN1 is reported to facilitate EC migration and tumour angiogenesis via a paracrine effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maity et al., 2014</xref>), and YAP, an upstream regulator of CCN1, is expressed in the developing front of mouse retinal vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, to examine the precise mechanistic involvement of CCN1 in vascular formation, we designed two kinds of morpholino (MO) to target the transcription start site (ATG MO) or intron 1/exon 2 boundary of the <italic>ccn1</italic> gene (Splicing MO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and observed vascular development in TG (<italic>flk1:EGFP</italic>) embryos. MO-mediated knockdown of <italic>ccn1</italic> caused the formation of small heads, oedema, and bent trunk regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In TG (<italic>flk1:EGFP</italic>) embryos, control MO injection resulted in the formation of T-shaped intersegmental vessels (ISVs) and dorsolateral anastomose vessels (DLAVs) at 40 hr post-fertilisation (hpf) (I′ and II′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas the vasculature in the head and trunk regions of <italic>ccn1</italic> morphants was abnormally sprouted and disconnected (III′, IV′, V′, and VI′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>ccn1</italic> morphants lost the T-shaped morphology previously displayed at the DLAV and ISV connexions (IV′ and VI′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When we observed more precisely in ISVs, in control animals, frontal cells from the DA migrated along a left-ascending path to the parachordal vessel (PAV) and then along a right-ascending path to the DLAV (I and II, arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); conversely, in two kinds of <italic>ccn1</italic> morphants, these cells took a right and then left-ascending or bifurcating path to DLAV or not migrating from DAV (III-VI, arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and disconnected or malformed DLAV (III-VI arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) were significantly increased at both 32 and 40 hpf. However, injection of sense RNA of <italic>ccn1</italic> significantly rescued the vascular malformations and altered phenotypes induced by <italic>ccn1</italic> morpholinos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> VII and VIII), suggesting that CCN1 is an essential factor for the vascular development in zebrafish. In addition, <italic>ccn1</italic> morphants demonstrated ectopic expression of <italic>flk-1,</italic> which was expressed not in vascular ECs but across the entire anterior–posterior body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Therefore, the results suggest that CCN1 is essential for the normal migration and sprouting as well as the identity of ECs in zebrafish vascular development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46012.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CCN1 knockdown induces defects in vessel migration and sprouting as well as identity of endothelial cells in zebrafish vascular development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme showing <italic>ccn1</italic> gene exon and intron.

However, the above experiment raised the question of why CCN1 deletion increases sprouting and whether CCN1 can stimulate or inhibit tip cell activity. We used recombinant CCN1 protein to mimic the secreted protein ex vivo and performed a mouse aortic ring assay, as well as an EC spheroid sprouting assay in vitro, using VEGF-A (VEGF) as a positive control. CCN1 induced intensive vascular sprouts from aortic explants and significantly increased tip cell populations to the same degree as VEGF, as determined by tip cell markers, DLL4 and CD34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siemerink et al., 2012</xref>) as well as an EC marker, CD31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). CCN1 also significantly increased sprouting branches from spheroids, as determined by both lengths and numbers of tip cells after immunostained with DLL4 and CD34 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Filopodial formation, which is an important marker of tip cells in migrating cells, was also detected in vitro by immunostaining with phalloidin. In human ECs, filopodia markedly increased upon exposure to CCN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To investigate the angiogenic activity of CCN1, we performed in vitro angiogenesis, tube formation, and EC migration assays. CCN1 markedly increased capillary tube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and promoted EC migration in the wound migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Because tip and stalk cell activities are increased during active angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eilken and Adams, 2010</xref>), we checked whether the expression of marker genes for tip and stalk cells changed following CCN1 treatment in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs).

VEGFR2 activation is a key event in determining the fate of an EC as a tip cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carmeliet et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether VEGFR2 is activated by CCN1 in ECs. CCN1 induced the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 from 10 min at slightly earlier time point of YAP/TAZ activation within 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). VEGFR2 activation after serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Latinkic et al., 2001</xref>) was highly repressed upon siRNA-mediated <italic>CCN1</italic> knockdown (siCCN1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that CCN1 activates VEGFR2. To confirm whether CCN1 is able to activate VEGFR2 in the absence of endogenous VEGF, we transfected HUVECs with siVEGF and found that CCN1 activated VEGFR2 regardless of endogenous VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>CCN1</italic> with siCCN1 repressed the mRNA expression of the tip cells markers, <italic>DLL4</italic> and <italic>VEGFR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) as well as the migration and sprouting ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that endothelial CCN1 is important for EC tip cell activity. The phosphorylation of Y1054/1059 in the VEGFR2 kinase domain mediates kinase activity, and that of Y1175 mediates binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K and to MAPKs, which is involved in migration as well as proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that VEGFR activation induces downstream kinases to inhibit LATS function and activate YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azad et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we checked that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and p85 PI3K, all downstream targets of Y1175 phosphorylation, were activated by CCN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, to confirm whether CCN1-mediated tip cell activity involves the MAPK and PI3K signalling cascades, we used pharmacological inhibitors for ERK1/2 (PD98059), p38 MAPK (SB203580), JNK MAPK (SP600125), and PI3K (LY294002). Upon treatment with all inhibitors except SP600125, <italic>DLL4</italic> mRNA and protein levels were highly repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). To confirm these results, filopodial formation, as determined by phalloidin staining, was highly reduced in ECs exposed to CCN1 together with the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). CCN1-mediated increases in the phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 further implicate its probable involvement in VEGFR2 activation, similar to that of VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartoli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartoli et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Following injection of cyclo(RGDfK) for 2 days, the number of sprouting tip cells with filopodia significantly decreased at P5 and P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To further investigate the autoregulation of CCN1 in sprouting angiogenesis in vivo, we performed aortic ring and Matrigel invasion assays in <italic>Ccn1</italic>-TG mice. The aortic rings isolated from these TG mice showed an increased number of tip cells and sprouting ECs compared to those in WT mice, and these were significantly reduced in cyclo(RGDfK)-treated aortas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, cyclo(RGDfK) treatment repressed in vivo angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug assay. Haematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining of sections of plugs from <italic>Ccn1</italic>-TG mice revealed an increased number of neovessels and microvessels compared to that in controls, while in Matrigel plugs treated with cyclo(RGDfK), both neovessel and microvessel densities were decreased compared to those in <italic>Ccn1</italic>-TG mice without cyclo(RGDfK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Similar results were observed in the CAM assay, with results of treatment with CCN1 alone or together with cyclo(RGDfK) further strengthening the above finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also confirmed that treatment with SU5416, a VEGFR2 kinase-specific inhibitor, demonstrated the same inhibitory results in CAM and Matrigel plug assays following treatment with CCN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of YAP/TAZ increases CCN1 expression and secretion from cancer cells into the tumour microenvironment, which activates tip cell activity by increasing the expression of YAP/TAZ as well as VEGFR2 and DLL4 in ECs to promote vascular sprouting and tumour angiogenesis. Our results indicate that CCN1 expression induced by activated YAP/TAZ increases tip cell activity in ECs via filopodial formation mediated by the mDia1 Rho effector. CCN1 increases activation of the VEGFR2, ERK1/2, P38 MAPK, and PI3K signalling pathways by binding with integrin αvβ3 and VEGFR2. These signalling pathways subsequently induce YAP/TAZ activity and CCN1 expression, sustaining tip cell activity in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46012.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram depicting CCN1 induction of tip cell identity through interplay of integrin αvβ3/VEGFR2 with Hippo pathway.</title><p>CCN1 in the milieu is sensed by ECs by binding to membrane integrin αvβ3 and VEGFR2 receptors, thus activating the MAPK and PI3K-YAP/TAZ signalling pathways, leading to activation of YAP/TAZ.

Based on these data, we attributed the angiogenic defects of CCN1 knockdown to the dysfunction of a specific type of EC: the tip cells. Tip cells migrate and branch according to increased concentrations of VEGF, whereas exposure to relatively low concentrations of VEGF induces the proliferation of stalk cells. Tip/stalk cell fate might be determined by different responses for cells to the environmental cue. It has been indicated that the main determinant for tip/stalk cell fate is the Notch signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hellström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanco and Gerhardt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boareto et al., 2015</xref>). Tip cell specification is initially achieved by DLL4 expression in the topmost cells and by Notch signalling in adjacent ECs. Tip cells that respond to VEGF signalling by increasing their levels of DLL4 expression have the strongest reactions to VEGF and acquire many filopodial phenotypes; in contrast, increased expression levels of Notch and Jagged-1 in neighbouring cells (stalk cells) suppress tip cell-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carmeliet et al., 2009</xref>). Increased expression of DLL4 is a key determinant for tip cell specification. DLL4/Notch1 signalling between adjacent ECs establishes an adequate ratio between tip cells and stalk cells in response to VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hellström et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we found that CCN1 increased tip cell phenotype and the expression of the tip cell marker gene <italic>DLL4</italic>, possibly mediated through the activation of VEGFR2 by CCN1. A new tip cell marker CD34 expressing ECs show low proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siemerink et al., 2012</xref>), and CD34 has been expressed in undifferentiated cells with stem-cell properties, such as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krause et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nielsen and McNagny, 2009</xref>), suggesting that tip cells rarely divide but have stem-like properties among ECs. CD34 expressed in sprouting aorta and spheroid ECs and CD34+/DLL4+ expressing ECs were increased by CCN1 treatment, confirming the CCN1-induced tip cell formation.</p><p>CCN1 is highly induced by hypoxia and is regulated via both hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kunz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meyuhas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>). Since hypoxia enhances VEGF expression—in addition to regulating ECM composition, deposition, posttranslational modifications, and rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2010</xref>)—it is possible that hypoxic conditions increase the formation of tip cells, followed by stalk cell proliferation and tube formation, to supply oxygen to cells through neovessels. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced CCN1 and VEGF can collaboratively activate tip cell induction in ECs. If branched vessels are formed, oxygenation lowers the levels of CCN1 or VEGF, resulting in the survival of quiescent phalanx cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carmeliet et al., 2009</xref>). It has been reported that CCN1 regulates the expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mo et al., 2002</xref>). We did not observe increased levels of VEGF, either in the sera of EC-specific <italic>Ccn1</italic>-TG mice or in EC culture media treated with CCN1, which is consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the EC-specific targeted effects. Therefore, these results suggest that CCN1 induces tip cell activity in ECs in the absence of VEGF through VEGFR2 activation and in collaboration with integrin αvβ3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

However, in P5 mice, the EC-specific deletion of CCN1 results in an increase in the number of tip cells in retinal ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>). This result may reflect the high expression and secretion of CCN1 in other cell types, increasing tip cell activity in ECs. CCN1 is expressed in most cell types but not in ECs after development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Su et al., 2004</xref>). It is expressed in the front of the sprouting retina vessel, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>), and it functions in both paracrine and autocrine manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Latinkic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mo and Lau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krupska et al., 2015</xref>). For the first time, after we confirmed that CCN1 is expressed only in tip cells in an autocrine manner, we revealed the mechanism by which tip cell activity is sustained. We treated cells with recombinant CCN1 primarily to mimic paracrine CCN1. In addition, we used EC-specific <italic>Ccn1</italic>-overexpressing mice to observe the function of endothelial CCN1. In recent research focusing on the role of some genes in blood vessels, mice with EC-specific gene knockout (KO) have generally been used; however, since the target gene in this case was more weakly expressed in ECs than in other surrounding cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that EC-specific KO phenotypes may be affected by proteins expressed in the other cell types, especially when studying a secreted protein, such as CCN1. Therefore, even though the results from EC-specific KO mice demonstrate dramatic effects on abnormal vascular formation, it is crucial to figure out the endogenous functions of genes on the basis of their expression patterns.</p><p>It has been reported that CCN1 does not induce the proliferation of fibroblasts or ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kireeva et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that CCN1 cannot enhance stalk cell phenotype, as seen in our experiments. Expression of <italic>VEGFR2, DLL4</italic> and <italic>SOX17</italic> was significantly induced by CCN1 or VEGF. These findings are in agreement with a recent report that SOX17/VEGFR2 constitutes a feedback loop activated by VEGF signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). SOX17 is a transcription factor expressed in tip cells that enhances developmental angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that CCN1 is involved in vascular sprouting by increasing the SOX17-VEGFR2 feedback loop, resulting in tip cell rather than stalk cell specification.</p><p>Direct physical interactions between purified CCN1 and integrin αvβ3 have already been observed in cell-free systems, and the EC adhesion induced by CCN1 is mediated by its binding to integrin αvβ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kireeva et al., 1998</xref>). In fact, several members of the CCN protein familyinduce angiogenic processes, such as proliferation, chemotaxis, and tube formation in ECs, through binding to integrin αvβ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kubota and Takigawa, 2007</xref>). In ECs, we found that CCN1 induced interactions between CCN1, integrin αvβ3, and VEGFR2. These interactions may then influence tip cell formation and tip cell activity induced by CCN1, indicating that CCN1 functions as a matricellular protein that mediates cell–matrix communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Lau, 1991</xref>). In addition, reactivation of Hippo pathway in several cancers on inhibition of integrin linked kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Serrano et al., 2013</xref>) and repressed CCN1 on targeted inhibition of integrin αvβ3 suppressing the metastasis in osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gvozdenovic et al., 2016</xref>) suggested interplay of integrin αvβ3 and Hippo signalling but this is the first time to show the CCN1 mediated feedback loop through integrin αvβ3/YAP/TAZ axis in vascular sprouting.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that CCN1 plays a key role in the induction of tip cell identity in EC sprouting. The inhibition of DLL4 in tip cells induces a loss of Notch signalling and is associated with an increase in VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 in stalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shawber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suchting et al., 2007</xref>). The inhibition of DLL4/Notch signalling causes large vessels and increases vascular density in tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The loss of CCN1 in ECs appears to inhibit DLL4/Notch signalling, even in the presence of VEGF, in retinal vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that CCN1 may increase tip cell activity via the DLL4/Notch signalling pathway. Interestingly, CCN1 increases the expression of both DLL4 (a negative feedback regulator of VEGF) and SOX17 (a positive regulator of VEGF). Thus, CCN1 may be a key molecule modulating VEGF signalling, either in the presence or absence of VEGF. Therefore, it is likely that the involvement of CCN1 in the activation of VEGFR2 is a key link in VEGFR2 feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The increased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Y1175) caused by the loss of CCN1 in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>) may induce EC proliferation because of the dual roles of Y1175 phosphorylation in both EC proliferation and EC migration. Our results reflect the paracrine effects of CCN1 treatment on the Y1175 phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in EC migration, initiated by tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Y1054 phosphorylation, involved in tyrosine kinase activity, clearly led to CCN1-mediated increases in VEGFR2 kinase activity levels, thus enhancing downstream signalling and leading to the expression of tip cell marker protein DLL4.</p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates the existence of many overlapping roles for CCN1 and VEGF in vascular formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krupska et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, it was reported that EC-specific targeting of CCN1 increased the proliferation of retina ECs, resulting in dense and enlarged vascular networks that lacked the normal arrangement of arterioles, capillaries, and venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>). Hyperplasia of ECs and an increased venule diameter can be explained by enhanced stalk cell activity. Additionally, increased numbers of filopodia and decreased DLL4 signalling activity have been observed in the frontal cells of the retina following EC-specific <italic>Ccn1</italic> KO, suggesting that loss of CCN1 in ECs disturbs the Notch/DLL4 signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chintala et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, CCN1 may distinctly regulate the activities of tip cells and stalk cells.</p><p>Disrupting angiogenic vessel formation, either by inhibition of VEGF itself or by inhibition of the VEGF signalling pathway, limits targeting efficiency due to increases in intratumoural hypoxia and the induction of other growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), and Tie-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rapisarda and Melillo, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, DLL4/Notch signalling has been found to mediate this resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Novel and successful methods for targeting tumour angiogenesis have recently been developed. For example, combining anti-VEGF signalling therapy with an EGFR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>) or kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moreno Garcia et al., 2012</xref>) improves clinical outcomes. Thus, studies of specialised endothelial tip, stalk, and phalanx cell in developing sprouting vessels may provide approaches for eliminating resistance to anti-VEGF therapy (Avastin) and increasing the efficiency of treatments for angiogenic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Transcript data from human cancer database (from GDC) was analyzed with t-test after edgeR package was employed for genomic data analysis. Overall survival rate was evaluated using log-rank test with Kaplan–Meier estimation. The correlation of mRNA expression levels between nine angiogenesis marker genes and <italic>CCN1</italic> in three cancers (LUSC, BLCA, and STAD) was estimated by Spearman’s rank correlation (Spearman’s rho) and empirical testing using the following procedure.

This random selection was repeated 100,000 times, resulting in 100,000 random Spearman’s rho values. We then estimated an empirical null distribution for the Spearman’s rho by applying the Gaussian kernel density estimation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bowman and Azzalini, 1997</xref>) to the 100,000 random Spearman’s rho values.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hong Chen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>It would be important for authors to either show a CRISPR/Cas9 phenotype or to perform a rescue experiment – that is to use a MO that targets the endogenous gene but not a rescue construct, and put both in and show a rescue. A more detailed quantitative analysis of the overall state of the embryos subjected to morpholinos relative to controls would also strengthen this work.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The conclusion of the present study on the role of Cyr61 in angiogenesis is inconsistent with a previous study (Chintala et al., 2015). It is possible that the vascular phenotypes could differ, given that the present study and the previous study have employed different approaches (gain-of-function versus loss-of-function). However, it is still necessary to reconcile this disparate results/conclusion with more convincing evidences. For example, examining the vascular phenotypes in the EC-specific Cyr61-deleted mouse would be a definitive approach.</p><p>2) The reviewers raised numerous issues and errors in imaging presentation, descriptions, and statistical analyses. The authors should carefully go through their manuscript and correct them. Moreover, there were several technical issues that could be solved with better and advanced approaches.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>While the presented study is interesting, it is mainly based in vitro observation. The in vivo experiments performed in Zebrafish and mouse would require further work and characterization to completely support the proposed model by the authors.</p><p>In particular, in the last sentence of the Results section the authors write: Our results indicate that Cyr61 expression induced by activated YAP/TAZ increases tip cell activity in ECs via filopodial formation mediated by the mDi1 Roh effector.&quot; Cyr61 increases activation of VEGFR2, ERK1/, P38 MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways by binding with integrin alphavbeta3 and VEGFR2. These signalling pathways subsequently induce YAP/TAZ activity and Cyr61 expression, sustaining tip cell activity in ECs (Figure 8)&quot;. Even if Cyr61 is not highly expressed in retina tip cells, the authors should generate the EC-specific knockout mice in order to clearly confirm their proposed model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The investigators of this manuscript reported that Cyr61 positively regulated endothelial tip cell activation and promoted angiogenesis through integrin αvβ3 and YAP/TAZ pathway and its potential clinical implications on the survival of cancer patients. Thus, the area of research holds substantial translational value and clinical relevance. The idea to study the role of integrin αvβ3 and YAP/TAZ pathway in mediating the effect of Cyr61 on angiogenesis is original. The experimental design was logical with the usage of Zebrafish MO and of endothelial cell-specific Cyr61 transgenic mice. A variety of studies were used to confirm endothelial tip cell function and angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. The investigators also analyzed human patient data from NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal with lung squamous cell carcinoma, bladder urothelial cancer, and stomach adenocarcinoma to establish the reverse relationship between patient survival and Cyr61 expression. These data were strong and supportive to the conclusion in general. However, the in-depth mechanisms underlying how Cyr61 modulates activity of integrin αvβ3 and signaling capacity of VEGFR2 is less clear. Further, Zebrafish MO studies need to be complemented with rescue experiments or knockout approaches.</p><p>Additionally, there are a few concerns in the manuscript that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Very little data were provided on the patients including age, sex, stage of cancer, other critical medical conditions like DM, HTN, coronary artery disease that may have a substantial impact on the survival. The labeling in Figure 7C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and C (Days to death) appeared to be wrong; the mean survival age needs to be indicated. Information of basal time point for the survival curve needs to be explained whether &quot;0&quot; indicates the date of diagnosis, surgery, or treatment.</p><p>2) The authors stated that Cyr61 was only expressed in tip cells in an autocrine manner, not in stalk cells. It was also not produced in endothelial cells after development. It would be nice to include discussion regards the differences between tip cells and stalk cells and the potential mechanisms regulating its expression.</p><p>3) WB results lack statistical analyses and some blots do not reflect the results. It would be helpful to replace with better representative and unsaturated gel bands throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) Image data appeared to be adjusted artificially and inappropriately. For example, integrin β3 signal in the merged image does not reflect or display information shown in the corresponding single channel (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>5) The description for the statistical method is unclear. The statistical analysis section needs to be addressed more appropriately. For instance, &quot;Analysis of variance&quot; means &quot;ANOVA&quot; where it indicated as two different approaches. IHC data was indicated where one-way ANOVA with post-hoc test was used. Authors need to explain how other experiments were analyzed. Some experiments contain two groups where One-way ANOVA may not be suitable for statistical analysis. Figure 2C and Figure 5E have two groups and should be analyzed by t-test. Transcript data from human cancer database (from GDC) should be analyzed with t-test if edgeR or DESeq was employed for genomic data analysis.</p><p>6) Many places showed the unaligned or different thickness of error bars within the graphs, which need to be fixed (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E, 3B, 5B, G, H, I). Also, there are missing error bars in some place (Supplemental figure B).</p><p>7) VEGFR2 was used as an internal loading control after VEGF or Cyr61 stimulation. VEGFR2 is not a proper loading control as VEGFR2 phosphorylation can induce VEGFR2 internalization and degradation.</p><p>8) Since α-SMA is expressed in smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts. α-SMA alone is not a solid pericyte marker (Figure 7A). Therefore, the conclusion that Cyr61TG decrease pericyte coverage is overstating. PDGFR-β or NG2 should be used for validating pericyte coverage in transplanted tumor section.</p><p>9) Materials and methods and resource table showed that BAECs were used in this study (subsection “Cell culture” and key resources table). However, BAECs had not been used throughout the study. It would be nice to state which experiments BAECs were used.</p><p>10) In Figure 1 legend, it should be &quot;intron 1/exon2&quot; as indicated in text and schematic figure, not &quot;intron2/exon3 boundary&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Kim et al. investigates the angiogenic function of cyr61 (CCN1) using numerous in vivo and in vitro models. They conclude that cyr61 induces tip cells by working thru VEGFR and integrin signaling, and they place YAP/TAZ in the signaling axis. Although there are some potentially interesting insights provided, there are significant concerns with both novelty, significance, and methodology that significantly diminish enthusiasm.</p><p>1) The overall novelty is not considered high, and the work is predicted to have moderate to minimal impact on the field. It is known that Cyr61 is involved in angiogenesis, and a 2015 Development paper (cited) describes an angiogenic loss-of-function phenotype suggesting that Cyr61 negatively regulates VEGFR2 and integrin signaling with some underlying mechanism. This work's unique aspect of YAP/TAZ involvement is predicted from recent work of others showing that YAP/TAZ regulates angiogenesis.</p><p>2) The premise for the experiments is not always clear. EC cell-autonomy vs. non cell-autonomy for Cyr61 function is often interchanged, so it is not clear how the authors interpret their data. Most experiments are gain of function and show that exogenous protein or EC-specific expression increase sprouting parameters, yet Chintala et al. showed that vascular-specific deletion of CCN1 also lead to increased sprouting, and this apparent discrepancy is not explained. The authors claim little to no endothelial expression of cyr61, but Chintala et al. showed expression at the angiogenic front. The single in vivo loss-of-function experiment uses only one Zfish morpholine, and the phenotype is pleiotropic without a rescue, so in my opinion cannot be interpreted. Thus the premise for the work is not strong. The authors assume that &quot;tip cell&quot; is a fate, not a phenotype, and use primarily 2D EC cultures to look at perturbations they associate with &quot;tip cells&quot;.</p><p>3) There are numerous methodological issues that weaken the work. For example, the Zfish experiment cannot be interpreted as the embryos are severely compromised and there is no rescue done; the aortic ring assay does not use a marker to distinguish endothelial cells from other cells that also sprout; the spheroid assay is not robust and does not form luminized vessels in controls; the assay for filopodia is primarily done in 2D, where it is not clear what is measured or how filopodia are normalized.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46012.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The conclusion of the present study on the role of Cyr61 in angiogenesis is inconsistent with a previous study (Chintala et al., 2015).

As for these concerns, <underline>first,</underline> many previous publications showed and suggested that CCN1 (Cyr61) enhances angiogenesis (reviewed in (Jun and Lau, 2011)), consistent with our results, but inconsistent with another study (Chintalaet al., 2015). CCN1 stimulates cell migration or chemotaxis in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and promote the invasiveness of certain cancer cells (Chen and Lau, 2009). CCN1, CCN2 and CCN3 are functioning through direct binding to integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cells to promote proliferation and induce chemotaxis and formation of tubules (Babicet al., 1998; Kubota and Takigawa, 2007; Jun and Lau, 2011). The previous publications found that these CCNs may be involved in embryonic development, inflammatory diseases and tumorigenesis through their angiogenic activities (Kubota and Takigawa, 2007; Kularet al., 2011).</p><p>In addition, Ccn1 enhances tumor growth through its potent angiogenic activity (Babicet al., 1998), accordingly, forced expression of Ccn1 in breast cancer cells promotes tumor growth in xenografts with increased vascularization (Xieet al., 2001; Tsaiet al., 2002). The results are correlated with our results for LLC allograft mouse tumor model (Figure 7A-B) and TCGA big data analysis (Figure 7D).</p><p>Second, a question struck in our mind, if <italic>CCN1</italic> is rarely expressed in ECs after birth but expressed in other CNS cells and fibroblast (Kireevaet al., 1997), in <italic>Ccn1</italic>-EC-specific KO mouse, other cells can secrete CCN1 into ECs which can bind to integrin αvβ3 leading to the increased angiogenesis. Hence, the increased angiogenesis in <italic>Ccn1</italic>-EC-specific KO mouse is not likely owing to the inhibitory function of CCN1 towards angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGFR2 activity in ECs (Chintala et al., 2015), but is likely to the angiogenic function of the secreted CCN1 from non-EC cells where it might have been expressed. Thus, EC-specific KO for certain protein which is rarely expressed in EC but fairly expressed in non-ECs cannot demonstrate the role of that protein in EC if it is secreted, which we have discussed in “Discussion” part in our manuscript.</p><p>Chintala et al., 2015, also showed that Ccn1 is expressed only in the front area of the retina, but scarcely expressed in other retinal vascular ECs at p5. This expression pattern in retina may support our results for the autonomous activation of tip cells through the YAP/TAZ (which are expressed in retinal vessels at P5 (Kimet al., 2017)) activity induced by Ccn1 (Figure 3 and 5). Also EC-specific KO of Lats (an upstream inhibitor or YAP/TAZ) in mice showed the significant increase in “<italic>Ccn1</italic> expression signature” in ECs (Kimet al., 2017), suggesting that YAP/TAZ activation increases Ccn1 in the front region of retinal vessels.</p><p>In conclusion, we would like to suggest that our approaches of in vitro study and in vivo EC-specific transgenic mouse are towards the right direction to identify the exact role of CCN1 in angiogenic process. Therefore, lots of evidences from our in vitro and in vivo research with CCN1 on ECs as well as the role of YAP/TAZ, upstream regulator of CCN1, in sprouting angiogenesis, indicate that CCN1 is the angiogenic inducer as a tip cell activator but not the angiogenic inhibitor.</p><p>Third, unfortunately, currently we do not have the mouse system for inducible EC-specific deletion of <italic>Ccn1</italic>, however, we have the zebrafish system for showing the role of ccn1 in endothelial cells.

In a previous report, CCN1 has 20 AA residues (NCKHQCTCIDGAVGCIPLCP) which are binding sites for integrin αvβ3 for its proangiogenic activity (Chenet al., 2004). As mentioned in the Results section, β1 integrin is known to be involved in the tubular formation of migration of ECs by CCN1, but involvement of β1 was not found in the adhesion induced by CCN1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We, thus, investigated the interaction between integrin αvβ3 and CCN1, VEGFR2 and integrin αvβ3 as well as CCN1. We then used specific peptide inhibitor against integrin αvβ3, cyclo (RGDfK), which binds specifically and with high affinity to αvβ3 to inhibit its activity (Lucieet al., 2009; Limet al., 2018). Cyclo (RGDfK) treated ECs abolished CCN1-treated VEGFR2 signaling pathway and Yap/Taz activation. Therefore, we concluded that VEGFR2 signaling pathways are activated by CCN1 via binding of integrin αvβ3/VEGFR2/CCN1. However, in-depth mechanism underlying how CCN1 modulates integrin ɑ and VEGFR2 activity is to be identified in separate further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, there are a few concerns in the manuscript that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Very little data were provided on the patients including age, sex, stage of cancer, other critical medical conditions like DM, HTN, coronary artery disease that may have a substantial impact on the survival. The labeling in Figure 7C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and C (Days to death) appeared to be wrong; the mean survival age needs to be indicated. Information of basal time point for the survival curve needs to be explained whether &quot;0&quot; indicates the date of diagnosis, surgery, or treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we obtained clinical information of the patients from the original papers. Also, we assessed whether clinical parameters (age, sex, and stage of cancer) could have substantial impacts on the survival by performing 1) Student’s t-test to compare ages between <italic>CCN1</italic> high and <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient groups and 2) proportion tests for proportions of sex or stage of cancer in <italic>CCN1</italic> high and <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient groups. Age showed no significant difference between <italic>CCN1</italic> high or <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient group in LUSC and STAD cohorts. Also, none of sex and stage of cancer was significantly enriched in either <italic>CCN1</italic> high or <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient group in LUSC and STAD cohorts. Given that <italic>CCN1</italic> high and <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient groups showed significant difference in the survival, these data suggest that these parameters appear to have no significant impacts on patient survival. Interestingly, however, in BLCA, age and stage of cancer showed significant (P&lt;0.05) difference or enrichment between <italic>CCN1</italic> high and <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient groups, suggesting potential association of age and stage of cancer with patient survival in BLCA. On the other hand, we could find other medical conditions including DM, HTN, and coronary artery disease from the original papers (TCGA data portal and supplementary tables) and thus could not assess potential impacts of these conditions on patient survival through the aforementioned proportional tests for their enrichments in either <italic>CCN1</italic> high or <italic>CCN1</italic> low patient group in LUSC, STAD, and BLCA cohorts. In the revised manuscript, we added the descriptions for these results in Results section (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Moreover, as suggested, we changed the x-axis label “Days to death (year)” in Figure 7C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C to “Years after diagnosis”. We also included the mean survival age (mean OS; estimated as the area under the survival curve) of each patient group. Basal time point (“0”) for the survival curve indicates the date of the initial pathological diagnosis. We added this information to figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors stated that Cyr61 was only expressed in tip cells in an autocrine manner, not in stalk cells. It was also not produced in endothelial cells after development. It would be nice to include discussion regards the differences between tip cells and stalk cells and the potential mechanisms regulating its expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed as much as possible about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells and the potential mechanisms regulating its specification by CCN1 in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) WB results lack statistical analyses and some blots do not reflect the results. It would be helpful to replace with better representative and unsaturated gel bands throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed Western blot (WB) analysis in Figure 3B again, quantified with previous blot data and graphed as shown in Figure 3B right panel.

For example, integrin β3 signal in the merged image does not reflect or display information shown in the corresponding single channel (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>Merged images are adjusted darker than the integrin β3 signals. We corrected it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The description for the statistical method is unclear. The statistical analysis section needs to be addressed more appropriately. For instance, &quot;Analysis of variance&quot; means &quot;ANOVA&quot; where it indicated as two different approaches. IHC data was indicated where one-way ANOVA with post-hoc test was used. Authors need to explain how other experiments were analyzed. Some experiments contain two groups where One-way ANOVA may not be suitable for statistical analysis. Figure 2C and Figure 5E have two groups and should be analyzed by t-test. Transcript data from human cancer database (from GDC) should be analyzed with t-test if edgeR or DESeq was employed for genomic data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We described in detail the statistical analysis for the data with different approaches at the Materials and methods section. We used t-test for Figure 7D for the transcript analysis as reviewer indicated and added this in Materials and methods section as a “Statistical analysis” as well as in a part of figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Many places showed the unaligned or different thickness of error bars within the graphs, which need to be fixed (Figure 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E, 3B, 5B.

Therefore, the conclusion that Cyr61TG decrease pericyte coverage is overstating.

However, BAECs had not been used throughout the study. It would be nice to state which experiments BAECs were used.</p></disp-quote><p>After we used BAECs in the preliminary experiments, we changed the cells into HUVECs to do in vitro tube formation assay and obtained results shown in this manuscript.

They conclude that cyr61 induces tip cells by working thru VEGFR and integrin signaling, and they place YAP/TAZ in the signaling axis. Although there are some potentially interesting insights provided, there are significant concerns with both novelty, significance, and methodology that significantly diminish enthusiasm.</p><p>1) The overall novelty is not considered high, and the work is predicted to have moderate to minimal impact on the field. It is known that Cyr61 is involved in angiogenesis, and a 2015 Development paper (cited) describes an angiogenic loss-of-function phenotype suggesting that Cyr61 negatively regulates VEGFR2 and integrin signaling with some underlying mechanism. This work's unique aspect of YAP/TAZ involvement is predicted from recent work of others showing that YAP/TAZ regulates angiogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We responded these issues as described in the “Major points” from the Reviewing Editor above. Here we underscored the positive feedback regulation of tip cells by CCN1 and identified the signalling pathway from the membrane to transcription factor, YAP/TAZ in the nucleus. Formation or specification of tip cell should be continued among the ECs during active angiogenesis. Like stem cells, tip cells having migrating property may have to make stalk cells that follow them by dividing. Or only stalk cells are dividing behind the tip cells. Because the dynamic changes of Notch signalling as well as resultant genetic modification in migrating and extending cells, we still do not know exactly whether and how a cell at the topmost is maintained as a tip cell. We adopted the in vitro cell culture system where an angiogenic factor was applied to the whole culture media with the same concentration. Genetic changes or behaviour of ECs by the same manner even the migrating phenotypes were different. Therefore, we determined the expression level of tip cell markers as well as YAP/TAZ activity as a master regulator of tip cell. A receptor of CCN1, integrin αvβ3 made it associated into VEGFR2 to transfer signalling for activation of YAP/TAZ.</p><p><italic>2) The premise for the experiments is not always clear. EC cell-autonomy vs. non cell-autonomy for Cyr61 function is often interchanged, so it is not clear how the authors interpret their data. Most experiments are gain of function and show that exogenous protein or EC-specific expression increase sprouting parameters, yet Chintala et al. showed that vascular-specific deletion of CCN1 also lead to increased sprouting, and this apparent discrepancy is not explained. The authors claim little to no endothelial expression of cyr61, but Chintala et al. showed expression at the angiogenic front. The single</italic> in vivo <italic>loss-of-function experiment uses only one Zfish morpholine, and the phenotype is pleiotropic without a rescue, so in my opinion cannot be interpreted. Thus the premise for the work is not strong. The authors assume that &quot;tip cell&quot; is a fate, not a phenotype, and use primarily 2D EC cultures to look at perturbations they associate with &quot;tip cells&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We responded and performed the rescue experiment as described in “Response” to the “Major points” from the Associate Editor above. We tried to clarify the premise for the experiment in the whole manuscript as solid as possible, especially the EC-cell autonomy for CCN1 function.</p><p>At the beginning of research, in zebrafish knockdown experiments, we found that ccn1 has a role in the migration and sprouting of ECs during vascular development. Then using in vitro EC culture system, we identified the genetic changes of markers for specific ECs as well as the migrating ability after CCN1 was treated. Next, we investigated CCN1 induced YAP/TAZ and VEGFR2 activity, key regulators of vascular sprouting, and further signaling circuit to induce CCN1 again. Therefore, we emphasize that CCN1 may activate YAP/TAZ to induce target gene, CCN1 again for maintaining the tip cell properties. It was a gradual outcome, and our final conclusion was the auto-regulation by CCN1 in tip cells.</p><p>And we described and emphasized that CCN1 is expressed only in retina frontal EC, but not much in whole EC in the second paragraph of the Introduction section. And then we raised a question in the Results section about the discrepancy that CCN1 deletion increases sprouting even if it is expressed only in the frontal ECs in the subsection “CCN1 promotes endothelial sprouting activity in angiogenesis”..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are numerous methodological issues that weaken the work. For example, the Zfish experiment cannot be interpreted as the embryos are severely compromised and there is no rescue done; the aortic ring assay does not use a marker to distinguish endothelial cells from other cells that also sprout; the spheroid assay is not robust and does not form luminized vessels in controls; the assay for filopodia is primarily done in 2D, where it is not clear what is measured or how filopodia are normalized.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We responded these issues as described in the “Major points” from the Reviewing Editor above. For the sprouting assay, we perform it again with 3D culture system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
