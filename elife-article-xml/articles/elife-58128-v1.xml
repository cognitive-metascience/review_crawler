pathogen-derived epitopes encountered during a lifetime are recognized by the available TCR repertoire. A feature of cross-reactivity where previous exposure to one microbe can alter immunity to subsequent, non-related pathogens has been mainly explored for viruses. Yet cross-reactivity to additional microbes is important to consider, especially in HIV infection where gut-intestinal barrier dysfunction could facilitate T cell exposure to commensal/pathogenic microbes. Here we evaluated the cross-reactivity of a ‘public’, HIV-specific, CD8 T cell-derived TCR (AGA1 TCR) using MHC class I yeast display technology. Via screening of MHC-restricted libraries comprising ~2×10<sup>8</sup> sequence-diverse peptides, AGA1 TCR specificity was mapped to a central peptide di-motif. Using the top TCR-enriched library peptides to probe the non-redundant protein database, bacterial peptides that elicited functional responses by AGA1-expressing T cells were identified. The possibility that in context-specific settings, MHC class I proteins presenting microbial peptides influence virus-specific T cell populations in vivo is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>sporosarcina newyorkensis</kwd><kwd>CD8 T cells</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M019837/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillespie</surname><given-names>Geraldine Martina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01AI103867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AI057229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Potential for specific microbiome-directed, MHC-restricted shaping of a commonly selected HIV-specific CD8+ T cell population was suggested by MHC class I yeast display-based peptide screening approaches.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cross-reactivity represents an intrinsic feature of immunity that allows post-thymically selected T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize distinct peptides originating from diverse microbial origins when bound by a single MHC. This considerable immune redundancy exists to cover the deficit between the predicted number of MHC-bound antigenic peptide epitopes that humans encounter during their lifetime (~10<sup>12</sup>) versus the number of unique TCRs available in the periphery (&lt;10<sup>8</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mason, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wucherpfennig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sewell, 2012</xref>). A biologically relevant consequence of cross-reactivity where infection with an initial microbe alters immunity to subsequent, non-related infecting pathogen - termed heterotypic immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gil et al., 2015</xref>) - has been reported to influence the course of natural infections in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aslan et al., 2017</xref>), and can also affect vaccine-mediated immunity and immune-mediated checkpoint therapy outcomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sioud, 2018</xref>). Where such cross-reactivity narrows the immune response and/or skews the enrichment of non-protective immune responses, sub-optimal immunity following infection or post-vaccination can result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clute et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aslan et al., 2017</xref>). The potential to elicit immune pathology also exists, for example, via the amplification of T cells with autoimmune potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rist et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">ImMaDiab Study Group et al., 2018</xref>). However, beneficial effects could also materialize if a cross-reactive response driven by the primary infecting microbe is protective against a subsequent infection involving a non-related pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Su et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The possibility that cross-reactive T cells could influence immunity to non-related pathogens exists but has not been extensively explored – this is particularly relevant in the setting of HIV infection, where viral-induced gut-intestinal (GI) barrier dysbiosis could potentially allow commensal or pathogenic microbes to influence virus-specific T cell populations. Although this has been addressed to some extent in the context of HIV infection for MHC class II and CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Su et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campion et al., 2014</xref>), this topic has received only limited attention in relation to CD8+ T cells and MHC class I restricted epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pohlmeyer et al., 2018</xref>). To explore this, we chose a specific example corresponding to a ‘public’ HIV-specific TCR, namely, the AGA1 TCR, that recognizes the immunodominant, HLA-B*57:01-restricted gag-derived KAFSPEVIPMF (KF11) peptide epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>). The KF11 peptide regularly elicits a set of closely related ‘public’ TCRs utilizing highly conserved TCR V alpha (AV) 5, V beta (BV) 19 and CDR3 A/B hypervariable chain motifs that were originally identified in non-related, HIV-infected B*57:01+ patients who progress slowly to AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillespie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, KF11-specific T cells utilizing near identical AGA1-related BV19-CDR3-BJ1-2 chains, or cells carrying conserved CDR3-BJ1-2 motif (x-Y-G-Y-T, where x = polar residues) segments on diverse BV chain backgrounds, have been reported in both slow and normal progressor HIV+ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mendoza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simons et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that the x-Y-G-Y-T motif is frequently selected in response to the KF11 epitope. Although AGA1 TCR-mediated cross-reactive responses against broad clade variants, including C clade escape variants of KF11 have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillespie et al., 2002</xref>), there are no documented cases of cross reactivity against non-HIV peptides.</p><p>Using the yeast display-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birnbaum et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2018</xref>) where ~ 2×10<sup>8</sup> random peptides were linked to and presented by HLA-B*57 on the surface of yeast cells, we interrogated the cross-reactivity of the AGA1 TCR. This strategy revealed a number of important features of AGA1 TCR-mediated specificity, including characterization of the minimal, central dipeptide motif within the 11 amino acid peptide sequences required to facilitate AGA1 TCR binding. In addition, by using TCR-retrieved peptide libraries to interrogate the non-redundant sequence databases, a number of bacterial peptides that elicited strong functional responses by AGA1-expressing T cell clones were identified. The implications of these findings are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HLA-B57 yeast display library design and validation</title><p>Yeast cell libraries displaying HLA-B*57:03-β2m linked to a randomized peptide library were generated to screen the breadth of AGA1 TCR binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (i) for overview of strategy). The peptide-β2m-MHC library construct was based on previous designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birnbaum et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2018</xref>) and comprised a single peptide test reagent (KF11) or randomized peptide libraries linked to human β2m and the heavy chain of HLA-B*57:03 encoding a Y84A mutation. A myc-tag incorporated between the MHC α3 domain and the Aga2 yeast protein allows the monitoring of peptide-β2m-HLA-B*57:03 expression on the yeast cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (ii)). The functionality of yeast displayed HLA-B*57:03 was confirmed initially by staining a control KF11-β2m-HLA-B*57:03 yeast display with fluorescently conjugated AGA1 TCR tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Following validation, mutagenized peptide libraries were produced. For the preparation of these libraries, peptide residues at positions 2 (Ala/Ser/Thr) and 11 (Phe/Trp/Tyr) (CΩ) were restricted to retain the preferred HLA-B*57:03 anchor binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 1997</xref>), whilst the remaining nine amino acids were randomized using degenerate NNK nucleotide addition as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (ii)).

The enrichment of library peptides was tracked via deep sequencing analysis. By Round 3 of selection, clear evidence of peptide sequence enrichment emerged for variants that resembled the known KAFSPEVIPMF (KF11) peptide. Of the roughly 2.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> reads detected from deep sequencing runs, the top 20 selected peptides represented 89.4% of recovered reads at Round 3, and three peptide sequences accounted for approximately 35% of these reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Distinct patterns of individual amino acid enrichment/fixation within the peptide sequences had also emerged by Round 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The most striking distribution of amino acids included the near exclusive selection of peptides with a conserved central p5Pro-p6Glu motif, which contrasted with the greater diversity tolerated at auxiliary positions along the remaining peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Given that the majority of interactions are formed between CDR3 alpha chain amino acids and the KF11 peptide Glu6 side chain in the published HLA*57:03-KF11-AGA1 TCR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), fixation of this central motif most likely reflects its critical importance for AGA1 TCR binding. Amino acid selection outside the p5Pro-p6Glu di-motif was variable, although patterns of conservation specific to the physiochemistry of residues were apparent; the strong enrichment of hydrophobic amino acids at p3 and p7, and to a lesser extent at p10, for example, reflected the chemistries of these residues in the KF11 peptide (p3Phe, p7Val, p10Met, respectively). Similarly, p4 position - a solvent-exposed Ser and an important AGA1 TCR contact residue in the KF11 peptide - displayed a specific enrichment of polar residues in library-derived peptides. Selection patterns were less obvious at positions 1, 8 and 9, where mixtures of both polar and non-polar residues were tolerated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fixation of specific peptide amino acids residues following Round 3 AGA1 TCR–mediated selection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid enrichment along the length of AGA1 TCR selected 11mer peptides are illustrated (i) in bar chart format for approximately 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> selected peptide sequences, with individual amino acid enrichment at each position of the 11mer peptide represented on the X-axis and sequence frequency on the Y-axis.

To address this, we performed a sandwich ELISA-based UV exchange peptide binding assay to gauge the ability of the various peptides to bind and therefore ‘rescue’ HLA-B*57:01 pre-refolded with UV-labile peptide upon photo-illumination. In terms of the library-derived peptides, there was a strong concordance between the magnitude of T cell responses generated and the extent to which the peptides stabilised HLA-B*57:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Lib 2 peptide, for example, demonstrated the weakest binding to HLA-B*57:01 and represented the only library-derived peptide that failed to elicit functional responses by AGA1-expressing T cell clones. A similar pattern existed for the microbial peptides, where the largest T cell responses were generated by the strongest HLA-B*57:01 binding peptides.

We re-interrogated the ‘nr’ database using this peptide motif to hunt for related peptides. A number of highly homologous peptides were identified of which the majority mapped to HdH enzymes specific to distinct microbial genera. Ten additional HdH peptides (Table 2) were synthesized and tested in T cell functional assays.

When the HdH and KF11 peptides were ranked according to the strength of peptide binding ELISA data, specific amino acids were prominent in the stronger binding peptides: position (p)2 Thr/Ser (preferred anchors), p3Iso, p7Iso, a Pro at p8 or 9 (but not both) and p10Try.

This is especially relevant in the setting of HIV infection, where viral-induced gut-intestinal (GI) barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenchley et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenchley et al., 2006b</xref>) and microbiome dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mudd and Brenchley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lozupone et al., 2013</xref>) could potentially allow commensal or pathogenic microbes to influence the frequencies/functions of resident or infiltrating virus-specific T cells.</p><p>To explore cross-reactivity beyond the normal scope of viral-derived peptide epitopes we chose the well-characterized and commonly selected HLA-B*57:01-restricted AGA1 TCR that recognizes the HIV gag-derived KF11 epitope. Although specific features, including the short and convergent nature of both the TCR CDR3alpha/beta regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venturi et al., 2006</xref>), in addition to the unusual nature of the KF11 peptide when bound by HLA-B*57:01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stewart-Jones et al., 2005</xref>), may drive preferential usage of this TCR, external influences could additionally contribute to its enhanced frequency or common selection in vivo. To evaluate the cross-reactive breadth of the AGA1 TCR, we employed previously developed MHC class I yeast display technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birnbaum et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2018</xref>). This approach permits a high-throughput, non-biased screen of cross-reactivity via TCR-mediated sampling of a repertoire approximating ~2×10<sup>8</sup> distinct peptides bound by MHC on the yeast cell surface. Data obtained using this well-validated approach illustrated key features of AGA1 TCR-mediated specificity. The first and most notable included fixation of the peptide’s central p5Pro-p6Glu di-motifs in TCR-selected libraries following 3 rounds of yeast display selection. As illustrated by our previous analysis of the HLA-B*57:03-KF11-AGA1 TCR co-crystal complex, KF11 peptide residues 4 to 6 primarily contribute to extensive H bonding and van der Waals interactions, the majority of which are formed between CDR3 alpha chain amino acids and the KF11 peptide’s p6Glu residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of p6Glu for AGA1 TCR-mediated recognition of library peptides was also reflected here by its absolute conservation in peptide sequences retrieved following repeated rounds of selection. The near equivalent requirement for p5 Pro in library-enriched peptides may instead reflect its indirect role facilitating the precise peptide conformation to generate a preferred AGA1 TCR recognition landscape akin to that described for KF11 in complex with HLA-B*57:03. Despite the substantial involvement of KF11 p4Ser in the published AGA1 TCR-B*57:03-KF11 binding interface, this residue was not completely conserved in all peptides following selection. However, as library peptides with p4 polar residues were specifically enriched, this may reflect pressure to fulfil H bonding requirements analogous to those described previously for the interaction between KF11p4Ser and the AGA1 TCR CDR3 alpha chain region in the AGA1 TCR-B*57:03-KF11 co-complex structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the library design generated in this study allowed for the KF11 sequence to be present, it was not found in either the naïve or in subsequent rounds of AGA1 TCR-enriched libraries. Hence, the yeast clone was unlikely to be a transformant in these screens. This, to some extent, reflects one small limitation of the yeast display screens where the functional library cannot fully cover the theoretical diversity of all potential cross-reactive peptides. However, the real strength of the method is reflected by its ability to identify the restricting peptide when absent, in addition to related peptides, from available databases using algorithms and statistical-based approaches. This is what we observed for the KF11 peptide which emerged as the top database-mined peptide hit using library peptide-led database screens.</p><p>Following Round 3 peptide sequence acquisition, data-informed algorithms were developed to identify similar peptides in the non-redundant database. Next to KF11-mined peptides and related variants, microbial peptides comprised the top peptide hits. Of the small panel of bacterial peptides included in follow-up T cell functional studies, three peptides were recognised. One peptide that elicited weak responses was derived from <italic>O. uli</italic>, a gram-positive member of the <italic>Coriobacteriaceae</italic> family previously associated with orthodontic infections in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vieira Colombo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dewhirst et al., 2001</xref>). A second peptide mapped to a hypothetical protein (CORT_0A05310) from <italic>C. orthopsilosis</italic>, an invasive yeast strain associated primarily with blood-borne infections linked to catheter-delivered nutrients (hyperalimentation) during hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tavanti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merseguel et al., 2015</xref>). However, the largest responses were driven by a peptide sequence (LTISPEIPPYF) that mapped to a haloacid dehydrogenase (HdH) enzyme from <italic>S. newyorkensis</italic>. Although normally associated with terrestrial environments and food production/processing facilities, these endospore-forming Firmicutes have also been isolated from plants, in addition to humans and animals specimens (blood and fecal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliver et al., 2018</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolfgang et al., 2012</xref>), most likely as a consequence of exposure to contaminated soil. Although KF11 and the <italic>S. newyorkensis</italic>-derived HdH peptide share only 50% sequence homology, keys amino acids were conserved; these included peptide amino acids comprising a central TCR recognition ‘hotspot’ (p4Ser and p6 Glu) in addition to residues that shaped the solvent-exposed peptide arch (p5Pro and p9Pro) that helped both stabilize interactions with HLA-B*57:01 and allowed AGA1 TCR binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>). Through further rounds of database interrogation, a panel of closely related HdH peptide variants were identified from distinct bacterial genera, of which the majority were also recognised by AGA1-expressing T cell clones. Interestingly, one of these peptides (LAITPEIAPYF) mapped to <italic>Bacillus massiliosenegalensis</italic>, a species previously isolated from the gut microbiome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramasamy et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, our findings raise the question that if encountered in a HLA-B*57:01-restricted context, could haloacid dehydrogenase peptides originating from these diverse microbes influence the frequencies and/or functionality of AGA1 TCR expressing T cells in vivo?</p><p>It is known that certain bacteria, either directly via bacterial-derived LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tripathy et al., 2017</xref>), CpG DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Speiser et al., 2005</xref>) and metabolites generated by specific microbiome-resident populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luu et al., 2018</xref>) or indirectly, via the induction of cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wong and Pamer, 2001</xref>), can affect the functionality or non-specifically drive the expansion of CD8+ T cells. Whether virus-specific CD8+ T cell populations are occasionally expanded by bacterial-derived antigens in an MHC-restricted context is less well understood. Although this question remains unanswered here for the AGA1 TCR, CD8+ T cells that specifically cross-react with both self-peptide and commensal microbes have been reported, mainly in the context of autoimmune disease. In the murine NOD MyD88-/- model of type I diabetes, the disease-associated enrichment of fusobacteria encoding a peptide with homology to the islet-specific glucose-6-phosphate catalytic subunit-relate (IGRP) protein, reportedly drove activation of IGRP-reactive CD8+ T cells that promoted development of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tai et al., 2016</xref>). A subset of autoreactive CD8+ T cells with specificity for an islet-derived peptide epitope that cross-reacts with a peptide derived from the commensal organism <italic>Bacteroides stercoris,</italic> has also been reported in human type I diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">ImMaDiab Study Group et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence that virus-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies are influenced by bacterial-derived peptides is less clear. In a murine study, elevated numbers of lung-derived MCMV-specific CD8 T cells was attributed to indigenous microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sprent et al., 2000</xref>), and although subclinical MCMV reactivation in lung tissue as a contributing factor was not fully excluded, heterologous recognition of peptides from endogenous microbes sharing consensus motifs with MCMV was proposed as a potential driver of these cells.</p><p>HIV-specific CD8+ T cells are abundant in the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferre et al., 2010</xref>), an environment that represents a major site of HIV replication and reservoir of viral persistence, thus providing a constant source of cognate antigen in vivo. Hence, the extent, if any, to which bacterial-derived MHC class I restricted peptides would influence HIV-reactive T cell frequencies in this environment is unclear. However, T cells infiltrating the Lamina Propria and intestinal intraepithelial encounter diverse pathogenic and commensal microbes in healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isakov et al., 2009</xref>). With exposure to bacterial antigen exacerbated in HIV infection via translocation and systemic dissemination of microbial products following mucosal barrier disruption, it remains unknown if this setting allows specific HIV-reactive CD8+ T cell populations to be influenced by microbes in an MHC-restricted context, and specifically, if MHC class I proteins can present microbial peptides that inflate specific subsets of memory HIV-specific T cell populations during active disease. Additionally, determining if specific circumstances, for example, during gastrointestinal infections in healthy individuals or in patients with chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease, allow MHC-restricted microbial peptides to influence the precursor frequencies of viral-specific CD8+ T cells would be of interest. Although proposed in this study, definitive evidence that specific bacteria carrying KF11-related HdH peptides pre-select and expand AGA1-expressing CD8 positive T cells in vivo is lacking, hence further studies are required to investigate this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>EBY100</td><td>D.

HLA-B*57:03 subtype, was used to generate the MHC class I expressing yeast display platform tested in this study. Although the AGA1 TCR is restricted by the KF11 peptide in complex with HLA-B*57:01, this TCR also binds with high affinity (Kd ~5 μM) to the near-identical HLA-B*57:03-KF11 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart-Jones et al., 2012</xref>). The peptide-β2m-MHC heavy chain single chain trimer construct design was based on previously developed MHC class I yeast display scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birnbaum et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2018</xref>) and incorporated a single chain fusion display where HLA-B*57:03 heavy chain domains were included downstream of the KF11 epitope sequence and the β2m gene. Flexible GSSS linkers interconnected KF11, β2m ([GSSS]<sub>3)</sub> and the B*57:03 heavy chain regions ([GSSS]<sub>4)</sub>. To minimize linker protrusions that could affect TCR binding, mutagenesis of position 84 (Tyr &gt; Ala) in the HLA-B*57:03 alpha 1 (α1) region was performed to generate a larger linker-accommodating cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>). A DNA construct library encoding an 11 amino acid (11mer) peptide-MHC library was generated where all peptide residues were fully randomized except for the preferred HLA-B*57:01/57:03 anchor binding residues, which were restricted to Ser, Thr and Ala at position two and to Trp, Phe and Tyr at position 11 to preserve binding to HLA-B*57:03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 1997</xref>). All positions except for the anchor residues were generated using an NNK codon library. Position two utilized a DCK codon and position 11 used either a TGG codon for Trp or a TWY codon for Phe and Tyr. Two separate library inserts were generated to encode for the codon library NNKDCKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNKNNK(TGG/TWY) with theoretical nucleotide diversities of 2.1E14 and 8.4E14 for a total diversity of 1.06E15.</p><p>The peptide-HLA-B*57:03 construct library was used to generate a yeast display library detailed above as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birnbaum et al., 2014b</xref>). Briefly, freshly prepared EBY-100 electrocompetent yeast were incubated with a 5:1 ratio of pMHC insert to linearized pYAL vector by mass (~1 ug vector and ~5 ug insert per electroporation) and transformed to generate a randomized peptide library. The insert contained an equal mass mixture of the polymerase chain reaction product containing the two libraries detailed above. The final library, which was generated via 20 electroporations, was then quantified as containing ~2×10<sup>8</sup> unique transformants via limiting dilution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Selection and sequencing of HLA-B*57:03 peptide library</title><p>Each step described below was performed essentially as previously reported and was conducted with enough yeast to ensure &gt;10 fold coverage of the previous step’s theoretical diversity.

The library was then induced in SGCAA media, pH 5.5, and allowed to incubate while shaking at 250 rpm at 20°C for 48 hr.</p><p>After induction, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> yeast were assayed for induction by staining for a C-terminal Myc epitope tag placed between the MHC and Aga2. Next, yeast corresponding to &gt;10 fold diversity of the initial library or the yeast from the previous round of selection were incubated with streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec 130-048-102), washed in PBS + 0.5% BSA, and passed through a Miltenyi LS column (Miltenyi Biotec 130-042-401) to remove non-specific binders. Yeast were then incubated with streptavidin beads co-incubated with 400 nM biotinylated TCR, washed in PBS+BSA, and then run through an LS column. Retained yeast that were then eluted from the column, washed into SDCAA, and re-cultured. Selections were repeated for an additional two rounds. Finally, a more stringent final round of selection was conducted by staining yeast with 400 nM TCR streptavidin tetramers, incubating with anti-fluorophore microbeads, and sorting via magnetic selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Analysis via next-generation sequencing</title><p>Peptide enrichment and overall motifs were analyzed via next-generation sequencing as previously described. Briefly, plasmids from 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> yeast per round of selection were recovered from selected yeast (Zymoprep II kit, Zymo Research). Peptide sequences were then amplified via PCR. During the course of PCR, individual barcode sequences (to deconvolve rounds of selection) and random 8mer sequences (to increase sequence diversity) were added to the amplicons. The product of these PCRs were used in a second PCR to affix Illumina sequencing adapters. Final PCR products were gel purified, pooled, quantitated, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using a v2 2 × 150 nt kit with PhiX DNA spiked in to ensure sufficient sequence diversity for high-quality reads. As detailed previously data processing, analysis, and predictions were as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birnbaum et al., 2014b</xref>). The forward and reverse sequencing data were used to create a single sequence of the paired-end reads using PandaSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Masella et al., 2012</xref>), deconvoluted into each round of selection by barcode, and trimmed for analysis using Geneious version 6 (Biomatters Inc). In order to correct for potential PCR or sequencing errors, sequences differing by one nucleotide from the most abundant were coalesced. Amino acid frequencies for each round were determined after translation and removal of sequences containing frame shifts or stop codons. Predictions from the profile-based search of the NCBI non-redundant protein data database (downloaded June 21, 2013) was preformed using the statistics from the third round using an amino acid frequency cut-off of 0.01.

The central issue addressed by the study holds interest for the broader community. We believe that TCR cross-reactivity is informative for understanding the broader implications of adaptive immunity. It is especially interesting that the presented peptide, KAFSPEVIPMF, is not in the set of top peptides enriched after sorting, suggesting that pMHC/TCR affinity is not the whole story of T cell activation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MHC yeast display-interrogation of a conserved, HIV specific TCR reveals cross-reactivity to bacteria-diverse peptides&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Brian Baker (Reviewer #2); David Kranz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fischer et al. reports fascinating results from a technical tour-de-force studying TCR cross-reactivity. The paper as written is concise, clearly presented, and, while dense, is approachable. Materials and methods are detailed appropriately, experiments are properly executed, and results are correctly interpreted. Detailing TCR cross-reactivity in this way is informative and the concluding speculations are intriguing. An interesting observation is that the presented peptide, KAFSPEVIPMF, is not in the set of top peptides enriched after sorting, confirming the nuance that pMHC/TCR affinity is not the whole story of T cell activation.</p><p>Overall, the consensus of the reviewers was that the manuscript is well-written and experiments are rigorously performed, demonstrating considerable technical finesse. The central issue addressed by the study holds interest for the broader community. While generating support for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers thought that revising the manuscript would provide needed additional detail and dial back some more speculative conclusions and discussion. Additional experiments are not deemed necessary. Important points meriting additional discussion and consideration include the limitations of a yeast-display library that covers only a tiny percentage of the possible sequence space and the representation of the eliciting KF11 peptide in the library and its apparent failure to enrich. Also, while quite intriguing, the synthesis of the presented results do not fully support the broad conclusion stated in the title: &quot;MHC yeast display-interrogation of a conserved, HIV specific TCR reveals cross-reactivity to bacteria-diverse peptides&quot;. Confirming the microbiota connection would require additional experimental scope. Therefore, the reviewers feel that a more conservative tone in the Discussion should be embraced in revision.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) On the note above, do p-MHC binding affinity <italic>predictions</italic> (e.g., NetMHC or similar) track with the data? Given the results in Figure 3B, can the authors comment on how incorporating MHC binding affinity predictions into the database scanning would add to the process?</p><p>2) Subsection “Cross-reactive potential of AGA1+ T cell clones to library- and database-derived peptide hits.” – clone 1.2. How homologous is this TCR? This should be somewhere, to include loop sequences.

Although we have left some of the speculative discussion in place, we do specifically state, on two occasions in this amended draft, that we have not shown in vivo evidence that the AGA1 TCR is stimulated by the HLA-B*57:01 restricted bacterial-derived HdH peptides (Discussion: paragraph five and six). We have also adjusted the title to reflect that peptides which are sequence identical to microbial peptides are recognised by the TCR to help state more accurate claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) On the note above, do p-MHC binding affinity predictions (e.g., NetMHC or similar) track with the data? Given the results in Figure 3B, can the authors comment on how incorporating MHC binding affinity predictions into the database scanning would add to the process?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point that we have now addresses in the revised manuscript. We have added the specific section to Results, subsection “Recognition HdH peptides by AGA1-expressing T cell clones” paragraph one. There is a negative, albeit very weak (R2= -0.18), correlation between NetMHCPan4.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan/) predicted binding affinities for KF11 and bacterial HdH peptides and the ELISA-generated binding data (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). One factor that is likely to confound the strength of this correlation is a lack of data generated using either in vitro binding assays for HLA-B*57 and/or from mass spectrometry-based peptide elution studies for binding of longer peptides to MHC, and this would potentially limit the predictive power of NetMHC when such peptides are considered. As an aside to this, we have also ranked the HdH and KF11 peptides according to the strength of peptide binding ELISA data and patterns are evident. The strongest HdH binders carry in their peptide sequences: p2 Thr/Ser (preferred anchors), p3Iso, p7Iso and a Pro as p8 or 9 (but not both) and p10Try. Peptides in the medium and low binding categories although containing some combinations of these residues have noted single amino acid changes and/or combinations of changes in these positions that could modulate binding strength. Supplementary file 1–table 4 has been added to summarize this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Cross-reactive potential of AGA1+ T cell clones to library- and database-derived peptide hits.” – clone 1.2. How homologous is this TCR? This should be somewhere, to include loop sequences. Is there anything to be learned regarding identity/homology in the sequences and responses to the peptides?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the omission of this information. The relevant sequences have now been added to the manuscript (Supplementary file 1–Table 3) and is now referenced in the Results section (subsection “Cross-reactive potential of AGA1+ T cell clones to library- and database-derived peptide hits.”, last paragraph). The Vbeta19 chains of the AGA1 TCR, which corresponds to clone 1.1, is 100% sequence identical across the CDR3 and J region of the V beta 19 chain expressed by clone 1.2. One amino acid difference distinguishes the TCR alpha chains of AGA1 (clone 1.1) and clone 1.2 – this maps to within the J region (underlined).</p><p>This residue is outside the peptide-MHC binding interface described previously for the AGA1-B*57:03-KF11 co-complex (noted here in italics). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this change causes subtle differences to the recognition of these peptides, the functional data we generated in vitro using clones 1.1 and 1.2 did not suggest any discernible differences in patterns of HdH peptide recognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The first involves the statistical probability of properly identifying cross-reactive peptides from a library where the sequence-space that is screened is only one in over a million (i.e. library of 10e8, where theoretical diversity is 10e15). Thus, most cross-reacting peptides are likely missed. In fact, one presumes that they did not even isolate the wild type FK11 or its variants and there needs to be a discussion of this.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the functional library cannot fully cover the theoretical diversity of cross-reactive peptides. Although the library design generated here allowed for KF11 to be present, it was not found in either the naive library nor in subsequent rounds of AGA1 TCR-enriched libraries. Hence, the yeast clone was probably not present as a transformant in this study. However, the strength of this method is that the restricting peptide ligand doesn’t have to be in the library – using algorithms and statistics, it is possible to pull out at the restricting peptides, in addition to related peptides, from available databases. This is exactly what we observed for the KF11 peptide which emerged as the top database-mined peptide hit using library peptide-led database searches. We have added a discussion to this effect (Discussion paragraph three).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In a similar way, the authors need to discuss whether they used the FK11 sequence to search the microbial database and what they identified in this search.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that simple algorithms based on KF11 peptide could have informed hunts for additional peptide ligands. However, as KF11 and the HdH peptides share only 50% sequence similarity, it’s unlikely that they would have been mined using more simplistic searches based on the sequence of KF11 alone. The MHC-yeast display/TCR-informed database searches enables more focused and definitive screens given that algorithms generated are data-led and take into account the broad range of peptides that can physically bind the MHC and that are also physically recognised by the TCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A significant concern is whether identifying the Mic 1/HdH sequences as cross-reacting ligands for Aga1 TCR from their search has any physiological significance. Or, is it just the likelihood of finding peptides that cross-react due to the now well understood principles that a single TCR cross-reacts with many peptide ligands. S. newyorkensis is not an intracellular human pathogen, nor a known commensal organism. To have functional significance one would imagine very large burdens would need to be encountered in order to have sufficient peptide presented through APC uptake, processing, and presentation by HLA-B57.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the reviewers comments and can only speculate as to whether these bacterial antigens can elicit MHC restricted T cell cross-reactivity in vivo. Although <italic>S. newyorkensis</italic> is not a commensal, nor is it an intracellular pathogen, this microbe has been reported as a pathogen that can cause infection in humans, and there is also potential for exposure via environmental contamination, especially from outdoor terrains, most notably soil. Also, as pointed out in the manuscript, we identified and tested a number of additional HdH peptides from other Bacilli, and a variety of peptides from genera/species other than <italic>S. newyorkensis</italic> were recognised by the AGA1 TCR. Most interestingly, and included in this group, was a HdH peptide derived from a commensal known as <italic>Bacillus massiliosenegalensis</italic>, raising the likelihood that at least one population of microbiome commensals carry a HdH peptide in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiment with lysates from S. newyorkensis tries to address this, but it is not even clear that the HdH peptide is the actual ligand in that experiment. While it will be experimentally very difficult to prove that S. newyorkensis has an influence in vivo on T cells that bear Aga1-related TCRs, it would at least be useful to know that the stimulating ligand in the lysate was indeed from HdH. If HdH cannot be deleted, perhaps it could be introduced into another “non-inducing” bacterial host to show lysates of that stimulate Aga1 T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to assure the reviewer that the lysates from <italic>S. newyorkensis</italic> comprised the only bacterial lysates that was well recognised by the AGA1 TCR – this observation was reproducible during different rounds of biological repeats and for clones 1.1 and 1.2. However, we do accept that recognition of the lysate requires more detailed validation. We will endeavour to address the nature of the ligand once the post-COVID restrictions allow us to pursue this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
