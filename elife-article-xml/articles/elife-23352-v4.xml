during mitosis. In most organisms, centromeres lack defined genetic features. Rather, they are specified epigenetically by a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. The Mis18 complex, comprising the Mis18α:Mis18β subcomplex and M18BP1, is crucial for CENP-A homeostasis. It recruits the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres and primes it for CENP-A loading. We report here that a specific arrangement of Yippee domains in a human Mis18α:Mis18β 4:2 hexamer binds two copies of M18BP1 through M18BP1’s 140 N-terminal residues. Phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at two conserved sites in this region destabilizes binding to Mis18α:Mis18β, limiting complex formation to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using an improved viral 2A peptide co-expression strategy, we demonstrate that CDK1 controls Mis18 complex recruitment to centromeres by regulating oligomerization of M18BP1 through the Mis18α:Mis18β scaffold.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23352.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23352.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>CENP-A</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AdG 669686 RECEPIANCE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 1093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Dongqing</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Priyanka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The stoichiometry and mechanism of interactions of the Mis18 complex with M18BP1 was analysed to unveil the molecular basis of new CENP-A deposition during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all eukaryotes, faithful chromosome duplication and segregation to the daughter cells is essential for cell viability and development. During mitosis, chromosomes bi-orient on the mitotic spindle, a structure made of microtubules, microtubule motors, and microtubule-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heald and Khodjakov, 2015</xref>). Chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules through large multisubunit assemblies known as kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pesenti et al., 2016</xref>). Besides microtubule binding, kinetochores harness a poorly understood molecular mechanism of ‘error correction’ that leads to selective stabilization of bi-oriented attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). Upon completion of bi-orientation, removal of sister chromatid cohesion allows the separation of the sister chromatids to the two newly forming daughter cells.</p><p>How kinetochores assemble, and how their position on chromosomes is maintained generation after generation, is an important and partly unresolved challenge. Kinetochores assemble on centromeres, unique chromosomal loci characterized by a strong enrichment of the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</xref>). Centromeres in different organisms often consist of long arrays of repetitive sequences, such as the human 171-basepair α-satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</xref>). However, centromeres are often found associated with non-repetitive and non-evolutionarily conserved sequences in different organisms. Furthermore, there are instances in humans and other species of neo-centromeres that become established on non-repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</xref>). These examples indicate that the sequence of centromeric DNA contributes only marginally to centromere identity.</p><p>There is now general agreement that CENP-A itself is an epigenetic factor for specification of centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cleveland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Rop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stellfox et al., 2013</xref>). CENP-A is required for the recruitment of several inner (centromere-proximal) kinetochore proteins, now generally referred to as constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okada et al., 2006</xref>), and thus acts as the kinetochore’s foundation. CENP-A, together with other CCAN proteins, also promotes the recruitment of specialized machinery devoted to its own incorporation in chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</xref>). This limits incorporation of new CENP-A to the position of the existing CENP-A domain, thus preserving centromere identity. Importantly, the amount of CENP-A at centromeres is halved during DNA replication, and the ensuing CENP-A ‘vacancy’ may be filled with histone H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunleavy et al., 2011</xref>). The reduction in CENP-A is compensated with new CENP-A deposition after cell division, in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bodor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shelby et al., 2000</xref>), likely in a reaction that replaces H3.3 with CENP-A.</p><p>The Mis18 complex is an evolutionarily conserved functional unit of the CENP-A loading machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2004</xref>). Vertebrate Mis18 complex consists of Mis18α and Mis18β, which are non-redundant and physically interacting paralogs, and M18BP1 (also known as KNL2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>). The Mis18 complex interacts with the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foltz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and with CCAN subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dambacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moree et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shono et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stellfox et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

It contains a conserved 50-residue SANT (Swi3, Ada2, N-CoR, and TFIIIB) domain and a 100-residue SANT-associated (SANTA) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maddox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The high content of unstructured regions suggests that M18BP1 functions as a hub for multiple protein-protein interactions. Indeed, CENP-C, CENP-I, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), MgcRacGAP, and the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) KAT7 are suggested to interact with M18BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dambacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lagana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moree et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohzeki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shono et al., 2015</xref>), but the molecular details of these interactions remain poorly defined.</p><p>On the other hand, significant progress has been made in the characterization of the interaction of M18BP1 with Mis18α and Mis18β. Mis18α and Mis18β have similar domain structures, with an N-terminal unstructured region, a Yippee domain in the middle region, and a C-terminal coiled-coil. Recent studies of the single <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Mis18 ortholog and of the human Mis18α:Mis18β complex suggested that Mis18 proteins form tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). A segment of M18BP1 comprising ~380 N-terminal residues was shown to be responsible for a physical interaction with the Mis18α:Mis18β complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohzeki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stellfox et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The assembly of the CENP-A deposition machinery in the G1 phase is regulated by inhibitory CDK phosphorylation of CENP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), HJURP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and M18BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2012</xref>). Moderate CDK activity through the S and G2 phases and high CDK activity in M phase of the cell cycle keep the CENP-A loading machinery disassembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2012</xref>). Degradation of Cyclin B at anaphase and the ensuing decline in CDK activity reverts this condition, allowing physical interactions of the CENP-A loading machinery. The Mis18 complex starts localizing to the CENP-A domain from anaphase and recruits HJURP and new CENP-A in early G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>).

We show that M18BP1 binds Mis18α:Mis18β through two sub-regions in its N-terminal 140 amino acids. Single CDK phosphorylation sites in each sub-region, Thr40 and Ser110, regulate the interaction, with phosphorylation largely reducing the affinity of M18BP1 for Mis18α:Mis18β, and phosphomimetic mutations abolishing the CENP-A loading activity of M18BP1. Thus, our results identify a mechanism to limit CENP-A loading to the G1 phase of the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> contains two sequential binding regions for Mis18α:Mis18β</title><p>We performed amylose-resin pull-down assays with purified M18BP1-MBP (maltose binding protein) fusion variants and Mis18α:Mis18β to identify the M18BP1 sequence responsible for this interaction. The N-terminal 140 residues of M18BP1 were sufficient for Mis18α:Mis18β binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a list of constructs used in this study), thus narrowing down the binding site for the Mis18α:Mis18β complex within the N-terminal region of M18BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohzeki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stellfox et al., 2016</xref>). A sequence alignment of vertebrate M18BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) revealed that the N-terminal 140 residues of M18BP1 contain two highly conserved CDK phosphorylation motifs at positions Thr40 and Ser110 that are surrounded by other conserved residues, and a less conserved CDK motif at position Thr4. Divergent sequences around residue 50–70 of M18BP1 create a gap separating the two conserved regions. To identify the region responsible for M18BP1 binding, we split M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> into two fragments (1–60 and 61–140). Both regions retained the ability to bind Mis18α:Mis18β, indicating that each region retains measurable binding affinity for Mis18α:Mis18β, with M18BP1<sup>1–60</sup> binding apparently more strongly than M18BP1<sup>61–140</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

For this, we modified the 2A-peptide co-expression system to allow co-expression of EGFP-M18BP1 segments and of mCherry-Mis18α. 2A-peptides are 20-amino-acid viral peptides possessing ‘ribosome skipping’ activity and are widely used to co-express proteins in eukaryotic cells when introduced between coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Felipe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). P2A (Porcine Teschovirus-1 2A) and T2A (Thosea asigna virus 2A) are the most efficient of the known 2A-peptide sequences.

Since their experiments were carried out with bacterially expressed proteins, whereas we used proteins expressed in insect cells, we asked if the inconsistency of hydrodynamic analyses resulted from differences in the host used for recombinant expression of the Mis18 complex. We therefore co-expressed 6His-Mis18α and MBP-Mis18β in <italic>E. coli</italic> with a bicistronic expression system. After removal of affinity tags, the <italic>E. coli</italic> and insect cell expressed Mis18α:Mis18β complexes showed essentially identical elution profiles in analytical SEC experiments at two different concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The two complexes also behaved essentially identically in sedimentation velocity AUC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are in agreement with our contention that the Mis18 complex is hexameric. Untagged Mis18α and Mis18β were insoluble when expressed in isolation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (unpublished data), but tagging them with 6His-MBP delivered soluble products. 6His-MBP-Mis18β appeared monodisperse in analytical SEC experiments, whereas 6His-MBP-Mis18α appeared polydisperse, despite good purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Removing the 6His-MBP-tag without prior mixing of 6His-MBP-Mis18α and 6His-MBP-Mis18β caused precipitation of both Mis18α and Mis18β, indicative of poor stability of the individual untagged subunits. Tag cleavage after subunit mixing at 1:1 molar ratio yielded (in addition to a precipitate that was removed by centrifugation) Mis18α:Mis18β complex that eluted from an analytical SEC column at the same volume (~1.45 ml) as the Mis18α:Mis18β complex obtained by co-expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> or insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Finally, we repeated these SEC experiments using the detergent-containing SEC buffer reported by Nardi and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>), again without observing significant changes in the elution profile of the Mis18α:Mis18β complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23352.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Assembly mechanism of Mis18α:Mis18β-hexamer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analytical SEC results of insect-cell-expressed Mis18α:Mis18β (blue), <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed Mis18α:Mis18β (green), Mis18α<sup>1-191</sup>:Mis18β<sup>1-189</sup> (yellow-green), Mis18α<sup>78-191</sup>:Mis18β<sup>73-189</sup> (orange), 6His-Mis18α<sup>192-233</sup>-mCherry:Mis18β<sup>190-229</sup> (red), Mis18α<sup>192-233</sup>-mCherry:Mis18β<sup>190-229</sup> (purple), 6His-Mis18α<sup>192-233</sup>:Mis18β<sup>190-229</sup>-MBP (black).

However, in the absence of a molecular basis for the interaction of M18BP1 with Mis18α:Mis18β, the details of this regulation had remained unclear. We show that each of the two Mis18α:Mis18β binding regions of M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> (1-60 and 61–140) contains a highly conserved CDK-phosphorylation motif. Using a series of purified M18BP1 proteins with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutations, we demonstrated that Thr40 and Ser110 are targets of the CDK1:Cyclin B complex. When introduced in full length M18BP1, the phosphomimetic mutations T40D and S110E reduced recruitment of M18BP1, prevented recruitment of Mis18α to centromeres, and interfered with new CENP-A deposition. These defects are very similar to the defects observed upon expression of EGFP-M18BP1<sup>141–1132</sup> in cells depleted of endogenous M18BP1, and point to M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> as a controlled interaction module for complex formation with Mis18α:Mis18β.</p><p>We used biochemical reconstitution to gain further insights into the organization of the Mis18 complex. The single-peak elution profile from analytical SEC and the single-peak sedimentation-coefficient-distribution profile from AUC of the Mis18α:Mis18β:M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup>-MBP complex indicate that the reconstituted samples are stable and homogeneous. We used these samples to determine the stoichiometry of human Mis18α:Mis18β and of the Mis18 core complex by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stankovic et al., 2016</xref> AUC. The Mis18α:Mis18β complex is a hexamer containing four Mis18α and two Mis18β subunits, and it binds two M18BP1<sup>1-140</sup> subunits. The functional importance of oligomerization of Mis18α and Mis18β for CENP-A loading has been highlighted in two additional recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). The single fission yeast ortholog of Mis18 uses both the Yippee and the C-terminal coiled-coil domains to form homo tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). Full-length human Mis18α and Mis18β, on the other hand, have been reported to oligomerize via their C-terminal coiled-coil domains to form 2:2 heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>). Our results are inconsistent with this recent report. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al. (2016)</xref> derived the molecular mass of the Mis18α:Mis18β complex through the Siegel-Monty equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Siegel and Monty, 1966</xref>) with estimates of the Stokes radius (from SEC experiments) and of the sedimentation coefficient (from glycerol-gradient ultracentrifugation experiments) derived from Western blot analysis of SDS-PAGE, an approach that we deem more error prone in comparison to our combined sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium AUC analyses. We show that recombinant Mis18α:Mis18β complexes produced in insect cells and <italic>E coli</italic> have essentially identical hydrodynamic properties in different buffers and concentrations. Thus, the hexamer is the prevalent form of the Mis18α:Mis18β complex.</p><p>Our biochemical assays show that the Yippee domains of Mis18α and Mis18β are both required for achieving a strong interaction with M18BP1<sup>1-140</sup>. This suggests that the stoichiometry of Mis18β in the Mis18 complex limits the number of bound M18BP1, because two Mis18α:Mis18β Yippee domain hetero-dimers can be formed in one hexamer, and each can bind a copy of M18BP1<sup>1-140</sup>. Our results are consistent with evidence that M18BP1 interacts with the Mis18α:Mis18β complex only when both Mis18α and Mis18β subunits are co-expressed in a yeast-three-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>). The 4:2:2 stoichiometry of the Mis18 complex likely provides a base to understand the assembly of the CENP-A loading machinery, and further structural analysis will have to examine the details of this unique octameric complex.</p><p>Overexpression of EGFP-M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> in HeLa cells had a strong dominant-negative effect on centromere localization of Mis18α:Mis18β and on CENP-A loading, suggesting that EGFP-M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> binds to Mis18α:Mis18β in HeLa cells and prevents its interaction with endogenous M18BP1. This result also indicates that the complex of EGFP-M18BP1<sup>1–140</sup> with Mis18α:Mis18β cannot localize to centromeres. Indeed, we observed that M18BP1<sup>141–1132</sup>, which is unable to bind with Mis18α:Mis18β, localized to centromeres, although weakly, arguing that M18BP1<sup>141–1132</sup> contains interaction modules for autonomous localization to centromeres. Mouse M18BP1 and frog M18BP1 isoforms were shown to interact with the CCAN protein CENP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dambacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moree et al., 2011</xref>) through a binding domain located between the SANTA and SANT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dambacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stellfox et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrated that forced dimerization of M18BP1<sup>141-1132</sup> using GST-tag increased its localization to centromeres in HeLa cells, supporting the hypothesis that Mis18α:Mis18β-mediated dimerization of M18BP1 is required to strengthen the interaction between the Mis18 complex and centromeric recruiters. However, GST-mediated dimerization did not rescue centromeric localization of EGFP-M18BP1<sup>141–1132</sup> to the levels of full length EGFP-M18BP1, indicating that the interaction with Mis18α:Mis18β contributes to the localization mechanism even beyond dimerization. A physical interaction of Mis18β with the CENP-C C-terminal region might account for increased binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stellfox et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Combining our findings with those of recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nardi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohzeki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stellfox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>), we conclude that full assembly of the Mis18 complex is important for its function. Our analysis demonstrates that the phosphorylation of Thr40 and Ser110 of M18BP1 by CDK1 prevents assembly of the Mis18 complex, thus describing a crucial mechanism to temporally restrict CENP-A loading to early G1 phase, when the levels of Cyclin B rapidly decline after their mitotic peak. In conclusion, the available evidence depicts a complex binding mechanism for the centromere localization of the Mis18 complex, with multiple binding interfaces and a complex regulation by mitotic kinases. Here, we have dissected the regulation of a crucial element of this interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmid pETDuet-8His was generated from pETDuet-1 (Novagen) by adding the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of 8His-tag immediately after the <italic>Xho</italic>I site using an modified inverse PCR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erster and Liscovitch, 2010</xref>).

The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: CREST/anticentromere antibodies (human autoimmune serum, Antibodies, Inc.), anti-M18BP1 (Bethyl A302-825A), anti-rabbit Rodamine red–conjugated, anti-human DyLight 405–conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol mounting media (EMD Millipore) and imaged using a 60× oil immersion objective lens on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope. Quantification of centromere signals were performed using the software Fiji with a script from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bodor et al., 2012</xref>) with modifications for semi-automated processing. Briefly, average projections were made from z-stacks of recorded images. Centromere spots were chosen based on the parameters of shape, size, and intensity using the images obtained with CREST-staining, and their positions were recorded. The mean intensity value of adjacent pixels of a centromere spot was subtracted as background intensity from the mean intensity value of the centromere spot. Statistical analysis of the quantified intensity was performed and the plots were generated with the software Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation experiment</title><p>HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Cells were treated with 50 ng/mL doxycycline (Sigma) for 18 hr and then treated with both 50 ng/mL doxycycline and 9 µM CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (Merck) for additional 6 hr before harvest. Cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 75 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF and Protease Inhibitor Mix HP Plus (SERVA), lysed using Bioruptor Plus sonication device (Diagenode) and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant containing 2 mg protein was incubated with 7.5 µl GFP-Trap_A beads (Chromotek) for 2 hr at 4°C. The beads were washed thrice with the lysis buffer containing 300 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM NaCl. Proteins were eluted by adding SDS sample buffer and were analyzed using Tricine-SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. EGFP-M18BP1, mCherry-M18BP1, mCherry-Mis18α, Mis18β and vinculin were detected using following antibodies: anti-GFP (Abcam, AB6556), anti-mCherry (Novus, NBP1-96752), anti-Mis18β (Atlas, HPA052271), anti-vinculin (Sigma, V9131) anti-mouse-HRP (Amersham, NXA931-1ML) and anti-rabbit-HRP (Amersham, NXA934-1ML).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analytical size-exclusion chromatography</title><p>Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments were performed on calibrated Superose 6 increase 5/150 GL column or Superose 200 increase 5/150 GL column (GE Healthcare).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;CDK-regulated oligomerization of M18BP1 on a Mis18 hexamer is necessary for CENP-A loading&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Asifa Akhtar, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated that this manuscript presents a thorough biochemical characterization of the Mis18 heterohexamer and that specific M18BP1 phosphosites regulate Mis18α/β binding. Although these contributions are worthwhile, the fact that M18BP1 phosphorylation regulates Mis18α/β binding has been reported previously which impinges on the overall novelty of the manuscript. Moreover, since very different experimental protocols for reconstitutions are used between this and an earlier study, it remains possible that the complex may exist in different stoichiometry, this issue still remains open for discussion at this stage. Overall, the reviewers were of the opinion that the manuscript represents a modest advance in the field at this stage and discussed that the manuscript could perhaps be improved either by: (1) firmly establishing the biological role of the hexamer vs. a tetramer and by providing a better explanation for the difference between their results and the previous literature, or (2) from better delineating the role of the dimerization of M18BP1 via the Mis18 complex.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a very thorough study showing the dependency of Mis18α/Mis18β localisation to the centromeres and the M18BP1 phosphorylation by CDK1/CycB. Their identification of the phosphorylation sites and corresponding mutations for those sites clearly indicates a functional relevance of this modification on M18BP1 and its interaction with Mis18α/Mis18β. Furthermore, they have validated their 2A-peptide dependent assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) carefully showing they have a robust and reliable method for their assays.</p><p>As they were addressing the minimally required fraction of the M18BP1 they discovered that 1-140aa was sufficient for the Mis18α/Mis18β interaction but this fraction of the protein was showing a dominant negative effect on the endogenous M18BP1 however there is not any assay showing that this could be by direct binding to the endogenous protein or not.

In order to make any claim regarding differences and their significance (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) it is meaningless to compare the variance in centromere intensities. When enough centromeres are sampled there will always be a significance difference. What matters is the variance in the experiment itself. i.e. are the means of replicate experiments significantly different? Without this, these quantifications are not informative.</p><p>6) Final section:</p><p>The argument of oligomerization and its benefit to M18BP1 recruitment is weakly supported by data. Essentially, the only evidence in support of this is the slight increase in M18BP1 localization when it is forced to dimerize by fusion to GST in the absence of its ability to dimerize via Mis18 proteins (by deletion of the N-terminal 140aa).</p><p>This experiment is however, poorly controlled. First, as I outlined above the level of significance of the difference in the signal intensities cannot be determined by comparing the variance in centromeres across cells in a signal experiment. Instead, the reproducibility of the difference between experiments should be tested. Secondly, it is not clear from this experiment whether the perceived increase in M18BP1 centromere localization by GST dimerization compensates for the lack of dimerization via the Mis18 proteins. In other words, does GST play a role here that would otherwise be provided by the Mis18 proteins? One way to test this is to fuse GST to full length M18BP1 and test its effect on localization. In this case, if the authors´ hypothesis is correct, then M18BP1 dimerization via M18alpha and beta is functional and further dimerization via GST would have no further contribution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Centromere identity is epigenetically specified by nucleosomes in which H3 has been substituted for the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A. Faithful, site-specific transmission of CENP-A chromatin from one generation to the next is essential for chromosome segregation and long-term genome stability. This process is carried out by the CENP-A specific chaperone HJURP which is targeted to the proper locus by the Mis18 complex (Mis18α, Mis18β, and M18BP1) immediately following mitosis during early G1. Cell cycle regulated assembly and centromere recruitment of the Mis18 complex is essential for centromere inheritance, and a major focus of recent work in the centromere field has been to understand the basis of this regulation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that Cdk phosphorylation prevents premature recruitment of the Mis18 complex to centromeres during G2 and mitosis (Silva, et al. 2012). This was extended by the demonstration that Cdk phosphorylation of M18BP1 prevents recruitment of Mis18α/β to the N-terminal 383 amino acids of M18BP1 (McKinley and Cheeseman, 2014). In this manuscript, Pan, et al. show that of the residues mutated by McKinley and Cheeseman, two of them in particular, T40 and S110, inhibit the direct interaction of M18BP1 with Mis18α/β when phosphorylated.</p><p>M18BP1 must associate with Mis18α/β to target the complex to G1 centromeres thus it is important to understand how the complex is assembled. Previous work using size exclusion chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation led to the proposal that the Mis18 complex comprises a Mis18 heterotetramer (2α:2β) formed by their C-terminal coiled-coil domains bound to an unknown number of M18BP1 molecules (Nardi, et al. 2016). In this work, Pan, et al. use sedimentation velocity and equilibrium ultracentrifugation to determine that the Mis18 complex comprises a Mis18 heterohexamer (4α:2β), which in turn can bind 2 copies of the M18BP1 N-terminus. The authors argue that a Mis18 hexamer is the true stoichiometry because the methods used in the previous study are more error-prone. In addition, they suggest that the previous study may have obtained a 2:2 stoichiometry because they combined a 1:1 molar ratio of separately purified Mis18α and Mis18β rather than coexpressing them in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>The major scientific contributions in this manuscript are 1) the biochemical characterization of the Mis18 heterohexamer which clarifies previous studies and 2) the specific M18BP1 phosphosites that regulate Mis18α/β binding. Although these contributions are worthwhile and the biochemical studies are well done it is not clear whether this work warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> given the relatively modest advance in our understanding of Mis18 complex function in centromere formation.</p><p>1) The reason for the discrepancy between the stoichiometry measured by Pan, et al. and Nardi, et al. remains unclear. By size exclusion, Nardi et al. also appear to observe a mono-dispersed species with a migration consistent with their calculated molecular weight. Pan, et al. argue based on their analyses that the Mis18 complex adopts an elongated conformation, leading to its earlier elution in size exclusion chromatography. Therefore, if anything I would expect a molecular weight calculation based on SEC elution of this complex to overestimate rather than underestimate its stoichiometry. In the absence of data supporting the idea that the stoichiometry of the complex is 'titratable,' I also don't find the notion that Nardi et al. observed a tetramer simply because they mixed Mis18α and Mis18β in a 1:1 ratio compelling. If the ratio were off, presumably Nardi et al. would have seen a population at equilibrium containing some hexamer and some monomer/dimer/trimer. The difference in observed species may likely be due to the different expression systems used (bacterial vs. eukaryotic) and resulting differences in protein modifications/folding/etc., but there may also be some interesting biology in the differences. On the other hand, elaborating on the technical differences between the methods to clarify why the Siegel-Monty method is more error-prone would be helpful.</p><p>I don't think it's specifically up to the authors in this paper to resolve the reason for this discrepancy, but given that it's not clear whether we're looking at precisely the same complex as in Nardi et al. I think it's important for the authors to provide some additional characterization of the hexamer. Is the coiled-coil domain involved in hexamerization? Do the coiled-coil mutations described by Nardi et al. affect hexamer formation? Is the hexamer comprised of a Mis18α/β tetrameric core mediated by coiled coils with additional Mis18α bound by a different mechanism (e.g., the Yippee domain, which is also used for tetramerization in SpMis18)? The Musacchio lab has made extensive use of cross-linking/mass spectrometry in the past to understand the organization of multi-protein complexes – perhaps this could shed light on differences between the Nardi and Pan Mis18 complexes.</p><p>2) Although it's clear that Mis18 complex assembly is required for its recruitment, it is not clear whether the cell cycle timing of its recruitment is strictly determined by regulating the timing of complex assembly or whether regulation of some additional interaction plays a role. Silva, et al. found that mutating 24 putative Cdk sites (including S110 but not T40) in M18BP1 uncoupled its centromere localization from cell cycle regulation, allowing its recruitment in mitosis and G2. Can this be recapitulated by the lone S110A (or T40V/S110A) mutant characterized by Pan, et al.?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23352.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] As they were addressing the minimally required fraction of the M18BP1 they discovered that 1-140aa was sufficient for the Mis18α/Mis18β interaction but this fraction of the protein was showing a dominant negative effect on the endogenous M18BP1 however there is not any assay showing that this could be by direct binding to the endogenous protein or not.

On the basis of this analysis, we conclude that the Mis18⟨:Mis18® does not take the form of a tetramer under any of the new conditions we have investigated, including conditions that recapitulate the previous experiments of Nardi and colleagues cited by the reviewer.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>A) Our original studies were carried out with protein purified from insect cells after co-expression of the ⟨ and ® subunits. We now report expression of isolated 6His-Mis18⟨ and 6His-Mis18® in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Both subunits were expressed but insoluble. However, we were able to purify Mis18⟨ and Mis18® in <italic>E. coli</italic> by co-expression, or through addition of 6His-MBP tags to increase their solubility. Removing the 6His-MBP tag before mixing 6His-MBP-Mis18⟨ and 6His-MBP-Mis18® caused both proteins to precipitate, but if the tags were removed after mixing, the complex remained soluble. We show that <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed Mis18⟨:Mis18® complex, whether produced by co-expression or by mixing of individual subunits, has essentially the same hydrodynamic profile of the insect cell sample (by gel filtration and AUC), corresponding to a hexamer. These new analyses provide rather incontrovertible evidence that the dominant form of the Mis18⟨:Mis18® complex is the hexamer and that there are no other known conditions in which a tetramer might appear.</p><p>B) We have now characterized the mechanism of hexamer formation. In agreement with Subramanian et al., 2016, the Mis18⟨:Mis18® Yippee domain form hetero-dimers and the Mis18⟨ Yippee domain also form homo-dimers. In addition, we show by AUC experiments that the Mis18⟨:Mis18® C-terminal helices form trimers containing one ® and two ⟨ subunits. These results strongly argue against the mechanism proposed by Nardi et al. that Mis18⟨ and Mis18® form tetramer via the interaction of their C-terminal helices. These experiments, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, now allow us to propose a detailed model of the hexamer.</p><p>C) In addition, we now show the Mis18⟨:Mis18® Yippee domain heterodimer is where M18BP1 binds, explaining the 4:2:2 stoichiometry.</p><p>D) We kindly object to the statement that determining mass through sedimentation equilibrium and velocity “does not mean…superior or more likely to be correct”. To our knowledge, sedimentation equilibrium is superior to any other technique for mass determination, as it is completely independent of macromolecular shape and does not rely on any form of calibration, a step that is of course highly likely to introduce artifacts, in particular if performed with a sample as heterogeneous as the one used by Nardi and colleagues.

Previous work using size exclusion chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation led to the proposal that the Mis18 complex comprises a Mis18 heterotetramer (2α:2β) formed by their C-terminal coiled-coil domains bound to an unknown number of M18BP1 molecules (Nardi, et al. 2016).</italic> </p><p>This may read fastidious, but we think that it was Stellfox et al.2016 rather than Nardi et al. 2016 who showed Mis18⟨:Mis18® complex binds directly to (a significantly larger segment of) M18BP1.</p><p><italic>In this work, Pan, et al. use sedimentation velocity and equilibrium ultracentrifugation to determine that the Mis18 complex comprises a Mis18 heterohexamer (4α:2β), which in turn can bind 2 copies of the M18BP1 N-terminus. The authors argue that a Mis18 hexamer is the true stoichiometry because the methods used in the previous study are more error-prone. In addition, they suggest that the previous study may have obtained a 2:2 stoichiometry because they combined a 1:1 molar ratio of separately purified Mis18α and Mis18β rather than coexpressing them in eukaryotic cells.</italic> </p><p><italic>The major scientific contributions in this manuscript are 1) the biochemical characterization of the Mis18 heterohexamer which clarifies previous studies and 2) the specific M18BP1 phosphosites that regulate Mis18α/β binding. Although these contributions are worthwhile and the biochemical studies are well done it is not clear whether this work warrants publication in eLife given the relatively modest advance in our understanding of Mis18 complex function in centromere formation.</italic> </p><p>The type of thorough and detailed work presented in this manuscript tends at time to be underappreciated by editors or reviewers on the basis that it lacks conceptual novelty. We would like to argue that this type of work is instead fair rewarding because it will provide durable, trustable information to a field that has still much to discover. In this revised version of the manuscript, we have further extended our characterization of the Mis18 complex, defining in quite some detail the basis for its oligomerization and of its interaction with M18BP1. We demonstrate that M18BP1 forms dimers or oligomers via the Mis18 complex, and that this interaction is essential for CENP-A loading, because it cannot be recapitulated simply by forcing dimerization of M18BP1 via GST.</p><p><italic>1) The reason for the discrepancy between the stoichiometry measured by Pan, et al. and Nardi, et al. remains unclear. By size exclusion, Nardi et al. also appear to observe a mono-dispersed species with a migration consistent with their calculated molecular weight.</italic> </p><p>We disagree with the reviewer that Nardi et al. observed mono-dispersed species. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> from Nardi et al., the one on which their hydrodynamic analysis is based, the authors only showed Western blots (WBs) of fractions from size-exclusion chromatography separations, but never showed chromatograms, nor did they show Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE separations. It is apparent from these WBs that the indicated species often sediment or elute in more than one peak. It is our view that this evidence is incompatible with the reviewer’s conclusion that the elution profiles shown by Nardi et al. represent mono-dispersed species. We also argue that putting confidence on these profiles as a source of values for the sedimentation coefficient and the Stokes’ radius required to solve the Siegel-Monty equation (the approach used by Nardi et al.) may be a source of errors. In frankness, we hope that the reviewer will recognize that our approach cannot and should not be equaled to that used by Nardi and coworkers. We are confident that the new evidence we provide in this revised version of the manuscript will convince the reviewer.</p><p><italic>Pan, et al. argue based on their analyses that the Mis18 complex adopts an elongated conformation, leading to its earlier elution in size exclusion chromatography. Therefore, if anything I would expect a molecular weight calculation based on SEC elution of this complex to overestimate rather than underestimate its stoichiometry. In the absence of data supporting the idea that the stoichiometry of the complex is 'titratable'.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer should note that the equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out at five different concentrations (6, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 µM) without any evidence of changes in the stoichiometry of the complex. As noted in our response to reviewer 2, equilibrium sedimentation analysis is superior because it is entirely shape independent and provides a direct measurement of mass. As explained in our response to reviewer 2, we have now extended our analysis to a version of the complex expressed in and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> and show that it has the same hydrodynamic properties, at two different concentrations, of the complex purified from insect cells.</p><p><italic>I also don't find the notion that Nardi et al. observed a tetramer simply because they mixed Mis18α and Mis18β in a 1:1 ratio compelling. If the ratio were off, presumably Nardi et al. would have seen a population at equilibrium containing some hexamer and some monomer/dimer/trimer. The difference in observed species may likely be due to the different expression systems used (bacterial vs. eukaryotic) and resulting differences in protein modifications/folding/etc., but there may also be some interesting biology in the differences. On the other hand, elaborating on the technical differences between the methods to clarify why the Siegel-Monty method is more error-prone would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our argument to explain the discrepancy made assumptions that cannot be proven. We have therefore removed the sentences about 1:1 mixing from our Discussion. We already underlined the implicit difficulty of using Siegel-Monty with samples like the ones used by Nardi and co-workers. Co-expression is the gold standard to solve the solubility and assembly problems of macromolecular complexes. When writing our manuscript we have tried to be respectful of the biochemical work of Nardi et al., even if we felt that it does not meet the standards required to reach definitive conclusions. Importantly, we have not been able to purify 6His-Mis18⟨ or 6His-Mis18® in isolation from bacteria due to the very poor behavior of these proteins. Addition of an MBP tag partly solved the problem, as long as the tag was not cleaved off. As already referred to above, we have only been able to purify the Mis18 complex after co-expression of Mis18⟨ and Mis18® in <italic>E. coli</italic>. While not as stable as the complex produced in insect cells, this bacterially expressed complex behaves in gel filtration and AUC assays precisely like the sample produced in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>I don't think it's specifically up to the authors in this paper to resolve the reason for this discrepancy, but given that it's not clear whether we're looking at precisely the same complex as in Nardi et al. I think it's important for the authors to provide some additional characterization of the hexamer. Is the coiled-coil domain involved in hexamerization? Do the coiled-coil mutations described by Nardi et al. affect hexamer formation? Is the hexamer comprised of a Mis18α/β tetrameric core mediated by coiled coils with additional Mis18α bound by a different mechanism (e.g., the Yippee domain, which is also used for tetramerization in SpMis18)? The Musacchio lab has made extensive use of cross-linking/mass spectrometry in the past to understand the organization of multi-protein complexes – perhaps this could shed light on differences between the Nardi and Pan Mis18 complexes.</italic> </p><p>As already indicated above, all our new experiments, which include experiments carried out under the conditions of Nardi et al. with protein of bacterial origin, failed to identify the existence of a Mis18 tetramer. We have now included additional evidence supporting our hexamer model. For a summary, please refer to the section of the major comment #3 of the reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>2) Although it's clear that Mis18 complex assembly is required for its recruitment, it is not clear whether the cell cycle timing of its recruitment is strictly determined by regulating the timing of complex assembly or whether regulation of some additional interaction plays a role. Silva, et al. found that mutating 24 putative Cdk sites (including S110 but not T40) in M18BP1 uncoupled its centromere localization from cell cycle regulation, allowing its recruitment in mitosis and G2. Can this be recapitulated by the lone S110A (or T40V/S110A) mutant characterized by Pan, et al.?</italic> </p><p>This is a question of great interest to members of the Janssen laboratory, who have already published important work on this topic and presented at recent meetings unpublished data on the role of phosphorylation in the recruitment of CENP-A loading machinery. Partly for this reason, we have decided not to analyze this question in detail. In addition, given the very extensive level of phosphorylation of M18BP1 and other proteins in the CENP-A loading pathway, we surmise that it is unlikely that preventing the phosphorylation of the two residues we have discussed will be sufficient to bypass cell cycle inhibition of CENP-A loading. Of note, the work of Janssen and co-workers focuses precisely on this point, and reached the conclusion that lack of phosphorylation at different residues (on HJURP and M18BP1) may be sufficient to prevent CENP-A deposition in G2. More pervasive phosphorylation in M-phase may extend the regulation of additional sites, such as the ones we have identified.</p></body></sub-article></article>
