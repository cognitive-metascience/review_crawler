in a spectrum of leukodystrophy including Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H-ABC), a rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, often associated with a recurring variant p.Asp249Asn (D249N). We have developed a novel knock-in mouse model harboring heterozygous (<italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic>) and the homozygous (<italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic>) mutation that recapitulate the progressive motor dysfunction with tremor, dystonia and ataxia seen in H-ABC. <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice have myelination deficits along with dramatic decrease in mature oligodendrocytes and their progenitor cells. Additionally, a significant loss occurs in the cerebellar granular neurons and striatal neurons in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice. In vitro studies show decreased survival and dysfunction in microtubule dynamics in neurons from <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice. Thus <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice demonstrate the complex cellular physiology of H-ABC, likely due to independent effects on oligodendrocytes, striatal neurons, and cerebellar granule cells in the context of altered microtubule dynamics, with profound neurodevelopmental deficits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside human and other animal cells, filaments known as microtubules help support the shape of the cell and move proteins to where they need to be. Defects in microtubules may lead to disease. For example, genetic mutations affecting a microtubule component called TUBB4A cause a rare brain disease in humans known as H-ABC.</p><p>Individuals with H-ABC display many symptoms including abnormal walking, speech defects, impaired swallowing, and several cognitive defects. Abnormalities in several areas of the brain, including the cerebellum and striatum contribute to these defects. . In these structures, the neurons that carry messages around the brain and their supporting cells, known as oligodendrocytes, die, which causes these parts of the brain to gradually waste away.</p><p>At this time, there are no therapies available to treat H-ABC. Furthermore, research into the disease has been hampered by the lack of a suitable “model” in mice or other laboratory animals. To address this issue, Sase, Almad et al. generated mice carrying a mutation in a gene which codes for the mouse equivalent of the human protein TUBB4A.</p><p>Experiments showed that the mutant mice had similar physical symptoms to humans with H-ABC, including an abnormal walking gait, poor coordination and involuntary movements such as twitching and reduced reflexes. H-ABC mice had smaller cerebellums than normal mice, which was consistent with the wasting away of the cerebellum observed in individuals with H-ABC. The mice also lost neurons in the striatum and cerebellum, and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, the mutant TUBB4A protein affected the behavior and formation of microtubules in H-ABC mice.</p><p>The findings of Sase, Almad et al. provide the first mouse model that shares many features of H-ABC disease in humans. This model provides a useful tool to study the disease and develop potential new therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>hypomyelination</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>leukodystrophy</kwd><kwd>TUBB4A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RFA 67-54</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padiath</surname><given-names>Quasar</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanderver</surname><given-names>Adeline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM126950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holzbaur</surname><given-names>Erika LF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 NS060698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holzbaur</surname><given-names>Erika LF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship BO 5434/1-1)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boecker</surname><given-names>C Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33NS104384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padiath</surname><given-names>Quasar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33NS106087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padiath</surname><given-names>Quasar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS095884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padiath</surname><given-names>Quasar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>H-ABC leukodystrophy results in neurologic decline, hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum and <italic>Tubb4a</italic><sup><italic>D249N/D249N</italic></sup>mouse model recapitulates features of H-ABC disease, providing an important tool for therapeutic development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum (H-ABC) is a leukodystrophy caused by sporadic, typically de novo, heterozygous mutations in the <italic>TUBB4A</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simons et al., 2013</xref>). This gene encodes the tubulin beta 4A protein, which heterodimerizes with α−tubulin to form subunits that assemble into microtubules. Monoallelic mutations in <italic>TUBB4A</italic> result in a spectrum of neurologic disorders ranging from an early onset leukoencephalopathy to adult-onset Dystonia type 4 (DYT4; Whispering Dysphonia). H-ABC falls within this spectrum, presenting in the toddler years, typically with dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hersheson et al., 2013</xref>), progressive gait impairment, speech and cognitive deficits, as well as characteristic neuroimaging features - hypomyelination and atrophy of the caudate and putamen along with cerebellar atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van der Knaap et al., 2007</xref>). On human pathological specimens, dorsal striatal areas and the granular layer of the cerebellum exhibit neuronal loss with axonal swelling and diffuse paucity of myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simons et al., 2013</xref>). About 65% of published cases with <italic>TUBB4A</italic> mutations have H-ABC; the heterozygous mutation p.Asp249Asn (<italic>TUBB4A<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic>) is the most common mutation (24.1% of overall mutations in a cohort of 166 individuals- personal communication B. Charsar) amongst all forms of <italic>TUBB4A</italic> associated leukodystrophy, and is particularly represented in individuals with a H-ABC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyatake et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pizzino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Purnell et al., 2014</xref>). H-ABC is currently considered an intermediary phenotype, between severely affected early infantile variants and juvenile-adult mild variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nahhas N et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although the expression pattern and associated disease phenotypes implicate a functional role of tubulin beta 4A protein in both neurons and oligodendrocytes, little is known about the pathologic mechanisms of <italic>TUBB4A</italic> mutations. <italic>TUBB4A</italic> is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the cerebellum and white matter tracts of the brain, with more moderate expression in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hersheson et al., 2013</xref>), reflecting disease involvement in H-ABC. At a cellular level, <italic>TUBB4A</italic> is primarily localized to neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs), with highest expression in mature myelinating OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Our group has reported the effects of expressing a range of <italic>TUBB4A</italic> mutations using an OL cell line as well as mouse cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>). Over-expression of the <italic>TUBB4A<sup>D249N</sup></italic> mutation in an OL cell line resulted in decreased myelin gene expression and fewer processes compared to expression of wild type <italic>TUBB4A</italic> (<italic>TUBB4A<sup>WT</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, in cerebellar neurons, <italic>TUBB4A<sup>D249N</sup></italic> over-expression resulted in shorter axons, fewer dendrites, and decreased dendritic branching compared to <italic>TUBB4A<sup>WT</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>). Other <italic>TUBB4A</italic> mutations highlighted phenotypic abnormalities specifically only in neurons and/or OL cell lines, suggesting mutation-specific effects, corresponding to variable clinical phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>). This work highlights the importance of using models with mutations naturally occurring in humans. A spontaneously occurring rat model, the <italic>taiep</italic> rat, with a homozygous p.Ala302Thr <italic>Tubb4a</italic> mutation, has been reported with only a hypomyelinating phenotype in the brain, optic nerves and certain tracts of the spinal cord but no neuronal pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>taiep</italic> specific mutation has not been reported in humans but is consistent with our cellular data showing variable cellular phenotypes for different mutations. An interesting feature observed in the <italic>taiep</italic> was accumulation of microtubules, particularly in the OLs, with subsequent demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Currently, there are no published animal models for the <italic>TUBB4A<sup>D249N</sup></italic> mutation specifically associated with H-ABC; which is key for understanding the pathogenesis and developing therapeutic options for individuals who harbor this mutation. Thus, we have developed a knock-in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mouse as a model of H-ABC, recapitulating features of the human disease including dystonia, loss of motor function, and gait abnormalities. The histopathological features of the mouse model include both loss of neurons in striatum and cerebellum and hypomyelination in the brain and spinal cord, as observed in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>). We have also explored the functional consequence of mutant tubulin on microtubule polymerization and the cell-autonomous role of <italic>Tubb4a</italic> mutation in neurons and OLs of the <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> CRISPR knock-in mice</title><p>Heterozygous mutation p.Asp249Asn (<italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup>)</italic> mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas-9 technology by substituting p.Asp249Asn (c.745G &gt; A) mutation in exon 4 of the <italic>Tubb4a</italic> gene.

The p.Asp249Asn (D249N) variant has been closely tied to the classic features of H-ABC, including the characteristic triad of hypomyelination with striatal and cerebellar atrophy. Although the naturally occurring <italic>taeip</italic> rat model harbors a <italic>Tubb4a</italic> mutation, the p.Ala302Thr mutation has not previously been seen in affected human individuals; the model lacks cerebellar and striatal atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2003</xref>) and is more consistent with those individuals manifesting isolated hypomyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pizzino et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we sought to fully explore H-ABC in a novel CRISPR-Cas9 transgenic model of the classic p.Asp249Asn (D249N) mutation, hoping to provide greater understanding of the diverse cellular phenotypes affected in the human disease.</p><p><italic>Tubb4a</italic> mutations in our model results in a severe myelin pathology, consistent with hypomyelination and progressive demyelination over time. Profound hypomyelination may contribute to early onset tremor in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice, similar to what is seen in <italic>Shiverer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biddle et al., 1973</xref>)<italic>, Shi<sup>mild</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Readhead and Hood, 1990</xref>) and <italic>Jimpy</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nave et al., 1986</xref>). <italic>Tubb4a</italic> is highly expressed in mature OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), which may contribute to the significant glia phenotype in this mouse. The number of OPCs appears to be preserved in vivo in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice, although co-staining of NG2 (OPC marker) with caspase indicates increased cell death in early OL lineage cells of <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice. A preserved overall number of NG2 and Olig2+ cells suggests that the death of OPCs may result in increased proliferation in vivo, supported by co-staining of NG2 with Ki-67. It has previously been shown that OPCs are dynamic cells and maintain their homeostatic behavior since NG2 cells abolished by differentiation or death are quickly restored through proliferation of the nearest OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>). OPCs isolated from <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice showed no changes in cell death markers but displayed defects in proliferation with fewer A2B5+ Ki-67+ cells compared to control WT control mice. Thus in vitro changes reflect a cell-autonomous effect resulting in decreased proliferation with no change in cell death. Conversely, in vivo dynamics of OPCs is complex as the increase in OPC proliferation occurs in the context of cell death, which could possibly be due to cross-talk with other cells such as neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagy et al., 2017</xref>) and influence of the milieu, as has been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez-Castaneda and Gaultier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McTigue and Tripathi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tripathi and McTigue, 2007</xref>). Ultimately, both in vitro and in vivo studies show significant decrease in the number of mature OLs in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice as opposed to WT control mice. Since OLs express a greater degree of Tubb4a, it is possible a proportion of mature OLs die, not captured by the apoptotic marker caspase in vivo or die by a non-apoptotic mechanism. Thus, both cell death and inefficient differentiation may account for severe deficits seen in formation of mature OLs in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Pathology does not appear to be restricted to the OL lineage in H-ABC, however. <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice show evidence of severe loss of cerebellar granular neurons at P21 and more limited striatal neuron degeneration after ~P37. The milder defects seen in striatal neurons may be related to the variable expression of <italic>Tubb4a</italic>, that is relatively higher in cerebellum than striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hersheson et al., 2013</xref>). We also studied cortical neurons in culture from <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice, demonstrating decreased survival and stunted axonal and dendritic length, although no obvious cortical defect is identified in vivo. Neuronal loss in the striatum and cerebellar granule layer is consistent with reported neuropathology in individuals affected by H-ABC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pizzino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van der Knaap et al., 2002</xref>) and may underlie the progressive gait abnormalities, ataxia, and motor dysfunction seen in both this mouse model and affected individuals.</p><p>MTs are integral to neuronal and OL development, contributing to their structure, including arborization, polarity, growth cone dynamics; as well as function such as axonal transport and intracellular transport of key myelin proteins through efficient MT polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2016</xref>). A number of mutations in α-tubulin and β-tubulin are attributed to neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartelli et al., 2010</xref>) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanara et al., 2007</xref>) due to altered MT dynamics resulting in impaired axonal transport crucial for active cargo transport. Previous in vitro reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vulinovic et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that <italic>TUBB4A<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> causes alterations in tubulin dynamics. In current studies, while there is no change in microtubule assembly rates in functional studies in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> neurons, a potential increase occurs in the frequency of pausing at the growing microtubule ends. Our data also suggests that there may be alterations in microtubule organization in axons, given the increased variance in EB3-comet density along the axons of <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> neurons. Alterations in MT dynamics or organization in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> neurons may hamper the transport of cargo required for axon elongation and dendritic branching. Additionally, given the complexity of OL processes and myelin sheath development, it can be foreseen that inefficient delivery of cargo along MTs also contributes to the decreased maturation and complexity of <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> OLs.</p><p>Notably, the <italic>taeip</italic> rat displays an accumulation of microtubules in OLs, unmyelinated axons, and astrogliosis along with perinuclear localization of RNA for PLP, MAG and MBP myelin genes, which was attributed to altered activity of the motor protein dynein for MBP trafficking in mutated OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Connor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilkins et al., 2010</xref>). Our EM studies in <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice show unmyelinated or abnormally thin myelinated axons, astrogliosis, axons with abnormal accumulation of lysosomes, microglia, and/or macrophages containing myelin debris, and lipid droplets reminiscent of deficits seen in <italic>taiep</italic> rats. However, the remarkable microtubule accumulation demonstrated in the <italic>taiep</italic> rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 2017</xref>) is not seen in our <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Despite no microtubule accumulation, it is noteworthy that the <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mutation appears to significantly affect microtubule dynamics in our model. This may be the basis for the cell-autonomous effects of <italic>Tubb4a</italic> mutations, leading to decreased OL maturation, impaired axonal growth and reduced neuronal survival. The exact mechanism by which <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> mutation impacts microtubule function, myelination, and neuronal function remains unknown and needs to be further explored.</p><p>An important limitation of this study is the use of mice with both heterozygous and homozygous mutations, when in humans the inheritance pattern of H-ABC is sporadic with heterozygous mutations causing disease. While both <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> and heterozygous <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/+</sup></italic> mice demonstrate severe hypomyelination followed by additional myelin loss; only the homozygous <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice show early deficits in gait and motor skills, consistent with ataxia and tremor seen in H-ABC affected individuals. One potential explanation for this species-specific difference is dosage sensitivity, resulting in a dissimilar penetrance of phenotypes. This has been reported for the <italic>taiep</italic> rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2003</xref>); in addition, there are several other reported genes such as <italic>GATA3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lim et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>TBX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jerome and Papaioannou, 2001</xref>), <italic>GLI3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böse et al., 2002</xref>) where, heterozygous mutations are present in humans but homozygous mice have similar phenotypic expression to the human disease. The presence of disease in both heterozygous and homozygous animals could be due to mutations causing either loss or gain of function. However, our previous in vitro work and a study in human SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing mutant TUBB4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vulinovic et al., 2018</xref>) suggests a mechanism for toxic gain of function. This is further supported by existing <italic>Tubb4a knock out</italic> (<italic>KO</italic>) mouse models. <italic>Tubb4a KO</italic> mice with LacZ expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skarnes et al., 2011</xref>) are available at the knock-out mouse project repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI">http://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI</ext-link>:107848#section-associations). Homozygous <italic>Tubb4a KO</italic> mice show normal embryonic development and growth relative to WT mice. Phenotypic lac Z expression data shows that the nervous system appears normal with no discernible cerebellar neuron loss. Together this body of evidence suggests a mechanism of dominant toxic gain of function and while presence of WT Tubb4a might not be essential for brain development and function, mutations may later result in neuronal and oligodendrocyte deficits.</p><p>As various <italic>TUBB4A</italic> mutations have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pizzino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tonduti et al., 2016</xref>), it is becoming recognized that mutation specific cellular effects, with independent involvement of the striatum, myelinating cells, and cerebellum, may be responsible for the wide phenotypic variability seen in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pizzino et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup></italic> mice are the first model to demonstrate both neuronal and oligodendroglial defects, and replicate the behavioral and neurodegenerative features of classical H-ABC disease.

The neurons were imaged in an environmental chamber at 37°C on a PerkinElmer UltraView Vox Spinning Disk Confocal system with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope using a Plan Apochromat 60 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. Axons were identified by established morphological criteria and images were acquired with a Hamamatsu EMCCD C9100-50 camera driven by Volocity software (PerkinElmer) at a rate of 2 s per frame for 600 s. Quantification of EB3 dynamics was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>). The ImageJ macro toolset KymoClear was used to generate kymographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mangeol et al., 2016</xref>). The KymoClear toolset passes a Fourier filter on the original kymograph allowing for automated discrimination of anterograde, retrograde or static components and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of EB3 comets without affecting quantitative analysis of the data. The tracks of individual EB3 comets were manually traced using a custom MATLAB GUI (Kymograph Suite) and used to determine run-length, run-time, and velocity of each comet. The investigator was blinded for the neuronal genotype during both image acquisition and kymograph analysis.

For mouse studies, ‘n’ represents the number of animals used per experiment unless indicated otherwise. Gait abnormalities, righting reflex, rotarod, and weight assessments were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by the post-hoc Tukey test. For grip strength and ambulation, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test was performed. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences between groups were estimated by the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. Comparisons in myelin quantification, NeuN, ASPA, NG2, Olig2, Ki-67 and cleaved caspase three counts and fluorescent intensity were analyzed by ordinary two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons post-hoc Tukey tests. EM analysis for G-ratio and axon diameter was conducted using one-way ANOVA with the post-hoc Tukey test and the % myelin analysis was conducted with two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey test. Neuronal survival, axon and dendritic length, and assessment of OL markers examined in vitro were compared using one-way ANOVA with the post-hoc Tukey test. EB3 dynamics in neurons were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software) with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Judith Grinspan and the IDDRC for the availability and use of PLP antibody for the experiments in this manuscript.

For example, analysis of the corpus callosum is generally used to assess histologic parameters of myelination. Similarly, EM was conducted in myelin rich regions such as the optic nerve or spinal cord as these are routinely examined for studying myelin ultrastructure. OPC isolation was performed as a secondary validation of OL lineage studies, which is typically performed with cerebral cortices. We have now been added previously published references for these established methodologies for clarity. Specifically, details have been added in the Materials and methods sections in the main text under EM, immunohistochemistry and oligodendrocyte culture sections to clarify our approaches. Finally, in some circumstances we used other structures for validation (e.g. the cerebellum) because these regions are known to be affected in H-ABC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rationale and conclusions of the in vitro studies need clarified.

We have added references around the use of fetal neurons to generate in vitro models, which is an accepted protocol in the field. We have additionally clarified that neurons were counted prior to plating (at similar densities) and that data that is shown represents actual survival as an endpoint of the assay, and documents 1-week survival across all cohorts. Specifically, the following text has been added in the Materials and methods section: “The neurons were plated at equal densities for all genotypes in 24-well plate were assessed for cell survival, axonal and dendritic length at 1-week post-plating.”</p><p>Regarding the OL studies, we have conducted additional experiments to address the question about OPC proliferation and death, in addition to OL maturation and the data are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We have added the results under the section addressing cell autonomous effects of OPC in vitro studies. We report a significant decrease in proliferation of OPCs isolated from Tubb4a<sup>D249N</sup> and Tubb4a<sup>D249N/D249N</sup> mice compared to WT mice, however no significant cell death was observed in the different groups. We further explain in the Discussion, that while the in vitro cell-autonomous effect results in decreased proliferation with no change in cell death; in vivo effects showing increase in proliferation in the context of cell death could be due to cross-talk with other cells such as neurons and influence of the milieu. This has previously been shown in other disorders and a reference is provided.</p></body></sub-article></article>
