Studies have shown that N-glycans are important for serine protease expression and secretion, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report a common mechanism of N-glycosylation in the protease domains of corin, enteropeptidase and prothrombin in calnexin-mediated glycoprotein folding and extracellular expression. This mechanism, which is independent of calreticulin and operates in a domain-autonomous manner, involves two steps: direct calnexin binding to target proteins and subsequent calnexin binding to monoglucosylated N-glycans. Elimination of N-glycosylation sites in the protease domains of corin, enteropeptidase and prothrombin inhibits corin and enteropeptidase cell surface expression and prothrombin secretion in transfected HEK293 cells. Similarly, knocking down calnexin expression in cultured cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes reduced corin cell surface expression and prothrombin secretion, respectively. Our results suggest that this may be a general mechanism in the trypsin-like serine proteases with N-glycosylation sites in their protease domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calnexin</kwd><kwd>corin</kwd><kwd>N-glycosylation</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>serine protease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL126697</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qingyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91639116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qingyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81671485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qingyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>N-glycans commonly present in the protease domains are required for calnexin-mediated protein folding and intracellular trafficking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the human genome, ~2% of the genes encode proteases, among which trypsin-like serine proteases are a major group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Overall and Blobel, 2007</xref>). Most of the trypsin-like serine proteases act extracellularly to participate in physiological processes, including embryonic development, food digestion, blood coagulation and hormone processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Otín and Hunter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neurath, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Overall and Blobel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perona and Craik, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stroud, 1974</xref>). Dysregulated serine protease expression and activity contribute to major health problems such as cardiovascular disease, cancer metastasis, inflammation, and neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gohara and Di Cera, 2011</xref>).</p><p>N-glycosylation is a common post-translational modification in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eklund and Freeze, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patterson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Varki, 1993</xref>). About two thirds of the predicted human proteins contain N-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apweiler et al., 1999</xref>). Consistently, most of the trypsin superfamily members are N-glycosylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyake et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu and Suttie, 1999</xref>). Many N-glycosylation sites in these serine proteases, especially those in the protease domain, are highly conserved; that is, a specific N-glycosylation site in a protease is conserved not only in the homologs of different species, but also at the same location in other members of the protease superfamily. Such conservation indicates the functional importance. Indeed, N-glycosylation has been shown to regulate the extracellular expression, secretion and activation of trypsin-like serine proteases, although the underlying mechanisms are not elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gladysheva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyake et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu and Suttie, 1999</xref>). It is unclear if N-glycans at the conserved sites have a general role in the biosynthesis of the trypsin-like serine proteases.</p><p>Corin is a trypsin-like serine protease that activates natriuretic peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2000</xref>). It consists of a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain and an extracellular region with multiple protein modules and a C-terminal protease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hooper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 1999</xref>). In cells, corin is made as a zymogen and activated on the cell surface by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 (PCSK6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2018</xref>). <italic>CORIN</italic> and <italic>PCSK6</italic> variants that impair corin cell surface expression and zymogen activation have been identified in patients with hypertensive diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2017</xref>).</p><p>Human corin has 19 N-glycosylation sites in its extracellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 1999</xref>). We and others have shown that N-glycosylation is critical for corin cell surface expression and zymogen activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gladysheva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Abolishing N-glycosylation sites at Asn80 and Asn231 in the pro-peptide region increased corin shedding on the cell surface, whereas abolishing N-glycosylation site at Asn1022 (N1022), the only N-glycosylation site in the protease domain of human corin, reduced the cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). To date, how N-glycosylation at N1022 regulates corin cell surface expression remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we made membrane-bound and soluble forms of corin with or without the N1022 N-glycosylation site and analyzed the mutant proteins in transfected cells. We also did proteomic analysis to identify intracellular proteins interacting with corin. We verified our findings in enteropeptidase (also called enterokinase, EK), a transmembrane serine protease, and prothrombin, a secreted serine protease. We found that N-glycosylation in the protease domain of corin, EK and prothrombin has a common role in regulating the extracellular expression of these proteases, which involves calnexin-assisted protein folding and ER exiting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glycosylation at N1022 promotes cell surface expression of corin zymogen</title><p>N1022 is a conserved glycosylation site in the corin protease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Abolishing this site impairs corin cell surface expression and zymogen activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). To test if the effect is related to zymogen activation, we analyzed corin mutants lacking the activation site (R801A) with or without the N1022 glycosylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In western blotting of transfected cell lysates, levels of corin zymogen bands (~160–200 kDa) were similar in corin WT and mutants N1022Q, R801A, and R801A/N1022Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). In corin WT, the cleaved protease domain fragment (Corin-p) migrated as an ~40 kDa band under reducing conditions. In the N1022Q mutant, the Corin-p band was lighter and migrated faster, due to the lack of N1022 glycosylation and poor zymogen activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, no Corin-p band was detected in mutants R801A and R801/N1022Q lacking the activation site. In biotin-labeled cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right), levels of corin bands in the N1022Q mutant were 43 ± 9% of that in WT (p=0.002) and levels in the R801A/N1022Q mutant were 41 ± 8% of that in R801A (p=0.027). The total intensity of WT bands (Corin and Corin-p) was similar to that of R801A (Corin band only). The results indicate that lacking N1022 glycosylation reduces corin cell surface expression with or without the activation cleavage at R801.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35672.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>N-glycosylation at N1022 in single-chain and soluble corin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of human corin WT and mutants with or without R801 activation site and N1022 N-glycosylation site.

Previously, N-glycosylation at N1022 was found to be critical for corin cell surface expression, but the underlying mechanism was unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we found that N-glycosylation at this site was important for corin folding and trafficking in the ER. In proteomic analysis, we identified calnexin and BiP, two ER proteins that bound preferably to the N1022Q mutant.</p><p>Calnexin acts in glycoprotein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caramelo and Parodi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helenius and Aebi, 2001</xref>). Unlike in heat-shock chaperone-mediated protein folding, which involves direct protein-protein binding, calnexin binds to monoglucosylated oligosaccharides on glycoproteins after triglucosylated N-glycans are trimmed by glucosidases I and II. Calnexin also binds to target proteins via direct hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brockmeier and Williams, 2006</xref>). Such interactions alone, however, are insufficient for glycoprotein folding. We found increased binding of the N1022Q mutant to calnexin and BiP, indicating that N-glycans at N1022 on corin is important for calnexin-assisted protein folding and ER exiting. The results led to a working model, in which calnexin first binds to nascent corin through direct protein-protein interactions. Subsequent binding of calnexin to monoglucosylated N-glycans on corin, at N1022 and other N-glycosylation sites, facilitates corin folding. The resultant conformational change in corin disrupts the interaction with calnexin, allowing corin to exit the ER. Consistent with this model, we showed that the treatment of DNJ, a glucosidase inhibitor, increased the binding of the N1022Q mutant and WT corin to calnexin and BiP to similar levels. The results support the importance of N-glycan-calnexin interactions in corin folding and ER exiting. Moreover, the results indicate that N-glycans at other N-glycosylation sites on corin are also involved in the calnexin interaction.</p><p>Human corin contains 19 N-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 1999</xref>). Among them, N1022 is the only site in the protease domain. Our findings indicate that N-glycosylation in the protease domain is critical for calnexin-assisted folding. In trypsin-like serine proteases, N-glycosylation sites in the protease domain are common. Previously, N-glycosylation in the protease domain of factor VII (FVII) was shown to promote FVII secretion in COS-7 and CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolt et al., 2007</xref>). Abolishing the N-glycosylation site in the protease domain of chymotrypsin C reduced the secretion in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bence and Sahin-Tóth, 2011</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of a mutant chymotrypsin C lacking the N-glycosylation in the protease domain caused ER stress in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bence and Sahin-Tóth, 2011</xref>). These data suggest that N-glycosylation in the protease domain of trypsin-like serine proteases has a general role in calnexin binding and protein folding. Consistent with this hypothesis, DNJ treatment and calnexin knockdown decreased corin cell surface expression and prothrombin secretion in cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes, respectively. Moreover, elimination of N-glycosylation sites in the protease domain of EK or prothrombin increased EK and prothrombin binding to calnexin and BiP and decreased EK cell surface expression or prothrombin secretion in HEK293 cells. These results show that in corin, EK and prothrombin, which have distinct protein domain structures and physiological functions, N-glycosylation in their protease domains has a common function in calnexin-assisted folding and extracellular expression. Possibly, this is a general mechanism in most, if not all, trypsin-like serine proteases that have N-glycosylation sites in their protease domains.</p><p>Calreticulin is a soluble calnexin homologous in the ER and acts as a key partner in the calnexin-calreticulin cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caramelo and Parodi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helenius and Aebi, 2001</xref>). Like calnexin, calreticulin binds to monoglucosylated oligosaccharides on glycoproteins. In a previous study, inhibition of glucosidase II increased calreticulin binding to cruzipain, a protozoan cysteine protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Labriola et al., 1999</xref>). In our study, we found increased binding of N1022Q corin, EK-4Q and PT-N416Q mutants to calnexin but not calreticulin, indicating that calnexin is the primary ER chaperone that interacts with N-glycans in the protease domain of these proteases. If both calnexin and calreticulin recognize similar monoglucosylated N-glycans, how do these proteins distinguish their glycoprotein substrates? Unlike calreticulin, calnexin has a transmembrane domain anchoring calnexin on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalziel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellgaard and Frickel, 2003</xref>). In most trypsin-like serine proteases, the protease domain is C-terminal. Possibly, the membrane-bound calnexin is more accessible to the N-glycans in the C-terminal protease domain, which comes last from the translocon on the ER membrane in protein synthesis. This may explain that despite the 18 N-glycosylation sites in the pro-peptide of corin, N-glycosylation at N1022 in the protease domain is required for optimal corin folding and ER exiting. Consistently, N-glycosylation in the protease domain of the CorinEK4N mutant promotes the cell surface expression of the chimeric protein. These results indicate that N-glycans in the protease domain regulate calnexin-assisted folding in a domain-autonomous and calreticulin-independent manner.</p><p>The importance of N-glycans in glycoprotein folding varies depending on proteins and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helenius and Aebi, 2001</xref>). In the trypsin-like protease superfamily, not all members are N-glycosylated. Some members have N-glycosylation sites in the pro-peptide but not in the protease domain. It is attempting to postulate that N-glycosylation in the protease domain offers an advantage in protein folding efficiency and hence protein production. The requirement of N-glycosylation in a particular protease may depend on its expression level and specific cell environments. More studies are needed to test the folding efficiencies between the trypsin-like proteases with and without N-glycosylation sites in their protease domains in different cells. As trypsin-like proteases are used as biologics to treat human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craik et al., 2011</xref>), creation of new N-glycosylation sites may also be a strategy to increase the production of recombinant proteases in vitro.</p><p>In summary, we identify a common mechanism of N-glycosylation in the protease domains of corin, EK and prothrombin in calnexin-mediated folding and ER exiting. This process is calreticulin-independent, operates in a domain-autonomous manner, and involves two steps: direct calnexin binding to the target protein and subsequent calnexin binding to monoglucosylated N-glycans. Our findings suggest that this may be a general mechanism in the trypsin-like proteases with N-glycosylation sites in their protease domains. Naturally-occurring mutations disrupting such N-glycosylation sites may impair the expression and function of the trypsin-like serine proteases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Corin</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NM_006587.3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Prothrombin, PT</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NM_002772.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Enteropeptidase, EK</td><td>NCBI</td><td>NM_000506.4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Calnexin (siRNA kit)</td><td>Origene</td><td>SR300576</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Calnexin (siRNA kit)</td><td>Origene</td><td>SR417891</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-1573</td><td>STR profiling, no mycoplasma <break/>contamination</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>HL-1</td><td>PMID: 21518754, <break/>EMD Millipore: SCC065</td><td>From Dr. William Claycomb</td><td>No mycoplasma contamination</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HepG2</td><td>ATCC</td><td>HB-8065</td><td>STR profiling, no mycoplasma <break/>contamination</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Corin plasmid</td><td>PMID: 14559895</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>sCorin plasmid</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CorinEK plasmid</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>EK plasmid</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>PT plasmid</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-V5</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>R96025</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-V5-HRP</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>R96125</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GAPDH</td><td>EMD Millipore</td><td>MAB374</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-PDI</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab3672</td><td>Immunostaining</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-TGN46</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab50595</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Igg (mouse)-Alexa-594</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>A-21203</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Igg (rabbit)-Alexa-488</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>A-11008</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-calnexin (human)</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>2679T</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-BiP</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>3177T</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-calreticulin</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>12238S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HSP70</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>4872T</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HSP90</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>4877T</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-PDI</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>3501T</td><td>Western blotting</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Igg (mouse)-HRP</td><td>KPL</td><td>474–1806</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Igg (rabbit)-HRP</td><td>KPL</td><td>474–1516</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-calnexin (mouse)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab75125</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-corin (mouse)</td><td>Homemade</td><td>PMID: 26259032</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td>pSecTag/FRT/V5-His <break/>Expression kit (vector)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>K602501</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA <break/>reagent</td><td>pcDNA 3.1/V5-His <break/>Expression kit (vector)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>K480001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay <break/>or kit</td><td>ELISA kit (prothrombin)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab108909</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td>1-deoxynojirimycin, DNJ</td><td>Alfa Aesar</td><td>J62602-MC</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The plasmids expressing corin WT and the mutants N1022Q and R801A were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knappe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

The manuscript is well written and points towards new important functions for glycosylation of serine protease domains. Publication of the study is recommended with some corrections and additions.</p><p>In general, loading controls for Western blots showing the total amount of protein loaded for each sample in is missing in most of the figures (Figure 1B, D, Figure 2A, C, Figure 6B, C and Figure 7C, D), which makes it difficult to conclude anything with certainty. A Western blot showing the expression level for a housekeeping gene (β-actin, GAPDH or similar) is needed for all blots. Furthermore, when using densiometry tools for quantification, the correct method is normalizing the amount of protein of interest (e.g. corin) to the loading control (e.g. GAPDH), to ensure that the difference in intensity is not due to variation in the amount of total protein loaded.</p><p>In Figure 2A and B, the authors conclude that N1022 glycosylation promotes ER trafficking. These data are obtained by quantifying the protein expression levels as determined by the semi-quantitative method Western blotting followed by quantification using densiometric analysis on what appears to be two separate membranes, one for WT and one for N1022Q, which makes it difficult to compare. Although these are commonly used techniques in cell biology it is not a quantitative method and the intensity of the band is not necessarily linear for the protein concentrations detected in Figure 2A. Furthermore, a loading control is needed, as mentioned above. As impaired trafficking of the N1022Q mutant is one of the main conclusions from this study it would be nice to see this observation supported by other more quantitative techniques such as ELISA or similar.</p><p>In Figure 2C, the authors conclude that N1022Q mutant is retained in the ER or early Golgi as compared to the WT based on Endo H sensitivity. Again Western blot analysis is used to quantify the amount of protein. The baseline protein expression of the N1022Q mutant appears higher than for the WT (Figure 2C, compare lanes 1 for WT blot with N1022Q blot). Upon deglycosylation at timepoint 0 we see a down-switch in molecular weight for both WT and N1022Q, and the band intensity is comparable for + Endo H and –Endo H. In contrast, at timepoint 4 hours after CHX treatment, there is an inconsistency between the band intensity for WT -Endo H and WT +Endo H? The Endo H treatment should only affect the size of the protein, not the expression level (equivalent levels for N1022Q after 4h CHX – and + Endo H)? Again, a loading control for the blot is needed as mentioned in the first point.</p><p>In Figure 3, the authors write that corin N1022Q staining was &quot;strong&quot; compared to &quot;little corin staining&quot; in WT corin expressing cells after 4 h CHX treatment based on ICC analysis. This observation is not evident from the images shown in Figure 4A and B? Looking at Figure 3 there is still (equivalent levels?) corin in the WT (3rd column, 2nd row Figure 3A, red staining) as compared to N1022Q (4th column, 2nd row, Figure 3A, red staining)? It is also difficult to see the difference in overlap with the ER marker PDI and the WT versus the N1022Q as suggested by the authors.</p><p>In Figure 4 the authors immunoprecipitate corin by a C-terminal V5 tag and find an increased level of the ER proteins calnexin and BIP in the N1022Q pull down as compared to WT corin pull down. In all previous figures comparing expression levels of N1022Q to WT it looks like there is more N1022Q in the lysate. It would be nice to see the amount of corin precipitated by the V5 tag for both the WT and the N1022Q mutant to rule out that the increased level of calnexin and BiP interaction in the N1022Q pull down is not due to more of the N1022Q protein precipitated as compared to WT.</p><p>In Figure 5B a similar issue is found, as described above. It is not evident that the total amount of precipitated corin for the V5 pull down is comparable for WT and N1022Q. A Western blot of V5 immunoprecipitated corin is needed.</p><p>In Figure 8 it is similarly important to show the amount of precipitated protease for both EK and prothrombin (PT) in the respective V5 pulldowns to exclude that the difference in calnexin and BiP levels is not due to varying levels of the protease in the samples.</p><p>In summary, the study is extensive, systematic and reveals a potential new role for serine protease domain glycosylation in calnexin assisted protein folding and extracellular expression. However, most of the conclusions in the article are based on subtle differences in protein expression levels as determined by semi-quantitative methods such as Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. It is therefore crucial for publication to include loading controls for all Western blots as well as controls for the amount of protease immunoprecipitated for the V5 pull-downs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Wang et al., with the title &quot;N-glycosylation in the protease domain of trypsin-like serine proteases mediates calnexinassisted protein folding and extracellular expression&quot; the authors set out to determine how N-glycosylation regulates the extracellular expression, secretion and activation of trypsin-like serine proteases. They report the identification of a common mechanism of N-glycosylation in the protease domains of corin, enteropeptidase and prothrombin in calnexin-mediated glycoprotein folding and extracellular expression. A substantial amount of data is included in the study and experiments are carried out in a thorough manner. The findings are novel and interesting to a wide audience; including scientists interested in basic biology of proteases as well as scientists focusing on post-translational modification of proteins and cellular trafficking.</p><p>It is convincingly demonstrated that glycosylation at N1022 promotes corin exiting from the ER. Furthermore, increased N1022Q mutant corin binding to calnexin and BiP is shown. To demonstrate a functional role of calnexin and BiP for corin trafficking, cells were treated with DNJ, a glucosidase inhibitor. This experiment was performed based on the knowledge that in calnexin-assisted glycoprotein folding, triglucosylated oligosaccharides on nascent proteins are trimmed by α-glucosidases I and II to monoglucosylated oligosaccharides, allowing calnexin binding to N-glycans to assist protein folding. DNJ treatment indeed blocked calnexin binding to N-glycans on corin and impaired calnexin-assisted folding, resulting in increased direct corin binding to calnexin and BiP.</p><p>1) While the DNJ experiments are informative, it cannot be conclusively established that calnexin and BiP are the essential players in corin glycoprotein folding and transport. The inclusion of selective silencing of calnexin and/or BiP by RNAi would provide valuable data and further substantiate their importance.</p><p>2) All experiments are carried out in HEK293 cells using recombinant versions of serine proteases. The biological relevance is therefore unclear. Inclusion of data using cells expression endogenous protease(s) in combination with DNJ treatment and/or RNAi-mediated silencing of calnexin and BiP would greatly enhance the impact of the findings described here.</p><p>In conclusion, the manuscript by Wang et al. is thorough and experiments are carried out in a careful manner. The findings are novel and interesting. A knock-down experiment to specifically target calnexin and/or BiP in cell lines that express one or two of the endogenously proteases under study (one or two different cell lines) would significantly enhance the biological relevance of this new exciting N-glycosylation-mediated folding and trafficking mechanism. These experiments would be expected to be manageable, relatively straight forward, and possible to carry out within a reasonable time-frame.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>This is well designed and executed study that adds to our understanding of the role of protease domain glycosylation of trypsin fold serine proteases. The results are clean and well interpreted. The manuscript has a good structure and the cartoons in the figures are very helpful to follow the experimental section. There are a couple of questions that need to be properly addressed and are also listed below.</p><p>1) Figure 5B shows that DNJ increases calnexin and BiP binding to corin WT and to N1022Q (similar results for EK and prothrombin in later figures). I don't quite understand why there is increased binding to N1022Q in the presence of DNJ, since the N1022-attached glycan (which is absent in the mutant) seems to be the main driver for folding and export. Since the N1022Q mutant has no glycan attached at this position and, therefore, no glucose residues to begin with, it is not clearly understood (by me) why glucosidase I/II inhibition of the N1022Q mutant by DNJ would lead to even more unfolded (and retained) corin in the ER. Since in this case (N1022Q mutant) DNJ inhibits glycosylation at other sites (possibly 18 if I'm correct) the increased calnexin binding seems to be related to impaired trimming of some of these other glycan attachments. How then is the N1022 so important by itself? Maybe I have misunderstood this, but I urge the authors to work on improving the clarity on this section. In addition, the authors may comment in the Discussion as to whether DNJ increases calnexin (or calreticulin) binding of proteins other than trypsin fold serine proteases or whether this is an effect specific to trypsin fold serine proteases (any literature on this?).</p><p>2) Based on the proteomics results the authors have focused on calnexin and BiP, even though there are many other hits that came out of this experiment. A potentially relevant binding hit seems to be the PDI A3 and A4, which also showed enrichment in the N1022Q group (Table 1). Any reason why this was not pursued?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35672.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The manuscript is in principle within the scope of eLife's interest/mission.

In the absence of DNJ, increased binding to calnexin and BiP in the N1022Q mutant, compared to WT corin, indicates the importance of N-glycans at N1022. In the presence of DNJ, all N-glycan-calnexin interactions are expected to be inhibited. Increased binding of N1022Q to calnexin, in the presence of DNJ, indicates that N-glycans at other N-glycosylation sites on corin are also involved in the calnexin interaction. We have revised the Discussion to clarify this point (second paragraph).</p><p>In our proteomic studies, we chose 2-fold as the cut-off value for differential binding proteins. We provided this information in the footnote of Supplementary file 2. The N1022Q vs. WT ratios for PDI A3 and A4 were 1.24- and 1.67-fold, respectively, which were below the cut-off value.</p><p>However, we do appreciate the Editor and reviewer’s comments. In this revision, we have included the cut-off information in the Results (subsection “Increased N1022Q binding to calnexin and BiP”, first paragraph). We also performed new pull-down experiments using an anti-total PDI antibody (Cell Signaling, 3501T), which showed similar PDI binding between WT corin and N1022Q. The results are included in the revised Figure 4A and D, and the text (see the aforementioned subsection, last).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, does DNJ increase calnexin (or calreticulin) binding of proteins other than trypsin fold serine proteases or is this is an effect specific to trypsin-fold serine proteases?</p></disp-quote><p>DNJ is a glucosidase inhibitor. As calnexin and calreticulin are involved in the folding process of many glycoproteins, we do not expect the effect of DNJ to be specific to trypsin-like serine proteases. Surprisingly, only limited studies have been published in this area. In our PubMed search, we found only one report, in which DNJ treatment increased calreticulin binding to cruzipain, a protozoa cysteine protease (Labriola et al., 1999). We did not find any papers reporting increased calnexin binding to trypsin-like serine proteases or other proteins in the presence of DNJ. In the revised Discussion, we have cited the Labriola paper (fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>[…] In general, loading controls for Western blots showing the total amount of protein loaded for each sample in is missing in most of the figures (Figure 1B, D, Figure 2A, C, Figure 6B, C and Figure 7C, D), which makes it difficult to conclude anything with certainty.

The conclusion of impaired trafficking is also supported by immunostaining (Figure 3) and increased calnexin and BiP binding (Figures 4 and 5). We have revised the Results to reflect this point (subsection “Glycosylation at N1022 promotes corin exiting from the ER”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2C, the authors conclude that N1022Q mutant is retained in the ER or early Golgi as compared to the WT based on Endo H sensitivity. Again Western blot analysis is used to quantify the amount of protein. The baseline protein expression of the N1022Q mutant appears higher than for the WT (Figure 2C, compare lanes 1 for WT blot with N1022Q blot). Upon deglycosylation at timepoint 0 we see a down-switch in molecular weight for both WT and N1022Q, and the band intensity is comparable for + Endo H and -Endo H. In contrast, at timepoint 4 hours after CHX treatment, there is an inconsistency between the band intensity for WT -Endo H and WT +Endo H? The Endo H treatment should only affect the size of the protein, not the expression level (equivalent levels for N1022Q after 4h CHX – and + Endo H)? Again, a loading control for the blot is needed as mentioned in the first point.</p></disp-quote><p>The GAPDH controls have been added to Figure 2C. Indeed, comparing bands in WT and N1022Q with and without Endo H treatment is less desired. A better way is to compare the ratio of Endo H-sensitive vs. resistant bands within the same lane. Such analysis led to the same conclusion. We have revised the description in the Results (subsection “Glycosylation at N1022 promotes corin exiting from the ER”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, the authors write that corin N1022Q staining was &quot;strong&quot; compared to &quot;little corin staining&quot; in WT corin expressing cells after 4 h CHX treatment based on ICC analysis. This observation is not evident from the images shown in Figure 4A and B? Looking at Figure 3 there is still (equivalent levels?) corin in the WT (3rd column, 2nd row Figure 3A, red staining) as compared to N1022Q (4th column, 2nd row, Figure 3A, red staining)? It is also difficult to see the difference in overlap with the ER marker PDI and the WT versus the N1022Q as suggested by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3, images in difference columns were from different cells. To ensure the visibility, photo exposure times may not be the same. Thus, images in different columns are not meant to be compared each other. In our analysis, we compared the intensity of corin (red) vs. PDI (green) staining in the same images, i.e. in the same individual cells. This should be clear when one looks at two bottom right panels in Figure 3A. We have revised the Results (subsection “Glycosylation at N1022 promotes corin exiting from the ER”, last paragraph) and Figure 3 legend, to reflect this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4 the authors immunoprecipitate corin by a C-terminal V5 tag and find an increased level of the ER proteins calnexin and BiP in the N1022Q pull down as compared to WT corin pull down. In all previous figures comparing expression levels of N1022Q to WT it looks like there is more N1022Q in the lysate. It would be nice to see the amount of corin precipitated by the V5 tag for both the WT and the N1022Q mutant to rule out that the increased level of calnexin and BiP interaction in the N1022Q pull down is not due to more of the N1022Q protein precipitated as compared to wt.</p><p>In Figure 5B a similar issue is found, as described above. It is not evident that the total amount of precipitated corin for the V5 pull down is comparable for WT and N1022Q. A Western blot of V5 immunoprecipitated corin is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We value the reviewer’s suggestion. In revised Figures 4A and 5B, corin proteins in V5-pull down samples are shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 8 it is similarly important to show the amount of precipitated protease for both EK and prothrombin (PT) in the respective V5 pulldowns to exclude that the difference in calnexin and BiP levels is not due to varying levels of the protease in the samples.</p></disp-quote><p>EK and PT were verified in the V5 pull-down samples and have been included in revised Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>[…] 1) While the DNJ experiments are informative, it cannot be conclusively established that calnexin and BiP are the essential players in corin glycoprotein folding and transport.

The biological relevance is therefore unclear. Inclusion of data using cells expression endogenous protease(s) in combination with DNJ treatment and/or RNAi-mediated silencing of calnexin and BiP would greatly enhance the impact of the findings described here.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, the suggested experiments have been done in HL-1 and HepG2 cells and the results are shown in new Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>…1) Figure 5B shows that DNJ increases calnexin and BiP binding to corin WT and to N1022Q (similar results for EK and prothrombin in later figures). I don't quite understand why there is increased binding to N1022Q in the presence of DNJ, since the N1022-attached glycan (which is absent in the mutant) seems to be the main driver for folding and export. Since the N1022Q mutant has no glycan attached at this position and, therefore, no glucose residues to begin with, it is not clearly understood (by me) why glucosidase I/II inhibition of the N1022Q mutant by DNJ would lead to even more unfolded (and retained) corin in the ER. Since in this case (N1022Q mutant) DNJ inhibits glycosylation at other sites (possibly 18 if I'm correct) the increased calnexin binding seems to be related to impaired trimming of some of these other glycan attachments. How then is the N1022 so important by itself? Maybe I have misunderstood this, but I urge the authors to work on improving the clarity on this section. In addition, the authors may comment in the Discussion as to whether DNJ increases calnexin (or calreticulin) binding of proteins other than trypsin fold serine proteases or whether this is an effect specific to trypsin-fold serine proteases (any literature on this?).</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in our replies to the Editorial comments, human corin has 19 N-glycosylation sites. In the absence of DNJ, increased binding to calnexin and BiP in the N1022Q mutant, compared to WT corin, indicates the importance of N-glycans at N1022. In the presence of DNJ, all N-glycan-calnexin interactions are expected to be inhibited. Increased binding of N1022Q to calnexin, in the presence of DNJ, indicates that N-glycans at other N-glycosylation sites on corin are also involved in the calnexin interaction. We have revised the Discussion to clarify this point (second paragraph).</p><p>Also described above, in our PubMed search we found only one report, in which DNJ treatment increased calreticulin binding to cruzipain, a protozoa cysteine protease (Labriola et al., 1999). We did not find any papers reporting increased calnexin binding to trypsin-like serine proteases or other proteins in the presence of DNJ. In the revised Discussion, we have cited the Labriola paper (fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on the proteomics results the authors have focused on calnexin and BiP, even though there are many other hits that came out of this experiment. A potentially relevant binding hit seems to be the PDI A3 and A4, which also showed enrichment in the N1022Q group (Table 1). Any reason why this was not pursued?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above in our replies to Editorial comments, we chose 2-fold as the cutoff value for differential binding proteins in our proteomic studies. We provided this info in the footnote of Supplementary file 2. The N1022Q vs. WT ratios for PDI A3 and A4 were 1.24- and 1.67-fold, respectively, which were below the cut-off value. However, we do appreciate the Editor and reviewer’s comments. In this revision, we have included the cut-off information in the Results (subsection “Increased N1022Q binding to calnexin and BiP”, first paragraph). We also performed new pull-down experiments using an anti-total PDI antibody (Cell Signaling, 3501T), which showed similar PDI binding between WT corin and N1022Q. The results are included in the revised Figure 4A and D.</p></body></sub-article></article>
