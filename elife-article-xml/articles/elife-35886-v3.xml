These systems are evolutionarily related to flagella, sharing many elements of the machinery that mediates the assembly of this complex organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diepold and Armitage, 2015</xref>). Unlike flagella, which have evolved to propel bacteria through liquid environments, T3SS machines have evolved to deliver bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to modulate cellular functions, thus shaping the functional interface between symbionts or pathogens and their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galán, 2009</xref>). The entire T3SS machine or injectisome is composed of the needle complex (NC), which is embedded in the bacterial envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubori et al., 1998</xref>), and a large cytoplasmic structure known as the sorting platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lara-Tejero et al., 2011</xref>). The NC consists of a cylindrical base ~26 nm in diameter and ~32 nm in height, which is anchored to the inner and outer membranes through multiple ring-shaped structures, and a needle-like appendage or filament that protrudes several nanometers from the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marlovits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schraidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Worrall et al., 2016</xref>). The cytoplasmic sorting platform consists of a six-pod structure 23 nm in height and 36 nm in width, capped at one of its ends by a six-spoke, wheel-like structure, all together arranged in a cage-like assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). The building of this complex organelle occurs in a highly organized fashion that is initiated by the step-wise assembly of the NC, followed by the formation of the cytoplasmic sorting platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sukhan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diepold and Wagner, 2014</xref>). The assembly of the NC is initiated by the organization of a multi-protein membrane complex known as the export apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). This complex templates the assembly of the inner rings of the NC base, which are subsequently linked to the independently assembled outer ring. Once the base and sorting platform are assembled, the intermediate substructure becomes competent for the secretion of ‘early substrates’, which are those necessary for the assembly of the inner rod and needle filament. The mechanisms of assembly of the inner rod and needle substructures are incompletely understood. The needle is built by addition of its single subunit at the growing tip after transiting through the central channel of the nascent filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poyraz et al., 2010</xref>). Much less is known about the structure and assembly of the inner rod, which is also formed by a single subunit and links the needle substructure to the base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marlovits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lefebre and Galán, 2014</xref>).

Type III secretion occurs in a hierarchical manner and the order in which a protein is engaged by the secretion machine has predictive value about its potential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galán et al., 2014</xref>). Proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion machine are engaged first (early substrates), followed by the proteins translocases (middle substrates), and finally the effector proteins (late substrates). In the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS at least two regulatory proteins, InvJ and SpaS, are involved in regulating the ‘substrate switching’ of the secretion machine from early to middle and late substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monjarás Feria et al., 2015</xref>). Absence of InvJ results in secretion machines ‘locked’ in the early substrate mode thus leading to long needles and inability to secrete middle and late substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubori et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, a mutation in the catalytic site of the export apparatus component SpaS (<italic>spaS<sup>N258A</sup></italic>) results in a secretion machine unable to secrete middle and late substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monjarás Feria et al., 2015</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Day and Lee, 2003</xref>), we found that OrgC is secreted into the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium culture supernatant in a SPI-1 T3SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

As early substrates are not injected into target host cells, these observations are consistent with previous reports failed to detect the translocation of OrgC into mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Day and Lee, 2003</xref>), and suggest that it may be involved in the assembly of the secretion machine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OrgC is required for efficient needle assembly</title><p>We investigated the secretion of early, late and middle substrates in a <italic>∆orgC S.</italic> Typhimurium mutant strain.

Notably, the <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant exhibited significantly increased level of secretion of the needle and inner rod subunit proteins PrgI and PrgJ.

We have previously observed that the absence of InvJ leads to the production of extremely long needles, which in turn result in the clumping of the bacterial culture due to needle tangling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lefebre and Galán, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubori et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore investigated the role of OrgC in needle formation by introducing a <italic>∆orgC</italic> deletion in a <italic>∆invJ S</italic>. Typhimurium mutant strain, and examining its effect on needle-dependent bacterial clumping. We found that the deletion of <italic>orgC</italic> completely abolished the <italic>∆invJ S</italic>. Typhimurium cell clumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) even though it did not alter the levels of the core components of the T3SS NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis and in sharp contrast with the <italic>∆invJ</italic> mutant, very few longer needles were observed on the surface of the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>∆orgC ∆invJ</italic> mutant when examined by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we found that while PrgI secretion was increased in the <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant strain, introduction of a <italic>∆invJ</italic> mutation into this mutant background reduced the levels of secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), presumably because in the absence of InvJ more PrgI subunits assemble into long needles. These results suggested that OrgC might be involved in needle formation. To further explore this hypothesis we isolated NCs from wild type and the <italic>∆orgC S</italic>. Typhimurium mutants and compared them by electron microscopy. We found that the proportion of fully assembled NCs (i. e. NC bases with needle substructures) vs. NCs without needle substructures was significantly reduced in the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). However, both the average length of the needles and the distribution of needle lengths in fully assembled NCs were indistinguishable in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that OrgC plays a role in the initiation of needle assembly but does not influence needle elongation or needle length.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>OrgC can exert its function when exogenously applied to bacterial cells</title><p>It is well established that type III secretion machines recognize substrates through signals located at their amino termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michiels and Cornelis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sory and Cornelis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rüssmann et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore to investigate whether the function of OrgC requires its secretion through the T3SS we constructed a mutant that lacks its first 21 amino acids. In addition, we constructed a mutant in which a maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag was placed at the amino terminus of OrgC, an arrangement that interferes with type III protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori and Galán, 2002</xref>). Both mutant constructs were stably expressed in a <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant strain but, in contrast to wild type OrgC, they were not detected in the culture supernatants indicating that their secretion was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The ability of both mutant constructs to complement a <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant strain was then tested by examining their ability to complement the OrgC-dependent bacterial cell clumping phenotype observed in the <italic>∆invJ S</italic>.

Within this loop, residues 133–139 have a somewhat partial helical character as indicated by the small Cα secondary chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, this PrgI-binding region is essentially lacking in tertiary structure. Further analysis of the electrostatic surface of OrgC indicated that the PrgI-binding region is mostly electronegative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The corresponding surface in PrgI involved in OrgC binding is mostly electropositive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting a role for electrostatic interactions in the binding mechanisms.</p><p>To get more insight into OrgC function we generated a model of how it might dock in the assembled needle filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). The NMR titration experiments identified two surfaces in PrgI that are involved in its interaction with OrgC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>): a surface involving residues S39 and L51 located towards the head group of the PrgI alpha helical hairpin, and another surface involving residue F68 located towards the bottom of this hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In the model, the PrgI surface defined by its residues S39 and L51 is exposed at the tip of the assembled needle filament, and is therefore accessible for OrgC binding, specifically to its residues 134–141 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The second PrgI surface defined by F68, however, is primarily involved in PrgI-PrgI contacts in the assembled needle and therefore would not be available for OrgC binding in the assembled needle filament. We propose a model in which OrgC would bind PrgI prior to its assembly into the needle filament engaging both interacting surfaces, the one defined by S39/L51 and that defined by F68. Such interaction would presumably lead to a more efficient needle assembly. Once PrgI polymerized into the nascent filament, OrgC would disengage from PrgI as the F68 surface would be now engaged in high-affinity PrgI-PrgI contacts. A corollary of this model is that OrgC would not be able to bind the tip of the assembled needle filament due to the absence of a critical PrgI surface defined by PrgI<sup>F68</sup>. This prediction is consistent with our inability to detect OrgC at the tip of the growing needle filament.</p><p>A database search for related structures using DALI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holm and Sander, 1993</xref>) detected no structural homologs, thus suggesting that OrgC represent a unique fold. Of interest is the observation that no true structural homologs could be detected among the components of the flagellar apparatus, which is thought to be the evolutionary precursor of virulence-associated type III secretion systems. However, it is noteworthy that the D1 domain of the flagellar capping protein FliD loosely shares some of the topological features of the OrgC central four-helix domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). The functional implications of this observation, if any, are unknown but may suggest some convergent evolutionary process in the emergence of OrgC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study describes an as of yet undiscovered component of non-flagellar T3SSs, which is encoded within <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SPI-1, next to the cluster of genes that encode the T3SS injectisome. In <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium this gene was originally identified as co-regulated with other T3SS-associated genes within the SPI-1 cluster, and more specifically co-regulated in response to oxygen levels (hence his name <underline>o</underline>xygen <underline>r</underline>egulated <underline>g</underline>ene C or OrgC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones and Falkow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2000</xref>). We found that OrgC is an ‘early’ substrate of the <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS, co-secreted with the inner rod and needle filament proteins, and the regulatory protein InvJ. Consistent with its position in the secretion hierarchy, our results indicate that OrgC plays a role in the initiation of assembly of the needle filament of the injectisome. We arrive at this conclusion based on several pieces of evidence. First, we found that removal of <italic>orgC</italic> from a <italic>∆invJ S.</italic> Typhimurium effectively abolished the clumping phenotype observed in this mutant strain due to the entanglement of the long needles that result from the absence of InvJ. Second, this effect was not associated with the presence of shorter needles but rather, with the presence of a reduced number of long needles on the bacterial surface of the <italic>∆orgC ∆invJ</italic> double mutant. Consistent with these observations, deletion of <italic>orgC</italic> from wild type <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium did not alter needle length but significantly reduced the number of NCs harboring an attached needle substructure. Third, secretion of middle and late substrates was also reduced in the <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant strain. This observation is in agreement with the reduction in the number of fully assembled injectisomes in this mutant strain, which is a requirement for the secretion of middle and late substrates by the T3SS. Finally, we found that OrgC directly interacts with PrgI and accelerates the initiation of its polymerization in vitro.</p><p>What is the mechanism by which OrgC may exert its function? Our results indicate that OrgC directly interacts with PrgI both in vivo and in vitro as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, bacterial two-hybrid and NMR spectroscopy assays. Mutations in residues in both OrgC and PrgI determined to be critical for binding by NMR spectroscopy resulted in a loss of OrgC function. We also found that OrgC must be secreted by the T3SS to exert its function and that a <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutation can be complemented by the exogenous addition of purified OrgC protein. Importantly, dynamic light scattering experiments showed that purified OrgC was able to accelerate the in vitro polymerization of PrgI into needle filaments. Taken together these results indicate that to exert its function OrgC must physically interact with PrgI and that the place of this interaction must be accessible from the outside. Therefore, these observations suggest a mechanism by which OrgC may help the initiation of the polymerization of PrgI into the needle filament. Our results indicate that OrgC may not be necessary for the subsequent elongation of the needle substructure since needles assembled in the ∆<italic>orgC</italic> mutant, although significantly reduced in numbers, exhibited the same length as those assembled in strains expressing OrgC. If OrgC were required for needle elongation, needle filaments would be expected to be shorter. Furthermore, we were not able to detect the presence of OrgC at the tip of growing needle filaments or in isolated needle complexes, which would also be expected if OrgC were involved in needle elongation. Therefore, we hypothesize that OrgC may help to nucleate the initial polymerization of PrgI monomers. Once assembly is initiated, OrgC may be discarded thus explaining our inability to detect it at the tip of the growing needle filaments or as an integral component of isolated NCs. Consistent with this hypothesis, the NMR titration experiments identified PrgI residues critical for OrgC binding that are not available for binding in the assembled filament further supporting this model.</p><p>The function of OrgC appears to be substantially different from another protein reported to influence needle assembly in <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp. that may involve the control of the secretion of the needle protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaylock et al., 2010</xref>). However, the activity of OrgC and the phenotype of the <italic>∆orgC</italic> mutant are reminiscent of flagellar capping proteins, which are required for the assembly of the rod, hook, and filament, the flagellar substructures that make up the entire flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikeda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohnishi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>). Each of the different flagellar substructures has its own specific capping protein, which control their distal growth by regulating the assembly of the different subunits at the growing tip. The recent atomic and cryo EM structures of FliD, the capping protein for the flagellar filament, have provided insight into the potential mechanism by which these proteins may exert their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Postel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2017</xref>). FliD consists of three domains (D1, D2, and D3) that assemble into an hexamer (in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> FliD) or a pentamer (in the case of <italic>S.</italic> typhimurium FliD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2017</xref>). In the multimeric forms, the D2 and D3 domains form a plate that resembles either a 5- or 6-point star. The D1 domain, which resembles flagellin, forms 5 or 6 leg-like structure, which connects the plate to the tip of the flagella. A model has been proposed in which the D1 domain of FliD temporarily occupies a position in place of a nascent flagellin until the flagellin reaches the growing end of the filament, at which point FliD would move aside to repeat the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>). In this model, the plate structure made of domains D2 and D3 would slow down the transit of flagellar subunits to facilitate their assembly at the tip. There are many similarities between OrgC and capping proteins. Like capping proteins, OrgC is secreted through the T3SS, promotes the assembly of the needle filament, and can exert its function when exogenously added to culture media. However, there are many significant differences as well. Unlike capping proteins, OrgC appears to be required only for the efficient initiation of needle filament assembly but not for its elongation. Once assembly is initiated, OrgC is likely discarded to the culture supernatant as we were unable to detect it bound to the tip of the growing needle or in isolated NCs. Furthermore, unlike the capping proteins, OrgC is not essential for needle assembly. In its absence, the number of fully assembled NC is reduced although those that assemble exhibit needle filaments that are of the same length as those of wild type. The functional differences between OrgC and the capping proteins are also reflected in substantial differences in their sizes (150 vs ~450 amino acids) and amino acid sequence. However, the NMR structure of OrgC indicates that even though it shares no amino acid sequence similarity with capping proteins, its central core domain exhibits topological similarities with the D1 domain of capping proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deane et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore it is possible that OrgC may be equivalent to capping proteins lacking the 'plate' substructure, which may explain the substantial differences in the activities of these functionally related proteins. The diameter of the T3SS needle is significantly smaller than the diameter of the flagellar filament (8 nm vs 20 nm), which may translate into differences in its assembly mechanism, and in turn, differences in the requirement and/or function of the accessory proteins during assembly. In fact, OrgC homologs appear to be absent from several T3SSs, suggesting that the needle filaments of these systems may have evolved a complete independence from accessory proteins for their assembly. In support of this hypothesis, we detected a high degree of conservation in the amino acids involved in the interaction with OrgC in needle filament proteins from T3SS that have homologs of OrgC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have described an as of yet unidentified component of non-flagellar T3SSs, which promotes the assembly of the needle filament substructure. These studies provide major insight into the assembly mechanisms of the T3SS injectisome and highlight differences and similarities with the evolutionary related flagellar apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species)</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> <break/>serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB300</td><td valign="top">Nature, 291:238</td><td valign="top">wild type</td><td valign="top">Mouse isolate of SL1344</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> <break/>serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB2942</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>orgC 3xFlag invC::kan</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB2943</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>orgC</italic> 3xFlag invJ::kan</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB2946</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>orgC 3xFlag spaS-3xFlag</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB2947</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>orgC</italic> 3xFlag spaSN258A-3xFlag</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB2326</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>∆invJ flhD</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB2939</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>∆invJ∆orgC flhD</italic>::Tn<italic>10</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB3079</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>mbp-prgH flhD</italic>::<italic>tet</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB3275</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><italic>mbp-prgH flhD</italic>::<italic>tet ∆orgC</italic></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>Salmonella</italic> <break/><italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td valign="top">SB762</td><td valign="top">Infect.

PrgI was expressed and purified for NMR studies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). For protein expression, plasmid expressing His-tag-GB1-OrgC or PrgI was transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3). OrgC and PrgI uniformly labeled with <sup>15</sup>N were obtained by cell growth in 1L M9 minimal media supplemented with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, antibiotics, trace minerals (ATCC MD-TMS), and vitamins (ATCC MD-VS). Unlabeled OrgC and PrgI were obtained by cell growth in 1L LB media. Typically, cells were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.8 at 37°C, induced with 1 mM IPTG, and protein expression was continued by cell growth at 15°C. Cells were lysed by sonication and the recombinant protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McShan et al., 2016</xref>). The His-tag-GB1-OrgC fusion protein was digested with TEV protease, followed by a second round of nickel affinity chromatography to yield recombinant OrgC.</p><p>The assignment of the NMR peaks of PrgI has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and the NMR assignments for OrgC followed essentially the methods used in assigning PrgI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Purified <sup>15</sup>N-labeled OrgC and unlabeled PrgI were dialyzed in NMR buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7), and several samples of <sup>15</sup>N OrgC:PrgI complexes at varying molar ratios were prepared. Likewise, <sup>15</sup>N PrgI was titrated with unlabeled OrgC in a similar manner. The titration was monitored by acquiring 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra for each titration point at room temperature using a Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. The NMR spectra were processed by NMRPipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaglio et al., 1995</xref>) and analyzed by NMRView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson, 2004</xref>). Weighted chemical shift deviations were calculated and plotted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McShan et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>NMR structure determination of OrgC</title><p>NMR samples for structure determination consisted of 500 μL volume of 1.2 mM <sup>15</sup>N- or <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>13</sup>C-labeled OrgC (residues 21–150) in 2 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 6.5) and 75 mM NaCl. Typical NMR samples were dissolved in 10% D<sub>2</sub>O, however, for 3D <sup>13</sup>C-edited HMQC NOESY (see below), the NMR sample was lyophilized, and re-dissolved in 100% D<sub>2</sub>O. NMR spectra were acquired at 25°C using a Bruker Avance 800 MHz NMR equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe or a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR equipped with a room-temperature triple resonance probe. NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaglio et al., 1995</xref>) and analyzed with NMRView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson, 2004</xref>). NMR peak assignments were obtained from 2D <sup>15</sup>N HSQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grzesiek and Bax, 1993a</xref>) and 3D HNCACB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wittekind and Mueller, 1993</xref>), HNCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grzesiek et al., 1992</xref>), CACBCONH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grzesiek et al., 1992</xref>), and HBHA(CO)NH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grzesiek and Bax, 1993b</xref>). Analysis of the <sup>13</sup>Cα, <sup>13</sup>Cβ and <sup>1</sup>Hα secondary chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wishart and Nip, 1998</xref>) identified the helical regions of OrgC. For structure calculations, distance restraints were obtained from NOEs (nuclear Overhauser effect) assigned from 3D <sup>15</sup>N-edited HSQC NOESY (t<sub>mix</sub>120 ms) and 3D <sup>13</sup>C-edited HMQC NOESY (t<sub>mix</sub>120 ms). Using intra-residue NOEs as internal standards, the NOEs were categorized based on peak intensities into strong, medium, and weak NOEs, and assigned upper distance limits of 2.7 Å, 3.5 Å, and 5.5 Å, respectively. Dihedral angle restraints of phi −60 ± 20° and psi −40 ± 20° were used for alpha helical regions identified by the secondary chemical shifts. Structure calculations were done using CYANA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Güntert, 2004</xref>), typically, as follows: 170 structures were calculated by simulated annealing and molecular dynamics followed by energy minimization of 100 structures with the lowest energies. The 20 lowest energy structures were analyzed to identify violations in distance and dihedral restraints. Structure calculations were repeated iteratively by addition of newly identified NOEs until the global fold of the protein emerged. The 40 CYANA structures with the lowest target functions were used as starting models for further structural calculations and refinement using AMBER7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Case, 2002</xref>) following a similar protocol described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dames et al., 2002</xref>). Briefly, the AMBER7 structure calculation was initiated with 1000 steps of energy minimization, followed by simulated annealing <italic>in vacuo</italic> for 20 ps at 1000 K, a second round of simulated annealing for 20 ps at 500 K, and a final energy minimization of 1000 steps. In the final stages of the structural refinements, AMBER7 with the generalized Born potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2002</xref>) was used as implicit water model in NMR structure calculations. The twenty lowest energy structures were used for structural analysis using Pymol. The 20 PDB coordinates, the assigned chemical shifts, and the restraints used in the NMR structure determination were deposited at the RCSB Protein Data Bank with the accession code PDB ID 6CJD and BMRB ID 30417.

Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Many Gram-negative pathogen employ a syringe-like secretion system – the injectisome – to secrete effector proteins into host cells. The injectisome is evolutionary related to bacterial flagella. A type III secretion system (T3SS) powers protein export via both nanomachines. In the present manuscript, Kato et al. investigated the molecular function of a hitherto poorly characterized component of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> SPI-1 injectisome, OrgC. The authors found that OrgC is secreted in a T3SS-dependent manner and is required for efficient needle assembly, but not for needle elongation. In a clever set of experiments, the authors show that extracellular addition of recombinant OrgC is able to complement the needle assembly defect of a ∆<italic>orgC</italic> mutant strain. Finally, the authors determined that OrgC interacts with the injectisome needle protein PrgI and solved the OrgC structure. The injectisome is a macromolecular machine of remarkable complexity. How bacteria manage to assemble such complex structures remains a poorly understood and is of interest to a general audience. The work is elegantly carried out and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide further evidence of OrgC-dependent in initiation of PrgI needle polymerization, either in vitro (by purifying OrgC-His and PrgI and assaying for filament assembly using electron microscopy or fluorescence as readouts) or in vivo (by monitoring needle polymerization in vivo by addition of recombinant OrgC and/or PrgI* in a ∆<italic>orgC</italic> ∆<italic>prgI</italic> double mutant).</p><p>2) The authors should determine if plasmid overexpression of OrgC is having an effect on expression or secretion. For example, is overexpression affecting the regulation of HilA?</p><p>3) It is obvious that purified OrgC has an effect when added exogenously. This is shown by the indirect &quot;clumping&quot; assay. However, it would be more convincing if the authors repeated the experiment in Figure 2E by analyzing the needle complexes from the wild type and orgC mutant after ectopic addition of purified OrgC since this assay is more direct.</p><p>4) Figure 6FG: The phenotype of the orgC deletion mutants is not informative without showing that these mutants are stable and still secreted.</p><p>5) The authors need to provide additional quantification and/or information for the following:</p><p>-Figure 1CD: Improve figure labels and add a legend. (Currently, the labeling of the figure is misleading. The authors study the secretion of OrgC-3xFLAG, which is expressed from a plasmid, not of endogenous orgC.

The secretion phenotype of the ∆<italic>orgC</italic> mutant is not nearly as robust as the clumping phenotype. As shown in Figure 6G, the phenotype of the PrgI mutations in the clumping assay was intermediate in comparison with the phenotype of the ∆<italic>orgC</italic> mutant. This is expected given the complexity of the interface between OrgC and PrgI, which cannot be easily altered by mutagenesis without compromising needle assembly. Consequently, the PrgI mutations, while exhibiting a phenotype in the more robust clumping assay, they do not show a measurable phenotype in the secretion assay. We have clarified this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Add list with strain and plasmid genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The strains and plasmids have now been added in a Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3, which we had originally accidently did not upload.</p></body></sub-article></article>
