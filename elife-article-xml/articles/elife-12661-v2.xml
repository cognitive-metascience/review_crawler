We investigated the composition and distribution of shaker-type-potassium channels (Kv1 channels) within the nodal complex of myelinated axons following injury. At the neuroma that forms after damage, expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 (normally localised to the juxtaparanode) was markedly decreased. In contrast Kv1.4 and 1.6, which were hardly detectable in the naïve state, showed increased expression within juxtaparanodes and paranodes following injury, both in rats and humans. Within the dorsal root (a site remote from injury) we noted a redistribution of Kv1-channels towards the paranode. Blockade of Kv1 channels with α-DTX after injury reinstated hyperexcitability of A-fibre axons and enhanced mechanosensitivity. Changes in the molecular composition and distribution of axonal Kv1 channels, therefore represents a protective mechanism to suppress the hyperexcitability of myelinated sensory axons that follows nerve injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12661.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12661.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12661.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Around 20% of the world’s population experiences long-lasting “chronic” pain, which often results in poor sleep, depression and anxiety. One of the most disabling forms of chronic pain is called neuropathic pain, which results from injuries to sensory nerves. Pain or discomfort is felt in response to touches that are not normally painful. Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat as we do not fully understand the molecular mechanisms that cause it.</p><p>Stimulating a nerve causes it to produce action potentials. At a molecular level, these action potentials are generated by ions moving into and out of the neuron through proteins called ion channels. The movement of sodium ions into a neuron triggers an action potential, and the movement of potassium ions out of the neuron returns it to a resting state.</p><p>After a sensory nerve is cut or otherwise damaged it becomes hyperactive and produces spontaneous electrical activity that the brain interprets as pain signals. However, it is not fully understood how cutting a nerve affects the ion channels in a way that generates this hyperactivity.</p><p>Different types of ion channel are found in different regions of the nerve cell; for example, type 1 potassium channels are normally found in a region called the juxtaparanode at the axon of the neuron. Calvo et al. have now tracked what happens to type 1 potassium channels after nerve injury in rats. Soon after nerve damage occurred, nearly all of these ion channels disappeared from the juxtaparanode. At the same time, electrical activity in the cut nerve increased, and the recovering animals responded in ways that suggested they were hypersensitive to the nerve being touched.</p><p>Three weeks after the injury, most rats lost their hypersensitivity and the electrical activity in the cut nerve returned to near-normal levels. Calvo et al. found that the recovering nerves contained new subtypes of type 1 potassium channels. These potassium channels did not just appear in the juxtaparanode: they also invaded the ‘fence’ region that normally separates potassium channels from sodium channels. The same was observed to happen in the nerves of patients that suffer from neuropathic pain due to a nerve injury.</p><p>At this late time point after nerve injury, blocking the activity of potassium channels produced the same abnormal increase in the nerve’s electrical activity as seen immediately after the nerve had been cut. The rats’ hypersensitivity to touch also returned. This suggests that the appearance of the new potassium channel subtypes might be a protective mechanism that reduces the activity of a damaged nerve to decrease pain.</p><p>These findings suggest new ways of treating neuropathic pain. Further studies are now needed to investigate whether drugs that can activate the new potassium channel subtypes could stop pain from an injured nerve becoming a long-term problem.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12661.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12661.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>neuropathy</kwd><kwd>shaker type potassium channels</kwd><kwd>juxtaparanode</kwd><kwd>hypersensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Faculty Award 2755-010-81</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calvo</surname><given-names>Margarita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Apoyo al Retorno del investigador en el extranjero Folio 82130016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calvo</surname><given-names>Margarita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome strategic award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMahon</surname><given-names>Stephen B</given-names></name><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>David LH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Wellcome Clinical Scientist (ref. no. 095698z/11/z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>David LH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002848</institution-id><institution>Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FONDAP-15150012, Ministerio de Economia, Millennium Nucleus-P-07-011-F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Court</surname><given-names>Felipe A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Type 1 potassium channels alter their composition and localisation to suppress hyper-excitability and neuropathic pain of injured sensory neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Following traumatic nerve injury spontaneous activity develops initially in myelinated and subsequently in unmyelinated sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wall and Gutnick, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kajander and Bennett, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2000a</xref>). The onset of this spontaneous activity is associated with the emergence of pain-related sensory changes in animal models and is critical for the maintenance of peripheral neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haroutounian et al., 2014</xref>) in patients where selective blockade suggests the involvement of myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 1988</xref>). Ectopic activity is particularly prominent in myelinated afferents and peaks within the first few days post injury and then declines over subsequent weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kajander and Bennett, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2000</xref>). Such ectopic activity arises both at the neuroma site and also at the level of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wall and Devor, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Altered expression, function and trafficking of voltage-gated ion channels are key determinants of these excitability changes. <italic>Shaker</italic> type voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1 channels) are important determinants of neuronal excitability. They are formed by heteromultimers of α and β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacKinnon, 1991</xref>). The characteristics of the outward currents they carry depend on subunit composition. Sensory neurons are known to express Kv1 channels and functionally these channels have been shown to limit excitability of sensory neurons: For instance Kv1.2 suppresses excitability at the level of the sensory neuron cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasband et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everill et al., 1998</xref>) and Kv1.1 acts as a ‘brake’ on mechanosensitivity at the terminals of C-mechano-nociceptor and Aβ-mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hao et al., 2013</xref>). Kv1 channels also act as excitability brakes for cold thermal sensitivity in intact and damaged axons of primary sensory neurons (many of such fibres are also mechano-sensitive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madrid et al., 2009</xref>). Kv1 channels are known to be expressed in the juxtaparanodal region of myelinated sensory axons. An unexplored issue, however, is whether the distribution of these channels changes under pathological neuropathic states.</p><p>Saltatory conduction in myelinated fibres depends on the molecular organization of channel domains within the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Rasband, 2013</xref>): voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) are clustered at the node of Ranvier. Nodes are flanked by the paranode, which is an important point of attachment between the axon and the terminal loops of the Schwann cell. Just inside the innermost axoglial junction of the paranode is the juxtaparanode a domain enriched in Kv1 channels Kv1.1 and 1.2. The localisation of Kv1.1 and 1.2 to the juxtaparanode is dependent on the formation of a molecular scaffold, which includes the adhesion molecules caspr2 and TAG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>). In the naïve state in adulthood, the juxtaparanodal Kv1 channels are thought not to have a major influence on axon conduction properties of peripheral myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiu and Ritchie, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sherratt et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>), probably because they are electrically insulated from the node of Ranvier under the myelin sheath. However during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vabnick et al., 1999</xref>) and following primary demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>) (during which myelin is removed but the axon remains intact), Kv1.1 and 1.2 become more widely distributed to include the paranode and even the node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2004</xref>), and can act to suppress excitability. Although Kv1.1 and 1.2 expression within the soma is known to be down-regulated following axon transection, and this leads to hyperexcitability at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2003</xref>), the distribution of these channels at the nodal complex and damaged nerve terminal (in the neuroma that forms) has not been examined. Furthermore, little is known regarding the distribution of other members of the shaker type Kv1 channels family such as Kv1.4 and 1.6 following nerve injury.</p><p>Here we show that within a neuroma, expression levels of Kv1.1 and 1.2 are markedly reduced but over time Kv1.4 and 1.6 expression increases within juxtaparanodes and paranodes. At sites remote from injury, there is also a gradual redistribution of Kv1 channels to the paranode. Electrophysiological and behavioural experiments suggest that changes in subunit expression and redistribution of Kv1 channels act a ‘brake’ on the hyperexcitable state that arises in myelinated axons following traumatic nerve injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of Kv1 channels subunits switches at nodal regions after nerve injury</title><p>To investigate the role of Kv1 channels in hypersensitivity after nerve injury we used a model of complete sciatic nerve transection followed by positioning of the proximal stump superficially under the skin of the leg [modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorsi et al. (2008)</xref>]. This model enables us to study both the expression of Kv1 channels within the neuroma and undertake behavioural analysis using specific blockers of Kv1 channels.</p><p>To study how the localisation of Kv1 channels changes within the nodal complex, we used a pan-Nav channel antibody to label the node of Ranvier, a Caspr antibody to label the paranode and Kv1.2 and Caspr2 antibodies to label the juxtaparanode. In the naïve axon, we observed that over 90% (mean 91 ± SEM 2.9%, n = 4 animals) of the nodes presented a characteristic morphology with Nav clustering in the centre, surrounded by caspr at both sides and Kv1.2 clustered within the juxtaparanode.

At day 7 after injury, Kv1.2 channels were not located strictly not only in the juxtaparanodal regions but also overlapped with paranodal proteins. To objectively measure this, we quantified the distance between the Nav channels staining and the distal end of the caspr staining, and the distance between the Nav channels staining and the proximal end of Kv1 channels. The difference between these two distances was indicative of the level of overlap between Kv1 channels and paranodal proteins (note that ‘naked’ nodes were not included in the analysis of the spatial distribution of Kv1 channels because by definition these only consist of Nav clusters without paranodal and juxtaparanodal proteins). In naïve axons the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 3.8 ± 0.2 μm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was 4.2 ± 0.2 μm, resulting in a relatively small, albeit positive, difference between these distances (0.5 ± 0.08 μm, n = 4 animals, 25–40 nodes per animal), indicating there was no overlap. At day 7 after injury, the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 4 ± 0.1 μm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was 3.2 ± 0.2 μm, giving a negative value for the difference between both distances (-0.8 ± 0.1 μm, n = 3 animals, 32–35 nodes per animal), which indicates that the Kv1 channels were co-localised with caspr staining and moving closer to the node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Note that the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr staining remained unchanged after injury, while the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was significantly reduced. Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (<italic>Caspr2</italic>) forms a complex with Kv1 channels at the juxtaparanode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2014</xref>). We evaluated if caspr2 moves closer to the node together with Kv1 channels. We measured the distance between the Nav channels staining and the distal end of the caspr staining, and the distance between the Nav channels staining and the proximal end of caspr2. In naïve axons, the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 3.8 ± 0.3 μm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of caspr2 staining was 4.3 ± 0.0 μm, resulting in a small difference between these distances (0.49 ± 0.09 μm, n = 4 animals, 25–30 nodes per animal), indicating there was no overlap. At day 7 after injury, the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 4.1 ± 0.2 μm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of caspr2 staining was 2.8 ± 0.2 μm, giving a negative value for the difference between both distances (-1.2 ± 0.1 μm, n = 3 animals, 30 nodes per animal), which indicates that the caspr2 co-localised with caspr staining and had moved closer to the node together with Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12661.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nav channel expression.</title><p>Representative sections of longitudinal nerves immunostained with Kv1.2 in green, a panNav antibody in red (to identify the node), and caspr in blue (to identify the paranode) from neuroma day 21.

The effect on Kv12 re-localization remains the same at the site far from the neuroma: The difference between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr distance and Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 distance was -1 ± 0.09 μm, at the site close to the neuroma and -1.1 ± 0.09 μm, at the site far from the neuroma (p = 0.6, n = 5 animals, 24–26 nodes per animal).

Therefore, we examined their ultrastructural anatomy using electron-microscopy and measured the distance between the axon and the paranodal loops (axo-glial distance), the number of detached and everted loops and the minimal and maximal distance between loops. We analysed sciatic nerves from sham-operated and neuroma animals and we observed very few detached or everted loops, with no differences between groups. The close apposition between the axon and the paranodal loop was unchanged as the axo-glial distance was not significantly changed (sham = 9.7 ± 0.4 nm, neuroma = 11.4 ± 0.7 nm, n = 4–5 animals per group, 6–9 nodes per animal one way ANOVA p = 0.08). We observed a small but significant increase in the maximal distance between loops (sham = 12.5 ± 1 nm, neuroma = 18.9 ± 1.4 nm, one way ANOVA, p = 0.005). In summary, these results suggest that although there was no major disruption of the septate axoglial junctions there was a small but significant increased separation between the paranodal loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

We used this model instead of the neuroma model to have certainty that all the dorsal root axons studied had their peripheral terminals injured.</p><p>In the dorsal roots from naïve animals, the distance between Nav channels staining and the end of caspr was 3.5 ± 0.2 μm, and the distance between Nav channels staining and the start of Kv1.2 staining was 4 ± 0.2 μm, resulting in a small positive difference between these distances (0.5 ± 0.1 μm, n = 4 animals, 25–32 nodes per animal), indicating there was no overlap. Seven days after transection of L5 spinal nerve this distance was still positive (0.24 ± 0.05 μm, n = 4 animals; distance Nav-end caspr 3.7 ± 0.2 μm, distance Nav-start Kv1.2 3.9 ± 0.1 μm; 30–40 nodes per animal).

We observed this novel localisation of Kv1.2 in the paranode which (in contrast to the neuroma site) is still clearly present after nerve injury within the dorsal root. We also observed novel expression of Kv1.4 and 1.6 in the dorsal root of injured animals, and these were localised to the paranode in addition to the juxtaparanode (the distance between end of caspr and start of Kv1.4 and 1.6 staining was -1.7 ± 0.6 μm and -1.07 ± 0.2 μm respectively; for Kv1.4 distance between Nav-end caspr 3.6 ± 0.4 μm, distance between Nav-start Kv1.4 1.9 ± 0.6 μm; for Kv1.6: distance between Nav-end caspr 3.4 ± 0.4 μm, distance between Nav-start Kv1.6 1.6 ± 0.4 μm n = 4 animals per group, 30–35 nodes per animal <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12661.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Kv1 channels expression in the dorsal roots of naïve animals and 21 days after spinal nerve transection (SNT).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative sections of longitudinal dorsal roots immunostained with Kv1 channels in green (Kv1.2, Kv1.4 and Kv1.6, respectively), a panNav antibody in red (to identify the node), and caspr in blue (to identify the paranode).

We applied the toxin at the neuroma site (or, in control animals, acutely cut sciatic nerve stump) and to the L5 DRG and recorded from sensory axons in thin strands dissected from the dorsal root. In the naïve situation (n = 222 neurons, 10 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>), the incidence of spontaneous activity did not significantly change after α-DTX (5.4 and 9.8% of myelinated afferents when the toxin was applied to nerve stump or L5 DRG, respectively). Two days after transecting the sciatic nerve (n = 291 neurons, 4 animals), spontaneous activity at the injured nerve increased to 22% of myelinated afferents, and it was similar with or without toxin (toxin applied to neuroma 26.1%, toxin applied to the L5 DRG 26%). However, at 7 days after nerve injury (n = 241 neurons, 7 animals) the proportion of spontaneously active afferents had decreased to 6.2%, and application of the toxin now induced a significant increase in proportion of spontaneously firing myelinated afferents (11.2% toxin at the neuroma p = 0.07, and 15.6% toxin to L5 DRG, p = 0.002, chi-square test). At day 21 after injury (n = 237 neurons, 7 animals) spontaneous activity has decreased to baseline levels (2.5% of afferents within the dorsal root), but application of the toxin to both neuroma site or L5 DRG significantly increased the proportion of myelinated afferents demonstrating spontaneous activity (7.2% p = 0.03 and 17.7 ±% p&lt;0.001 respectively, chi-square test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). In summary, we observed an acute increase in spontaneous activity following nerve injury, which was reversed with time. However, at this later time, blockade of Kv1 channels (which had no effect in the naïve state) could reinstate spontaneous activity almost to levels seen acutely after nerve injury. Therefore, Kv1 channels appear to have a role in the recovery from increased excitability following nerve injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b–d</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12661.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Local application of α-DTX reinstates primary afferent hyperexcitability at later time points following nerve injury.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustration of 3-chamber recording system. 1) Recording chamber, 2) middle chamber, 3) stimulating chamber.

Following traumatic nerve injury there is an initial inflammatory response, demyelination and axonal die-back within the proximal nerve stump. This is followed by axonal sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fried and Devor, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeFelipe, 1991</xref>) (which is often misdirected) as well as proliferation of connective tissue and glial cells. This can lead to a region of nerve swelling, a neuroma, the development of which is well documented in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scadding, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeFelipe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Young, 1942</xref>). Nerve injury is often associated with ongoing pain, dysaesthesia and evoked pain; many patients report that touching the skin overlying or compression of the neuroma site can elicit pain and dysaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nikolajsen et al., 2010</xref>). Unfortunately in many patients, the treatment of neuropathic pain remains inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finnerup et al., 2015</xref>) and is associated with significant disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stokvis et al., 2010</xref>). Neuroma pain can be modelled in the rodent using a modified version of the tibial transposition neuroma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorsi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Altered distribution of Kv1 channels in nodal complexes of the neuroma and dorsal root</title><p>It has previously been documented that within a neuroma nodes of Ranvier become disorganised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levinson et al., 2012</xref>) and we confirm that here with the majority nodes showing abnormalities such as being elongated, split, heminodes or showing Na<sub>v</sub> in the absence of caspr. Voltage-gated sodium channels are known to accumulate particularly within axon tips and on denuded axons of the neuroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">England et al., 1996</xref>). Much less is known regarding the distribution of Kv1 channels changes within the neuroma. This is an important issue as such channels could potentially act as ‘brakes’ on excitability. At an early time point after injury, we found that Kv1.2 is no longer confined to the juxtaparanode but extended into the paranode. As this could be only a reflection of direct injury, we also looked into a site in the injured nerve 1 cm proximal to the neuroma and found similar changes in distribution, suggesting this is likely to reflect widespread changes within the axon/axoglial signalling (further supported by changes within the dorsal root and discussed below). At a later time-point following injury, we found a striking reduction in the expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 which are normally localised to the juxtaparanode. In contrast Kv1.4 and 1.6 which are present at a low level in the naïve state are up-regulated and are present both in the paranode and the juxtaparanode. We found broadly similar changes in rodent and human neuroma. This altered expression and localisation is likely to partially reflect the altered relationship between axons and myelinating Schwann cells. Within the neuroma new nodes of Ranvier will be formed as a consequence of myelination of new axon sprouts and remyelination of denuded axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorsi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyck et al., 1985</xref>). During developmental myelination and remyelination following primary demyelination (in which the axon remains intact) Kv1.1 and 1.2 can at early time points be observed in other regions apart from the juxtaparanode (at the node of Ranvier and the paranode) before being restricted to the juxtaparanode as the nodal complex matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vabnick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poliak et al., 2001</xref>). Kv1.4 and 1.6 expression has not to our knowledge been examined during myelination/remyelination.</p><p>We also studied the dorsal root, which is remote from the injury site to establish whether there were changes in Kv1 channels composition of the juxtaparanode that reflect the general response of the axon to injury rather than local effects such as inflammation and remyelination at the injury site. We also found striking changes within the nodal complex of sensory axons within the dorsal root. Kv1.2 was no longer down-regulated as had been noted at the neuroma site but its localisation changed following injury: They could be observed in the paranode as well as the juxtaparanode. In the naïve state, very little Kv1.4 and 1.6 expression was noted in the juxtaparanode of the dorsal roots. This is in agreement with previous studies that reported a low frequency of Kv1.4 immunoreactive juxtaparanodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everill et al., 1998</xref>) and no expression of Kv1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Utsunomiya et al., 2008</xref>). We found however that nerve transection led to markedly increased expression of these α-subunits and they were localised both to juxtaparanode and paranode.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Factors governing localisation of Kv1 channels to axonal domains in the naïve and injured state</title><p>What factors are responsible for the altered distribution of Kv1 channels within the juxtaparanode? We used ultrastructural examination of the juxtaparanode in the dorsal root to examine whether structural changes within the paranode could explain the movement of Kv1 channels into this region (from which they are normally excluded). The transverse bands are important points of attachment between the axon and the paranodal loops of the Schwann cell. These axoglial septate-like junctions are formed by the interaction of caspr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>) and contactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>) on the axolemma binding with the 155Kd isoform of Neurofascin expressed on the Schwann cell paranodal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tait et al., 2000</xref>). These junctions act as diffusion barriers between the nodal and juxtaparanodal membrane. Mice lacking caspr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2001</xref>), contactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>) or NF155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pillai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherman et al., 2005</xref>) have absent transverse bands, increased distance between the axon and Schwann cell membrane, disorganisation of the paranodal loops and probably as a consequence of the loss of this lateral diffusion barrier Kv1 channels are noted to extend into the paranode. Similarly in mice lacking ceramide galactosyl transferase in which all-putative adhesion components of the paranodal junction are lacking, Kv1.2 and caspr2 are also mis-localised to the paranodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poliak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2003</xref>). On ultrastructural examination of the paranodes within the sciatic nerve following injury, we did not see major structural changes and there was no increase in the distance between the axon and the Schwann cell membrane at the site of attachment of the paranodal loops. We noted an increase in the maximum distance between paranodal loops, which is unlikely to alter the ability of molecules to passively diffuse between the membrane domains of the juxtaparanode and paranode (however it will increase the diameter of the helical pathway between paranodal loops connecting the extracellular space to the axonal internode. One potential consequence of which would be reduced passive resistance to current flow between the node and voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) in the juxtaparanode and paranode, which could then have a greater influence on nodal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shroff et al., 2011</xref>). A recent publication has demonstrated that in mice lacking βII spectrin expression in axons Kv1 channels were no longer restricted to the juxtaparanode but could also be observed in the paranode even though the structural integrity of axoglial junctions was intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). βII spectrin contributes to the sub-membranous cytoskeleton of the axon-linking membrane proteins to actin and appears to act as a barrier limiting the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins. We found that paranodal expression of βII spectrin was reduced following axotomy and a reduction in this sub-membranous barrier is compatible with the lateral movement of Kv1 channels into this region that we observed. As well as Kv1 channels we also see caspr2 overlapping with paranodal markers following nerve injury and again such paranodal localisation of caspr2 was also reported in mice in which axonal βII spectrin is conditionally ablated. Caspr2 complexes with and is important for the correct localisation of Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poliak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2003</xref>) suggesting that this whole protein complex is mis-localised following nerve injury. Although loss of a sub-membranous barrier to diffusion of the VGKC-complex is one explanation for their paranodal localisation, we do not yet have a full understanding of the regulation of Kv1 channels trafficking. Phosphorylation events may have a role to play as Kv1.2 can undergo phosphorylation, which impacts on surface expression/localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gu and Gu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The effect of altered Kv1 channels subunit composition and localisation on axonal excitability and neuropathic pain</title><p>Following axonal injury sensory axons become hyper-excitable and this is important in driving and maintaining neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2000</xref>). A recent study showed that myelinated sensory fibres are key in maintaining mechanical allodynia in several neuropathic pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Spontaneous activity and mechanical stimulus evoked activity has been recorded in myelinated afferents innervating neuroma using microneurography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nyström and Hagbarth, 1981</xref>). The role of Kv1 channels has mainly focussed on their importance in suppressing excitability at the soma rather than the axon following injury. The expression of a number of α Kv1 channels sub-units has been documented to decrease following peripheral axotomy including Kv1.1, 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everill et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2004</xref>) and in some reports Kv1.4 (we did not see a reduction in Kv1.4 using western blot analysis of DRG lysate following sciatic axotomy, however, this is a less proximal lesion compared to spinal nerve ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Everill et al., 1998</xref>]). Correspondingly, the K currents mediated by such channels are reduced when measured at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2004</xref>) both in small and large diameter DRG cells. The focus has therefore been on the loss of K currents within the soma which normally act as a ‘break’ on excitability, and combined with increased excitatory drive for instance due to the dysfunction of voltage-gated sodium channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels this leads to ectopic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waxman and Zamponi, 2014</xref>). While changes at the soma are undoubtedly important, ectopic impulses also arise along the axon. There has been much less focus on the distribution and function of Kv1 channels within the axon following peripheral nerve injury.</p><p>The function of Kv1 channels is critically dependent on their targeting to specific neuronal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trimmer, 2015</xref>). The expression of Kv1 channels within the DRG soma and the axon should not be assumed to be the same: For instance the expression of Kv1.6 remains stable within the DRG both at the level of mRNA and protein (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al. (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al. (2004)</xref> and our own data) but as we show here expression markedly increases in axons within peripheral nerve and dorsal root. Altered α subunit composition and localisation of Kv1 channels is likely to have functional implications. In the naïve state, the Kv1 channels Kv1.1 and 1.2 are located within the juxtaparanode, below the insulating myelin sheath and at least in peripheral nerves have little functional impact on nodal excitability and conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poliak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiu and Ritchie, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sherratt et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>). During development when Kv1 channels are observed in the node and paranode using specific blockers of this K current suggests that these Kv1 channels prevent re-entrant excitation in motor axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vabnick et al., 1999</xref>). Following primary demyelination, the re-distribution of Kv1 channels to the paranode acts to suppress continuous conduction in demyelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>). In certain contexts therefore and especially when Kv1 channels begin to encroach on the paranodal regions there is evidence that these channels can suppress excitability of the axon. As has been previously demonstrated we have found that the rate of ectopic activity within myelinated axons is very high in the first week and then decreases the longer the time elapsed following the initial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 1988</xref>). Understanding adaptive mechanisms to suppress such hyper-excitability will potentially provide insight as to why in certain patients such mechanisms fail leading to chronic pain states. Over a similar time period as this reduction in spontaneous activity we have observed increased expression of Kv1.4 and 1.6 as well as redistribution of Kv1 channels to the paranode and juxtaparanode domains. Selective inhibition of Kv1 channels with α-DTX reinstates a higher level of ectopic activity, increases mechanosensitivity of afferents innervating the neuroma and on behavioural testing also exacerbates mechanical hypersensitivity, which had begun to normalise at 3 weeks post injury. α-DTX blocks Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6. As expression of Kv1.1 and 1.2 are decreased while Kv1.6 is increased, most probably the effect seen with the toxin is through Kv1.6. Selective inhibition of Kv1.4 did not recapitulate these events emphasising the role of Kv1.6 (and subunits with which it complexes) in suppressing hyperexcitability. Neuronal Kv1 proteins form heterotetramerization of α subunits, which also associate with auxiliary Kvβ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jan and Jan, 2012</xref>), adding complexity in ascribing function to individual α subunits. α subunits confer particular pharmacological and biophysical properties on these channels and in addition there may be interactions between subunits. For instance Kv1.4, usually shows N-type rapid inactivation through an N-terminal inactivation ball however this can be over-ridden if associated with a Kv1.6 α subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roeper et al., 1998</xref>), due to its NIP (N-type inactivation prevention) domain.</p><p>In conclusion, we have found major changes in Kv1 channels subunit composition and distribution within the axolemma of myelinated axons following traumatic nerve injury. In contrast to the soma in which Kv1 channels expression is reduced this increased availability of Kv1 channels within the paranodes and altered subunit composition appears to fulfil an adaptive role in suppressing excessive excitability in myelinated afferents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in accordance with UK Home Office and Pontificia Universidad Catolica’s regulations (animals in the UK were purchased from Charles-River UK, animals from Chile were purchased onsite). Rats were group housed and placed on a 12 hr-light 12 hr-dark cycles. Two different nerve injury models were used: the neuroma model and the L5 spinal nerve transection (SNT) model. The neuroma model of neuropathic pain was based on the TNT model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorsi et al., 2008</xref>), but performed with some modifications. Briefly, the sciatic nerve was dissected free of adjacent tissue, ligated with a suture, and cut proximal to its bifurcation. The needle from the suture was passed through a subcutaneous tunnel to the lateral aspect of the hindlimb where it was pushed through the skin. The nerve was drawn into the tunnel until the ligature is adjacent to the skin. The suture was cut, and the incision closed. The suture tied to the distal end of the sciatic nerve was visible through the skin and served as the target for mechanical stimuli. An analogous site served as the target on the contralateral hindlimb. For the L5 SNT model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Chung, 1992</xref>), one-third of the L6 transverse process was removed and the L5 spinal nerve was identified and dissected free from the adjacent L4 spinal nerve and then tightly ligated using 6–0 silk and then transected distally to the suture. Sham-operated animals served as a control. We used these two different models as the neuroma model is the most adequate for performing behavioural tests as the injured nerve can be directly stimulated, while the L5 SNT model has the advantage that it gives certainty that all the dorsal root axons studied had their peripheral terminals injured. For both models animals were deeply anaesthetised with a mix of isofluorane and oxygen. Postoperative analgesia was given for the first 5 days postop (tramadol 50 mg/kg/day p.o). Animals were checked every day after surgery to check for self-mutilation behaviour (autotomy), which prompted us to sacrifice the animal. Calculation of the sample size needed was done for each experiment as described below. Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by 'Coordinación de Ética, Bioética y Seguridad de las investigaciones UC' (experiments done in Chile) and were performed in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations (experiments done in the UK).

Morton’s neuroma patients that were due surgery for resection of painful neuromas were recruited for donating a small sample of the tissue resected during surgery. Control samples were obtained from subjects undergoing hand reconstructive surgery in where the sural nerve is harvested and used as a bridge to connect disrupted ends of motor nerves in the hand. A small sample for these healthy sural nerves was collected to use as control in this study. We used the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; which is a self-reporting scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain) to assess for pain before surgery. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before surgery.

We dissected the sciatic nerve free from connective tissue and collected 5 mm from the site of the neuroma and 5 mm from a site 1 cm proximal. Tissue for immunohistochemistry was post fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 30 min and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose for 3 days.

The samples were embedded in OCT, cryostat cut (8 µm) and thaw-mounted onto glass slides. Sections were pre-incubated in buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium azide) containing 10% normal donkey serum for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at room temperature.

Slides were washed with PBS, cover-slipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, UK) and visualised under a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, UK). All quantification of different IHC parameters was done with the investigator blinded to the identity of the group to which the animals belonged. Nodal quantification was done by assessing on average 31 nodes per animal, and using 4–5 animals per condition. For quantification of βII spectrin the intensity of the immunofluorescence of the axonal paranodal area (identified by caspr staining) was measured and the background of each section was subtracted. Then, measurements were normalised against the mean of the controls (naïve axons).

The 2 or 3 pieces of the membranes were lined up as a single membrane before exposing it to the film so that the molecular weight can be calculated by measuring the running distance of the molecular weight marker and the target bands.

Longitudinal sections 1 μm thick were cut on a microtome and stained with toludine blue before being examined on a light microscope. Ultrathin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome and stained with lead uranyl acetate. Sections were mounted on unsupported 100 mesh grids.

A tracheotomy was performed and the L5 dorsal roots and DRGs were exposed via laminectomy. Sciatic nerve neuroma with proximal nerve (5–6 mm long) and contralateral uninjured sciatic nerve were exposed. The contralateral sciatic nerve was acutely cut to disconnect from the periphery just before recording. The entire site was covered in agarose gel and four chambers created by removing blocks of this gel. These were 1) neuroma chamber, containing ipsilateral neuroma and part of sciatic nerve which is subjected to stimulation; 2) acutely cut nerve end chamber, containing contralateral sciatic nerve proximal end; 3) DRGs chamber, containing L5 DRGs from both sides; 4) spinal recording chamber, containing part of L5 dorsal roots from both sides near entry zone to spinal cord. The neuroma chamber and nerve cut end chamber were filled with mineral oil during stimulation, and the oil was replaced with αDTx (100 nM in saline) during toxin application. The DRGs chamber was filled with saline or αDTx/saline solution, and the recording chamber was always filled with mineral oil. The pool temperatures were not controlled, but as animals were warmed using an infrared lamp from the back, the pool was therefore heated, and typically was at 34–35°C. Just before recording, the L5 dorsal root was cut near entry zone, a filament was teased out and hooked up for recording. Each filament was stimulated electrically with increasing current to recruit sequentially each conducting axon in that filament. The conduction velocity of each conducting axon was noted. Thus, the number of functioning axons in each filament was determined (typically, 6–10). Spike discrimination was used to detect the number different axons firing spontaneously in each filament (typically 0–3) during a pre-treatment baseline and under 3 different treatment conditions: 1) no αDTx in any of the chambers; 2) αDTx in neuroma or nerve cut end chamber; 3) αDTx in neuroma or nerve cut end chamber and DRGs chambers. The αDTx was applied for at least 20 min before recording. An independent investigator prepared the drugs individually and labelled them for each animal according to the randomization schedule. Data analysts were blinded as the conditions under which all recording were made.</p><p>Signals were amplified with an AC-coupled amplifier (Neurolog NL104A with headstage NL100AK), then high-pass- and low-pass filtered (Neurolog NL125) at 500 Hz and 5 KHz frequencies. The filtered signals were passed through a Humbug 50 Hz noise eliminator (Quest scientific, Vancouver, BC, Canada), further amplified (Neurolog NL 106), fed to an analog-to-digital converter PowerLab, and sampled at 20 KHz with Labchart software (ADinstruments, UK). Stimulation (200 µs square-wave pulses) was delivered from a stimulus isolator (Neurolog, NL800A). The filter settings used strongly favours recordings from A-fibres and not C-fibres. All the fibres recorded to nerve stimulation conducted in the A fibre range (&gt;2 m/sec). The size of the filaments recorded was also unfavourable for detecting clear single unit C fibre activity.</p><p>Three minutes baseline was recorded to examine spontaneous activity. The percentage of spontaneously firing units was calculated as the number of spontaneously active units divided by the number of conducting fibres determined in recruitment recording. The firing rate was calculated as the total number of spikes during recording divided by the time recorded.

The total number of conducting axons in each filament was determined by incremental electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. The percentage of mechanosensitive units was calculated as the number of different neurons responding by firing action potentials upon mechanical stimulation, divided by the number of conducting fibres (which was determined in the same way as for the spontaneous activity experiments). Axonal mechanosensitivity was assessed before and after toxin application at 21 days after axotomy. Mechanosensitivity experiments were carried out on separate animals to spontaneous activity experiments to ensure that any spontaneous activity encountered was not caused acutely by the repeated mechanical stimulation of the neuroma.</p><p>Data was analyzed using software Labchart. Statistics comparing proportions of neurons exhibiting either spontaneous activity or mechanosensitivity were performed using chi-square test with Yates correction.

Animals were randomised to receive either subcutaneous αDTX (0.5 ml at 100 nM in saline, Alomone, UK) or saline (which was administered locally at the site of the neuroma) using a computer-generated random sequence. The sample sizes were calculated using a power of 80% and an α error of 0.05%, assuming a 60% decrease in withdrawal threshold with a variance of 25% from the mean, which resulted in a sample needed of 7 animals per group. Experimental groups were the following: baseline with vehicle, baseline with toxin; day 3 after surgery with vehicle, day 3 with toxin; day 7 with vehicle, day 7 with toxin; day 21 with vehicle, day 21 with toxin. To reduce the amount of animals of the study the animals that received saline only were used again for the consecutive time-points. The animals that received toxin had to be sacrificed after testing, as the toxin is irreversible. The toxin or saline were injected 30 min before testing. Autotomy after nerve injury (especially neuroma model) appears at around 10 days after injury. Therefore, we allocated 2 extra animals for the saline group, and 2 extra for toxin day 21. We had to sacrifice 1 animal from the saline group at day 6, and 2 animals from the toxin group day 21 (at day 15 and 17 after injury respectively), due to self-mutilating behaviour. For testing, rats were gently restrained using a towel on a table. Calibrated von Frey hairs were applied to the skin covering the neuroma until the fibre bent. Withdrawal of the limb by the animal was recorded as a response. The 50% withdrawal threshold was determined using the up-down method (Dixon, 1980). An independent investigator prepared the drugs individually and labelled them for each animal according to the randomization schedule. Operators and data analysts were blinded throughout the study.

To answer this question we repeated the experiment (i.e. neuroma at day 7) and collected nerve from the injury site close to neuroma) and from a site 1cm proximal to the injury site (far from neuroma). For Kv1.2 we found that the results were the same when we looked at a site close to the neuroma and at a site far from the neuroma with the movement of Kv1.2 into the paranodal region in both situations. In comparing the neuroma site and 1cm proximal to the neuroma there was no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the end of Caspr staining (p = 0.8), no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the start of Kv1.2 staining (p = 0.9), and in the difference between these measurements (p = 0.6). Regarding caspr2, we also found that it moves to the paranode at both sites, close and far from the neuroma. Comparing these two sites there was no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the end of Caspr staining (p = 0.9), no difference in the distance measured from the Nav staining to the start of caspr2 staining (p=0.1), and no difference (p=0.06) in the difference between these measurements. We have now added these new results to the manuscript (Results and Discussion) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: the authors are commended for attempting to use human samples to compare with what was obtained in the rodent model.

The Kv1.4 staining is simply not compelling.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is right that the staining we showed for Kv1.6 and for Kv1.4 in human tissue is not as optimum as that in preclinical animal models. Therefore, we changed those two images for other examples. We should say, that this staining is extremely difficult to do in human nerves (due to the fact that for instance we have limited control as to the duration of time before the nerve is placed in fix following surgery), and after several optimizing steps this is our best attempt. We added high magnification pictures in the figure to fit the style, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref> we show low magnification of the same images (both are in Morton neuroma). There is a higher background than we would like but we do think that there is juxtaparanodal staining.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12661.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12661.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12661.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12661-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>How can KV1.2 be used as a marker of the paranoid when its distribution is the object of inquiry? Why not use Caspr2?</italic></p><p>We assume that this is a typo and this question relates to using Kv1.2 as a marker of the juxtaparanode (not paranode). Assuming this is the case, we agree with the reviewer that it is best not to refer to Kv1.2 as a marker of the juxtaparanode. It is the subject of inquiry and is a protein normally localized to the juxtaparanode and it is re-distributed after injury. What we have done is measure the distance between the voltage gated sodium channel accumulation (Nav) and the end of caspr (which we used as a marker of the paranode and importantly this distance doesn’t change with nerve injury). We also measured the distance between Nav and the start of the Kv1 channels. We then obtained the difference between these two distances. If the distance was a positive value it meant that there is a gap, albeit very small, between this paranodal protein and the Kv1 channels. If this distance was a negative value it meant that the Kv1 channels have moved into the paranode and co-localise with caspr (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 2</xref>). We did these same measurements for caspr2 another protein normally localized to the juxtaparanode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is also re-distributed along the Kv1 channels.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12661.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12661.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12661.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12661-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>To make this clearer we now included explicit references to these measurements (Nav to caspr and Nav to Kv1/caspr2).
