Yet the identity and function of these maternal factors during the gamete to embryo transition remains poorly understood. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, LSD1/KDM1A enables this transition by removing H3K4me2 and preventing the transgenerational inheritance of transcription patterns. Here we show that loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A in mice results in embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage, with arrested embryos failing to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This suggests that LSD1/KDM1A maternal reprogramming is conserved. Moreover, partial loss of maternal LSD1/KDM1A results in striking phenotypes weeks after fertilization; including perinatal lethality and abnormal behavior in surviving adults. These maternal effect hypomorphic phenotypes are associated with alterations in DNA methylation and expression at imprinted genes. These results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where defects in early epigenetic reprogramming can lead to defects that manifest later in development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08848.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08848.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During fertilization, an egg cell and a sperm cell combine to make a cell called a zygote that then divides many times to form an embryo. Many of the characteristics of the embryo are determined by the genes it inherits from its parents. However, not all of these genes should be “expressed” to produce their products all of the time. One way of controlling gene expression is to add a chemical group called a methyl tag to the DNA near the gene, or to one of the histone proteins that DNA wraps around.</p><p>Soon after fertilization, a process called reprogramming occurs that begins with the removal of most of the methyl tags a zygote inherited from the egg and sperm cells. The zygote’s DNA is then newly methylated to activate a new pattern of gene expression. In mammals, some genes escape this reprogramming; these “imprinted” genes retain the methylation patterns inherited from the parents.</p><p>Reprogramming is assisted by “maternal factors” that are inherited from the egg cell. Once reprogramming is completed, the maternal factors are destroyed as part of a process called the maternal-to-zygotic transition. A maternal factor called KDM1A can remove specific methyl tags from certain histone proteins, but how this affects the zygote is not well understood. Now, Wasson et al. (and independently Ancelin et al.) have investigated the role that KDM1A plays in mouse development.</p><p>Wasson et al. genetically engineered mouse egg cells to contain little or no KDM1A. Zygotes created from egg cells that completely lack KDM1A die before or shortly after they have divided for the first time and fail to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Other egg cells that contain low levels of KDM1A can give rise to baby mice. However, many of these mice die soon after birth, and those that grow to adulthood behave in abnormal ways; for example, they display excessive chewing and digging. These disorders are linked to the disruption of DNA methylation at imprinted genes.</p><p>The next challenge will be to further investigate the mechanisms by which defects in maternally deposited KDM1A exert their long-range effects on imprinted genes and altered behaviour. This is particularly important because of the recent discovery of three patients with birth defects that are linked to genetic variants in KDM1A.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08848.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08848.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>MZT</kwd><kwd>KDM1a</kwd><kwd>maternal effect</kwd><kwd>LSD1</kwd><kwd>genomic imprinting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1354998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wasson</surname><given-names>Jadiel A</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epigenetic reprogramming by LSD1/KDM1A acts at fertilization in mice to enable embryogenesis and prevent behavioural abnormalities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At fertilization, the epigenome of the developing zygote undergoes widespread changes in DNA methylation and histone methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arico et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bultman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). This reprogramming is driven by the deposition of maternal proteins and RNA into the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). After fertilization, zygotic genes become transcriptionally active, while the maternal transcriptional program is silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). In mice, this maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) occurs between the one- and two-cell (1-2C) stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamatani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments in <italic>Xenopus</italic> demonstrated that the oocyte has the capacity to reprogram a differentiated somatic nucleus into a cloned embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurdon et al., 1958</xref>). This epigenetic reprogramming capacity of the oocyte is also conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 1996</xref>). It is thought that the epigenetic reprogramming capacity of the oocyte enables the MZT. Nevertheless, the enzymes involved in maternal epigenetic reprogramming, and the consequences of failure to reprogram, largely remain a mystery.</p><p>Recently, work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> implicated LSD1/SPR-5/KDM1A (previously referred to as LSD1, hereafter referred to as KDM1A) in maternal reprogramming at fertilization. Di-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) is acquired in gamete genes during the specification and maintenance of the germline. The H3K4me2 demethylase KDM1A is maternally deposited into the zygote at fertilization and required to prevent H3K4me2 from being inherited transgenerationally. Without KDM1A, H3K4me2 accumulates at gamete genes across generations and results in the inappropriate expression of these genes. This correlates with increasing sterility in the population over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The requirement to reprogram H3K4 methylation is also suggested to be a critical step in SCNT. During SCNT in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the cloned embryos often inappropriately express genes from the tissue where the somatic nucleus was derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ng and Gurdon, 2005</xref>). This transcriptional memory can be eliminated by overexpressing histone H3 with a mutated K4 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ng and Gurdon, 2008</xref>). This work implies that H3K4 methylation may be the carrier of transgenerational transcriptional memory, and that complete reprogramming may require the removal of this modification.</p><p>Genomic imprinting is the monoallelic expression of a small number of genes based on their parent of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartolomei and Tilghman, 1997</xref>). Imprinted genes are dependent upon DNA methylation at small imprinting control regions (ICRs) associated with these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartolomei and Tilghman, 1997</xref>). At ICRs, CpG methylation is established in the gametes and maintained throughout the development of the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolomei, 2009</xref>). In mammals, there are two amine-oxidase histone demethylases, LSD2/KDM1B (hereafter referred to as KDM1B) and KDM1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi et al., 2004</xref>). KDM1B is expressed mainly in the oocyte and required for the establishment of maternal imprints at imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). Without KDM1B, embryos derived from these oocytes exhibit a maternal effect embryonic lethality phenotype prior to mid-gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>). This demonstrates that, similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, amine oxidase-type histone demethylases can function maternally in mammals.</p><p>KDM1A is a component of several protein complexes. As part of the CoREST complex, it specifically demethylates H3K4me1/2, but not H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">You et al., 2001</xref>). Alternatively, when associated with the Androgen Receptor complex KDM1A has been shown to demethylate H3K9me2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Metzger et al., 2005</xref>). KDM1A is an essential gene in mammalian development, as homozygous mutants fail to develop properly after implantation and die prior to embryonic day 8 (e8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macfarlan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). To determine whether KDM1A may also be involved in maternal reprogramming, we conditionally deleted <italic>Lsd1/Kdm1a</italic> (previously referred to as <italic>Lsd1,</italic> hereafter referred to as <italic>Kdm1a</italic>) in mouse oocytes with three different maternal <italic>Cre</italic> transgenes. Deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> maternally with either <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> or <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> results in embryonic lethality primarily at the 1-2C stage and these embryos fail to undergo the MZT. This suggests that KDM1A plays a conserved role in maternal reprogramming. Surprisingly, deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> maternally with <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> results in an incomplete loss of KDM1A in oocytes. This uncovers a hypomorphic effect in which some surviving animals exhibit long-range developmental defects, including perinatal lethality and behavioral abnormalities. These defects are associated with disruption of the epigenetic landscape, including aberrant DNA methylation and expression at imprinted loci. These results demonstrate that defects in epigenetic reprogramming between generations can lead to abnormalities later in development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KDM1A is expressed throughout oocyte development</title><p>Based on the previously demonstrated maternal role of KDM1A in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and KDM1B in mice, we first asked if KDM1A is expressed in mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). RNA-seq datasets from ovulated oocytes and 2C-stage embryos suggested abundant KDM1A transcripts in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an antibody raised against KDM1A confirms that KDM1A is expressed in the oocyte nucleus and in the surrounding follicle cells throughout oocyte development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–L</xref>). Therefore, to determine if KDM1A functions in oocytes, we conditionally deleted <italic>Kdm1a</italic> by crossing <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) to three different maternal <italic>Cre</italic> transgenic lines, <italic>Ddx4/Vasa-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallardo et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lan et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>) (oocytes and embryos from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup><italic>::Ddx4/Vasa<sup>Cre</sup>, Kdm1a<sup>fl/</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup><italic>::Gdf9-Cre,</italic> and <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/</sup></italic><sup>Δ</sup><italic>::Zp3-Cre</italic> mice will be referred to hereafter as <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup>, Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> and <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> respectively). <italic>Vasa-Cre </italic>is expressed in the germline beginning at e18 and induces full deletion by birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallardo et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> is expressed in oocytes beginning at postnatal day 3 (P3), including in primordial follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lan et al., 2004</xref>), while <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> is also expressed in oocytes, but beginning at P5 in primary follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>). KDM1A IHC and IF demonstrate that deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> with either <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> or <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> results in the complete loss of KDM1A from the oocyte nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F,I</xref>). Crossing the <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> allele to <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> also results in complete maternal deletion, as can be determined by the 100% segregation of the maternally deleted allele to the offspring (all of offspring from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> mothers crossed to wild-type fathers result in heterozygous -/+ offspring) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This demonstrates that, similar to deletion via <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> or <italic>Zp3-Cre,</italic> crossing the <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>allele to <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> also effectively deletes <italic>Kdm1a</italic> maternally. However, for reasons that are not clear, deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> with <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> results in a hypomorphic effect, where 33.3% of oocytes completely lack KDM1A protein, but 66.7% retain a low level of KDM1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). This incomplete effect is surprising because the <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> transgene is reported to be expressed earlier in the germline than either <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> or <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallardo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lan et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that the low level of KDM1A remaining in some oocytes is due to delayed deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic>, though the reason for this potential delay is unknown.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Maternal expression and coditional deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> in mouse oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type mouse oocyte nucleus (white arrowhead) and surrounding follicle cells (white asterisks) stained with anti-KDM1A (green) antibody and DAPI (red).

In mice, zygotic transcription begins in the 1C embryo just prior to the first cleavage to the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamatani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). The heterozygous offspring from the maternally deleted mothers have a normal <italic>Kdm1a</italic> gene on the paternal allele. Thus, crossing maternally deleted mothers to wild-type fathers enables us to isolate the maternal function of KDM1A (Maternal-, Zygotic+, hereafter referred to as M-Z+). M-Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> mutant mothers are hereafter referred to as <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos, while M+Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from littermate control mothers that are <italic>Cre</italic> minus are hereafter referred to as <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M+Z+ embryos. <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos exhibit embryonic arrest at the 1-2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–I</xref>). Specifically, in control <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M+Z+ embryos at embryonic day 1.5 (e1.5), we observe 7% fragmented/degraded embryos, 65% 1-cell embryos and 28% 2-cell embryos (n=135, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos at e1.5 we observe 40% fragmented/degraded embryos, 59% unfertilized oocytes or 1-cell embryos, and only 1% 2C embryos (n=134, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). The vast majority of the non-degraded <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos are clearly fertilized and arrested at the 1C stage. However, we do occasionally observe unfertilized oocytes. In addition, we sometimes observe embryos that are highly abnormal morphologically and are difficult to clearly assign to a particular category. As a result, we quantified these <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos together. Nevertheless, compared to <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M+Z+ embryos, <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos have a large increase in the number of fragmented/degraded embryos at the expense of normal 2C embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Also, the remaining 1C and 2C <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos do not progress beyond the 1-2C stage, as we never observe any later stage embryos even at e2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,G,H</xref>).</p><p>M-Z+ heterozygous embryos derived from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> mothers (hereafter referred to as <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+embryos) undergo a phenotype that is similar to <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos. At e1.5, 95% (n=20) of control <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M+Z+ embryos have reached the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, at e1.5 only 35% (n=57) of <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos reach the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), though this is still much higher than the 1% of <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos that reach the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). It is not clear why there is a difference in the number of <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> versus <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos that cleave to the 2C stage. However, this may be due to subtle differences in developmental timing, strain background, or <italic>Cre</italic> specific differences. In addition, we have observed two <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos that develop past the 2C stage to the 3C- and 4C- stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J,K</xref>), though like the <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos, no <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ embryos survive to the blastocyst stage (data not shown). Taken together, the results from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> and <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> mice suggest that the embryonic arrest, primarily at the 1-2C stages is the KDM1A maternal loss-of-function phenotype.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> embryos arrest at the 1–2 cell stage.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Brightfield images of (<bold>A</bold>,<bold>C</bold>) M+Z+ and (<bold>B</bold>,<bold>D</bold>) M-Z+ 1- and 2-cell embryos derived from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> control and mutant mothers at e1.5.

Furthermore, we found several mitochondrially encoded genes (like mtCo3 and Atpase6) that had small but significantly reduced levels in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> oocytes. These mitochondrial genes are unlikely to be directly regulated by KDM1A, but their reduced levels could indicate a subtle metabolic defect in the mutants.

We chose to focus on embryos from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> mothers because a substantially higher proportion of these embryos reach the 2C stage. We found a dramatic alteration of the transcriptome, with 1527 genes over expressed and 2794 genes under expressed in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ 2C embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1B</xref>).

GO analysis of over and under expressed genes in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> 2C M-Z+ embryos demonstrated an enrichment of genes normally expressed in unfertilized oocytes, and a reduction in genes associated with embryonic development and tissue specific gene expression. This suggests that <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ 2C embryos may fail to undergo the MZT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1B</xref>).</p><p>To test this hypothesis further, we compared the expression of mRNAs from control <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>M+Z+ 2C embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>) or <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ 2C embryos with <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl </sup></italic>oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>).

In <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>M+Z+ 2C embryos relative to <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>oocytes, there are massive changes in the mRNA profile, with &gt;3,000 genes (and 387 repeat families) becoming zygotically activated and ~3000 maternal genes (and 17 repeat families) which are suppressed. This demonstrates that MZT has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> M-Z+ 2C embryos fail to properly activate the zygotic genome, with only 666 genes becoming activated (and 110 repeat families), and only ~1200 maternal genes repressed (13 repeat families) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1D</xref>).

If a mouse has a subtle defect during embryogenesis, the newborn pup may die perinatally. This is reflected in the large number of mouse models that exhibit perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Turgeon and Meloche, 2009</xref>). Therefore, to determine if lower maternal KDM1A might give rise to more subtle embryonic defects, we carefully monitored the first 48 hr following birth in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ progeny. Consistent with this being a major developmental transition, even in genotypically normal mice, we observe that 5% of offspring (n=216) born from littermate <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>control mothers die perinatally during the first 48 hr after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ progeny, the percentage of perinatal lethality is significantly increased (26%, n=47) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). It is unclear why these animals are dying perinatally. However, this increase in perinatal lethality is consistent with these animals having more subtle developmental defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ progeny exhibit abnormal behavior</title><p>Of the small number of M-Z+ animals that are born from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers, nearly 1/3 die perinatally in the first 48 hr after birth. However, the remaining 2/3 survive to adulthood and appear to be morphologically normal. Notably, because of the embryonic arrest and the perinatal lethality, this remaining 2/3 is a very small number of animals (n=10 from 8 crosses). Since progeny from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers have defects that can lead to perinatal lethality, we considered the possibility that the surviving animals from these <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers (hereafter referred to as <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults) could have phenotypic defects as well. To analyze these surviving animals, we crossed <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers (C57BL/6 background) to <italic>M. castaneus</italic> (CAST) fathers. This enabled us to use polymorphisms to examine subsequent molecular defects in a parent of origin specific fashion. Importantly, F1 hybrid (B6/CAST) offspring from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers have the same hypomorphic phenotype that we observe in a B6 background, where a small number of animals survive until birth (average litter size=1.6, n=6 litters from 8 crosses).</p><p>Mating the surviving <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults produced progeny, suggesting no gross defects in the specification of the germline or mating behavior. However, when we observed these <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults closely, we noticed that they exhibit abnormal behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). These abnormal behaviors include excessive scratching and digging, along with food harassing, where animals grind up all of the remaining food in the food hopper and incorporate it into the bedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). To quantify the food harassing behavior, we monitored both the weight of the food in the food hopper and the height of the bedding in the cage. Over a 3-day period, each individual <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adult almost completely depleted the food in the food hopper due to food grinding and harassing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). This resulted in a correspondingly large increase in the height of the bedding over a 6-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These effects are not observed in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers or the <italic>M. castaneus</italic> animals to which they were mated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,E</xref>), indicating that the behavior may be due to a maternal effect. To determine if this behavior is due to a maternal effect, we intercrossed the affected <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults. If the food-grinding behavior is due to a maternal effect, then mating two affected <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults should not produce progeny with abnormal behavior. This is because the <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults used as mothers in these crosses have a normal <italic>Kdm1a</italic> allele (-/+) so the resulting intercrossed progeny (hereafter referred to as F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults) are all M+. Intercrossing affected M-Z+ F1 hybrids produced no F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults with the food-grinding behavior, suggesting that the food-grinding behavior is dependent upon a maternal effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,G</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains possible that the F1 hybrid background also contributes to the abnormal behavior. To test this possibility, we crossed control littermates of <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mothers to CAST fathers to generate control B6/CAST hybrids (hereafter referred to as B6/CAST M+Z+ controls). These control hybrids exhibit modest food-grinding behavior, suggesting that the hybrid strain background likely also contributes to the maternal food-grinding defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,F</xref>). However, <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adults are significantly more affected than B6/CAST M+Z+ hybrid controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,F</xref>), suggesting that the abnormal food-grinding behavior is predominantly due to a maternal effect. Importantly, we also do not observe any <italic>Kdm1a</italic> haploinsufficiency defects. For example, the F2 intercrossed M+Z+ adults that are heterozygous for <italic>Kdm1a</italic> do not exhibit this abnormal behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,G</xref>). This suggests that the abnormal behavior is not due to <italic>Kdm1a</italic> haploinsufficiency. Finally, behavioral defects were observed in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ survivors obtained from litters ranging from one to four animals. This suggests that the maternal behavioral abnormalities are not simply due to reduced litter size.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-08848-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.019</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Stereotypical and abnormal behaviors in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ adults.</title><p>0:00-0:27 <italic>M. castaneus</italic> (CAST) control playing behavior. 0:27-0:40 <italic>M. castaneus</italic> (CAST) control eating. 0:40-1:03 (right) <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ adult food harassing behavior. 1:03-1:28 (right) <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ adult abnormal scratching behavior. 1:28-1:45 (right) <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ adult food harassing behavior and (left) abnormal digging behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08848.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08848.019</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Abnormal behaviors in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ adults.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Mouse cages at day 0 (<bold>A</bold>) and day 8 (<bold>B</bold>) from <italic>M. castaneus</italic> (CAST) controls compared to day 6 (<bold>C</bold>) from a <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> M-Z+ adult.

Thus the defects that we observe in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ progeny must be due to a heritable effect originating from the low level of maternal KDM1A. As a result, we sought to determine the nature of this heritable defect. The <italic>Kdm1a</italic> homolog <italic>Kdm1b</italic> is expressed maternally in mice, and loss of <italic>Kdm1b</italic> results in a heritable embryonic lethality defect associated with a failure to maternally acquire DNA methylation at imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the heritable defects could be due to DNA methylation defects at these loci, or in maternally methylated imprinted loci unaffected by the loss of KDM1B. In addition, in our RNA-seq data, we observe the misregulation of multiple genes that could potentially affect DNA methylation at imprinted loci. For example, four genes that are known to maternally affect DNA methylation at imprinted loci, <italic>Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57</italic> and <italic>Dppa3/Stella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawlaty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Messerschmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>), are all misregulated in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </italic>M-Z+mutants (<italic>Tet1:</italic> -3.8 fold, <italic>Trim28:</italic> -3.3 fold, <italic>Zfp57:</italic> +3.2 fold and <italic>Dppa3/Stella:</italic> +.58 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1B</xref>, quantitative RT-PCR validation of <italic>Trim28, Zfp57</italic> and <italic>Dppa3/Stella</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 is overexpressed in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </italic>M-Z+ mutants (<italic>Dnmt1:</italic> +2.1 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1B</xref>).

Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that DNA methylation and monoallelic expression at imprinted genes could be altered in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ progeny, either directly or indirectly. Interestingly, despite the clear loss of KDM1A in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </italic>mutant oocytes, the regulatory proteins that are affected by the loss of KDM1A are either not expressed in oocytes (Tet1) or not affected until after fertilization (<italic>Trim28, Zfp57, Dppa3/Stella</italic> and <italic>Dnmt1,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). This is consistent with our previous observations that KDM1A primarily affects the MZT.</p><p>To investigate DNA methylation and the expression of imprinted genes in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ offspring, we performed bisulfite analysis and qRT-PCR on perinatal lethal <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ pups. We analyzed imprinted that are both maternally (<italic>Zac1, Impact, Igf2r, Mest, Snrpn</italic>) and paternally methylated (<italic>H19</italic>). For these analyses, we took advantage of B6/CAST polymorphisms to determine whether individual alleles in F1 hybrid offspring came from the mother or the father. These F1 hybrid pups, derived from hypomorphic B6 <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mothers mated to wild-type CAST fathers, are denoted as maternal effect progeny 1 and 2 (MEP1 and MEP2), and were compared to two stage matched B6/CAST hybrid controls.</p><p>Two imprinted loci, <italic>Zac1</italic> and <italic>Impact</italic>, are severely affected in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>offspring.

To address this question, we asked if the maternal reprogramming function of KDM1A, first demonstrated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>), is conserved in mammals. As in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, KDM1A is heavily deposited maternally in the mouse oocyte, suggesting that KDM1A could play a conserved role in maternal reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To address this hypothesis directly, we conditionally deleted <italic>Kdm1a</italic> maternally in mouse oocytes using three separate <italic>Cre</italic> drivers. Deletion of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> in developing oocytes via <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> or <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> completely eliminates maternal KDM1A and results in embryonic arrest prior to the blastocyst stage, with the vast majority of embryos never developing past the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). This result is also observed when a second conditional <italic>Kdm1a</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>) is deleted with <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al.. Thus, maternal KDM1A is essential for the progression of mammalian embryogenesis.</p><p>The observed 1-2C embryonic arrest does not rule out an additional role for KDM1A in oocyte maturation, as we observe that a small fraction of KDM1A deficient oocytes are unfertilized, fertilized with multiple sperm, or display other gross morphological defects, including loss of the zona pellucida. These occasional defects are also observed in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. Consistent with this, Kim et al. have recently reported that deletion of a different conditional <italic>Kdm1a</italic> allele with <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> results in defects in meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to our results, Kim et al. find that most oocytes are affected and are not fertilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). It is not entirely clear why the phenotypes are slightly different, but it could reflect subtle differences in the timing of deletion due to the use of different floxed alleles, or differences in strain background. Nevertheless, in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup> </italic>and <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> mutants, we find that the majority of oocytes are fertilized normally, and many embryos undergo cleavage to reach the 2C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Also, in hypomorphic <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>animals we observe defects on the paternal allele of imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggest a requirement for KDM1A post-fertilization in the zygote. In mammals, zygotic transcription initiates between the one and two cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamatani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, the heterozygous offspring derived from our crosses likely begin to express KDM1A from paternal allele at the 2C stage. Taken together, these results pinpoint a requirement for maternal KDM1A reprogramming between fertilization and cleavage. Consistent with this conclusion, the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. demonstrates that chemically inhibiting KDM1A function post-fertilization also results in a 2C arrest. This further suggests a zygotic requirement for KDM1A immediately post-fertilization.</p><p>When <italic>Kdm1a</italic> is deleted with <italic>Gdf9-Cre,</italic> only one embryo reached the 2C stage. In contrast, when <italic>Kdm1a</italic> is deleted with <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic>, many embryos cleave to the 2C stage and we even observe rare embryos that reach the 3C and 4C stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This slight difference in phenotype is likely due to the fact that the <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> acts earlier than the <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic>. Nevertheless, the difference in phenotype suggests that KDM1A may act maternally at multiple discrete steps. This conclusion is reinforced by the recent demonstration that loss of KDM1A also impairs meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the observation that many maternally deleted embryos undergo cleavage, suggests that KDM1A is not just required for cell-cycle progression or cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with the observation that KDM1A null embryos survive until e8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the difference in phenotype between maternally deleted embryos and embryonically deleted embryos, which survive to e8, clearly delineates the maternal requirement for KDM1A from the embryonic requirement.</p><p>To determine the potential cause of the KDM1A maternal embryonic arrest, we profiled the expression of <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>oocytes and <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </italic>M-Z+ embryos that underwent cleavage to the 2C stage. Compared to control 2C embryos that have robustly activated the zygotic transcriptional program, <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </italic>M-Z+ 2C embryos retain the expression of nearly 2 out of 3 oocyte genes, and fail to activate approximately 4 out of 5 zygotically activated embryonic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This indicates that maternally deleted <italic>Kdm1a</italic> embryos fail to undergo the MZT. Consistent with this being the primary defect in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup></italic> mutants, we observe relatively few transcriptional changes in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The requirement for KDM1A in facilitating the MZT is also demonstrated in the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al., where it is shown that maternal KDM1A is necessary for the multiple waves of zygotic gene activation. Thus, we propose that KDM1A plays a major role in facilitating the progression of embryogenesis by enabling the MZT.</p><p>Surprisingly, in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> oocytes, we found an incomplete loss of KDM1A protein, despite the fact that 100% of the progeny inherited the deleted <italic>Kdm1a</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We have previously observed that strain background differences and/or specific interactions between <italic>Cre</italic> drivers and certain floxed alleles can lead to different patterns of deletion, often not matching published patterns. Thus, it is possible that <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> oocytes have a small amount of KDM1A remaining because the <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> transgene occasionally works much later than previously reported when crossed with the <italic>Kdm1a</italic> floxed allele.</p><p>Similar to <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Zp3</sup> </italic>and <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Gdf9</sup> </italic>M-Z+ embryos, many of the hypomorphic <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ embryos undergo early embryonic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the partial loss of KDM1A maternal reprogramming also uncovers a hypomorphic phenotype where a few embryos survive past the 2C stage until birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Of these animals that are born, a significantly increased fraction die perinatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, on the rare occasions that more than one animal was born from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mutant mothers, the full litter either all died perinatally or all survived. Remarkably, the perinatal lethal pups are derived from crosses between <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mothers and wild-type fathers (M-Z+). This suggests that the increased perinatal lethality is due to hypomorphic maternal KDM1A in the mother’s oocyte. It remains possible that the small <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ litter sizes also contribute to the perinatal lethality, due to maternal neglect. However, many <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ animals that are born in small litters survive to adulthood (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that the perinatal lethality is not simply due to small litter size.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.026</object-id><label>Table

could also lead to behavioral abnormalities in the surviving adults. To investigate this possibility, we performed a number of behavioral assays on surviving <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ adult animals. These include monitoring food disappearance and bedding height to measure excessive food grinding, the marble burying assay to measure excessive digging behavior, and the open-field test, to measure anxiety. In all of these assays, we observe a maternal effect on behavior due to hypomorphic maternal KDM1A from <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that hypomorphic KDM1A in the mother’s oocyte can lead to altered behavior in the resulting adult progeny.</p><p>To investigate the potential molecular nature of the heritable defects, we analyzed DNA methylation and expression at imprinted loci. Both DNA methylation and expression are altered at imprinted genes in perinatal lethal <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>pups. In particular, we observe a striking disruption in the allele-specific expression of both <italic>Zac1</italic> and <italic>Impact</italic>, along with decreased expression and altered DNA methylation at other imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that subtle defects in maternal KDM1A can alter the epigenetic landscape in a heritable fashion. Also, though KDM1A and KDM1B may have some functional overlap, the distinct imprinting defects observed in each mutant demonstrate that they have functions that are not redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, both <italic>Zac1</italic> and <italic>Impact</italic> have been associated with nervous system defects, and loss of <italic>Zac1</italic> paternally results in perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kosaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pereira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roffe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt-Edelkraut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Varrault et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that defects in these genes could potentially contribute to the abnormalities that we observe in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>M-Z+ progeny. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if this is the case.</p><p>Loss of maternal KDM1A could lead to the observed phenomena (imprinting defects, perinatal lethality and behavioral abnormalities) either directly or indirectly. Evidence for an indirect mechanism can be inferred from the misregulation of several genes (<italic>Dnmt1, Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57, Uhrf1 and Dppa/Stella)</italic> that are known to regulate epigenetic information. For example, <italic>Tet1/Tet2</italic> double mutants exhibit a partial perinatal lethality phenotype that is reminiscent of what we observe in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa</sup> </italic>progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawlaty et al., 2013</xref>). Also, mice that are haploinsufficient for <italic>Trim28</italic> display abnormal exploratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whitelaw et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, KDM1A may affect these phenomena by directly regulating histone methylation. For example, the removal of H3K4 methylation may be required to enable the activity of the DNMT3a/3b <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi et al., 2007</xref>). Such a model has been proposed to account for the imprinting defects that are observed when KDM1B is maternally deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this model, the accompanying paper by Ancelin et al. demonstrates that loss of KDM1A maternally leads to global changes in both H3K4 and H3K9 methylation following fertilization. However, Stewart et al. recently demonstrated that loss of maternal KDM1A in mice does not affect H3K4me2, or the acquisition of DNA methylation at imprinted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the variable disruption of imprinting that we observe in hypomorphic animals is more consistent with a general disruption of epigenetic information. Thus, we favor a model in which the general disruption of epigenetic reprogramming, along with secondary epigenetic defects due to the misregulation of epigenetic reprogramming enzymes during the MZT, combine to give rise to the phenomena that manifest postnatally in progeny. Currently, we are engineering a hypomorphic maternal <italic>Kdm1a</italic> allele that can be used to generate larger numbers of hypomorphic animals to further elucidate these mechanisms.</p><p>In summary, our data highlights three important consequences of the loss of maternal KDM1A: (1) early embryonic arrest and the failure of embryos to undergo the MZT, (2) perinatal lethality and altered behavior in rare surviving progeny from hypomorphic mothers, and (3) a general disruption of genomic imprinting in the hypomorphic progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although these individual phenotypes may be linked, it is possible that they are separate outcomes that depend on distinct activities of maternal KDM1A during the MZT. Nevertheless, our results establish a novel mammalian paradigm in which altered epigenetic reprogramming by a histone demethylase between generations leads to defects that manifest weeks later, highlighting the potential long-range consequences of epigenetic perturbations in the early mammalian embryo.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.027</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model.</title><p>Loss of maternal LSD1 results in defects later in development in wild-type oocytes, after fertilization (denoted by blue sperm encircling oocyte) the fertilized egg undergoes the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT; green to blue/purple) at the 1–2 cell stage. These M+Z+ embryos proceed normally through development (indicated by blastocyst, perinatal stage pup, and adult mouse). In contrast, when Lsd1 is deleted with either Gdf9- or Zp3-Cre, the resulting Lsd1Gdf9 and Lsd1Zp3 progeny become arrest at the 1–2 cell stage and never undergo the MZT (green). When Lsd1 is deleted with Vasa-Cre, we observe 3 hypomorphic outcomes in resulting Lsd1Vasa progeny: (1) developmental arrest at the 1–2 cell stage, (2) perinatal lethality and (3) abnormal behavior in surviving adult animals. These outcomes are due to reduced LSD1 in the mothers oocyte, suggesting that lowered maternal LSD1 can result in defects much later in development.

Briefly embryos were lysed in Prelude Direct Lysis buffer (Nugen, San Carlos, CA) and amplified cDNAs were prepared using the Ovation RNA-seq system V2 (Nugen, 7102-32). Paired end libraries were prepared according to the Tru-seq library construction protocol starting with Covaris fragmentation step. Libraries were then sequenced on an Illumina Hi-seq 2000. For expression analysis, only first mate pair was used and reads were trimmed from 3' end to 50 bp. Trimmed reads were filtered to a minimum average base quality of 15. We combined the knownGene, ensGene and refGene annotations for mm10 (downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser) with the full RepeatMasker annotation, also from UCSC Genome Browser, to build a single gene annotation. Redundant transcripts were filtered out using the gffread utility packaged with Cufflinks. The annotation was modified to include a common gene_id value for same-name repeat elements resulting in a total of 875 repeats. Sequences for all annotated features were extracted from the mouse genome and RNA-Seq reads were aligned to them using BBMap with 95% identity, up to a single INDEL and up to 2000 equally best alignments per read. Alignments to features were quantified by counting hits to gene loci and down-weighting read alignments that mapped to multiple gene loci by 1/N<sup>2</sup> where N is equal to the number of gene loci. Reads aligned to repeat elements were counted in the same way but instead of using gene loci the repeat name was used for binning hits. If a read mapped to multiple repeat features all of the same name then it was counted as 1 hit to that repeat name. Raw read counts were loaded into R and median normalized for differential expression analysis. For each pair-wise test genes with raw counts less than 10 in all conditions were not tested. Differential expression was performed by testing the null hypothesis that a gene's fold change between conditions is zero. The observed dispersion-mean relationship was fit using a method similar to that of DESeq and the predicted dispersions were used as the minimum dispersion per gene. Fold-changes between conditions were tested by monte-carlo simulation using the observed and estimated means and dispersions to generate random negative binomial distributed count values (the rnbinom method in R). In each monte-carlo iteration N samples were simulated per condition (N = to the number of samples in each condition), averaged into conditions and the log fold-change was calculated. The resulting simulated log fold-change distributions are normally distributed. Z- scores were computed for each observed log fold-change compared to its corresponding monte-carlo simulated fold-change distribution and translated to two-tail p-values against the normal probability distribution. Raw p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini &amp; Hochberg correction. Genes and repeats were tested together and marked significant if the adjusted p-value was less than 0.05. RNA-seq data is deposited at GEO (GSE66547). Oocyte expression data used for comparisons was previously deposited at GEO (GSE33923.) For the heat map plot, each gene found to be significantly associated with PC1 is standardized relative to its mean and scaled relative to its variance (ie each gene is scaled separately to improve visualization.) Each row is a gene which is standardized where mean is zero with standard deviation is 1. This makes each row relative to its mean. The scale is relative to its variance. Rows are sorted by a clustering of the genes. Color scale is relative to mean expression level per gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Characterization of food-grinding behavior in <italic>Kdm1a<sup>Vasa </sup></italic>adult progeny</title><p>Each animal was placed in a mouse housing unit (32.8 × 18.6 × 13.6 cm) with 5/8 inches of bedding.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Maternally provided LSD1 enables the maternal-to-zygotic transition and prevents defects that manifest postnatally&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers, one of whom, Gavin Kelsey, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>All agree that the work represents a significant advance however several revisions are recommended. The Reviewing editor has drafted a summary of the reviews to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors nicely show that deletion of LSD1/KDM1A in oocytes in the mouse (which they do with three different <italic>Cre</italic>-drivers) causes arrest at the 2-cell stage and gross impairment of zygotic genome activation (as demonstrated by a nicely executed RNA-seq analysis). The mechanistic basis of these effects are not characterised in further detail. The absolute requirement of LSD1 for embryonic progression, implicating the importance of regulation of histone post-translation modifications, is an important observation. The unique aspect of this manuscript, however, is the <italic>Lsd1</italic> hypomorph inadvertently produced by the incomplete ablation caused by the <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> (paradoxical given the earlier timing of this <italic>Cre</italic> transgene and remains unexplained). The imperfect ablation of <italic>Lsd1</italic> allows some embryos to survive through the critical pre-implantation phase, and then to term and adulthood, although there is another period of attrition at birth. The adult survivors display abnormal behaviours, which are characterised in detail. Again, I think this is a very interesting observation, which points to epigenetic imbalance in the early embryo as having potentially long-term consequences. No doubt, the authors could have chosen other phenotypes to examine, as there is no reason to suspect that the presumed epigenetic defects should be restricted to these few behaviours, but the limited numbers of surviving adults preclude a deeper phenotypic characterisation. With justification, the authors choose to analyse imprinted genes as potential mediators, although I am not aware that the specific imprinted genes examined are implicated in the behaviours tested.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) I have a problem with the basic experimental design. It seems to me that if one expects developmental failures one should never use superovulated females as a source of the eggs. Eggs and embryos from superovulated females are going to be inferior and any negative developmental effect will be potentiated. I would recommend that at least some of described experiment be repeated using normal matings. In addition, the only significant molecular information in the manuscript is the transcriptome comparison between the maternally deleted and wt 2-cell stage embryos i.e. period of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, the ZGA is entirely regulated by the maternally inherited molecules; proteins and RNAs. Proteome comparison would be technically quite difficult but transcriptome comparison between maternally deleted and wt oocyte is possible, necessary and should be included and interpreted in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one of the most important mechanisms controlling the utilization of many maternal mRNAs and it would be very important to determine how it functions during maturation of mutant oocytes and after fertilization in zygotes. In order to supplement the data on the imprinting state of several genes in perinatal pups, it would be necessary to assess and include in the manuscript the imprinting state of the same genes in the ovulated oocytes and zygotes.</p><p>2) A major concern is the characterisation of the effects on methylation and expression of imprinted genes in the <italic>Lsd1<sup>Vasa</sup></italic> progeny; this should be improved, especially because the link between effects on methylation and expression do not appear to be well correlated. I think there are obvious ways to improve this and the analysis as presented does not allow strong conclusions.</p><p>3) Is it the case that the authors analysed methylation and expression in dead pups (they refer to them as 'exhibiting perinatal lethality)? In which case, how reliable is the RT-qPCR analysis?</p><p>4) Do the bisulphite sequencing results take into account clonality? For example, for the <italic>Igf2r</italic> DMR in MEP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), there appears to be essentially three patterns of methylation: one fully unmethylated sequence, a set of fully methylated sequences and a set of sequences that are partially methylated in an identical pattern. Such a pattern could suggest a high rate of clonality and that very little amplifiable DNA went into the bisulphite reaction or post-bisulphite PCR, perhaps because DNA was degraded in dead pups. Alternatively, the result could suggest something of more biological interest, that these were the three methylation profiles present in cells of the early cleavage embryo at that very limited time window of maternal LSD1 deficiency, and that this limited set of profiles becomes 'fixed' when the embryonic lineage is determined from a small number of blastomeres. I think we need more detail and improved methylation analysis to be able to discriminate between technical issues and biologically interesting interpretation.</p><p>5) What tissue is actually assessed? The authors state 'sagittal sections' of the pups. So, is this comparable between the controls and mutants? Is it the case that only one control and two mutant pups were examined (the figure legend states: “All analyses were performed on a staged matched B6/CAST hybrid control pup and 2 maternal effect progeny (MEP) exhibiting perinatal lethality”)? This does not seem adequate for expression level comparison.</p><p>6) In the subsection “LSD1 is expressed throughout oocyte development”, finding of incomplete loss of LSD1 is really surprising. In the paper originally describing <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> mice, deletion was always observed in all oocytes. The breeding schemes the authors are using indicate that there is only one functional allele of <italic>Lsd1</italic> in the target cells, which makes the persistence of LSD1 even more surprising. Considering that <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> is most likely expressed in primordial germ cells it is extremely unlikely that, if deletion took place, the LSD1 can persist till ovulation. The authors admit that they cannot explain it, however the question remains if one should leave it like that. The authors can check how efficient deleters are the <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> mice they are using (more about mice later) by crossing them with some other <italic>fl/fl</italic> target strain. In addition, it would be interesting to determine the level of LSD1 in maternally deleted eggs. Is it the same as in heterozygous females or significantly lower? This information would be very important in evaluating the results of behavioural tests.</p><p>7) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Loss of maternal LSD1 results in 1-2 cell embryonic arrest”, is the timing of expression of paternal allele known? Please provide experimental evidence or citation.</p><p>8) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Loss of maternal LSD1 results in 1-2 cell embryonic arrest”, the development of <italic>Lsd1<sup>Gdf9</sup></italic> control embryos is very poor. Another example how unrelated/uncontrolled influence can significantly affect experimental results. In view of these results I would suggest deleting all results in which <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> is used. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, development of embryos from <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic> crosses is obviously much better than from <italic>Gdf9</italic> crosses, strain effect? Another reason to delete <italic>Gdf9</italic> results as those two groups should be comparable. 3- and 4-cell stage embryos appear very unhealthy.</p><p>9) One note of caution on the behavioural effects is that there could be a potential confound of litter effect, given that factors such as litter size in the early postnatal period could have a programming effect on a variety of adult behaviours – and so could be quite independent of history of <italic>Lsd1</italic> deficiency per se – and there is a strong effect on litter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Stronger data on the effect on imprinted genes (see above) would help negate a possible confounding effect such as this.</p><p>10) From the RNA-seq datasets, the authors comment on mis-regulation of interesting DNA methylation modulators, such as <italic>Dnmt1, Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57, Dppa3/Stella</italic> in 2-cell embryos from <italic>Lsd1<sup>Zp3-</sup>Cre</italic> females. Ideally, these effects would be validated by RT-qPCR. Also, this mis-regulation could be more apparent than real. For example, a two-fold up-regulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> could represent the same number of oocyte-derived <italic>Dnmt1</italic> transcripts, but a reduction in the total mRNA pool in the 2-C embryo owing to impaired zygotic genome activation, so it is a relative rather than absolute change.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Maternally provided LSD1/KDM1A enables the maternal-to-zygotic transition and prevents defects that manifest postnatally&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. These can be addressed without further experimentation, with modifications to the manuscript text or methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors addressed (or attempted to address) most of the comments. They also provided some additional experiments and discussed why some of the requested experiments could not be performed. The arguments (shortage of time, being out of the scope of the investigation, limit imposed by the available number of embryos) seem overall reasonable and justified. The manuscript is of sufficient quality and interest to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic> though some additions in the text are necessary.</p><p>Additional comment:</p><p>The Discussion is mostly concentrating on relatively trivial and unexplained results dealing with imprinting errors observed in two dead pups. The authors tried to explain the reason for using dead pups and how they controlled for possible artefacts. This explanation is not entirely satisfactory and possible technical problems could explain why two samples significantly differ. I certainly do not see the need to provide so much space in illustrations, results and discussion to this subject. The rest of the Discussion is mostly a repetition of the Results. There is no attempt to speculate about some puzzling observations. The presence of a small amount of protein in supposedly <italic>Vasa-Cre</italic> mediated deleted oocytes has been partially explained in the authors' reply to reviewers so why not add those thought to the Discussion. The suggestion that a possible reason may be extreme stability of LSD1 protein or RNA is not logical. If this would be the case one would expect to see even more protein or RNA in the oocytes in which deletion happens much later when mediated by <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> and <italic>ZP3-Cre</italic>.</p><p>The authors (again in the accompanying letter) state that differences between the <italic>Gdf9-Cre</italic> and <italic>ZP3-Cre</italic> experiments may be caused by different locations. They could have easily checked if this is true. As it stands there is a very significant difference and readers may draw all kinds of conclusions from what could be the trivial fact that one lab is better in growing embryos or handling mice. However, it is also possible that the difference is caused by an earlier action of GDF9 which would in turn deprive oocytes of histone demethylase a few days earlier. However if LSD1 protein or RNA is so long lived this explanation is useless.</p><p>One would really like to see those puzzles discussed a bit better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>As before, this manuscript on the consequences of ablation of LSD1/KDM1A in mouse oocytes has three components: phenotypic and molecular characterisation of defects in oocytes and preimplantation embryos; description of behavioural effects in rare surviving adult progeny obtained after early maternal germline ablation of LSD1 (<italic>Vasa-Cre</italic>); and molecular analysis of imprinted genes in pups from such maternal germline mutants. Some connections can be made between these phenotypic outcomes, but they can be considered separate facets of the story. Thus, the reported behavioural defects could be completely unrelated to altered imprinting, but the analysis of imprinted genes offers precedent that maternal lack of LSD1 could give rise to early epigenetic errors that persist into adult life. In the revised manuscript, the characterisation of the molecular defects in early embryos is significantly improved with the addition of the RNA-seq data from <italic>Lsd1:Zp3-Cre</italic> oocytes. These added data allow the authors to conclude more strongly that there is a defect in zygotic genome activation, since the disruption in gene expression in oocytes is far less extensive. However, whether the ZGA defect depends upon activity of LSD1 in the zygote/embryo or other factors stored in the oocyte that depend upon LSD1 in the oocyte cannot be distinguished. The manuscript from Ancellin et al. addresses this point. Nevertheless, the informatic analysis of the RNA-seq datasets looks very robust.</p><p>Regarding the other two main aspects of the manuscript, I retain some concerns. I think the authors could have gone about the expression and methylation analysis in a more robust way. Given the prominence given to this analysis in the manuscript, I would have considered that sacrificing a couple of pups for more refined molecular analysis, rather than relying on the approach adopted of extracting DNA and RNA from histological sections of deceased pups, would have been appropriate. It would have given this analysis far greater credibility: we would have had the confidence that pristine, freshly isolated and defined tissues were being analysed, rather than an aggregation of tissue of unknown quality from a sagittal section. On a side point, regarding the result for <italic>Grb10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it is not clear that the authors are actually looking at the germline DMR, as this region should be fully unmethylated on the paternal allele of control animals, whereas both alleles seem to be fully methylated. (The germline DMR is unmethylated on the paternal allele in all tissues and, as far as I am aware, tissue-specific expression status of <italic>Grb10</italic> occurs without changes in the methylation of the germline DMR.)</p><p>Regarding the behavioural tests, I am not sure the issue of litter size and behavioural effects is fully dealt with. Were the litter sizes similar for the various control groups, given the very small litter sizes of the maternal mutants? The definitive ways to get around possible confound of litter size when there seems to be such a profound effect on litter size would be to reduce the litter size of the controls groups to those of the maternal mutant class, or undertake cross-fostering to ensure control and maternal mutant groups all experience similar postnatal care. In as much as it is not possible to expect the authors to undertake the study in this way now, I do strongly urge them to include explicit statements in the Materials and methods on the postnatal history of the adults, both maternal mutant and control groups, relating to litter size (exact litter sizes for all groups). There remains a potential confounding factor here, and readers need to be able to appreciate it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08848.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Specific comments: 1) I have a problem with the basic experimental design.

Furthermore, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one of the most important mechanisms controlling the utilization of many maternal mRNAs and it would be very important to determine how it functions during maturation of mutant oocytes and after fertilization in zygotes.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have prioritized these studies. We now include RNA-seq analysis of polyadenylated and non- polyadenylated RNAs in <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> mutant versus control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This analysis shows that the transcriptome differences between control and <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> oocytes are much less than the differences between control and <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> M-Z+ 2C embryos. This finding is consistent with our conclusion that LSD1 functions post-fertilization during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. The new RNA-seq analysis does have some interesting new leads, including the massive upregulation of the Metallothionein1 (<italic>Mt1</italic> gene) and the reduction in several mitochondrially encoded genes in <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> oocytes. This indicates a possible stress response or metabolic deficit in the mutants which we have now indicated in the main text and Discussion. We are currently pursuing these potential <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> oocyte defects in our ongoing studies.</p><p><italic>In order to supplement the data on the imprinting state of several genes in perinatal pups, it would be necessary to assess and include in the manuscript the imprinting state of the same genes in the ovulated oocytes and zygotes.</italic> </p><p>This is a good question and was part of the original rationale for these experiments. So we tried very hard to analyze the establishment of maternal imprints in <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> and <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Vasa</sub> mutants, both in oocytes and arrested embryos (in the Katz and Macfarlan Laboratories). Although we could amplify repeat sequences and detected little change in DNA methylation levels in mutants relative to wt, we have been unable to amplify ICR regions from bisulfite treated DNA, even with nested PCR. Importantly, in our new RNA-seq analysis we do not observe imprinted gene expression defects in <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> oocytes. This provides indirect support that imprints are properly established.</p><p><italic>2) A major concern is the characterisation of the effects on methylation and expression of imprinted genes in the Lsd1<sup>Vasa</sup> progeny; this should be improved, especially because the link between effects on methylation and expression do not appear to be well correlated. I think there are obvious ways to improve this and the analysis as presented does not allow strong conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We have now assayed DNA methylation at imprinting control regions in a second control neonatal pup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this second control, imprinting is even more strictly maintained, suggesting that the imprinting defects in <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Vasa</sub> pups are not just due to variability. We were unable to obtain additional surviving <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Vasa</sub> mutants to improve the analysis on the mutant side. The variability between effects on methylation and expression are consistent with our overall observations that multiple epigenetic enzymes are disrupted.</p><p><italic>3) Is it the case that the authors analysed methylation and expression in dead pups (they refer to them as 'exhibiting perinatal lethality)? In which case, how reliable is the RT-qPCR analysis?</italic> </p><p>Because of the very limited number of hypomorphic animals and the need to allow viable neonatal pups to develop into adults, the methylation and expression had to be done on sagittal sections of newly deceased pups. In order to minimize the effects of death on these analyses, careful attention was taken to match the death conditions in controls. We also took great care to match sagittal sections. Importantly, we have now provided new RT-PCR data from a second control pup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The new data closely matches the other control, suggesting that the variability in expression that we see in some of <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Vasa</sub> pups is likely due to real variability rather than assay conditions.</p><p><italic>4) Do the bisulphite sequencing results take into account clonality? For example, for the Igf2r DMR in MEP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), there appears to be essentially three patterns of methylation: one fully unmethylated sequence, a set of fully methylated sequences and a set of sequences that are partially methylated in an identical pattern.

I think we need more detail and improved methylation analysis to be able to discriminate between technical issues and biologically interesting interpretation.</italic> </p><p>The bisulfite analysis was performed on a large amount of DNA extracted from a sagittal section of a neonatal pup. This minimizes the chances of clonality. In addition, we have verified the lack of clonality using the BiQ analyzer program.</p><p><italic>5) What tissue is actually assessed? The authors state 'sagittal sections' of the pups. So, is this comparable between the controls and mutants? Is it the case that only one control and two mutant pups were examined (the figure legend states: “All analyses were performed on a staged matched B6/CAST hybrid control pup and 2 maternal effect progeny (MEP) exhibiting perinatal lethality”)? This does not seem adequate for expression level comparison.</italic> </p><p>Please see responses to points 2 and 3.</p><p><italic>6) In the subsection “LSD1 is expressed throughout oocyte development”, finding of incomplete loss of LSD1 is really surprising. In the paper originally describing Vasa-Cre mice, deletion was always observed in all oocytes. The breeding schemes the authors are using indicate that there is only one functional allele of Lsd1 in the target cells, which makes the persistence of LSD1 even more surprising.

The authors admit that they cannot explain it, however the question remains if one should leave it like that. The authors can check how efficient deleters are the Vasa-Cre mice they are using (more about mice later) by crossing them with some other fl/fl target strain.</italic> </p><p>Data generated from analysis of this <italic>Lsd1</italic> conditonal allele in other tissues (submitted elsewhere) suggests that LSD1 protein (or RNA) can be extremely stable. For example, in some cells, LSD1 is still robustly detected 8 weeks after complete deletion of the floxed allele. Also in our hands, crossing <italic>Cre</italic>-drivers with different floxed alleles (or in mice from different strains) can lead to different patterns/timing of deletion, often not matching published patterns. For further explanation please see comments below.</p><p><italic>In addition, it would be interesting to determine the level of LSD1 in maternally deleted eggs. Is it the same as in heterozygous females or significantly lower? This information would be very important in evaluating the results of behavioural tests.</italic> </p><p>The controls for the immunohistochemistry on <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Vasa</sub> oocyes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are heterozygotes, suggesting that the “reduced” expression that we quantified is significantly lower than heterozygotes. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend has been amended to indicate this.</p><p><italic>7) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Loss of maternal LSD1 results in 1-2 cell embryonic arrest”, is the timing of expression of paternal allele known? Please provide experimental evidence or citation.</italic> </p><p>Answering this question would require that the maternally mutant embryos be fertilized and develop toward the blastocyst stage, or require RNA analysis of hybrid crosses that contain SNPs to distinguish alleles. However as we show in the manuscript, the maternal mutants do not develop when fertilized by wild-type males. In the occasional embryo that cleaves to the 2C stage, we do not detect Lsd1 transcripts (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3- figure supplement 3</xref>), but this could be due to the lack of full ZGA and may not be due to the lack of transcription from the paternal allele. We have generated RNA from 2C embryos derived from hybrid crosses (CAST/B6), but the <italic>Lsd1</italic> allele does not have SNPs, so allele specific expression could not be interrogated.</p><p><italic>8) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Loss of maternal LSD1 results in 1-2 cell embryonic arrest”, the development of Lsd1<sup>Gdf9</sup> control embryos is very poor. Another example how unrelated/uncontrolled influence can significantly affect experimental results. In view of these results I would suggest deleting all results in which Gdf9-Cre is used. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, development of embryos from Zp3-Cre crosses is obviously much better than from Gdf9 crosses, strain effect? Another reason to delete Gdf9 results as those two groups should be comparable. 3- and 4-cell stage embryos appear very unhealthy.</italic> </p><p>Some of the slight phenotypic differences between <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Zp3</sub> and <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Gdf9</sub> mutants may be due to the fact that the experiments were performed in two difference laboratories (Macfarlan and Katz). As a result, there may be subtle differences in developmental timing, strain background, etc. Nevertheless, we believe that the small differences are real and wish to report the result. To make the manuscript more clear, we have moved the <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Gdf9</sub> results to a supplemental figure and modified the text.</p><p><italic>9) One note of caution on the behavioural effects is that there could be a potential confound of litter effect, given that factors such as litter size in the early postnatal period could have a programming effect on a variety of adult behaviours – and so could be quite independent of history of Lsd1 deficiency per se – and there is a strong effect on litter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Stronger data on the effect on imprinted genes (see above) would help negate a possible confounding effect such as this.</italic> </p><p>Despite the strong effect on litter size in <italic>Lsd1</italic><sub>Vasa</sub> mutants, hypomorphic animals were obtained from litters ranging between 1-4 animals. Nevertheless, the behavior effects were observed in 100% of the animals, regardless of the size of the litter to which they were born. This suggests that the effect is independent of litter size. Text has been added to the manuscript to make this point.</p><p><italic>10) From the RNA-seq datasets, the authors comment on mis-regulation of interesting DNA methylation modulators, such as Dnmt1, Tet1, Trim28, Zfp57, Dppa3/Stella in 2-cell embryos from Lsd1<sup>Zp3-</sup>Cre females. Ideally, these effects would be validated by RT-qPCR. Also, this mis-regulation could be more apparent than real. For example, a two-fold up-regulation of Dnmt1 could represent the same number of oocyte-derived Dnmt1 transcripts, but a reduction in the total mRNA pool in the 2-C embryo owing to impaired zygotic genome activation, so it is a relative rather than absolute change.</italic></p><p>We agree. We have performed RT-PCR and added it to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The RT-PCR data is consistent with the reported RNA-seq data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: The authors addressed (or attempted to address) most of the comments. They also provided some additional experiments and discussed why some of the requested experiments could not be performed. The arguments (shortage of time, being out of the scope of the investigation, limit imposed by the available number of embryos) seem overall reasonable and justified.

If this would be the case one would expect to see even more protein or RNA in the oocytes in which deletion happens much later when mediated by Gdf9-Cre and ZP3-Cre.</italic></p><p> <italic>The authors (again in the accompanying letter) state that differences between the Gdf9-Cre and ZP3-Cre experiments may be caused by different locations. They could have easily check if this is true. As it stands there is very significant difference and readers may draw all kinds of conclusions from what could be trivial fact that one lab is better in growing embryos or handling mice. However, it is also possible that the difference is caused by earlier action of GDF9 which would I turn deprive oocytes of histone demethylase few days earlier. However if LSD1 protein or RNA is so long lived this explanation is useless. One would really like to see those puzzles discussed a bit better. Reviewer #2: As before, this manuscript on the consequences of ablation of LSD1/KDM1A in mouse oocytes has three components: phenotypic and molecular characterisation of defects in oocytes and preimplantation embryos; description of behavioural effects in rare surviving adult progeny obtained after early maternal germline ablation of LSD1 (Vasa-Cre); and molecular analysis of imprinted genes in pups from such maternal germline mutants.</italic> </p><p><italic>Some connections can be made between these phenotypic outcomes, but they can be considered separate facets of the story. Thus, the reported behavioural defects could be completely unrelated to altered imprinting, but the analysis of imprinted genes offers precedent that maternal lack of LSD1 could give rise to early epigenetic errors that persist into adult life. In the revised manuscript, the characterisation of the molecular defects in early embryos is significantly improved with the addition of the RNA-seq data from Lsd1:Zp3-Cre oocytes. These added data allow the authors to conclude more strongly that there is a defect in zygotic genome activation, since the disruption in gene expression in oocytes is far less extensive. However, whether the ZGA defect depends upon activity of LSD1 in the zygote/embryo or other factors stored in the oocyte that depend upon LSD1 in the oocyte cannot be distinguished. The manuscript from Ancellin et al., addresses this point. Nevertheless, the informatic analysis of the RNA-seq datasets looks very robust. Regarding the other two main aspects of the manuscript, I retain some concerns. I think the authors could have gone about the expression and methylation analysis in a more robust way. Given the prominence given to this analysis in the manuscript, I would have considered that sacrificing a couple of pups for more refined molecular analysis, rather than relying on the approach adopted of extracting DNA and RNA from histological sections of deceased pups, would have been appropriate. It would have given this analysis far greater credibility: we would have had the confidence that pristine, freshly isolated and defined tissues were being analysed, rather than an aggregation of tissue of unknown quality from a sagittal section. On a side point, regarding the result for Grb10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it is not clear that the authors are actually looking at the germline DMR, as this region should be fully unmethylated on the paternal allele of control animals, whereas both alleles seem to be fully methylated. (The germline DMR is unmethylated on the paternal allele in all tissues and, as far as I am aware, tissue-specific expression status of Grb10 occurs without changes in the methylation of the germline DMR.) Regarding the behavioural tests, I am not sure the issue of litter size and behavioural effects is fully dealt with. Were the litter sizes similar for the various control groups, given the very small litter sizes of the maternal mutants? The definitive ways to get around possible confound of litter size when there seems to be such a profound effect on litter size would be to reduce the litter size of the controls groups to those of the maternal mutant class, or undertake cross-fostering to ensure control and maternal mutant groups all experience similar postnatal care. In as much as it is not possible to expect the authors to undertake the study in this way now, I do strongly urge them to include explicit statements in the Materials and methods on the postnatal history of the adults, both maternal mutant and control groups, relating to litter size (exact litter sizes for all groups). There remains a potential confounding factor here, and readers need to be able to appreciate it.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful suggestions. We agree with the points that they have raised in the new round of reviews and have made all of their suggested changes and additions to the text (largely in the Discussion). In addition, we have removed the confusing <italic>Grb10</italic> imprinting data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and the corresponding text in the results. Finally, as requested, we have added a new table and text describing the table in the Methods. This new table lists the litter sizes of all perinatal lethal animals and all animals assayed in the behavioral assays.</p></body></sub-article></article>
