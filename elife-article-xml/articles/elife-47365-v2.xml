communities where interactions among community members impact both the individual constituents and the surrounding environment. Here, we developed a system to visualize interspecies behaviors at initial encounters. By imaging two prevalent pathogens known to be coisolated from chronic illnesses, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, we observed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can modify surface motility in response to secreted factors from <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Upon sensing <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic> transitioned from collective to single-cell motility with an associated increase in speed and directedness – a behavior we refer to as ‘exploratory motility’. Explorer cells moved preferentially towards <italic>S. aureus</italic> and invaded <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonies through the action of the type IV pili. These studies reveal previously undescribed motility behaviors and lend insight into how <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> senses and responds to other species. Identifying strategies to harness these interactions may open avenues for new antimicrobial strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</kwd><kwd>Staphylococcus aureus</kwd><kwd>polymicrobial infections</kwd><kwd>bacterial motility</kwd><kwd>cystic fibrosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship LIMOLI15F0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Limoli</surname><given-names>Dominique H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CFF Postdoc-to-Faculty Transition Award LIMOLI18F5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Limoli</surname><given-names>Dominique H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant R37 AI83256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Toole</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> coordinates invasion and destruction of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> communities by modulating single-cell and collective motility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While it is clear that many microbial infections do not occur with a single species, we have only recently begun to understand the profound impacts microbial species have on each other and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nguyen and Oglesby-Sherrouse, 2016</xref>). Studies of dental biofilms, intestinal communities, chronic wounds, and respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) demonstrate that community interactions influence microbial survival and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Limoli and Hoffman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gabrilska and Rumbaugh, 2015</xref>). For example, we and others find an association between coisolation of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> from the CF airway or chronic wounds and poor patient outcomes, including decreased lung function and shortened life-spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Limoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maliniak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hubert et al., 2013</xref>). Laboratory studies also reveal interactions between these two pathogens can alter virulence factor production by one or both species, potentially influencing pathogenesis, persistence, and/or antibiotic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotterbeekx et al., 2017</xref>). For example, in a model of coinfection on CF-derived bronchial epithelial cells, we observed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> form mixed microcolonies, which promotes the survival of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the presence of vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orazi and O'Toole, 2017</xref>). One strategy to improve outcomes for these coinfected patients may be to block harmful interspecies interactions before they begin.</p><p>Here, we designed a system to visualize early interactions between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> and follow single-cell behaviors over time with live-imaging. We show that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can sense <italic>S. aureus</italic> secreted products from a distance and in turn, dramatically alter the motility behaviors of this Gram-negative bacterium. In response to <italic>S. aureus,</italic> individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells transition from collective to single-cell movement, allowing exploration of the surrounding environment and directional movement towards <italic>S. aureus.</italic> We find that such ‘exploratory motility’ is driven primarily by the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> type IV pili (TFP) and modulated, in part, by the CheY-like response regulator, PilG. Importantly, we find <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is capable of responding to an array of bacterial species and strains recovered from a variety of sources, including CF patients, demonstrating a broad capacity for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to sense other microbial species and modulate motility in response. Thus, we provide a new means to study polymicrobial interactions at the single-cell level and reveal that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can sense the presence of other microbial species and dramatically, yet specifically, modify its behavior in response to such interspecies signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>S. aureus</italic> promotes exploratory motility in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>To understand early microbial interactions, we established an in vitro coculture system to monitor <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> at first encounters.

However, protease treatment of the supernatant, with either proteinase k or trypsin, almost entirely eliminated activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

PSMs are amphipathic, multifunctional peptides that lyse many human cell types, are pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant to neutrophils, and influence <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm morphology and dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> produces five α-peptides (PSMα1–4 and δ-toxin) and two β-peptides (PSMβ1 and 2).

Moreover, while the bulk assays most frequently utilized to study microbial interactions have provided insight into how bacterial species can influence community survival, metabolism, or virulence factor production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotterbeekx et al., 2017</xref>), we lack detailed information regarding how single-cells respond to the presence of another species at initial encounters. Here, we developed quantitative live-imaging methods to visualize the behaviors of two clinically important organisms and track their behavior over time. Through these studies, we uncovered microbial behaviors that could not have been predicted from bulk assays alone. We observed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is able to alter its behavior in the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> from a distance by responding to secreted factors. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is then able to tune its motility patterns, adopting a behavior we refer to as ‘exploratory motility’.</p><p>What interspecies factors do <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> sense and respond to? Our data thus far reveal that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can not only respond to secreted products from <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but also more broadly to a range of model bacteria and CF pathogens, both Gram-positive and negative. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> increased surface motility to varying extents depending on the species and strain utilized – a feature we predict will inform the nature and breadth of factors to which <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is capable of responding. For <italic>S. aureus,</italic> we determined the factors are heat stable proteins regulated by the Agr quorum sensing system. This insight led to the determination that <italic>S. aureus</italic> PSMs contribute to the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to induce surface motility in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, but do not fully account for the observed phenotype, suggesting that additional unidentified factors are necessary. Moreover, <italic>S. aureus</italic> may also produce Agr-independent factors that influence <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility, given that an Agr-deficient strain is unable to induce motility in the macroscopic sub-surface inoculation motility assay or directional motility on either the macroscopic or single-cell level, but remains capable of increasing single-cell motility during live-imaging. Thus, it is formally possible that separate factors are required for initiating single-cell motility and directional motion. Live-imaging also suggests that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells may actively avoid Agr-deficient <italic>S. aureus</italic>, raising the possibility that the Agr system negatively regulates a secreted factor that is unfavorable for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>How do PSMs promote <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility? PSMs are amphipathic peptides that are able to reduce interfacial tension (IFT), that is, the cohesive or excess energy between molecules at an interface. While such surfactants have been extensively characterized to play an essential role in flagella-mediated bacterial surface motility, referred to as swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kearns, 2010</xref>), their role in TFP-mediated motility is not well described. TFP generate bacterial movement on surfaces though polymerization and extension of pilus fibers, followed by pilus retraction, which pulls the cell body forward. Reduced IFT between the cell body and the surface, without affecting interaction between the pilus tip and the surface, may reduce drag on the cell body and reduce the force necessary to retract the pilus. TFP-mediated motility is most often described as a behavior where cells are primarily motile only in large groups. The behaviors for WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in monoculture observed here are consistent with previous descriptions of twitching motility, including the movement of cells in rafts, preferentially aligned along their long axis, and group tendril formation at the edges of the expanding community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrows, 2012</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells were seen to exit an expanding raft and transition to single-cell motility. Perhaps PSMs also reduce the IFT between neighboring <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells, disrupting collective movement within rafts.</p><p>PSMs are known to promote <italic>S. aureus</italic> spreading on wet surfaces, in particular PSMα3 and δ-toxin, which possess high surfactant activity and low hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsompanidou et al., 2013</xref>). In the current study, we examined a mutant deficient in all seven PSMs, thus it is unknown if each <italic>S. aureus</italic> PSM possesses similar ability to promote motility and/or if their mechanism of action toward <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> will also depend on their specific surfactant activity. Motility experiments in the presence of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> support the hypothesis that surfactants may increase TFP-mediated motility in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Two strains were examined, PY79 and 3610. 3610 induced <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility similar to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In comparison to PY79, which did not induce motility and is deficient in surfactant production, 3610 is an undomesticated strain that secretes a potent lipopeptide surfactant, called surfactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kearns and Losick, 2003</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to speculate that the different levels of surfactin account for the differential ability of these <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains to promote <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility.</p><p>PSMs can also form small transient pores in lipid membranes resulting in cell lysis of eukaryotic and some prokaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that interactions of PSMs with the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outer membrane influence <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> surface motility, independent of reduced IFT at the surface. For example, surfactin has been shown to influence <italic>B. subtilis</italic> quorum sensing and biofilm formation through the formation of membrane pores, resulting in potassium leakage. The resulting low cellular potassium activates the protein kinase, KinC, which regulates biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">López et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies will investigate if PSMs influence <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> surface motility by reduction of IFT, interactions with the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outer membrane, and/or alternative mechanism(s). Future studies are also necessary to determine if PSMs are sufficient to promote directional <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility or if PSMs function in concert with additional <italic>S. aureus</italic> factors to increase surface motility per se in order to facilitate movement towards an additional stimulus.</p><p>While flagella-mediated chemotaxis has been extensively studied in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, little is understood regarding how bacteria direct movement on a surface utilizing the TFP. While the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Pil-Chp system harbors similarity to the well-studied Che system in <italic>E. coli</italic>, initial studies uncover significant differences in the regulation of this pathway. PilJ is a predicted chemoreceptor, by sequence similarity to the flagella chemotaxis system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darzins, 1994</xref>); however, the functional role in chemotaxis remains unclear. In initial studies of TFP-mediated chemotaxis, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was shown to direct motility on agar surfaces up a gradient of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kearns et al., 2001</xref>). While a Δ<italic>pilJ</italic> mutant did not exhibit preferential movement up a PE gradient, the lack of twitching motility in this mutant prohibited interpretation of a role for PilJ. Here, despite the lack of development of a macroscopic twitching motility zone, individual cells were capable of initiating motility in the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> when monitored by live-imaging, suggesting that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is capable of sensing <italic>S. aureus</italic> and performing twitching motility in the absence of functional PilJ.</p><p>How does <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> sense an external stimulus and transmit this into a mechanical response driving twitching motility? Twitching cells move by pulling themselves along by pili clustered at one pole. Cells can reverse direction by extending the pili from the opposite pole, changing the direction of movement along the long axis. These reversals have recently been suggested to be important for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to direct movement up a chemotactic gradient while on a surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliveira et al., 2016</xref>). In a Δ<italic>pilG</italic> mutant (the response regulator for pilus extension), cells were observed to perform fewer reversals in comparison to WT in response to a chemotactic gradient and thus were unable to bias the directionality of their movement. Here we examined a role for PilG in modulating a response to secreted factors from <italic>S. aureus</italic> and found a Δ<italic>pilG</italic> mutant was significantly diminished in the ability to respond. Both Δ<italic>pilJ</italic> and Δ<italic>pilG</italic> mutants have been previously reported to be deficient in producing traditional twitch rings in the macroscopic sub-surface inoculation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darzins, 1994</xref>). Our observations here for PilJ and PilG, combined with those from Oliveira et al. suggest the collective movements of these mutants as measured in bulk assays may not be reflected on the single-cell level. However, in comparison to studies by Oliveira, we observed very little movement for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the absence of PilG. These studies utilized the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> parental strain PAO1 (in comparison to PA14 used here). We hypothesized that differences in parental strain background (PAO1 verses PA14) may account for the differences observed; however, we acquired the PAO1 parental and PAO1 Δ<italic>pilG</italic> mutant utilized in these studies and obtained similar results as observed for PA14 in coculture with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that experimental conditions influence to what extent <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is capable of performing TFP-mediated motility in the absence of PilG.</p><p><italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> is one of the most notorious predatory bacteria – elaborating an array of social behaviors reminiscent of what we observe here for <italic>P. aeruginosa. M. xanthus</italic> coordinates a cooperative, density-dependent feeding behavior, resulting in propulsion of the cells rapidly through the colony of prey, leading to prey lysis, and nutrient acquisition. When <italic>M. xanthus</italic> contacts prey cells, pili-dependent reversals are stimulated, which keeps the cells ‘trapped’ near the prey colony, promoting contact-dependent prey killing and increased local concentration of antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muñoz-Dorado et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we observed that when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encounters <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells appear to mount a coordinated response whereby <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> surrounds the <italic>S. aureus</italic> colony and eventually invades the colony – a behavior referred to as the ‘wolf pack’ strategy. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> produces an arsenal of secreted antimicrobials shown to inhibit the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, yet these secreted factors alone are insufficient for cellular lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Limoli et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to speculate that these behaviors function to synergistically increase cellular contacts necessary to kill <italic>S. aureus</italic> by a contact-dependent mechanism and/or to locally increase the concentration of secreted products.</p><p>By acquiring a fundamental understanding of how bacteria sense and respond to life with each other, we move closer to learning how to rationally manipulate interspecies behaviors during infection and in the environment. While for CF patients, this may mean preventing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> physical interactions, in other instances, we might bring species together who synergize to produce a beneficial compound.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

unrecognized interaction between two microbes that co-infect the CF airways: <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Specifically, the authors show that <italic>S. aureus</italic> induces <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> surface motility and identify phenol soluble modulins (together with yet-to-be identified other factors) as playing a role in inducing motility mediated by type IV pili. This work extends the relevance of single-cell twitching chemotaxis motility by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which had been previously reported, to interspecies interactions; it begins to uncover the mechanisms underpinning the interaction; and it demonstrates that other bacterial species can also induce <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility, suggesting these findings may be generalizable. Together, it raises many interesting questions for future work, including whether similar factors produced by diverse species trigger this response, and whether evidence for this seemingly ecologically relevant in vitro interaction can be found in vivo. The authors are commended for being so responsive throughout the review process.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Interspecies signaling generates exploratory motility in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Wolfgang.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The value of this paper is its focus on an interaction between 2 microbes that co-infect the CF airways. Though prior studies, such as Oliveira et al., 2016, have nicely documented single-cell twitching chemotaxis motility by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, this work represents a significant step forward in relevance of this phenomenon to an important ecological context. We would like to see this study eventually published in <italic>eLife</italic>, pending a convincing response (involving both editorial changes as well as new experiments) to the following essential revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should do three things to improve the paper:</p><p>1) Better contextualize their study in light of the Oliveira paper (this can be done in the Introduction and Discussion, and also experimentally – see point 3).</p><p>2) Expand understanding of the specificity of this interspecies interaction: test whether <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> responds similarly to other non-Staph species and/or</p><p>3) Determine whether the interactions observed here are operating through the Chp chemotaxis genes shown by Oliveira to be important in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in exploratory motility.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Limoli et al. used single-cell imaging to discover a novel behavioral interaction between <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. By imaging cells in co-culture, they found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> alters its motility in response to a chemical &quot;signal&quot; made by <italic>S. aureus. P. aeruginosa</italic> &quot;senses&quot; that signal and activates a form of motility that the authors term &quot;exploratory motility.&quot; The authors go on to show that exploratory motility is driven, at least in part, by type IV pili. They also show that the signal generated by <italic>S. aureus</italic> is regulated by the Agr quorum sensing system. Overall, this work represents the beginning of a potentially exciting story with important implications to research on biofilms, bacterial interactions, and motility. However, in its current state the paper falls in between two incomplete stories. If the primary goal is to characterize a new behavioral transition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from collective to solitary movement, the authors need to better understand the mechanism underlying the different motility modes and the transition between them. And if the primary emphasis is the interspecies signaling, the authors need to better understand the nature of the signaling involved. In my view, answering one of these two questions would elevate the paper to the standards of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Is there really a &quot;signal&quot; sensed by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>? While it seems clear that <italic>S. aureus</italic> can affect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility and that its ability to do so depends on Agr, I am concerned that this could be a passive effect of a secreted factor (such as a surfactant or a protease) rather than an active signaling process. The argument for active changes in cAMP levels (Figure 6B) shows a modest decrease in cAMP levels when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is exposed to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but this effect is only seen at late time-points which do not appear to be consistent with the kinetics of the response (Figure 2A). To really confirm this point the authors would ideally be able to elicit the response with the purified signal. For example, if the signaling is direct, they could try simply adding AIP to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. If not, the authors could better characterize the spent media activity they describe, for example by showing whether it is heat-stable, protease-resistant, organically-soluble, etc and then pursue purification appropriately.</p><p>2) How does the &quot;signal&quot; affect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility in general and type IV pili and flagella in particular? Figure 6 argues that cAMP drives exploratory motility, but I feel that this is simply correlation. In addition, it is unclear to me how changes in cAMP affect pilus activity and how pilus activity leads to &quot;collective&quot; or &quot;single-cell&quot; motility. At a minimum the authors could use single-cell imaging, perhaps with sparse labeling of fluorescent cells, to better understand the role of pili and flagella in collective motility. Additional cAMP mutants could help show the real necessity for this pathway. And finally, the role of PilJ needs to be untangled, as the signs of the signaling are confusing (how does inhibition of PilJ function stimulate solitary motility?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript By Limoli et al., describes a biologically interesting interspecies interaction between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in vitro. Importantly, this is the first well-documented characterization of type IV pilus (Tfp) dependent chemotactic behavior in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Specifically, the authors demonstrate a bacterial behavior termed exploratory motility, in which individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells actively move toward <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonies, and ultimately penetrate and disrupt the colony. The authors provide evidence that the chemotactic signal is secreted by <italic>S. aureus</italic> as 1) supernatants are sufficient to provoke the exploratory behavior and 2) the signal is lacking in <italic>S. aureus</italic> agr mutants.</p><p>The authors further confirm that the primary behavior requires <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Tfp, and that the phenotype can be modulated by altering intracellular cAMP (which is a regulator of Tfp biogenesis). While the data strongly suggests an underlying chemotactic response, the mechanisms is not thoroughly explored. Mutation of pilJ, encoding a putative MCP, resulted in an interesting phenotype, that was largely consistent with altered intracellular cAMP levels.</p><p>In summary, this is a very exciting paper describing an interesting and potentially significant biological behavior in an important opportunistic pathogen. The phenomenon is well documented, the experiments are well designed and the statistical analyses are thorough. I believe the manuscript will appeal to a broad audience and is likely to stimulate numerous additional studies.</p><p>I have only two major comments:</p><p>1) The authors propose that &quot;exploratory behavior&quot; may have implications for co-infections in cystic fibrosis and may represent a novel therapeutic target. This is highly speculative as the conditions in the CF lung are substantially different than the in vitro conditions used in the study. While <italic>P. aeruginosa/S. aureus</italic> co-infection is common in CF, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>a is an environmental bacterium that otherwise rarely coexists with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. It seems likely that this behavior evolved in an environmental niche, where it may provide a competitive advantage. It would be interesting to known if other species (in particular other environmental Gram-positive bacteria) can evoke the same phenotype in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This would provide information about the generality of the behavior in response to other potential bacterial competitors.</p><p>2) The signal and response mechanisms are only superficially explored. More information on either or both would increase the impact of the paper; however, I concede that an exhaustive characterization is unlikely to be achieved in a reasonable timeframe. Minimally, it would be useful to comment on other known factors implicated in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Tfp function, including ChpA, PilG/PilH and PilY1. Also, a generic characterization of the chemotactic signal would be informative and support the findings; for example, is it a protein or heat labile.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Interspecies signaling generates exploratory motility in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> aeruginosa&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While we appreciate that you successfully responded to our previous set of requests, and think this paper is on-track for acceptance in <italic>eLife</italic>, reviewer 1 raises an important point about the nature of the signal (and how it is discussed) that requires clarification. While we sympathize that revealing the identity of the signal might be something you are saving for another paper, inclusion of its identify here would significantly elevate the work. How easy would it be/how willing are you to include the identity of the unspecific &quot;signal&quot; in this manuscript, and/or test the hypothesis that it is surfactin (as suggested by reviewer 2)? If there is a compelling reason why taking it this one step further is impossible or undesirable, please explain.</p><p>Below, please find the direct critique from reviewer 1 that provides constructive feedback. Please address why you can or cannot comply with this request.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the original submission, Limoli et al. described an increase in motility of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which they argued could explain some of the interesting interactions known to occur between these species in clinically-important setting such as cystic fibrosis. Taking the two reviewers' comments into consideration, the editor requested that they address three major points: the species-specificity of the interaction, its genetic requirements, and its comparison to a previous potentially-related study by Oliveira et al.</p><p>The authors should be commended for indeed addressing all three points. Specifically, they now add additional data showing that the interactions are not species-specific and that the genetic requirements for their phenotype are similar to those previously reported by Oliveira et al.</p><p>On one hand, the authors successfully did what was asked of them. On the other hand, unfortunately, some of the new results dampened my enthusiasm for the work. For example, I am excited that clinical CF isolates of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> exhibit the same interspecies behavior as the model strains tested previously. However, I am worried that the new data showing that other bacterial species also induce <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> motility indicates that the &quot;signal&quot; the authors are interested in is actually a more general secreted factor that passively induces motility. Specifically, I am intrigued that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 3610 induces the response while <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PY79 (note: there is a typo in Figure 7D that calls it PV79) does not, as those two strains differ in their ability to make surfactin. Based on these new data, I feel that it is appropriate to directly test the hypothesis that surfactin is involved by testing a mutant of 3610 lacking the ability to make surfactin.</p><p>I would also encourage the authors to edit the tone of the Abstract and Introduction to better reflect their new findings. For example, I would feel more comfortable if the claim of &quot;signaling&quot; is decreased throughout the paper, as I am not convinced that active signaling is occurring. Along similar lines, the revised Abstract still makes it seem like the findings on the <italic>P. aeruginosa-S. aureus</italic> interactions are specific.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors addressed my concerns in the revised manuscript.

This study described a role for the CheY-like response regulator PilG, which regulates the ATPase necessary for TFP extension (PilB), to play a role in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> response to a chemotactic gradient. We therefore examined a role for PilG in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> response to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Similar to the results by Oliveira, we found that a Δ<italic>pilG</italic> mutant was diminished in its capacity to respond to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Figure 6). This was particularly striking when we compared the motility of Δ<italic>pilG</italic> to Δ<italic>pilJ</italic>, the predicted TFP chemoreceptor. Despite exhibiting low motility in traditional macroscopic assays, the Δ<italic>pilJ</italic> mutant was capable of responding to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while the response of the <italic>pilG</italic> mutant was significantly diminished.
