Prolonged wakefulness exacerbates the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) species, a major driver of AD progression, suggesting that sleep loss further accelerates AD through a vicious cycle. However, the mechanisms by which Aβ affects sleep are unknown. We demonstrate in zebrafish that Aβ acutely and reversibly enhances or suppresses sleep as a function of oligomer length. Genetic disruptions revealed that short Aβ oligomers induce acute wakefulness through Adrenergic receptor b2 (Adrb2) and Progesterone membrane receptor component 1 (Pgrmc1), while longer Aβ forms induce sleep through a pharmacologically tractable Prion Protein (PrP) signaling cascade. Our data indicate that Aβ can trigger a bi-directional sleep/wake switch. Alterations to the brain’s Aβ oligomeric milieu, such as during the progression of AD, may therefore disrupt sleep via changes in acute signaling events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>amyloid beta</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>prion protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000765</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rihel</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>282027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rihel</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012126</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rihel</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alzheimer Society of Alberta and Northwest Territories</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>W Ted</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alberta Prion Research Institute of Alberta Innovates</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>W Ted</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000143</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer Society of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leighton</surname><given-names>Patricia LA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009192</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leighton</surname><given-names>Patricia LA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>217150/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rihel</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amyloid beta, the major component of plaques in Alzheimer's disease, acutely and reversibly signals to modulate sleep as a function of oligomeric length, independently of neuronal loss.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in plaques, along with tau tangles, is one of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Change in Aβ levels in the brain is one of the earliest known pathological events in AD and is detectable years before the development of Aβ plaques and decades before the clinical onset of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jack et al., 2013</xref>). Because of its importance in AD progression, Aβ has been mostly characterized as a functionless, pathological, intrinsically neurotoxic peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moir and Tanzi, 2019</xref>). However, Aβ is an ancient neuropeptide conserved across vertebrates through at least 400 million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moir and Tanzi, 2019</xref>). Aβ’s cleavage from amyloid precursor protein (APP) is tightly regulated by multiple enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Brien and Wong, 2011</xref>), and its release from neurons is carefully controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>). Aβ interacts with numerous surface receptors and can activate intrinsic cellular signalling cascades to alter neuronal and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jarosz-Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, Aβ has been suggested to act as an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/antimicrobial-peptides">antimicrobial peptide</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soscia et al., 2010</xref>), and the deposition of Aβ may be induced as an innate immune <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/defence-mechanisms">defence mechanism</ext-link> against microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). However, the various biological effects of Aβ in health or disease remain obscure.</p><p>One of the earliest symptoms of AD is the disruption of sleep, and AD patients have sleep-wake abnormalities, including insomnia at night and increased napping during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loewenstein et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prinz et al., 1982</xref>). Multiple transgenic AD mouse models that overproduce Aβ also show disrupted sleep phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sterniczuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2002</xref>), often in the absence of neuronal loss and preceding impairments of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Irizarry et al., 1997</xref>). In non-pathological conditions, Aβ levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are modulated by the sleep-wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Aβ generation and release are controlled by electrical and synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamenetz et al., 2003</xref>), leading to increased extracellular Aβ levels during wakefulness and decreased levels during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). These observations have led to the proposal that sleep and Aβ dynamics create a vicious feed-forward cycle, wherein increases in wakefulness result in increased extracellular Aβ and aggregation, which then dysregulates sleep, further exacerbating pathogenic Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roh et al., 2012</xref>). How increased Aβ burden leads to disruptions in sleep remains unknown, although AD-related cell death of critical sleep/wake regulatory neurons has been suggested as a possible mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fronczek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manaye et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given the relationship between Aβ and sleep, we hypothesized that Aβ may directly modulate sleep-regulatory pathways independently of neuronal cell death. To test this, we took advantage of the ability to directly deliver small molecules and Aβ peptides to the brain of larval zebrafish, which have conserved APP processing machinery and Aβ peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newman et al., 2014</xref>) and share genetic, pharmacological, and neuronal sleep-regulatory mechanisms with mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow and Rihel, 2017</xref>). We found that Aβ size-dependently and reversibly modulates behavior through two distinct genetic, pharmacologically tractable pathways that regulate sleep in opposing directions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aβ dose-dependently modifies zebrafish sleep and wake behavior</title><p>Isolating the specific biological effects of Aβ has been experimentally difficult. One challenge is that Aβ is processed from a series of complex cleavage steps of a longer transmembrane protein, APP, which also produces other protein products with a variety of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Brien and Wong, 2011</xref>). This restricts the utility of genetic manipulations to tease out Aβ-specific roles from the other APP components. Another challenge is that Aβ forms, in vitro and in vivo, a variety of oligomeric species (e.g. dimers, longer oligomers, or large fibrils) with diverse structures, binding affinities, and signalling properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benilova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jarosz-Griffiths et al., 2016</xref>). Teasing out the biological signalling capabilities of these diverse oligomeric species requires selective manipulation of Aβ oligomeric states, which is difficult in vitro and is currently nearly impossible endogenously in vivo.</p><p>To overcome some of these barriers, we developed an injection assay in which the amount and type of the Aβ oligomers can be controlled and then tested the acute signaling effects of Aβ on sleep and wake behavior. Our minimally invasive intra-cardiac injection assay in 5 days post fertilization (5 dpf) larval zebrafish avoids direct damage to brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This technique rapidly (&lt;1 hr, peaking within 2–3 hr) and reversibly delivers Aβ to the larval brain, as assessed by injection of fluorescently tagged Aβ42 and subsequent confocal brain imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To generate different Aβ oligomeric species, we modified previously established in vitro monomeric Aβ incubation protocols (see Extended Methods) that enrich for Aβ with different oligomeric sizes and opposing effects on rat neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kusumoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orbán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whitcomb et al., 2015</xref>). By incubating Aβ42 overnight at increasing temperatures, we generated Aβ oligomeric pools with significantly different lengths, as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Aβ42 incubated overnight at 4°C consisted of fewer and shorter oligomers (Aβ<sup>short</sup>, mean 45 ± 11 nm, median = 39 nm) than when incubated at 25°C (Aβ<sup>long</sup>, mean 75 ± 10 nm, median = 61 nm) or at 37°C (Aβ<sup>v-long</sup>, mean 121 ± 10 nm, median = 88 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aβ oligomers bi-directionally affect sleep and wake in zebrafish larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematic.

In initial experiments, we determined the appropriate Aβ injection dose by injecting 1 nL of a 1–1000 nM dose series for both Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> and assessing subsequent waking activity and sleep, which is defined in zebrafish larvae as a period of inactivity lasting longer than one minute, which are associated with an increased arousal threshold and other features of behavioral sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prober et al., 2006</xref>). Unexpectedly, these oligomeric species had opposing behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Aβ<sup>short</sup> increased waking activity and decreased sleep relative to Aβ<sup>rev</sup> peptide, while Aβ<sup>long</sup> decreased waking and increased sleep (prep waking effect, p&lt;0.001; prep sleep effect p&lt;0.05, two-way ANOVA). These effects were generally consistent across doses, although some dose-responses elicited stronger differential effects than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), with the maximal difference between the Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> preparations at 10 nM (p<underline>&lt;</underline>0.01 doseXprep interaction, two-way ANOVA). We estimate this dose yields a final concentration that falls within the lower range of physiological concentrations reported for Aβ42 in human CSF of 100 pM-5nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2007</xref>). For example, assuming that all injected Aβ goes into the brain, the highest possible concentration would be 1500 pg/ml or 300 pM (45 ng/ml x 1 nl in 30.4 nl brain = 1.5 ng/ml = 1500 pg/ml). At the lower end, assuming equal distribution of Aβ over the whole body yields a final concentration estimate of 150 pg/ml or 30 pM (45 ng/ml x1 nl in 300 nl of body = 150 pg/ml). We therefore continued with 10 nM injections for all subsequent experiments, as it combines the maximal differentially observed behavioral effects between Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> with physiologically reasonable concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aβ affects sleep and wake in opposing directions as a function of oligomer size and independently of neural death</title><p>To explore the effect of Aβ oligomeric size on sleep, we then systematically tested the behavior effects of each Aβ species relative to a Aβ<sup>rev</sup> control for n = 3–5 independent experiments each. As in the dose response experiments, Aβ affected sleep and wake in opposing directions depending on its oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I’</xref>). In the day following injection, Aβ<sup>short</sup> significantly increased waking activity by +12.8% and reduced total sleep relative to Aβ<sup>rev</sup> by 15.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E’</xref>). The magnitude of the sleep effect is likely partially masked by a flooring effect due to generally reduced sleep during the day; we therefore favor reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrhein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, if we were to combine all the additional control Aβ<sup>short</sup> experiments subsequently reported in this manuscript (n = 160 Aβ<sup>rev</sup>n = 164 Aβ<sup>short</sup>, see Figure 3G and H), the effect size remains robust at −15.9% and the result is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA). These effects were reversible, as there were no significant differences in sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, black bar) or waking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black bar) between Aβ<sup>short</sup> and reverse peptide in the night following injection, and the behavior of Aβ<sup>short</sup>-injected larvae returned to baseline levels in the subsequent day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, while injection of longer Aβ fibers (Aβ<sup>v_long</sup>) had no effect on behavior, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I’</xref>), injection of the intermediate Aβ<sup>long</sup> oligomers significantly increased sleep during the post-injection day by +47.2% and reduced waking activity by 11.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G’</xref>). The increased sleep induced by Aβ<sup>long</sup> was due to a significant increase in the average number of sleep bouts but not an increase in sleep bout length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), indicating higher sleep initiation is responsible for the change in sleep rather than an increased sleep consolidation. This increased sleep effect by Aβ<sup>long</sup> was not observed in the night following injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, black bar), and behavior returned to baseline by the following morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>This data is consistent with Aβ<sup>short</sup> increasing wakefulness and Aβ<sup>long</sup> decreasing wakefulness and increasing sleep. Additional control experiments ruled out experimental artefacts, as larvae undergoing no treatment, anesthesia only, mock injection, or PBS only injections had indistinguishable effects on sleep/wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–J</xref>). Next, we recalculated the behavioral analysis only for the evening period before lights off, when vehicle-injected larvae were statistically indistinguishable from larvae that had been acclimated to the tracking rig for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Except for an even more severe flooring effect in the Aβ<sup>short</sup> injection experiments, the results from evening-only analysis were indistinguishable from calculations across the whole day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>).

In addition, Aβ injected animals raised to adulthood showed no major differences in their general health or in their survival rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Moreover, injected animals recovered fully in the long term, returning to baseline sleep and activity levels within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Second, both Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected larvae responded normally to salient stimuli such as a light:dark pulse, demonstrating that these larvae were not paralyzed, in a coma, or undergoing sickness behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Finally, we considered if the changes in motility in Aβ-injected larvae were seizure-like behaviors. Wild type (WT) zebrafish larvae display ‘burst-and-glide’ movements characterized by single short forward or turn movement followed by a short pause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In contrast, epileptogenic drugs like the GABA-receptor antagonist PTZ induce electrophysiological and behavioral seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baraban et al., 2005</xref>), which are observed as dramatic rearrangements in zebrafish bout structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The bout structure of Aβ<sup>rev</sup>, Aβ<sup>short</sup>, and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected fish was highly similar to WT behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>), and the high-frequency bouts (HFB) indicative of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reichert et al., 2019</xref>) were only found in PTZ exposed fish but not Aβ injected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). Together these experiments indicate that exposure to Aβ modulates normal sleep/wake behavior without inducing toxic states.</p><p>We conclude that the changes in behavior after Aβ exposure are due to acute signalling events and therefore sought to identify the neuronal and molecular substrates through which Aβ signals to modulate sleep/wake behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> induce opposing changes in neuronal activity and differentially engage sleep-promoting neurons</title><p>If Aβ oligomers alter behavior through acute signaling in the brain, the differential effects of Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> should be reflected at the level of neuronal activity.

To test this, we co-injected Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> in a 1:1 ratio and compared the sleep phenotype to injection of either oligomer alone.

Our results show that, depending on its oligomeric form, Aβ can acutely increase or decrease sleep and wake behaviors and brain states through behaviorally relevant molecular targets and independently of neuronal cell death. The exogenous application of Aβ oligomers in our experiments limit the conclusions we can draw about endogenous functions of Aβ, which in vivo may present with different structure, local concentrations, and kinetics. However, the bi-directional Aβ modulation of sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) predicts that alterations to the relative concentrations of different Aβ oligomeric forms during healthy aging and AD disease progression will have opposing consequences on sleep and wake behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Distinct molecular pathways for Aβ sleep-wake regulation</title><p>We found that Aβ<sup>short</sup>-triggered wakefulness required intact Adrb2a and Pgrmc1, while Aβ<sup>long</sup>-induced sleep required functional Prp signalling. These data are consistent with a model in which Aβ directly binds to these targets to modulate downstream signaling cascades that ultimately affect neuronal circuits that regulate behavioral state. Our results match well with previous reports demonstrating binding preferences of Aβ dimers, trimers, and 56 kDa oligomers for different targets in vitro. For example, Aβ dimers, which have been detected in the brains of AD patients ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vázquez de la Torre et al., 2018</xref>), have been shown to directly bind human ADRB2 with high-affinity, causing increased calcium influx and neuronal hyper-activation in rat prefrontal cortical slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). PGRMC1 can be activated by AD brain extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Izzo et al., 2014b</xref>) and also has shown preferential binding for 50–75 kDa Aβ species in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izzo et al., 2014a</xref>). Both types of shorter Aβ species that bind to ADRB2 and PGRMC1 fall within the size ranges that induce Adrb2a- and Pgrmc1-dependent wakefulness in zebrafish larvae. Our results are also consistent with studies that have identified PrP as a direct binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurén et al., 2009</xref>) for longer Aβ-oligomers of 20–200 nm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicoll et al., 2013</xref>), the size range of our sleep-inducing Aβ<sup>long</sup> preparation. In neuronal culture and slice preparations, longer Aβ-oligomers trigger reduction of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurén et al., 2009</xref>) via a Prp signaling cascade through mGluR5 and Fyn kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Um et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, we found that pharmacological blockade of either the direct Aβ-Prp interaction (with Chicago Sky Blue 6B), mGluR5 signalling (with MPEP), Fyn kinase activity (with saracatinib), or by mutation of the Prp receptors prevented the widespread reduction of neuronal activity and increase in sleep that was induced by longer Aβ-oligomers.</p><p>Although triggering neuronal and behavioral changes through distinct molecular pathways, several aspects of Aβ’s effects on sleep-wake regulation remain to be elucidated. For example, the elimination of either Adrb2a or Pgrmc1 is sufficient to fully prevent Aβ<sup>short</sup>-induced wakefulness. This suggests that Adrb2a and Pgrmc1 function in the same molecular pathway, and signaling by Aβ on either alone is insufficient to modulate behavior. Not much is known about how these two receptors interact with one another, but at least one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roy et al., 2013</xref>) has suggested they can directly physically interact. Whether Aβ<sup>short</sup> binds both receptors to affect behavior or whether one receptor is an obligate component of the other’s ability to transmit Aβ signals is currently unclear. It also remains unclear if the Aβ<sup>short</sup>-Adrb2a/Pgrmc1 wake pathway and the Aβ<sup>long</sup>-Prp sleep pathway occur in the same or different sets of neurons to modulate behavior, as these receptors have widespread expression in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cotto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Málaga-Trillo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thisse and Thisse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), although our co-injection experiment suggests they act on parallel neuronal circuits. Numerous wake- and sleep-promoting neuronal populations that could serve as neuronal targets for these signalling cascades to drive changes in behavioral state have been uncovered in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow and Rihel, 2017</xref>). Future experiments will be needed to tease out the neuronal components involved, for example by replacing functional receptors into candidate neurons in otherwise mutant animals and rescuing the responses to Aβ, or by mutating receptors selectively in cell types with conditional genetics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Altered Aβ oligomeric ratio—implications for sleep in health and AD</title><p>Our model investigates alterations in sleep/wake behavior due to acute changes in exogenously delivered Aβ levels. Thus, it is possible that the sleep/wake effects observed in our study may be different from those observed when Aβ fluctuates over 24 hr or when it is chronically accumulating as in AD. However, our model predicts that alterations to the ratio of Aβ oligomeric forms present in the brain could have differential effects on sleep-wake regulation, as the balance between sleep- and wake- promoting Aβ signals is tilted to favour one pathway over the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Given the natural daily increase in Aβ secretion during wakefulness and increased levels of Aβ clearance during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), changes in extracellular Aβ levels could sculpt behavior over the normal 24 hr circadian cycle. As Aβ burden is acutely increased by sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018</xref>), perturbations to the normal sleep-wake cycle may feedback on behavior through altered Aβ signaling. Other phenomena have been reported to alter Aβ generation and fibrilization over short time-scales. For example, temperature changes in the physiological range (35–42°C) have been reported to significantly affect Aβ oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghavami et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that either the natural daily fluctuation in body temperature (in humans, up to 2°C) or the induction of a fever can promote changes in amyloidogenic Aβ generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szaruga et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, Aβ can act as an antimicrobial peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soscia et al., 2010</xref>), and microbial infection can trigger Aβ fibrilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eimer et al., 2018</xref>). Considering that infection and fever are also potent drivers of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imeri and Opp, 2009</xref>), the sleep-inducing Aβ-Prp signaling pathway we identified here could mediate recovery sleep during illness-- a hypothesis for future investigation.</p><p>On longer timescales, the amount and type of Aβ oligomeric species (including dimers, cross-linked dimers, trimers, and 56 kDa oligomers) found in healthy brains change across the human life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lesné et al., 2013</xref>) and are heterogeneous and elevated in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izzo et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kostylev et al., 2015</xref>). Although the precise makeup of Aβ species present in healthy and AD brains has remained difficult to quantify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benilova et al., 2012</xref>), some studies have indicated that short (dimers, trimers) Aβ oligomers are more enriched in the early, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages of AD, while longer oligomers predominate in the CSF at later clinical stages of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De et al., 2019</xref>).

One possibility consistent with our data is that sleep symptoms of both normal aging and AD may reflect changes in Aβ burden that lead to an altered balance in sleep- and wake-promoting signaling cascades. These signaling molecules might therefore be potential therapeutic targets for treating disrupted sleep early in AD progression, which may in turn slow disease progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>See the Key Resources Table (Appendix 1—key resources table) for details of reagents.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains and husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were raised under standard conditions at 28°C in a 14:10 light:dark cycle and all zebrafish experiments and husbandry followed standard protocols of the UCL Zebrafish Facility.

We estimate that 1 nl of a 10 nM Aβ injection into a ~ 3.01 (±0.16) x10<sup>8</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>(285–317 nL) 5dpf larva yields a final monomeric brain/CSF concentration of ~28–32 pM. The success of the injection was checked under a standard fluorescent scope by the presence of fluorescence in the heart of the animal. Larvae were transferred to fresh fish water for 20 min to recover from Tricaine and transferred to sleep/wake behavior box. For drug blocking experiments, zebrafish larvae were soaked into 3 nM Chicago Sky Blue 6B (Sigma), 5 μM MPEP (Cambridge Biosciences), or 300 nM Saracatinib (Generon) 1 day before the injections (from 4 to 5 dpf). Fluorescently tagged HiLyte Fluor 647-labeled Aβ42 (Eurogentech LTD) was injected at 10 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>Larval zebrafish behavioral experiments were performed and analysed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, 5 dpf larvae were transferred to 96 square-well plates and continuously illuminated with IR and white lights from 9 am to 11 pm in a Zebrabox (Viewpoint life sciences) for 24–48 hr. The movement of each larva was measured and duration of movement was recorded with an integration time of 10 s. Data were processed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>, and statistical tests were performed using MATLAΒ.

A template for in vitro transcription was generated by PCR using a reverse primer that contains a T7 promoter sequence 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG</named-content>-3’ from cDNA. A digoxygenin (DIG)-labelled antisense RNA probe was synthesized using the DIG labelling kit (Roche) and T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The probe was detected with anti-DIG-AP antibody (1:2,000, Roche) and nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate (BCIP) substrate (Roche) according to published protocols. To detect the differences in expression between the mutant backgrounds and WTs after Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injection, larvae were incubated and washed in the same tubes throughout the ISH procedure to avoid staining artefacts. To do this, larvae from different genotypes were marked by cutting the tail to allow identification after ISH. The brains were exposed by dissection, keeping the brain and spinal cord intact. Embryos were stored in 60% glycerol/PBS for imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Baseline c-fos ISH</title><p>Zebrafish larval siblings were kept in 14:10 day/night normal or reverse-cycle incubators. 50 larvae were collected at each time point (ZT1, ZT13, and ZT19) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight.

For dose response curves, a two-way ANOVA was performed to test the interaction effects between preparation type and dose. For return to baseline statistics, paired t-tests were performed.

affect sleep. While Alzheimer's Disease is linked to sleep disruption, the nature of the interaction is still unclear. Using a zebrafish model, the authors show that short and long amyloid oligomers interact with different binding partners to decrease or increase sleep respectively.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bi-directional modification of sleep and wake by amyloid beta oligomers&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Eisen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Erik Musiek (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found the manuscript of interest and considered it a potentially important conceptual advance. However, they had a few concerns, which would need to be addressed for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>The model is based on intracardiac injection of Aβ, so the phenotypes result from exogenous expression/overexpression. Given this, the authors should refrain from drawing conclusions about endogenous Aβ. At the same time, the manuscript would benefit from minimal characterization of the endogenous molecules. For instance, is there a rhythm of Aβ expression over the sleep:wake cycle?</p><p>The fish undergo anesthesia and heart perforation and are recorded a few hours later. What are the controls for handling, surgical stress, and confounds of prior anesthesia? On a related note, can the authors exclude toxicity, which could affect motion? They address this point by showing <italic>c-fos</italic> and ERK staining, but many different patterns are observed and none are compared to staining under baseline sleep:wake conditions. It is also disturbing that the <italic>c-fos</italic> expression is so widespread. The reversibility of the effect is important and the role of specific molecules is interesting, but these still do not demonstrate impact on wake or sleep regulation per se.</p><p>Given that AD brains likely have oligomers of all sizes, it would be good to know what happens when short and long oligomers are infused together.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>There is a growing appreciation about the fundamental bidirectional link between sleep and Alzheimer's disease. Here Rihel and colleagues use a zebrafish model coupled to the injection of amyloid beta oligomers (the initiating pathogenic species for AD) to examine the link between Aβ and sleep. They demonstrate that the length of the oligomers determines whether Aβ induces wake (short Aβ) or sleep (long Aβ), providing novel insights into the role of different forms on sleep/wake. Importantly, they extend their findings to reveal novel molecular insights into the mechanisms into how Aβ exerts these sleep/wake effects. Overall, the findings make an important advance that will be of interest to the broad <italic>eLife</italic> readership.</p><p>I have one significant concern relating to claims that these studies reveal novel functions for the endogenous Aβ. A key missing experiment in this regard is manipulation of the endogenous Aβ gene/protein (or even assessment of endogenous Ab) and thus it is unclear if exogenous (intracardiac) injection of Aβ faithfully reproduces how an endogenous neuronal pathway would deliver Aβ in terms of location, local concentrations and kinetics.</p><p>I think the findings are significant and important on their own without having to make this claim which in this case is highly speculative. I would suggest either addressing experimentally or rewording and de-emphasizing this point in the text to make clear the speculative possibilities. In any case, these shortcomings should be more forthrightly noted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The use of zebrafish to investigate the role of beta amyloid polymers on sleep/wake regulation is potentially interesting as AD patients suffer from insomnia. Here Ozcan and colleagues inject oligomers synthesized in vitro into the fish neonate hearts and fish motion was then recorded and used as a proxy for sleep and wake states. The authors found a correlation between the polymer length and the impact on fish motor and brain activity.</p><p>While the findings are potentially interesting, several points are unclear if concerning to the reviewer:</p><p>1) First, all the experiments and interpretations rely on overexpression of Aβ polymers, there is no description or investigation in this study of the normal baseline of Aβ accumulation in this species. One would expect to see such data in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for example. Is there in fish a night vs. day, sleep vs. night rhythm of Aβ accumulation/expression?</p><p>2) The fish undergo anesthesia and heart perforation and are recorded a few hours later. How do handling, surgical stress, and confounds of prior anesthesia can be eliminated from &quot;sleep-wake&quot; data interpretation?</p><p>3) It is hard for the reader to distinguish a specific effect on sleep/wake. Increased or decreased motion could be due to toxicity or specific stimulation of neuronal circuits due to non-physiological presence of exogenous oligomers. The authors try to tackle this issue with <italic>c-fos</italic> and ERK staining, but Figure 2 shows at least 6 different staining patterns, none of them compared to a sleep/wake baseline of staining. It is quite worrisome to see such a broad over expression of <italic>c-fos</italic> throughout the brain when Aβ is accumulated. Are the fish having a seizure?</p><p>Toxicity could lead to reduced motion and even if it's reversible it can still be transient toxicity until oligomers are washed out. Hyperactivity could be due to aspecific overstimulation of neurons as illustrated by <italic>c-fos</italic> and ERK staining.</p><p>4) Injections in mutant backgrounds indeed show some specificity in binding/interaction but still it does not demonstrate that the impact is on wake or sleep regulation per se. Again only motion or broad brain staining (at one time point…) are shown. An alternative interpretation is that adrb2a, pgrmc, prp1 can indeed bind Aβ but relay the toxic or aspecific impact of oligomers over expression in a brain that normally does not accumulate such molecules.</p><p>This study has the potential to be extremely interesting but many controls and demonstration of endogenous Aβ role on sleep-wake cycle are needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The authors report the use of a novel model of intracardiac infusion of Aβ peptides in zebrafish larvae to study the effects of Aβ on sleep and neuronal activity. They provide convincing data that preparations of shorter Aβ oligomers induce neuronal activity and decrease sleep, while longer oligomers suppress neuronal activity and decrease sleep. They then delete known Aβ receptor proteins, and show that the effects of Aβ-short can be block by deletion of Adrb2 and Pgrmc1, while the effects of Aβ-long are blocked by prion protein deletion, or specific drugs. This is a unique system and method for administering Aβ that is quite powerful, and the experiments are rigorous and generally use multiple converging approaches (for instance genetic+pharmacologic) to support their findings. The reversibility of the effect, as well as blockade with specific pharmacological agents suggests that these are not non-specific toxic events. The findings provide a framework with which to potentially test other neurodegenerative proteins (such as a-syn), and to inform similar studies in mammalian systems.</p><p>1) While the experiments are well performed and the data intrinsically consistent, the applicability to mammals (and humans) is a consideration. Infusion of Aβ into the heart of larvae is a highly artificial system, and events that occur during sudden changes in Aβ levels may be different that those observed when Aβ is chronically present (as in AD). For example, infusion of Aβ peptide into the brain of mice or rats can induce acute, local neurodegeneration that is not observed in APP transgenic mice with chronically elevated Aβ levels. This is a fundamental shortcoming of the model, and there is little that can be done to address it, but it should be perhaps mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The implications of this bidirectional effect of short and long oligomers for sleep phenotypes in AD are also a bit unclear, as oligomers of all sizes are likely present in AD brain (though perhaps in different ratios as the disease progresses). It would be helpful to determine which pathway is dominant when both short and long oligomers are infused together, perhaps in different ratios. This is the only experiment I would request.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53995.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers found the manuscript of interest and considered it a potentially important conceptual advance.

For instance, is there a rhythm of Aβ expression over the sleep:wake cycle?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is extremely difficult to address in zebrafish currently. To our knowledge, a daily rhythm of Aβ has only been detected in measurement of the ISF/CSF (Holth et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2012), but this rhythm is not detected in whole tissue homogenates in mammals e.g.(Kang et al., 2009). Since the total CSF in one zebrafish larval brain is only ~6.5 nl (Fame et al., 2016), and typical experiments can only remove 1-2 nl of fluid per animal, it was not feasible to extract CSF from 900-5000 larvae to obtain ~5 μl of CSF for a single timepoint analysis, let alone the numbers that would be needed across 24hr. We therefore attempted to detect Aβ using whole tissue homogenates, but the sensitivity even for this method was not sufficient for us to detect Aβ in fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Potentially higher sensitivity kits were to be tried, but the global pandemic prevented those from being delivered before we were ordered shut.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A Western blot against Aβ42 is unable to detect a band in homogenates from 35-50 zebrafish larvae or from an adult brain.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53995-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fish undergo anesthesia and heart perforation and are recorded a few hours later. What are the controls for handling, surgical stress, and confounds of prior anesthesia?</p></disp-quote><p>We address this with further experiments, but first wish to communicate that from our perspective the controls for these elements were already a strength of the original submission.</p><p>To control for the effects of both experimental handling artefacts and exogenous protein confounds, we have included in every experiment a reverse Aβ peptide control that is injected into sibling larvae at the same time as the experimental oligomers, under the same handling and surgical stress and injected at the same concentrations to account for generalized response to proteins, and then tracked the reverse peptide injected and oligomer injected larvae side by side in the same video tracking set-up. Thus, the only difference between the controls and experiments shown in every panel is the inclusion Aβ oligomers vs. a control peptide.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have added additional experiments with anaesthesia only, mounting only and injection only controls (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1H-I). Our results demonstrate that the initial placement of fish into behavior boxes at the beginning of the video-tracking is responsible for differences between our experimental setup and other tracking experiments (e.g. Figure 1—figure supplement 1J-K) and is not due to heart-injection, anaesthesia, or mounting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, can the authors exclude toxicity, which could affect motion?

The reversibility of the effect is important and the role of specific molecules is interesting, but these still do not demonstrate impact on wake or sleep regulation per se.</p></disp-quote><p>To exclude toxicity and to demonstrate the effect of Aβ is on bona-fide sleep and wake, we made 4 new experiments. First, we now compare the <italic>c-fos</italic> patterns induced by oligomers to untreated larvae across the sleep:wake cycle and show that the <italic>c-fos</italic> expression pattern of baseline sleep-wake states match the Aβ induced sleep-wake states closely (Figure 2A-C). Second, we show that Aβ engage <italic>galanin</italic> positive neurons, a known key sleep regulator in fish and humans (Reichert et al., 2019) in a manner consistent with inducing normal sleep and wake states (Figure 2F). Third, we show the bout structures of injected fish are indistinguishable from WT fish and are clearly distinct from seizures (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D-E and Figure 1—video 1). Finally, we show that injected fish respond to acute stimuli the same way as their WT siblings, showing they have rapid state reversibility (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C). All of the new 4 experiments support our interpretation that Aβ-induced behavioral states are bona fide sleep/wake states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that AD brains likely have oligomers of all sizes, it would be good to know what happens when short and long oligomers are infused together.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this experiment to Figure 6F. Because short and long oligomers are additive, we conclude that not only do they act on different receptor molecules but also likely act on separate signalling pathways/neurons (e.g. instead of in series with each other) to affect sleep. We have added some discussion about this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>[…] I have one significant concern relating to claims that these studies reveal novel functions for the endogenous Aβ.

For example, genetic manipulation of APP, either through mutation or overexpression of multiple, mutated copies as is done in mouse AD research, will also affect the formation of other APP cleavage products, many of which are known to regulate biological processes, and these effects will accumulate over time, with little to no temporal control over the process. This consideration dictated our methodological choice from the start, and we built in several controls to ensure that the delivery of Aβ would be at very low concentrations and not would damage the brain (heart injections).</p><p>However, the reviewer raises a critical point about the characterization of endogenous Aβ in zebrafish. To address the point experimentally, we tested three different antibodies to detect endogenous levels of Aβ in zebrafish. We were able to detect very faint bands with the commonly used 4G8 -Aβ antibody (4G8 maps to residues 18–23, conserved between zebrafish Appa and human amyloid beta). However, the sensitivity was not enough to reliably detect endogenous Aβ in either larval or adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We then ordered a high sensitivity immunoassay kit (V-PLEX Plus Aβ42 Peptide (4G8), which has a dynamic range of 0.516-1271 pg/mL. However, we did not receive it and could not continue our experiments due to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p>This outcome is consistent with the zebrafish literature. There are many papers using zebrafish for AD research; however, there are no reports of detection of endogenous amyloid beta in larval zebrafish. One paper claims to measure endogenous Aβ levels in larval zebrafish using Westerns (Nery et al., 2017), but bands under 20 kDa are not labelled with a protein ladder making it unclear whether these really correspond to the Aβ band at 4 kDa (or dimers and trimers at ~8 and ~12 kDa or some other species). Wilson and Lardelli developed an assay to measure y-secretase activity in zebrafish but used an artificially modified form of App instead of the endogenous zebrafish App (Wilson and Lardelli, 2013). One study of brain-wide proteomic changes in <italic>bace-1</italic> mutant vs. wild type zebrafish found that zebrafish Appa and Appb proteins accumulate to higher levels in the <italic>bace-1</italic> mutants, suggesting that App processing in the zebrafish is conserved (Hogl et al., 2013). Thus, we believe that detection of zebrafish Aβ is not due to a difference of App processing between species but rather due to the lack of sensitivity of the antibodies.</p><p>Although a precise quantification of Aβ in the zebrafish brain remains elusive, the Hogl et al., 2013, proteomics analysis does allow for an estimate of zebrafish Appa and Appb protein levels, as well as the amount they are processed by Bace-1. Benchmarking their reported intensity‐Based Absolute Quantification (iBAQ), which scales proportionally to Molar concentration, for Appa and Appb against one of the most abundant fish brain proteins, Ependymin (estimated at 16 mM in fish ECF), allows for a rough estimate of protein concentration. We estimate from this that Appa is present at 1.7µM and Appb at 3.2µM. Since <italic>bace-1</italic> mutants accumulate 2-fold more Appa and 3-fold more Appb, this suggests that 50-66% of all zebrafish App is processed by <italic>bace-1</italic>. Thus, our estimate of 30-300 pM for the oligomer injections is 4-5 orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations of App, consistent with our other estimates. We recognize that this is only an indirect estimate and does not replace the need for measuring endogenous levels of Aβ and its oligomers at various sites in the zebrafish brain. We do believe it reinforces our contention that the concentrations we have injected are very low and reasonable, especially when compared to other typical in vivo and in vitro studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the findings are significant and important on their own without having to make this claim which in this case is highly speculative. I would suggest either addressing experimentally or rewording and de-emphasizing this point in the text to make clear the speculative possibilities. In any case, these shortcomings should be more forthrightly noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our findings are important without having to make a strong claim about endogenous processes. We have therefore followed the advice of reviewer 1 and modified our text to tone down the claim that injection of Aβ would reveal endogenous functions of Aβ. Specifically, we changed the following in the text:</p><p>The Summary now reads: “Our data indicate that Aβ can trigger a bi-directional sleep/wake switch”</p><p>The Introduction now reads: “the various biological effects of Aβ – in health or disease – remain obscure.”</p><p>The Introduction now reads: “Aβ may directly modulate sleep-regulatory pathways”</p><p>The Introduction now reads: “Isolating the specific biological effects of Aβ has been experimentally difficult.”</p><p>The Discussion now reads: “Although the exogenous application of Aβ oligomers in our experiments limit the conclusions we can draw about endogenous functions of Aβ, which in vivo may present with different structure, local concentrations, and kinetics, our bi-directional Aβ modulation of sleep and wakefulness (Figure 6G) predicts that alterations to the relative concentrations of different Aβ oligomeric forms during healthy aging and AD disease progression may have opposing consequences on sleep and wake behavior.”</p><p>Finally, we have added the following sentence to the Discussion: “Our model investigates alterations in sleep/wake behavior due to acute changes in exogenously delivered Aβ levels. Thus, it is possible that the sleep/wake effects observed in our study may be different than those observed when Aβ fluctuates over 24hr or when it is chronically accumulating as in AD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>The use of zebrafish to investigate the role of beta amyloid polymers on sleep/wake regulation is potentially interesting as AD patients suffer from insomnia.

The authors found a correlation between the polymer length and the impact on fish motor and brain activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for finding our work potentially interesting. For clarity, we would like to highlight some points about measuring sleep and wake states in zebrafish. While fish motion is indeed recorded as a proxy for sleep and wake states, it is well established that inactive bouts in larval fish lasting longer than 1 minute have all of the behavioral criteria for being bona fide sleep, including circadian and homeostatic regulation, characteristic sleep postures, and changes in arousal thresholds in response to stimuli across multiple modalities (Barlow and Rihel, 2017; Prober et al., 2006; Rihel et al., 2010; Zhdanova et al., 2001). Importantly, these bouts are regulated by pharmacology, genes, and neural circuits that are conserved from human to fish (Berridge et al., 2012; Carter et al., 2012; Prober et al., 2006; Zhdanova et al., 2001). We would also like to stress that waking activity (during active bouts, how active is a larva—e.g. taking a stroll or running sprints) is experimentally separable from sleep duration (e.g. see (Rihel et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the findings are potentially interesting, several points are unclear if concerning to the reviewer:</p><p>1) First, all the experiments and interpretations rely on overexpression of Aβ polymers, there is no description or investigation in this study of the normal baseline of Aβ accumulation in this species. One would expect to see such data in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for example. Is there in fish a night vs. day, sleep vs. night rhythm of Aβ accumulation/expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to reviewer 1 about the challenges we faced to quantify the level of Aβ in zebrafish. However, even if we were successful in detecting Aβ, it would have been extremely difficult to detect a sleep/wake rhythm of Aβ in zebrafish. To our knowledge, a daily rhythm of Aβ has only been detected in measurement of the ISF/CSF (Holth et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2012), but this rhythm is not detected in whole tissue homogenates in mammals (e.g.(Kang et al., 2009)). Since the total CSF in one zebrafish larval brain is only ~6.5 nl (Fame et al., 2016), and typical experiments can only remove 1-2 nl of fluid per animal, it was not feasible to extract CSF from 900-5000 larvae to obtain ~5 μl of CSF for a single timepoint analysis, let alone the numbers that would be needed across 24hr.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The fish undergo anesthesia and heart perforation and are recorded a few hours later. How do handling, surgical stress, and confounds of prior anesthesia can be eliminated from &quot;sleep-wake&quot; data interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>To control for the effects of both experimental handling artefacts and exogenous protein confounds, we have included in every experiment a reverse Aβ peptide control that was treated prior to injection the same as the Aβ oligomers, then injected into sibling larvae at the same time as the experimental oligomers, under the same handling and surgical stress, and tracked the reverse peptide injected and oligomer injected larvae side by side in the same boxes. To be clear, in every figure, we display a matching set of reverse peptide controls for comparison. Thus, while we cannot rule out synergistic effects between the Aβ oligomers and stress/anesthesia, the effects we describe must be due to the Aβ oligomer type, because this is the only variable that is different from the controls.</p><p>Nevertheless, we wanted to know how our handling was affecting the initial behavior. In the original manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1J), we demonstrated that there is a handling effect that lasts for several hours after injection, as seen by comparing PBS injected larvae to larvae placed in the boxes on a prior day. However, we found that our experimental results are unchanged if we omit or include these first 5 hours in our analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 1K).</p><p>To further dissect the effects of anaesthesia, mounting/unmounting, and injecting into the heart, we have added additional experiments (anaesthesia only; mounting only; injection only) to the figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1H-I). Since each of these produce a similar subsequent behavioral effect that is statistically indistinguishable from each other, we conclude the effects on behavior is due to initial placement of larvae into tracking systems at the beginning of the video-tracking and not the heart-injection, anaesthesia, or mounting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is hard for the reader to distinguish a specific effect on sleep/wake. Increased or decreased motion could be due to toxicity or specific stimulation of neuronal circuits due to non-physiological presence of exogenous oligomers. The authors try to tackle this issue with c-fos and ERK staining, but Figure 2 shows at least 6 different staining patterns, none of them compared to a sleep/wake baseline of staining. It is quite worrisome to see such a broad over expression of c-fos throughout the brain when Aβ is accumulated. Are the fish having a seizure?</p><p>Toxicity could lead to reduced motion and even if it's reversible it can still be transient toxicity until oligomers are washed out. Hyperactivity could be due to aspecific overstimulation of neurons as illustrated by c-fos and ERK staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising important points. We now show by 4 new experiments that sleep/wake states induced by Aβ are indeed specific, acutely reversible (e.g. not paralysis/coma) and engage endogenous sleep-wake active neurons and peptides.</p><p>A) The reviewer points out that the <italic>c-fos</italic> patterns induced by various Aβ oligomers were not compared to baseline staining during sleep/wake states, making their interpretation more difficult. We now provide <italic>c-fos</italic> staining for larvae just after light ON (ZT1, or 10am, when they are maximally awake), ZT13, when they are awake an hour before lights OFF, and in the middle of the night (ZT 19, or 4am), when larvae are mostly asleep. This data demonstrates that the Aβ<sup>short</sup> injected fish brain activity pattern is highly similar to the day (baseline awake) samples collected at ZT1 (Figure 2A, C). Although <italic>c-fos</italic> is upregulated in many regions, including the posterior hypothalamus and the dorsal and ventral telencephalon, these areas are also upregulated in the awake larvae at ZT1. We now point to 9 discrete populations that are <italic>c-fos</italic> positive in both sets. This is different to the massive, non-specific upregulation of <italic>c-fos</italic> seen in seizures (Baraban et al., 2005; Reichert et al., 2019). Similarly, <italic>c-fos</italic> expression following Aβ<sup>long</sup> injections, which was globally dampened relative to Aβ<sup>rev</sup>, is consistently low, similar to the low level of <italic>c-fos</italic> observed in ZT19 sleeping brains.</p><p>B) The reviewer asks whether Aβ injected fish have seizures. Seizures in zebrafish can be induced with the epileptogenic drug, PTZ, and are readily detected in larval zebrafish from behavioral analysis (Baraban et al., 2005). WT fish display characteristic “burst-and-glide” swimming movements that are characterized by a short single forward or turning movement followed by a short pause. This bout structure is not detected in animals having seizures, which have uncoordinated bout structures. We now provide tracking data and representative videos for Aβ<sup>rev</sup>, Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected fish, which all have similar bout structures to uninjected wild type larvae (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, and Figure 1—video 1). They do not display bouts that resemble seizures (compare to the PTZ treated larvae in Figure 1—figure supplement 3D). Following the analysis of Reichert et al., 2019, we quantified seizure behavior as the presence of high frequency bouts (HFB), which are present in 10 mM PTZ exposed larvae but not untreated larvae, and found that HFBs are not detected in Aβ injected fish, as in uninjected controls (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E).</p><p>C) The reviewer suggests that reduced motion seen after injecting Aβ long could reflect toxicity. To test this, we asked whether the inactive states of these larvae were acutely reversible to the same degree as wild type larvae. Larvae in natural sleep states can be aroused into wakefulness by strong salient stimuli, such as a sudden switch in lighting (Prober et al., 2006). Conversely, animals that are paralyzed, in a coma, or displaying sickness behavior (e.g. various toxic effects) do not easily reverse into waking states. We tested this by using 10 min-dark pulses which induces a characteristic response in WT larvae-- rapidly heightened activity when the lights turn off and reversal to baseline activity when the lights turn on. We observe that Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected fish show a response indistinguishable from WT siblings (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C), indicating that they have not lost their ability to respond to salient stimuli as might be expected from a state of generalized toxicity.</p><p>D) If the behavioral states induced by Aβ are indeed real sleep/wake states, oligomers should engage known sleep/wake regulatory pathways. Galanin-expressing neurons are active and <italic>galanin</italic> expression is increased during sleep in larval zebrafish (Reichert et al., 2019). Thus, we tested whether Aβ injections alter the number of strongly <italic>galanin</italic> expressing neurons in the hypothalamus, which correlates with sleep state (Reichert et al., 2019). We did in situ hybridization (ISH) for <italic>galanin</italic> 4-6 hours post-injection. All staining steps for different groups was done in the same tube to eliminate variations in ISH procedure, and subsequent neuron counts were done blindly. Consistent with Aβ<sup>long</sup> inducing sleep and Aβ<sup>short</sup> inducing wakefulness, we observed a slight decrease (-6%) in hypothalamic <italic>galanin</italic> cell number in Aβ<sup>short</sup> injected fish and a slight increase (+12%) in Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected animals compared to Aβ<sup>rev</sup> injected fish (Figure 2F-G). From blinded counts, <italic>galanin</italic> cell numbers between Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected fish were significantly different from each other (p&lt;0.01, Kruskal-Wallis). We have included represented images and analysis of these <italic>galanin</italic> changes in Figure 2F-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Injections in mutant backgrounds indeed show some specificity in binding/interaction but still it does not demonstrate that the impact is on wake or sleep regulation per se. Again only motion or broad brain staining (at one time point…) are shown. An alternative interpretation is that adrb2a, pgrmc, prp1 can indeed bind Aβ but relay the toxic or aspecific impact of oligomers over expression in a brain that normally does not accumulate such molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our points addressing comment 3 that detail our attempts to demonstrate the impact on sleep/wake regulation per se, especially the induction of wild type sleep/wake <italic>c-fos</italic> patterns and effects on sleep circuits like <italic>galanin.</italic> The <italic>c-fos</italic> patterns induced by oligomers is similar to changes in WT <italic>c-fos</italic> patterns over 24 hours, which is consistent with an interpretation that oligomers induce normal brain state changes. Additionally, Aβ<sup>long</sup> engages known sleep-regulatory pathways such as <italic>galanin</italic>, and <italic>galanin</italic> expression is reduced in Aβ<sup>short</sup> injected animals, which is also consistent with these changes being sleep/wake states. Together, these observations suggest that the induced states are not general toxicity but rather acute signalling events.</p><p>However, we take the point that it is difficult to completely rule out “toxicity” – for example even engagement of sleep circuits could be due to these circuits being the site of “toxic” effects. Even so, given the changes in Aβ composition in Alzheimer’s Disease patients, the demonstration of acute effects on sleep-regulating circuits should still be of wide interest.</p><p>We have added some more caveats to our interpretation to the Discussion section. Specifically, we added: “Although the exogenous application of Aβ oligomers in our experiments limit the conclusions we can draw about endogenous functions of Aβ, which in vivo may present with different structure, local concentrations, and kinetics, our bi-directional Aβ modulation of sleep and wakefulness (Figure 6G) predicts that alterations to the relative concentrations of different Aβ oligomeric forms during healthy aging and AD disease progression may have opposing consequences on sleep and wake behavior.” and “Our model investigates alterations in sleep/wake behavior due to acute changes in exogenously delivered Aβ levels. Thus, it is possible that the sleep/wake effects observed in our study may be different than those observed when Aβ fluctuates over 24hr or when it is chronically present as in AD”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study has the potential to be extremely interesting but many controls and demonstration of endogenous Aβ role on sleep-wake cycle are needed.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>[…] 1) While the experiments are well performed and the data intrinsically consistent, the applicability to mammals (and humans) is a consideration. Infusion of Aβ into the heart of larvae is a highly artificial system, and events that occur during sudden changes in Aβ levels may be different that those observed when Aβ is chronically present (as in AD). For example, infusion of Aβ peptide into the brain of mice or rats can induce acute, local neurodegeneration that is not observed in APP transgenic mice with chronically elevated Aβ levels. This is a fundamental shortcoming of the model, and there is little that can be done to address it, but it should be perhaps mentioned in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that we cannot detect any increase in neurodegeneration in our study (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), unlike the examples mentioned from injections in the brain of mice and rats. However, we agree our method has shortcomings relative to endogenous manipulations. We have made many changes to the text to make this shortcoming clearer. Please see responses to reviewer 1 and 2 for detailed examples of these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The implications of this bidirectional effect of short and long oligomers for sleep phenotypes in AD are also a bit unclear, as oligomers of all sizes are likely present in AD brain (though perhaps in different ratios as the disease progresses). It would be helpful to determine which pathway is dominant when both short and long oligomers are infused together, perhaps in different ratios. This is the only experiment I would request.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion for this experiment, which we believe also provides insight into whether the Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> are signalling onto the same or distinct neuronal circuit pathways or signalling cascades. To address which molecular pathway dominates if both short and long oligomers are present, we injected Aβ<sup>rev</sup>, Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> alone or the short and long oligomers mixed in a one to one ratio (Aβ<sup>mix</sup>). Confirming our previous results, the short and long oligomers gave opposite sleep phenotypes (p&lt;0.01, Kruskall-Wallis) in 4 new independent experiments. The sleep-wake phenotype of the Aβ<sup>mix</sup> lies between the Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> injected animals (Figure 6F), consistent with an additive effect of the two oligomers. This suggests that the long and short oligomers affect independent neuronal pathways/signalling cascades in addition to acting through distinct receptors (Adrb2a/Pgrmc1 vs. Prp). Future experiments will be needed to map the specific circuits involved, for example by testing whether systematic replacement of the receptors into subsets of neuronal circuits on mutant backgrounds can rescue the effects of Aβ oligomers.</p><p>We have added the following lines to describe this new data: “Co-injection of both Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> resulted in an intermediate phenotype that is indistinguishable from control injections of Aβ<sup>rev</sup> (Figure 6F), suggesting that the effects of Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> are additive and likely act through distinct neuronal circuits or signalling cascades to modulate sleep. Considering this result together with the genetic and pharmacological data, we propose a bi-directional model of Aβ sleep regulation in which Aβ<sup>short</sup> and Aβ<sup>long</sup> act through distinct receptors and neuronal pathways to independently modulate behavioral state (Figure 6G).”</p><p>References:</p><p>Berridge, C.W., Schmeichel, B.E., Espana, R.A., 2012.
