inject effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells, a process called type III secretion. Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> injectisomes in situ and the first structural analysis of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisome. Unexpectedly, basal bodies of injectisomes inside the bacterial cells showed length variations of 20%. The in situ structures of the <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>S. flexneri</italic> injectisomes had similar dimensions and were significantly longer than the isolated structures of related injectisomes. The crystal structure of the inner membrane injectisome component YscD appeared elongated compared to a homologous protein, and molecular dynamics simulations documented its elongation elasticity. The ring-shaped secretin YscC at the outer membrane was stretched by 30–40% in situ, compared to its isolated liposome-embedded conformation. We suggest that elasticity is critical for some two-membrane spanning protein complexes to cope with variations in the intermembrane distance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00792.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00792.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00792.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other animals can use the five senses—touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing—to interpret the world around them. Single-celled organisms, however, must rely on molecular cues to understand their immediate surroundings. In particular, bacteria gather information about external conditions, including potential hosts nearby, by secreting protein sensors that can relay messages back to the cell.</p><p>Bacteria export these sensors via secretion systems that enable the organism both to receive information about the environment and to invade a host cell. A total of seven separate secretion systems, known as types I–VII, have been identified. These different secretion systems handle distinct cargoes, allowing the bacterial cell to respond to a range of feedback from the external milieu.</p><p>The type III secretion system, also known as the ‘injectisome’, is found in bacterial species that are enclosed by two membranes separated by a periplasmic space. The injectisome comprises different components that combine to form the basal body, which spans the inner and outer membranes, and a projection from the basal body, called the hollow needle, that mediates the export of cargo from a bacterium to its host or the local environment.</p><p>The distance between the inner and outer membranes may vary across species or according to environmental conditions, so the basal body must be able to accommodate these changes. However, no mechanism has yet been established that might introduce such elasticity into the injectisome. Now, Kudryashev et al. have generated three-dimensional structures for the injectisomes of two species of bacteria, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, and shown that the size of the basal body can fluctuate by up to 20%.</p><p>Kudryashev et al. imaged whole injectisomes in these two species and found that the height of the basal body was proportional to the distance between the inner and outer membranes. To probe how this could occur, the properties of two proteins that are important components of the basal body were studied in greater detail. YscD, a protein that extends across the periplasmic space, was crystallized and its structure was then determined and used to develop a computer model to assess its compressibility: this model indicated that YscD could stretch or contract by up to 50% of its total length. The outer membrane component YscC also appeared elastic: when the protein was isolated and introduced into synthetic membranes, its length was reduced 30–40% relative to that observed in intact bacterial membranes.</p><p>A further experiment confirmed the adaptability of the basal body: when the separation of the membranes was deliberately increased by placing bacteria in a high-salt medium, the basal body extended approximately 10% in length. Cumulatively, therefore, these experiments suggest that the in-built flexibility of the basal body of the injectisome allows bacteria to adjust to environmental changes while maintaining their sensory abilities and host-invasion potential.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterial type III secretion apparatus, the injectisome, is a complex nanomachine that allows Gram-negative bacteria to export effector proteins in one step across the two bacterial membranes and an eukaryotic cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornelis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Galan and Wolf-Watz, 2006</xref>). The assembly of the injectisome involves some 34 different proteins. Many of these proteins form the structure, while others act as ancillary components driving the assembly process. Phylogenic analyses based on the most conserved proteins classify injectisomes into seven different families (Ysc, Ssa-Esc, Inv-Mxi-Spa, Hrc1, Hrc2, Rhizobiales, and Chlamydiales) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Troisfontaines and Cornelis, 2005</xref>). The injectisome consists of three parts: a ∼60 nm long, hollow needle protruding from the bacterial surface, a basal body that spans the two bacterial membranes and the periplasm, and a cytoplasmic part. Recent atomic models allowed a mechanistic understanding of the needle structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loquet et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The basal body of the <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium SPI-I and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> injectisomes have been purified and structurally analyzed in great detail. The basal body presents a barrel-shaped structure at the outer membrane (OM), with double ring-shaped densities underneath in the periplasmic space and the inner membrane (IM). These rings are formed by three multimeric proteins (YscC,D,J in <italic>Yersinia spp</italic>; InvG, PrgH,K in <italic>Salmonella</italic> SPI-1; MxiD,J,G in <italic>S. flexneri</italic>). The barrel-shaped structure spanning the OM and protruding into the periplasm consists of a 12–15 mer of a protein from the secretin family (YscC, InvG, MxiD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burghout et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marlovits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hodgkinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011</xref>). The lower double-ring reaching into the IM is made of a lipoprotein (YscJ, PrgK, MxiJ) proposed to form a 24-subunit ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimbrough and Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crepin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yip et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Silva-Herzog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hodgkinson et al., 2009</xref>) and a protein that is not so conserved as the others, but shares a similar modular domain architecture and acts as a connector between the secretin and the IM (YscD, PrgH, MxiG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diepold et al., 2010</xref>). The injectisome is evolutionarily related to the bacterial flagellar motor system, with which it shares the basic type III secretion export apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornelis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Minamino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erhardt et al., 2010</xref>). This allows parallels to be drawn for the cytoplasmic elements of the injectisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornelis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swietnicki et al., 2011</xref>). The recent crystal structure of the C-terminus of the export gate of the cytoplasmic export apparatus MxiA from <italic>S. flexneri</italic> revealed a ring arrangement and allowed a mechanistic insight into secretion control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrusci et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>S. flexneri</italic> injectisomes in their native environment, that is, in the membrane of the intact bacterium.

The 2.7 Å resolution structure of YscD<sup>150–362</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) showed three linearly arranged domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each domain comprises an αββαβ-ring building motif, which superposes well with corresponding motifs in the three domains of the homologous PrgH from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). However, although sharing the same multi-domain architecture, YscD features an extended conformation, while the domains of PrgH are in a more compact arrangement. The YscD structure points to a high inter-domain flexibility, as already indicated by the high B-factor values of the third domain of <italic>wt</italic> YscD<sup>150–362</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the connecting hinge (residues A282-N284) between the second and third periplasmic domains is mainly responsible for the high flexibility of YscD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). Based on this observation, we engineered a point mutation (G283P) at the hinge region, in order to stabilize YscD in a less flexible conformation. Mutation of G283 to a proline resulted in a protein that was still functional for type III secretion in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of YscD<sup>150–347</sup> G283P had a slightly more bent conformation in the hinge region, but otherwise showed the same extended domain organization as YscD<sup>150–362</sup><italic>wt</italic>: the first two domains superpose well with the <italic>wt</italic> structure, while the third domain is tilted by ∼9° with respect to the first two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Moreover, the application of stretching forces in MD produced an almost barrier-free transition from the compact to the extended conformation, resulting in a domain arrangement similar to that observed by X-ray crystallography. After this point the forces start to increase due to partial unfolding of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Due to this tertiary structure elasticity, that is, the rearrangement of tertiary structure in response to mechanical force, the periplasmic domains of YscD can undergo a maximal elongation of about 3.5 nm (i.e., a 50% elongation compared to the compact conformation), while opposing the stretching with a force as small as 35 ± 15 pN per YscD monomer, a value that is comparable with that estimated for other highly stretchable multi-domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsin and Schulten, 2011</xref>). This suggests that the tertiary structural elasticity of the ring components of the periplasmic portion of YscD significantly contributes to the overall elasticity of the basal body of the injectisome in response to external forces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural model of the elongated YscDJ inner ring of the basal body</title><p>We constructed a pseudo-atomic model of the inner membrane part of the basal body by combining experimental data with molecular modeling and simulations, similar as to exercised previously to unveil the architecture of large macromolecular complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lasker et al., 2012</xref>).

For this, we employed spatial restraints from the in situ cryo-ET map, cross-linking data from the PrgH/PrgK homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanowar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schraidt et al., 2010</xref>), homology models of YscJ based on EscJ, and the conformational ensemble defined by MD simulations of YscD. YscD model structure also includes the transmembrane (TM) domain and the N-terminal cytosolic part of YscD. It does not include the last 70 amino acids of YscD, which interact with the secretin YscC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schraidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ross and Plano, 2011</xref>), as structural information is lacking. In particular, the TM domain of YscD was modeled as an α-helix and equilibrated in a membrane bilayer using MD; it connects the two ring densities of YscD on both sides of the IM without any structural strain. The cytosolic domain of the YscD was modeled on the basis of the X-ray structure of the <italic>Y. pestis</italic> homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lountos et al., 2012</xref>), and arranged in a regular ring conformation fitting the electron density observed in the cytoplasmic injectisome regions underneath the IM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The cryo-ET map did not allow a direct density fit in the radial direction, due to the limited resolution of the map; the density corresponding to YscJ was smeared. However, the map revealed the height of the periplasmic domains of YscD and provided a hint for the radius or the ring and thus multimerization state of YscDJ. The assembly of the YscDJ ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) revealed that only an elongated arrangement of the C-terminal periplasmic domain of YscD—similar to the X-ray structure—best fits the in situ cryo-ET map, extending up towards the position of the secretin ring. Due to the lack of structural information for the last 70 amino acids of YscD, our model did not include this region, which is responsible for connecting to the secretin YscC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schraidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ross and Plano, 2011</xref>). Most of the YscD/YscJ interactions occur between the first periplasmic domain of YscD and the C-terminal domain of YscJ.

A higher-resolution structure of the YscC–YscD interaction would be needed to determine the exact dimensions.

Despite an observed length variation among <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisomes, sub-tomogram averaging allowed reconstructing the needle systems at a resolution of 4 nm, using minicells and applying focal pair tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kudryashev et al., 2012b</xref>), automated tomogram acquisition, and sub-volume alignment and classification in <italic>Dynamo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castano-Diez et al., 2012</xref>). The in situ reconstructions of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisomes show high overall similarity considering the lower resolution of the <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisome: the overall dimensions, ring hierarchy and the peptidoglycan attachment location are conserved. We could detect a significant difference in the location of the torus ring assigned to the N-terminus or YscV/MxiA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrusci et al., 2013</xref>). In the <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisome, it was ∼5 nm below the membrane, while in the <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisome it was ∼10 nm below the membrane. In the flagellar motor system the distance between the torus and the membrane is also ∼10 nm (measured from Figure 5B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrusci et al. [2013]</xref>, all distances were measured between centers of mass in the EM densities). This difference likely cannot be explained by sequence differences between YscV and MxiA, which are highly homologous (ClustalW similarity score 40). Further experiments or higher resolution structures in situ may give insights into these differences. The distance between the export gate and the ATPases were 11–13 nm for all three assemblies.</p><p>Injectisomes contain proteins homologous to FliN and FliM, termed YscQ in <italic>Yersinia</italic> and Spa33 in <italic>Shigella</italic>, which are suggested to form a C-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morita-Ishihara et al., 2006</xref>) similar to bacterial flagellar motors. However, the in situ reconstructions of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisomes did not reveal obvious C-rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This could be caused by YscQ being unstructured, or being only transiently associated with the injectisome. Further investigations are required to address this question.</p><p><italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisomes were found to vary in length by 20% inside the bacterial cells (an intermembrane distance between 30 and 36 nm). Most injectisomes seemed intact; nevertheless, we cannot exclude that under a certain osmotic pressure the injectisomes may detach from the outer membrane. Biophysical experiments would be required to understand, to which limits the basal body may stretch. In addition to the observed length variations, the injectisome’s basal bodies were longer in the native context than suggested from single particle structures: the <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisome in situ appeared about 10 nm or ∼40% longer (32 nm vs 22 nm at the membrane level). Dimensions of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisome in situ are similar to those of the <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisome. The elongation of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisome’s basal body seems anisotropic with higher contribution from the secretin YscC, based on cryo-ET studies of isolated and membrane-reconstituted YscC. Stretching of YscC by an estimated 5 nm and an elongation of YscD by an estimated 3.5 nm would explain an ∼8.5 nm overall extension of the <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisome’s basal body; the remaining 1.5 nm towards the observed 10 nm elongation of the <italic>Shigella</italic> system may be attributed to inter-species differences, or the limited resolution of the maps. High resolution structures are available for the periplasmic domains of PrgH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>), YscD (this work), EscJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crepin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yip et al., 2005</xref>) and secretin EscC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spreter et al., 2009</xref>). A higher-resolution structure of the membrane domains of the secretins in combination with further molecular simulations may allow a full mechanical understanding of the observed elasticity of the basal body.</p><p>We further compared the in situ structure of the <italic>S. flexneri</italic> injectisome with the available cryo-EM reconstructions of the isolated <italic>S. flexneri</italic> (EMD-1617) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hodgkinson et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> SPI-1 injectisomes (EMD-1871) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schraidt and Marlovits, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The lengths and lateral diameters of the in situ injectisomes from <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>S. flexneri</italic> are similar, while both isolated structures from <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> are much shorter. Further, the isolated <italic>S. flexneri</italic> injectisome has a slightly larger diameter. Even the shortest of our MRA class averages of in situ <italic>Yersinia</italic> injectisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) is still longer than the isolated <italic>Shigella</italic> injectisome, which would have to be stretched by ∼40% to match the dimensions of the average in situ <italic>Yersinia</italic> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is in agreement with the possible 8.5 nm length variation imparted to <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> injectisomes by YscC and YscD.</p><p>Our combined analysis of the injectisome by cryo-ET and image processing, X-ray crystallography, and MD simulations resulted in a pseudo-atomistic model of the YscDJ ring at the bacterial IM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). At the currently available resolution, the cryo-EM map doesn’t allow any conclusions about the interaction between the YscD and YscJ protomers. However, the map gives insights about the size of the assembly and the orientation of the protomers with respect to the bacterial IM. In particular, the 24-meric YscD assembly is compatible with the basal body’s diameter, as observed by cryo-EM, while a higher number of YscD units would lead to a poorer match with the experimental data. Moreover, the ring model for the TM and cytosolic domain of YscD further confirms a 24-mer stoichiometry as observed from the optimal fit with the cryo-EM density. The construction and docking of the YscJ 24-mer further supports the proposed stoichiometry. Taking the observed stoichiometry of EscJ into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crepin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yip et al., 2005</xref>), the model constructed of 24 YscJ molecules does not produce gaps or overlaps in the final structural assembly, as we otherwise obtained when using a higher or lower stoichiometry. Moreover, while we cannot rule out a different ring arrangement for YscJ in <italic>Yersinia</italic> compared to EscJ in <italic>E.coli</italic>, the outer diameter of the assembled YscJ 24-meric ring matched well the inner diameter of a YscD 24-meric ring.</p><p>Modeling the TM helix segment connected to the first periplasmic domain (residues 152–218) gave additional hints on the YscD orientation at the membrane surface. The short loop linking the two domains does not allow for large flexibility, providing a solid anchor point for the first YscD periplasmic domain at the membrane surface, and forcing a preferential perpendicular orientation to the IM. MD simulations also suggested a limited fluctuation for this portion of YscD embedded in a membrane model, confirming the preferential orientation found in the 24-mer YscD ring assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>YscDJ ring modeling has been performed to test for any elasticity of the basal body. Several models were constructed based on the extended and compact forms of the YscD monomer explored by steering MD (as described above, ‘Materials and methods’). Although the cryo-ET density could be optimally fitted only by extended forms similar to the X-ray YscD conformation, MD snapshots of individual monomers in more compact forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) allowed the construction, without incurring in steric clashes, of YscD 24-mer ring structures representative of possible states of intermediate compression compared to the fully extended ring model.</p><p>Bacteria are likely exposed to considerable physical forces in vivo, originating from swimming motions, contact with host cells, or from changes in osmolarity of the surrounding medium. For survival, the bacterial membranes must withstand distance variations, while membrane proteins and complexes must continue to function. We hypothesize that the here observed elasticity might allow the injectisome to better cope with such membrane stresses. This is supported by our finding that exposure of the <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> bacteria to osmotic stress from high salt conditions resulted in a significant elongation of their basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is tempting to speculate on any additional functional role of the observed elasticity, for example, to facilitate substrate secretion through a ratchet pump mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Astumian, 2011</xref>). Moreover it would be interesting to quantitatively assess the injectisome’s basal body elongation capabilities with biophysical techniques, for example, atomic force microscopy and force spectroscopy. Recently, it was suggested that injectisomes may rotate upon action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohgita et al., 2013</xref>), similarly to the evolutionary related flagellar motors. To our knowledge, however, the significantly larger basal bodies of flagellar motors do not vary in length, despite their active rotation. Furthermore, the basal bodies of the bacterial flagellar motors do not seem to differ in dimensions between their isolated and in situ structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Recent structural studies in situ revealed flexibility of large molecular complexes. The bacterial type VI secretion system is reported have two long lived stated in the action cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basler et al., 2012</xref>); bacterial flagellar motors of <italic>Borrelia burgdoferii</italic> partially lack the C-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kudryashev et al., 2010</xref>) and the stator rings follow the curvature of the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Protomers of nuclear pore complexes deviate from eightfold symmetry by up to 20% of the diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beck et al., 2007</xref>), which may be responsive to the turgor pressure of the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akey, 1995</xref>). We here hypothesize that for more fragile protein complexes that span two membranes, tertiary structure elasticity may constitute a general mechanism for structural protection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids, and genetic construction</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BW19610 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howitt et al., 2006</xref>) used for cloning and <italic>E. coli</italic> Sm10 λ <italic>pir</italic><sup>+</sup> used for conjugation were routinely grown in Luria broth (LB) or on LB agar (LA) plates at 37°C.

This preliminary structure, as well as sequence-based secondary structure and disorder prediction confirmed the presence of three compact α/β domains separated by flexible linkers. We correlated structure and flexibility in the YscD<sup>150–362</sup> by performing MD simulations of the preliminary structure (in explicit solvent). The system was subjected to geometry optimization and molecular dynamics; after 10 ns equilibration (of RMSD, density, volume) analysis was performed on the last 70 ns of simulation. The secondary structure elements in each of the three domains of YscD were conserved during the simulation, thus confirming the structural stability of the αββαβ-ring building motif. By comparing the computed atomic positional fluctuation to the experimental β-factor of the wt crystal structure we identified the motility of the third periplasmic domain as a possible cause of the poor quality of the crystal.</p><p>To improve the crystal we devised a strategy to restrain the motion of the third domain without affecting the protein fold. Essential dynamics analysis (EDA) was performed on the MD trajectory and anisotropic network model (ANM)—normal mode analysis (NMA) (‘Materials and methods’ below) was applied to the structure and to representative snapshots of the MD simulation. By analyzing the first modes, as independently obtained by EDA and ANM-NMA, we observed that the most relevant collective motions involved bending and rocking of the third domain with respect to the first two. Moreover the most relevant modes suggested the presence of a hinge between the second and third domain, responsible of most of the protein flexibility and causing large displacements of the third domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>wt</italic>). To assess the role of this hinge in the observed flexibility we performed a set of in silico mutations aimed at reducing the conformational freedom in YscD. We constructed a single (G283P) mutant by atomic replacement from the preliminary crystal structure and subjected the systems to the same simulation protocol and analysis as used for the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The proline substitution produced a significant damping in the protein motion and a decrease in the atomic positional fluctuation of the third domain. On the basis of these results we constructed yscD<sup>150–347</sup> G283P. The purified mutant protein produced more regular crystals displaying an improved diffraction pattern, reaching 1.4 Å resolution, with respect to the wild-type YscD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Elasticity of YscD revealed by molecular simulations</title><p>The three domains are, in YscD, arranged along a straight line, while the homologous PrgH protein adopts a more compact boot-shaped arrangement. The high flexibility of YscD, as observed in molecular dynamics simulation and predicted by ANM-NMA calculations, led us to infer that the system can access both straight and bent conformations through a stretching process involving bending/rotation of the tree domains. The YscD models presented here and the available structures of PrgH may represent two possible states, selected by experimental conditions and crystal packing among a large ensemble of accessible conformations.</p><p>To test the capability of YscD to access both bent and straight conformational states, we performed free and biased molecular dynamics simulations. We reconstructed the collapsed conformation based on the structure of PrgH (PDB: 3GRO; UniProtKB: P41783) by performing independent structural alignment between each domain (loops excluded) of YscD and PrgH; then we used MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiser et al., 2003</xref>) to splice together the three YscD fragments and to add and relax the loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fiser et al., 2000</xref>). The collapsed YscD was embedded in a box of water molecules and subjected to geometry optimization and molecular dynamics; after 10 ns equilibration (RMSD, density, volume), analysis was performed on a 70 ns equilibrium simulation. As a model of the straight YscD conformation we used the system constructed from the crystal structures (see above). Additionally, we tested with a similar setup and protocol the compact and straight (as in the X-ray structure) conformation of the G283P YscD mutant. The simulations showed that both straight and bent structures constitute stable conformational states for the YscD protein. As discussed above, the straight conformer showed little variation in the domain arrangement with respect to the initial X-ray structure of YscD, although oscillations of the third domain were observed throughout the simulation. The collapsed conformation diverged slightly from the PrgH structural template, mainly due to a different extension of the flexible loops, and different conformation of the first domain, causing a different domain arrangement; in particular the angle between domains one and two changes from 82° (initial geometry/PrgH) to 24 ± 6° (average during simulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> of the main text). Nonetheless, YscD showed the ability to explore a much compact arrangement, very close to the structure of PrgH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Tertiary structure elasticity explains a facile inter-conversion between extended and compact YscD states</title><p>Tertiary structure elasticity, defined as the rearrangement of tertiary structure in response to mechanical force, represents the first mode of elastic response to external stimuli. To address the tertiary structure elasticity of the periplasmic domain of YscD, a model of the wild-type YscD<sup>152–346</sup> protein was subjected to unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) and then to steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. The construction and equilibration of the initial compact conformation is reported above. Starting form the final geometry of the MD simulation (70 ns) the system was extended according to a standard SMD procedure. The Cα of Asp152 was kept fixed to its initial position while the Cα of Ans346 was slowly pulled at the constant velocity of 0.5 Å ns<sup>−1</sup> to reduce the effects of hydrodynamic drag force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsin and Schulten, 2011</xref>). A constant stretching force of 5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, resulting in a thermal noise deviation of 0.35 Å, was employed to pull the Cα of Ans346 along a fixed direction. The end-to-end distance was thus increased from 6.5 nm to 11.5 nm in 100 ns, with the system opposing a force of 35 ± 15 pN for the first 60 ns (100 nm extension); this value is comparable with the force computed, under similar conditions, for the protein titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsin and Schulten, 2011</xref>). Further stretching causes the rupture of an increasing number of hydrogen bonds within the β strands of the first and third domain, resulting in a progressive growth of the opposing force (above 150 pN). During the SMD simulation the system undergoes a complete stretching from the compact PrgH-like conformation to the fully extended conformation observed in the YscD X-ray structure. The most prominent degrees of freedom, during the extension process, are the two bending angles between neighboring domains pairs.</p><p>Due to its high tertiary structure flexibility, YscD can undergo a stretching of about 5 nm without opposing significant forces. Extension of the YscD periplasmic segment has, thus, a non-negligible impact on the overall height of the basal-body.

Loop modeling was performed using <italic>MODELLER</italic> 9.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiser et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>All molecular dynamics simulations were performed on systems assembled using the <italic>psfbgen</italic> module of VMD 1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). The proteins were embedded in an orthorhombic box of water molecules of suitable size as to allow for a minimum distance of 12 Å between the protein and any of the box faces. The web-based <italic>H++</italic> application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon et al., 2005</xref>) was used to calculate the pKa of titratable residues; since no relevant discrepancies with respect to tabulated values were found, standard protonation states were assigned. A suitable number of ions (Na+ or Cl−) were randomly placed in the box using the <italic>autoionize</italic> module of VMD as to neutralize the system’s net charge. All simulated systems were treated at the molecular mechanics (MM) level using the CHARMM22/CMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackerell et al., 2004</xref>) force field for protein and ions. The TIP3P model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) was employed for water molecules when an explicit solvation was required. Otherwise the effects of the water were accounted for by means of the generalized born (GB) implicit solvent model. The van der Waals interaction cutoff distances were set at 12 Å and long-range electrostatic forces were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald summation method with a grid size of &lt;1 Å.</p><p>The program <italic>NAMD 2.8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) was employed to perform all molecular dynamics simulations. All systems were subjected to 10,000 steps of geometry optimization (steepest descent) followed by a suitable equilibration phase. For all equilibrium simulation, constant temperature (T = 300 K) was enforced using Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient of 5 ps<sup>−1</sup>, constant pressure (p=1 atm) was enforced through the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston method with a decay period of 100 fs and a damping time constant of 50 fs. A time step of 2 fs was used throughout. Covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the RATTLE algorithm.</p><p>Normal mode analysis (NMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahar et al., 2009</xref>) of selected protein structures and essential dynamics analysis (EDA) of molecular dynamics trajectories were performed using Prody 0.9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bakan et al., 2011</xref>) results were rendered using the <italic>matplotlib</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunter, 2007</xref>) graphical library. In the anisotropic network model (ANM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eyal et al., 2006</xref>) approach the structure is modeled as a network of harmonic oscillators: the nodes identifying the α-carbons and the springs accounting for inter-residue interactions. Essential dynamics analysis was used to extract collective protein motions from the molecular dynamics simulations. Like ANM-NMA, EDA constitutes a powerful method to analyze collective motions in biomolecules. In the EDA approach the collective modes of motions are, however, extracted from a molecular dynamics trajectory rather than from a single structure, and shape and frequency of modes are obtained through diagonalization of the covariance matrix of the α-carbons motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amadei et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Macromolecular assemblies were constructed with the newly developed swarm intelligence-based protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Degiacomi and Dal Peraro, 2013</xref>) implemented in a software package called “parallel optmization workbench” (pow<sup>er</sup>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lbm.epfl.ch">http://lbm.epfl.ch</ext-link>). Pow<sup>er</sup> provides predictions for a multimeric structure arrangement on the basis of structural information about its subunits and experimental measures acting as search restraints (as recently shown for the assembly of aerolysin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Degiacomi et al., 2013</xref>). In a first step, an ensemble of monomer conformations is generated, typically from molecular dynamics simulations or structural biology experiments; this ensemble is then treated as a database of conformations. The advantage of this approach is that assembly prediction is performed using physically plausible structures and dynamic features are directly included. Upon definition of a list of geometric restraints (fitness) and a specific circular symmetry, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) search subsequently tries to arrange the elements of the conformational database in a multimeric assembly, so that all restraints are respected, and steric clashes avoided (i.e., part of the fitness function has an 9–6 Lennard-Jones-type energy potentials avoiding overlaps of different units). Geometric restraints can be typically provided by low resolution electron density maps or experiments such as cross-linking disulfide scanning, mutagenesis or FRET. If necessary, <italic>POW<sup>er</sup></italic> can assemble a multimer on a given substrate, like here for the case of YscD ring on top of YscJ ring. At PSO search completion, a set of solutions having a good score is usually generated. A smaller set of representative solutions, typically less than 10, which all satisfy the initial restraints, is then obtained by clustering the accepted solutions according to their respective root mean square deviation (RMSD).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank B Anderson, R Pantelic, K Goldie, and M Chami for expert technical assistance, S A Müller for extensive comments on the manuscript, M Kuhn for plasmid and strain contribution, K Namba for discussions and Martin Jacquot for support with the supercomputing infrastructure of University of Basel.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>MK, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>MDP, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>GRC, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>MS, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>SS, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>MA, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>UW, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>MTD, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>SM, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>CKEB, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>JK, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>AD, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>DC-D, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>DWH, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>HS, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00792.016</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for YscD<sup>150–362</sup> and YscD<sup>150–347</sup> G283P.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general, the reviewers are very positive about the interesting and unexpected results reported in your manuscript. In particular, the possibility to compare in vitro with in situ results was seen as very interesting. There was only one major technical concern that should be addressed.</p><p>The methods do not rule out that over-alignment has lead to artifacts in the sub-tomogram averaging structures. The risk of this is high for highly-symmetrized sub-tomogram averaging structures. The figures in some cases show disconnected and inverted densities, which can result from such artifacts. This is a particular concern for the YscC structure in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) but also for other panels. Further, the substantial differences in structure dependent on the mask used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> could also hint at this possibility. The authors should rule out this possibility by preferably:</p><p>1) aligning two halves of each dataset completely independently (from the start), and comparing the two halves to calculate resolution and to identify reliable features;</p><p>2) Or, if not, then make sure that low-pass filters are applied at each iteration such that zero information is passed beyond resolutions that are significantly below the final resolution obtained. The position of YscV can be interpreted only after these tests.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00792.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We are aware of the significant risk of overfitting in the alignment of noisy data to a reference. As you point out, classical sub-tomogram averaging may produce such overfitting, while the “gold standard” procedure reduces this risk by splitting the dataset into two sub-sets and processes these completely independently. Unfortunately, applying this algorithm to sub-volume averaging is challenging if only a low number of sub-volume “particles” is available. We have now re-processed our injectisome sub-volumes, following the “gold standard” strategy with our “Dynamo” software. This resulted in a more conservative resolution estimate of 4 nm for our final injectisome structure. We now describe this “gold standard” processing approach in an additional section within the Materials and methods section and a panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and we have updated the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>The new, more reliable processing, however, did not affect our findings or the interpretation of the results: the positions of the rings in the injectisome structure, including the putative YscV ring, remained as before, and significant variations in the injectisome lengths after classification and averaging are observed as previously described. These dimensions are also supported by intermembrane distances measured at individual single injectisomes that we also show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p>As for the YscC structure, due to the small number of particles we could not achieve a reliable convergence with only half of the particles. The average from all available YscC sub-volumes, however, shows similar dimensions as the individual YscC sub-volumes showed before averaging, which leads us to believe that the sub-volume averaging reports a valid average structure within the specified resolution limits. To provide a reliable estimate of this resolution, we now used the more conservative threshold for the resolution (FSC=0.5), reporting a resolution of 3 nm. We have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and the manuscript accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
