mammalian brain. Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic structural component of excitatory synapses, and their experience-dependent plasticity has been extensively studied in mouse superficial cortex using two-photon microscopy in vivo. By contrast, very little is known about spine plasticity in the hippocampus, which is the archetypical memory center of the brain, mostly because it is difficult to visualize dendritic spines in this deeply embedded structure with sufficient spatial resolution. We developed chronic 2P-STED microscopy in mouse hippocampus, using a ‘hippocampal window’ based on resection of cortical tissue and a long working distance objective for optical access. We observed a two-fold higher spine density than previous studies and measured a spine turnover of ~40% within 4 days, which depended on spine size. We thus provide direct evidence for a high level of structural rewiring of synaptic circuits and new insights into the structure-dynamics relationship of hippocampal spines. Having established chronic super-resolution microscopy in the hippocampus in vivo, our study enables longitudinal and correlative analyses of nanoscale neuroanatomical structures with genetic, molecular and behavioral experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>spine plasticity</kwd><kwd>in vivo imaging</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20160334901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nägerl</surname><given-names>U Valentin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>COEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-COEN-0003-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nägerl</surname><given-names>U Valentin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>COEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CoEN3018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuhrmann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuhrmann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERA-Net</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MicroSynDep</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuhrmann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeiffer</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship 634FDT20160435677</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeiffer</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Super-resolution STED microscopy is demonstrated for the first time in the deeply embedded mouse hippocampus in vivo, revealing direct evidence for an unprecedentedly high level of synapse remodeling in a brain structure closely associated with memory processing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic spines form the postsynaptic structural component of most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.

Spine structure is closely linked to synapse function, as the size of spine heads scales with synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noguchi et al., 2011</xref>) and the shape and number of spines can be modified by the induction of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nägerl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tønnesen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>) and by sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holtmaat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keck et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Rewiring of neural circuits by spine plasticity is considered a key neurobiological mechanism of memory formation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nimchinsky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sala and Segal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>]). Notably, a recent study showed that optically induced shrinkage of potentiated spines disrupts newly acquired motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2015</xref>), indicating a causal link between spine plasticity and memory. While experience-dependent plasticity of dendritic spines has been a consistent finding across mouse cortex in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>), very little is known about it in the hippocampus. However, this is a major knowledge gap, because this neural structure constitutes the archetypical memory center of the brain, and hippocampal brain slices and primary cell cultures are the dominant model systems for the study of synaptic plasticity mechanisms.</p><p>Imaging dendritic spines in the hippocampus in vivo is challenging because of its remote location more than 1 mm below the surface of the mouse brain. A pioneering study accomplished this with two-photon (2P) microscopy, but only over a period of a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mizrahi et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, approaches based on a ‘hippocampal window’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2014</xref>) or micro-endoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attardo et al., 2015</xref>) enabled ‘chronic’ 2P imaging over several weeks. However, 2P microscopy inevitably lacks the spatial resolution to visualize important details of spine morphology, such as spine necks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethge et al., 2013</xref>), and even struggles to resolve individual dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons, leaving a high fraction of them undetected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attardo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While regular light microscopy typically detects a spine density of around 1 spine/µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brigman et al., 2010</xref>), electron microscopy (EM) reports ~3 spines/µm on CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 1992</xref>) and in <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloss et al., 2018</xref>). By comparison, spine density is about ten times lower in many cortical areas, for example ~0.24 spines/µm for pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of mouse barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holtmaat et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Given the limited spatial resolution of 2P microscopy, we turned to super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hell, 2007</xref>) to improve the visualization of dendritic spines in the intact hippocampus of living mice. We used a home-built STED microscope based on 2P excitation (2P-STED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ter Veer et al., 2017</xref>) and equipped it with a long working distance objective to reach the deeply located hippocampus. We adopted a ‘hippocampal window’ technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dombeck et al., 2010</xref>), where a portion of the overlying somatosensory cortex is surgically removed and replaced by a metal cylinder sealed with a cover slip, providing stable optical access to the CA1 area of the hippocampus.</p><p>We demonstrate that our new approach offers substantially improved spatial resolution and image quality compared to regular 2P microscopy in mouse hippocampus in vivo. Using transgenic mice with fluorescently labeled pyramidal neurons, we measured spine density on basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in <italic>stratum oriens</italic> of the CA1 area and compared results obtained with 2P and 2P-STED microscopy in vivo as well as with STED microscopy in fixed hippocampal sections. Furthermore, we carried out repetitive 2P-STED in vivo imaging over a 4-day period to measure spine turnover.</p><p>Our analysis showed a two times higher spine density than reported by conventional 2P microscopy, and around 40% of all spines turned over within 4 days, suggesting a high level of circuit remodeling in the hippocampus in vivo. Furthermore, detailed morphological analysis revealed that primarily small spines were affected by spine turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2P-STED microscopy with a long working distance objective</title><p>We set up in vivo STED microscopy of dendritic spines in mouse hippocampus to track their morphological dynamics over the course of several days.

A Ti:Sapphire laser emits light pulses at 834 nm with 80 MHz repetition rate. The laser pumps an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) to obtain pulsed STED light at 598 nm. A glass rod and a polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) stretch the STED pulses. The STED doughnut is engineered by a helical 2π phase mask in combination with λ/2 and λ/4 wave plates. The second Ti:Sapphire laser tuned to 900 nm with 80 MHz repetition rate served for two-photon (2P) excitation and is synchronized to the STED light pulses. The 2P and STED beam are combined using a dichroic mirror (DM1). Both beams are swept over the specimen using a galvo-based x-y scanner and a z-focusing device. Scan (SL) and tube lens (TL) image the scan mirrors into the back focal plane of the objective and ensure that the expanded laser beams overfill the back aperture of the objective. Fluorescence is de-scanned and guided to the avalanche photodiode (APD) via a dichroic mirror (DM2) and filters (EF). Electro-optical modulators (EOM) serve for quick adjustments of the beam intensity.

While Gu et al. assessed spine turnover directly from the 2P images, Attardo et al. went a step further and used mathematical modeling to account for the effect of merged spines on apparent spine turnover. Importantly though, without applying the mathematical correction, their survival fraction was around 80% after 21 days, indicating that direct analysis of 2P images is highly problematic when it comes to establishing spine turnover rates.</p><p>Our super-resolution approach documented a spine survival fraction of 60% after 4 days, providing direct and unambiguous evidence that spines can turn over extremely rapidly in CA1 <italic>stratum oriens</italic>, supporting one of the main modeling-based conclusions of the Attardo <italic>et al.</italic> study. However, since we imaged just three time points over a relatively short period, it is hard to extrapolate our results in time and determine the extent to which the observed kinetics hold for the entire spine population. In fact, our observation that larger spines were more stable is a sign for the existence of multiple, kinetically distinct spine populations, unlike the Attardo <italic>et al.</italic> study, which argued for a single population.</p><p>We did not observe any overt signs of phototoxicity, such as dendritic ‘blebbing’ during short time-lapse sequences and across the imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This absence together with the fact that spine density remained constant indicates that the observed kinetics were real and not an artifact induced by our hippocampal window approach or 2P-STED imaging. The use of the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine could be problematic given the important role of NMDA-receptors in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. However, as the drug was applied only for a couple of hours per imaging session and we did not induce any plasticity, it is unlikely that our results were compromised by it. The use of more innocuous drugs or performing the experiments with non-anesthetized and head-fixed animals will be preferable in the future.</p><p>As we did not image in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic>, we do not know to what extent the divergence in spine turnover between <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> reported by Gu <italic>et al.</italic> and <italic>stratum oriens</italic> (Attardo <italic>et al.</italic> and our data) reflects methodological or genuine anatomical or physiological differences. In fact, <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> primarily receives input from CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Somogyi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cappaert et al., 2014</xref>), whereas <italic>stratum oriens</italic> also has afferents from entorhinal cortex and amygdala. In addition, there may be intrinsic differences in the postsynaptic neuron, which account for dendrite-specific spine turnover.</p><p>Our finding that hippocampal dendrites are subject to ongoing intense anatomical remodeling supports the view of the hippocampus as a highly dynamic structure designed to encode and process new memories, but not as a long-term repository of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>). The situation may be quite different in cortical areas, where typically a large fraction of spines is stable for many weeks in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grutzendler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Majewska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>), unless they are subjected to behavioral training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2009</xref>) or sensory manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keck et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether and how spine turnover actually reflects memory-relevant functional adaptations in synaptic strength and connectivity remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, the present work adds up to a substantial advance for the study of hippocampal synapses in living mice, extending the scope of super-resolution microscopy to a deeply embedded brain structure that is critical for memory function. By correlating spine-level structural changes with genetic, molecular and behavioral interventions and assays, our chronic super-resolution imaging approach creates manifold opportunities to study the neurobiological mechanisms and functional significance of spine plasticity in the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used adult female and male transgenic mice (<italic>Thy1</italic>-H<sup>YFP/+</sup> and <italic>Thy1</italic>-M<sup>GFP/+</sup>, 4–12 months old) where a subset of pyramidal neurons is fluorescently labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2000</xref>). The mice were group housed by gender at a day/night cycle of 12/12 hr.

In brief, mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamin/xylazine (0.13/0.01 mg/g bodyweight) and received subcutaneous injections of analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg) and anti-inflammatory agents (dexamethasone, 0.2 mg/kg) to prevent the brain from swelling during the surgical procedure. Using a dental drill, a craniotomy of 3 mm in diameter was performed above the right hemisphere (stereotactic coordinates: anteroposterior, −2.2 mm; mediolateral, +1.8 mm relative to bregma). The dura and somatosensory cortex above the hippocampus were carefully aspirated, while leaving the external capsule of the hippocampus intact. Subsequently, a custom-made metal tube sealed with a coverslip on the bottom side (both 3 mm in diameter, height 1.5 mm and 0.13 mm) was inserted into the craniotomy and fixed to the skull with dental acrylic. Following the surgery, mice received analgesics for 3 days (buprenorphine, 0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) and were allowed to recover from the surgery for 4 weeks before experiments started.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two-photon STED microscopy</title><p>We used a custom-made upright 2P-STED microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) based on two-photon excitation and stimulated emission depletion (STED) using pulsed lasers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ter Veer et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) operating at 80 MHz and emitting light at 834 nm was used in combination with an optical parametric oscillator (OPO BASIC Ring fs, APE, Berlin, Germany) to produce STED light pulses at 598 nm with ~150 fs pulse duration. The pulses were stretched to ~100 ps by passing them through a glass rod and a 20 m long polarization-maintaining fiber. A STED light reflection served to synchronize a second Ti:Sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics, Darmstadt, Germany) tuned to 910 nm and running at a repetition rate of 80 MHz, which was used for two-photon excitation of the fluorophores. Synchronization and optimal pulse delay were achieved with phase-locked loop electronics (3930, Lok-to-Clock, Spectra Physics). The STED doughnut was created by passing the STED beam through a vortex phase mask (RPC Photonics, Rochester, NY), which imposed a helical 2π-phase delay on the wave front. Wave plates (λ/2 and λ/4) were used to make the STED light circularly polarized before it entered into the objective. The 2P and STED beam were combined using a long-pass dichroic mirror. The two laser beams were moved over the sample in all three dimensions using a galvanometric x-y scanner (Janus IV, TILL Photonics) combined with a z-focusing piezo actuator (Pifoc, PI, Karlsruhe, Germany). To bridge the physical distance between the surface of the brain and the deeply embedded hippocampus, we employed a long-working distance water-immersion objective (Nikon CFI Apo 60X W NIR, 1.0 NA, 2.8 mm WD). The epi-fluorescence was de-scanned and imaged onto an avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQR-13-FC, PerkinElmer, Villebone-sur-Yvette, France). Signal detection and peripheral hardware were controlled by the Imspector scanning software (Abberior Instruments, Göttingen, Germany) via a data acquisition card (PCIe-6259, National Instruments). Optical resolution was assessed by imaging 40 nm fluorescent nanospheres (yellow-green fluospheres, Invitrogen) immobilized on glass slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Regions of interest were consecutively imaged in 2P and 2P-STED mode (10 × 10 µm<sup>2</sup>; 10 nm pixel size; 50 µs pixel dwell time). The laser power at the sample was typically around 5–20 mW for 2P and 5–15 mW for STED.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo imaging</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamin/xylazine (0.13/0.01 mg/g bodyweight) and the eyes were protected with ointment (Bepanthen). The mouse was fixed to a custom-made stereotactic frame and kept at body temperature using a heating pad. For the quantification of spine density, 2P-STED and 2P images of basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons were acquired applying identical acquisition parameters (10 × 10 × 4–8 µm<sup>3</sup>; 20–40 nm pixel size; 0.5–1 µm z-step; 20–70 µs pixel dwell time). For the chronic repetitive imaging, the position of the field of view (FOV) was registered in the first imaging session with the help of vascular landmarks and cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This allowed for subsequent retrieval of the FOV for each mouse. An overview 2P image z-stack (100 × 100 × 20 µm<sup>3</sup>; 200 nm pixel size; 1 µm z-steps) was acquired at each time point starting from the coverslip. Subsequently, identified distal stretches of basal dendrites in CA1 <italic>stratum oriens</italic> (5–20 µm in depth) were imaged in 2P and 2P-STED mode. A single imaging session lasted for ~1 hr and mice woke up in their home cage afterwards. All mice survived the imaging sessions and recovered normally from the anesthesia. Mice were excluded from the analysis if the hippocampal window was faulty or if their fluorescence levels were too low.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis</title><p>The 2P and 2P-STED images were spatially filtered (1 pixel median filter) and their brightness and contrast were individually adjusted. Optical resolution of the 2P-STED microscope was assessed by taking images of 40 nm fluorescent nanospheres. We measured two-pixel line profiles across the nanospheres and perpendicular to the spine neck, and fitted them with a Lorentzian function, whose full-width at half maximum (FWHM) served as a measure of the spatial resolution or the neck width, respectively. Paired spine neck measurements were only done for spines where the necks could be discerned in both the 2P and 2P-STED images. Spine density was determined as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuhrmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>). All dendritic spines, which extended out laterally from the dendritic shaft by more than 200 nm, were counted by manually scrolling through the z-stacks. Spine density was calculated as the number of spines divided by the dendritic length in micrometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the 4-day repetitive imaging data set, the spine density of each dendrite was determined blindly with respect to the time point of acquisition. Lost and new spines over the 4-day interval were identified by scrolling through the z-stacks in a chronological order. Spines were scored lost, if they were under the 200 nm threshold. Spines were considered new, if their position on the dendrite relative to neighboring spines shifted by ≥500 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Karel Svoboda as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Anthony Holtmaat (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Imaging and tracking of dendritic spines in vivo poses two distinct challenges: 1. the resolution, contrast and sensitivity need to be sufficiently high to discern spines from the parent dendrite and from one another. 2. dealing with motion artifacts, which can equally degrade the resolution. The first challenge is particularly important in hippocampus, since this is a deep structure with high spine densities. The latter is usually more of an issue in neocortex because it contains a high density of large, pulsating, blood vessels. 2-photon laser scanning microscopy allows imaging dendritic microstructures over time, however its resolution is limited and may not always be sufficient to resolve/detect all spines in the hippocampus. Modeling approaches have been applied to infer dynamics and turnover based on 2P in vivo images (Attardo et al., 2015).</p><p>The authors have applied 2P-STED, a super-resolution method, to image spine dynamics in the mouse hippocampus in vivo over 4 days. They dealt with access and motion artifacts by surgically replacing the cortex with a metal cylinder. To showcase the possibilities of the microscope and prep the authors provide paired comparisons between regular 2-photon and 2-photon STED images and measurements of spines. Then they went on to show that, due to the superior resolution, spine densities are closer to the values reported in EM (used as ground truth). The spine turnover rates are higher than what was reported in a previous 2-photon imaging study with a similar preparation (Gu et al. 2014), and similar to the modeling-based measurements derived from microendoscopic images (Attardo et al. 2015).</p><p>This paper describes a proof of principle using 2P-STED in vivo and provides a first analysis of structural plasticity data. We have no major concerns as to the validity of the results or their interpretation, but suggest expanding the analysis in order to provide more details about the structure-dynamics relationships.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The spine density reported with STED is still lower than that measured with EM. The authors should produce best-of-class STED images from fixed samples of the same mice and compare the spine densities, this would also control for possible effects of the surgery, loss of resolution in vivo etc.</p><p>2) The paper is short, but still a bit flabby. In parts it reads a bit like an infomercial for STED. The resolution advantage over 2p is obvious and should be mentioned once. The effects on measured spine density are also obvious and don't need to be belabored multiple times etc.</p><p>3) The data are under-analyzed. One of the main advantages of the current study as compared to the Attardo et al. study, is the information about spine structure (size, length, head size, neck size etc). In cortex, there are clear structure-dynamics relationships, but for hippocampus in vivo this is not known. The authors should expand their analysis into this direction and show whether such relationships between spine dynamics and spine length/size, head size etc exist.</p><p>4) The authors argue that the current data set experimentally confirms the modeling data from the Attardo et al. study. Indeed, the first 4 days of imaging suggest that the entire population of spines may be impermanent. However, due to the limited sampling rate, it is not inconceivable that the authors could not detect a more or less stable spine population. To get more insight into this, it would be interesting to analyze the survival rate of new spines, and perhaps model this to estimate the stability and turnover of the entire population. In cortex new spines tend have a half-life in the order of 2 days or so, but in the current data set they could probably live longer. This, together with the finding that about 30% of the entire population disappears over 4 days, may indeed suggest that the whole population of spines is subject to turnover (in contrast to cortex, where the turnover rates to a large extent concerns newly formed spines). The structure-dynamics relationship could also be incorporated into this model.</p><p>5) The authors need to discuss or analyze more extensively what were the critical factors in causing the quite different turnover rates between the current study and the Gu et al. paper (one of the co-authors is on both papers!). It is difficult to fathom that the different values (96% stability over 16 days in Gu et al., and 60% stability over 4 days in the current paper) were entirely due to the improved resolution or the hippocampal region. A direct comparison of turnover rates scored in 2P and 2P-STED could have possibly hinted at the underlying factors, or could have identified the type of spines that can be seen turning over in 2P-STED and not in 2P. Furthermore, they should also discuss if long-term 2P-STED could provide better data for cortex or not, given that cortex is usually more prone to movement artefacts?</p><p>6) Since this paper focuses heavily on showing the potential of in vivo 2P-STED, we suggest that the authors provide a more substantive comparison between 2P-STED and 2P images in 3D, that is by showing the image stacks that were typically used for scoring, in addition to the projections. This could be done as a figure supplement or as a new figure. This is important since spines are usually scored in 3D (as the authors do too), and resolving them in the axial dimension is most problematic – and probably still difficult in 2P-STED (as the authors comment). This might relate to the remaining difference between the reported spine densities in 2P-STED and EM.</p><p>7a) Most of the spine necks measured in 2P-STED are smaller than the PSF in 2P (as measured on beads). For example, there are spines that measure 500-700 nm in 2P, but less than 200 in 2P-STED. Wouldn't one expect the size of the smaller necks in 2P to be limited to the PSF of the microscope? Can the authors explain this phenomenon?</p><p>b) Can the authors also explain why the PSF in 2P is highly variable (the FWHM varies from ± 300-450nm)? We assume that the beads were imaged under optimal and standardized conditions. So, what causes the large variability? The PSF in the axial dimension should be presented as well, as this is the dominant factor in the difficulty to discern spines from the parent dendrite in 2P and probably also in 2P-STED.</p><p>c) Along similar lines since the PSF, it would be better to measure the PSFs on beads that are embedded in the preparation. This could change the variance and the bounds as seen in Figure 1C, as well as the relationship of the PSF to the measurements in E.</p><p>8) The authors should specify the length of dendrite that was analyzed, and provide the number of spines that were counted.

The authors should produce best-of-class STED images from fixed samples of the same mice and compare the spine densities. This would also control for possible effects of the surgery, loss of resolution in vivo etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Taking up your advice, we acquired STED images in fixed hippocampal brain slices obtained from the same transgenic mice we had used for the in vivo experiments. The spine density in these fixed samples approaches the values reported by EM. To understand the remaining difference, we used a geometrical model based on the PSF of our microscope and the dimensions of the measured dendrites. The model makes the point that the limited z-resolution of the STED approach is the main reason, why we still underreport spine density relative to EM. (Revised Figure 2; Figure 2—video 1.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The paper is short, but still a bit flabby. In parts it reads a bit like an infomercial for STED. The resolution advantage over 2p is obvious and should be mentioned once. The effects on measured spine density are also obvious and don't need to be belabored multiple times etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We heeded the reviewer’s advice and eliminated the redundancies about the STED benefit.</p><p><italic>3) The data are under-analyzed. One of the main advantages of the current study as compared to the Attardo et al. study, is the information about spine structure (size, length, head size, neck size etc). In cortex, there are clear structure-dynamics relationships, but for hippocampus</italic> in vivo <italic>this is not known. The authors should expand their analysis into this direction and show whether such relationships between spine dynamics and spine length/size, head size etc exist.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point, which prompted us to extract more morphological information from our time-lapse data set to analyse spine structure-dynamics relationships.</p><p>We carried out two types of analyses, which indicate that a structure-dynamics relationship indeed exists for hippocampal spines in vivo, resembling the case in the cortex, where smaller spines generally appear to be less stable.</p><p>Firstly, we show that spines that were visible on only one or two days have on average smaller heads than spines that were visible on all three imaging sessions.</p><p>Secondly, we performed a mathematical cluster analysis of the morphological parameters, which revealed three distinct spine populations (which incidentally resemble the classical spine types: cluster 1 ≅ small; cluster 2 ≅ thin; cluster 3 ≅ mushroom-like). Whereas 50% of ‘persistent’ spines (i.e. that were visible on all three imaging sessions) appeared in cluster 3, spines that were visible only on one or two sessions rarely (7%) exhibited a mushroom-like morphology. (New Figure 4; new Figure 4—figure supplement 1.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors argue that the current data set experimentally confirms the modeling data from the Attardo et al. study. Indeed, the first 4 days of imaging suggest that the entire population of spines may be impermanent. However, due to the limited sampling rate, it is not inconceivable that the authors could not detect a more or less stable spine population. To get more insight into this, it would be interesting to analyze the survival rate of new spines, and perhaps model this to estimate the stability and turnover of the entire population. In cortex new spines tend have a half-life in the order of 2 days or so, but in the current data set they could probably live longer. This, together with the finding that about 30% of the entire population disappears over 4 days, may indeed suggest that the whole population of spines is subject to turnover (in contrast to cortex, where the turnover rates to a large extent concerns newly formed spines). The structure-dynamics relationship could also be incorporated into this model.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we examined the kinetic data to look for evidence of a more long-lived spine population. We analysed the behaviour of new spines (i.e. spines that appeared on day 2) and observed that 66% of them were still visible during the next imaging session (day 4), indicating that newly formed spines may have a longer half-life in hippocampus than in cortex.</p><p>To take a closer look at the possibility of a stable spine population, we extrapolated the fraction of surviving spines by using a simple kinetic model based on a geometrical progression. The number of surviving spines on day n+1 can be expressed as:</p><p>u<sub>n+1</sub>=u<sub>n-</sub> F∗u<sub>n</sub></p><p>where u<sub>n</sub> is the number of surviving spines on day n and F is the fraction of lost spines from day n to n+1 among the surviving ones. Note that this definition of F differs from the lost fraction of spines, since it excludes the new spines on day n that are lost on day n+1. Therefore, the number of surviving spines is</p><p>u<sub>n</sub>=u<sub>0</sub>(1-F)<sup>n</sup></p><p>Fitting the model to the in vivo data set, we estimated F = 22%, which corresponds to a spine half-life of 5.5 days. Moreover, the fit indicates that the survival fraction indeed converges to zero, which is inconsistent with the existence of a stable spine population. However, the ability of this modelling approach to identify kinetically distinct populations is at present not very good, given the limited sampling duration.</p><p>By comparison, fitting the model to the 2P data set, yields a spine half-life of 9 days (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This confirms that data with lower spatial resolution indeed lead to an over-estimation of spine stability, as discussed in the Attardo study.</p><p>Because of the limited sampling and the inherent unreliability of longer-term extrapolations, we decided to omit this data from the manuscript. However, we discuss that these important kinetic issues need to be tested experimentally.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34700.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34700-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors need to discuss or analyze more extensively what were the critical factors in causing the quite different turnover rates between the current study and the Gu et al. paper (one of the co-authors is on both papers!). It is difficult to fathom that the different values (96% stability over 16 days in Gu et al., and 60% stability over 4 days in the current paper) were entirely due to the improved resolution or the hippocampal region. A direct comparison of turnover rates scored in 2P and 2P-STED could have possibly hinted at the underlying factors, or could have identified the type of spines that can be seen turning over in 2P-STED and not in 2P. Furthermore, they should also discuss if long-term 2P-STED could provide better data for cortex or not, given that cortex is usually more prone to movement artefacts?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we elaborate more about why the Gu et al. study reported a much higher spine stability. The reason is likely a combination of microscope resolution and hippocampal region. However, without a direct experimental comparison (our STED approach limited us to <italic>stratum oriens),</italic> we cannot provide a quantification for how much Gu et al. over-estimated stability versus how much spines are really more stable in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic>.</p><p>Having said that, we did observe a considerable level of spine turnover even with just 2P, which one might think supports the case of a biological difference between basal and apical CA1 dendrites. However, our 2P approach, which benefited from a higher objective NA, already detected about 45% more spines than Gu et al., so it is not a fair comparison, and thus the same argument about over-estimating spine stability applies. We have tried to address these questions openly in the Discussion.</p><p>Regarding the point about the utility of 2P-STED for cortex, it is likely that improved spatial resolution will still provide better data, even if imaging in superficial brain areas is more prone to movement artefacts. The benefit of STED will be less obvious in as much as sample motion and not optics is the dominant factor behind image blur. (New Figure 3—figure supplement 1.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since this paper focuses heavily on showing the potential of in vivo 2P-STED, we suggest that the authors provide a more substantive comparison between 2P-STED and 2P images in 3D, that is by showing the image stacks that were typically used for scoring, in addition to the projections. This could be done as a figure supplement or as a new figure. This is important since spines are usually scored in 3D (as the authors do too), and resolving them in the axial dimension is most problematic – and probably still difficult in 2P-STED (as the authors comment). This might relate to the remaining difference between the reported spine densities in 2P-STED and EM.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, resolving dendritic spines along the optical axis is still difficult, as our new approach did not provide an improved z-resolution. To comply with the reviewer’s suggestion, we provide a new supplementary figure that illustrates how we scored spines. In addition, as mentioned above, we have used a geometrical model to estimate the effect of limited z-resolution on spine counting. Taking this fraction of invisible spines into account, the estimated spine density closely matches the reported spine densities reported by Bloss et al. 2018 and Harris et al. 1992 using EM. (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1; new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7a) Most of the spine necks measured in 2P-STED are smaller than the PSF in 2P (as measured on beads). For example, there are spines that measure 500-700 nm in 2P, but less than 200 in 2P-STED. Wouldn't one expect the size of the smaller necks in 2P to be limited to the PSF of the microscope? Can the authors explain this phenomenon?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this inconsistency. Revisiting the 2P images, we realized that some of our measurements were contaminated by instances where spines appeared merged in the images with neighbouring spines or other poorly resolved structures due to the lower spatial resolution, yielding artefactually wider neck measurements. By carefully looking at the corresponding 2P-STED images, we could eliminate these cases. In addition, we have now excluded measurements where the R<sup>2</sup> of the fit for the line profiles was below 0.8. (Revised Figure 1E.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Can the authors also explain why the PSF in 2P is highly variable (the FWHM varies from ± 300-450nm)? We assume that the beads were imaged under optimal and standardized conditions. So, what causes the large variability?</p></disp-quote><p>We also thank the reviewers for spotting this error, due to the inclusion of clustered beads in the analysis. Removing these (based on checking the corresponding 2P-STED image) and applying the threshold described above (fits with R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.8 were excluded), the variability was greatly reduced. We obtained a value of 325 nm ± 5 nm for 2P, which is very close to the theoretical value of 320 nm for a 1.0 NA objective and 900 nm excitation. (Revised Figure 1C.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The PSF in the axial dimension should be presented as well, as this is the dominant factor in the difficulty to discern spines from the parent dendrite in 2P and probably also in 2P-STED.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present the PSF in the axial dimension as requested. (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Along similar lines since the PSF, it would be better to measure the PSFs on beads that are embedded in the preparation. This could change the variance and the bounds as seen in Figure 1C, as well as the relationship of the PSF to the measurements in E.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that measuring PSFs in situ would be the preferred strategy, but unfortunately for practical reasons we cannot fulfil this request at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should specify the length of dendrite that was analyzed, and provide the number of spines that were counted.

To see what different brightness levels do to the images, we present the images used in the actual figures in a less saturated way, which look very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34700.026</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34700-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The criteria used in counting spines are a bit vague.
