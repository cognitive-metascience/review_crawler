mechanism for spatial control of protein synthesis. However, the composition of transported ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) and the regulation of their movement are poorly understood. We have reconstituted microtubule minus end-directed transport of mRNAs using purified components. A Bicaudal-D (BicD) adaptor protein and the RNA-binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) are sufficient for long-distance mRNA transport by the dynein motor and its accessory complex dynactin, thus defining a minimal transport-competent RNP. Unexpectedly, the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA localisation signal promotes the interaction of Egl with BicD, which licenses the latter protein to recruit dynein and dynactin. Our data support a model for BicD activation based on RNA-induced occupancy of two Egl-binding sites on the BicD dimer. Scaffolding of adaptor protein assemblies by cargoes is an attractive mechanism for regulating intracellular transport.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36312.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In our cells, tiny molecular motors transport the components necessary for life’s biological processes from one location to another. They do so by loading their cargo, and burning up chemical fuel to carry it along pathways made of filaments. For example, one such motor, called dynein, can move molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific locations within the cell. There, the mRNA will be used as a template to create proteins, which will operate at exactly the right place.</p><p>Transporting mRNA in this way is critical in processes such as embryonic development and the formation of memories; yet, this mechanism is still poorly understood. Previous work suggested that the mRNA is simply a passenger of the dynein motor, but McClintock et al. asked if this is really the case. Instead, could mRNA regulate its own sorting by controlling the activity of dynein?</p><p>Studying mRNA trafficking within the complex molecular environment of a cell is challenging, so mRNA transporting machinery was recreated in the laboratory. Only the proteins necessary to build a working system were included in the experiments. In addition to the filaments, the components included dynein and a complex of proteins known as dynactin, which allows the motor to move together with a protein called BICD2. A protein named Egalitarian was used to link the mRNA to BICD2.</p><p>By filming fluorescently labelled proteins and mRNAs, McClintock et al. discovered that mRNA strongly promotes the movement of the dynein motor. A structured section in the mRNA acts as a docking area for two copies of Egalitarian. This activates BICD2, which then binds to dynein and dynactin, thereby completing the transport machinery. According to these results, the mRNA directs the assembly of the system that will carry it within the cell.</p><p>Viruses such as HIV and herpesvirus hijack dynein motors to have their genetic information moved around a cell in order to propagate infection. Understanding precisely how mRNA is transported may help to develop new strategies to fight these viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA transport</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>in vitro reconstitution</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>Bicaudal-D</kwd><kwd>Egalitarian</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105178790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McClintock</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dix</surname><given-names>Carly I</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name><name><surname>McLaughlin</surname><given-names>Stephen H</given-names></name><name><surname>Maizels</surname><given-names>Rory J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoang</surname><given-names>Ha Thi</given-names></name><name><surname>Bullock</surname><given-names>Simon L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reconstitution of dynein-based mRNA transport with purified components reveals a pivotal role of an RNA localisation signal in controlling the assembly and activity of the translocation machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Targeting of mRNAs to specific locations within the cytoplasm can confer precise spatial control over protein synthesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). By compartmentalising protein function, mRNA localisation contributes to diverse processes, including embryonic axis determination, epithelial polarity and neuronal plasticity. Trafficking of mRNAs frequently depends on the action of cytoskeletal motors, in particular those that move along the polarised microtubule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mofatteh and Bullock, 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which specific mRNAs are recruited to, and transported by, microtubule motors remain unclear.</p><p>One of the most tractable systems for microtubule-based mRNA transport operates during early development of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and is responsible for localising spatial determinants of embryonic patterning to microtubule minus ends. Transport of these mRNAs is dependent on the Egalitarian (Egl) and Bicaudal-D (BicD) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullock and Ish-Horowicz, 2001</xref>), as well as the minus end-directed motor cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) and its accessory complex dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilkie and Davis, 2001</xref>). Egl is a 1004-amino-acid protein that directly associates with the specialised RNA stem-loops that mediate polarised transport (so-called RNA localisation signals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>). The basis of RNA recognition by Egl is not known, although an exonuclease-like domain between residues 557 and 726 is partly responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>). Egl uses a short N-terminal region to bind BicD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>), and C-terminal features to bind the LC8 dynein light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>). Mammalian BicD orthologues – BICD1 and BICD2 – associate with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>). These observations have led to a model for linkage of localising mRNAs to the dynein transport machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is not known, however, if other factors co-operate with Egl and BicD to bridge mRNAs to the motor complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36312.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of dynein-based RNA transport with purified proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Existing model for linkage of localising mRNAs to dynein.

Several lines of evidence indicate that BicD is a key player in these processes. By forming an extended coiled-coil homodimer, the isolated N-terminal region of mammalian BICD2 (BICD2N: containing coiled-coil domain 1 (CC1) and part of CC2) can bridge the interaction between dynein and dynactin, forming a mutually dependent triple complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The binding of dynein to BICD2N and dynactin increases the incidence of processive movement dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>), which is associated with repositioning of the dynein motor domains with respect to the microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). The motor also moves with higher velocity and has increased force output once bound to BICD2N and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>). The equivalent N-terminal region of <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD stimulates dynein-based transport in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>Full-length BicD proteins interact poorly with dynein and dynactin and are therefore only weak activators of dynein motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). While mechanistic details are still lacking, BicD appears to be autoinhibited by folding back of the third coiled-coil domain (CC3) onto the dynein-activating sequences in CC1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuurman et al., 1999</xref>). It has been proposed that the interaction of CC3 with cargo-binding proteins such as Egl or Rab6 (a G-protein that binds Golgi-derived vesicles) frees CC1/2 to interact with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this model, mutating an essential residue in the shared Rab6- and Egl-binding site in CC3 prevents <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD from associating with dynein in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It has recently been shown in vitro that the presence of Rab6 allows full-length BICD2 to associate with dynein and dynactin and thereby activate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>). This observation provides direct evidence that association of a cargo-binding protein with CC3 stimulates the assembly of an active dynein-dynactin-BicD complex, although the stoichiometry of Rab6 and BICD2 in transport complexes was not investigated. Rab6 only associates with mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD proteins when it is GTP-bound (Rab6<sup>GTP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Short et al., 2002</xref>), a state induced by association with its target membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>). These data suggest a mechanism for linking long-distance movement of dynein with the availability of a vesicular cargo. Egl, on the other hand, can associate with BicD CC3 in vitro in the absence of an RNA cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). This observation implies that the RNA is not involved in the relief of BicD autoinhibition by Egl, although this hypothesis has not been tested directly.</p><p>We set out to elucidate molecular mechanisms of dynein-based mRNA transport by Egl and BicD by reconstituting this process in vitro with purified components. Our results define a minimal set of proteins for RNA translocation on microtubules and show that the RNA strongly activates dynein motility. Stimulation of transport by RNA is not dependent on the Egl-LC8 interaction. Rather, our data support a model in which the RNA localisation signal overcomes BicD autoinhibition by augmenting the interaction of Egl with BicD CC3. Our study reveals a pivotal role of an RNA localisation signal in gating the activity of a microtubule motor, and give rise to a model in which cargoes stimulate dynein motility by scaffolding active adaptor protein assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An in vitro assay for dynein-based mRNA transport</title><p>We set out to determine if purified dynein, dynactin, Egl and BicD are sufficient to induce mRNA transport in vitro.

This complex was purified from Sf9 insect cells by co-expression of Egl with BICD2, as soluble Egl could not be recovered in the absence of its binding partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The Egl/BICD2 complex, which was captured using an affinity tag on Egl, was not associated with significant amounts of RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous evidence that RNA is not essential for the interaction of Egl with <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The 1.4 MDa human dynein complex and 1.1 MDa pig dynactin complex were purified from established recombinant and native sources, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). The purity of these and other protein preparations used in the study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.

RNAs and proteins were incubated together for at least 1 hr to promote complex assembly, followed by dilution to concentrations that allow discrimination of single molecules on microtubules. We first used the 3’UTR of the <italic>hairy</italic> mRNA, which mediates transport by a complex containing Egl, BicD, dynein and dynactin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dix et al., 2013</xref>).

We also performed experiments with the <italic>I-factor</italic> retrotransposon RNA, which is transported in association with Egl, BicD, dynein and dynactin during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van De Bor et al., 2005</xref>).

Unlike Rab6, Egl can bind BicD in the absence of associated cargo, leading us to ask whether dynein and dynactin differentiate between RNA-bound and RNA-free Egl/BICD2. To address this question, we performed motility assays with Egl/BICD2, dynactin and fluorescent dynein in the presence and absence of RNA. Strikingly, the number of processive movements of dynein was ~six-fold higher when the RNA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

As described in the Introduction, previous studies have indicated that occupancy of the Egl/Rab6<sup>GTP</sup>-binding site in BICD2 relieves autoinhibition, licensing BICD2N to interact with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). During handling of the purified Egl/BICD2 complex, we noticed that it had a tendency to dissociate upon dilution. This observation suggests dynamic exchange of constituent species. We therefore wondered if the RNA relieves BICD2 autoinhibition by stabilising its interaction with Egl. To test this hypothesis, we first mixed the 59-nt <italic>ILS</italic> RNA with purified Egl/BICD2 and performed size exclusion chromatography. The RNA localisation signal caused a large change in the elution profile of the protein complex compared to the RNA-free form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a substantial increase in molar mass or a conformational change.</p><p>We next used sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (SE-AUC) to evaluate mean molar masses of complexes in the presence and absence of RNA independently of protein conformation. Over a range of protein concentrations, the presence of the <italic>ILS</italic> caused a large increase in mean molar mass compared to RNA-free samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36312.029</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The RNA localisation signal promotes the occupancy of BICD2 with Egl.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean molar masses of Egl/BICD2 complexes at different concentrations in the presence and absence of the <italic>ILS</italic> determined by SE-AUC.

The MALS analysis provides the abundance-weighted mean mass of all of the species present throughout the peak (darker lines). Gels of collected fractions stained with SYPRO Ruby reveal more Egl associated with BICD2 in the presence of the <italic>ILS</italic> (maximum Egl:BICD2 ratio without <italic>ILS</italic> = 0.07; maximum Egl:BICD2 ratio with <italic>ILS</italic> = 0.48), which corresponds to species with higher mean molar mass (gels are aligned with corresponding positions in the SEC-MALS trace). Consistent with the relatively modest increase in molar mass compared to BICD2 alone, the SEC-MALS peak for the mixture of Egl/BICD2 without the <italic>ILS</italic> is dominated by free BICD2, with a relatively small amount of Egl. The absence of a BICD2-like shoulder in the trace of this sample presumably reflects rapid binding and unbinding of Egl. Free monomeric Egl elutes later from the column in a broad peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Despite being present in a 10-fold molar access to Egl/BICD2, the scrambled <italic>ILS</italic> RNA elicited a relatively small increase in mean molar mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), confirming selectivity of the Egl/BICD2 complex for an active RNA localisation signal. Our finding that there is some association of Egl/BICD2 with the mutant RNA is compatible with earlier evidence that Egl is not a highly selective RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dix et al., 2013</xref>).

Consistent with such dynamics, the mean molar mass of the peak fractions increased with increasing amounts of Egl/BICD2 and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Analysis of peak SEC-MALS fractions by SDS-PAGE revealed that the <italic>ILS</italic>-induced increases in mass were associated with enhanced interaction of BICD2 and Egl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Collectively, these experiments reveal that the Egl/BICD2 and Egl/DmBicD complexes readily equilibrate with constituent species and that this is counteracted by the RNA localisation signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The copy numbers of RNA, Egl and BicD in active transport complexes</title><p>In our SE-AUC and SEC-MALS experiments, mean molar masses of the mixtures of <italic>ILS</italic>, Egl and a BicD protein could reach ~400 kDa. The predicted molar masses of the BICD2, DmBicD and Egl polypeptides are 93, 89 and 112 kDa, respectively, while the <italic>ILS</italic> has a molar mass of 19 kDa. It was previously shown that DmBicD is a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuurman et al., 1999</xref>), and we confirmed that this is also the case for BICD2 using SEC-MALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; observed molar mass 186.7 ± 0.5 kDa). The mean molar masses observed in our experiments with the <italic>ILS</italic> are therefore compatible with a fraction of BicD dimers being occupied by more than one Egl molecule. To directly evaluate the stoichiometry of Egl and BicD in mRNA transport complexes, we returned to our in vitro motility assay. This system allows investigation of the copy number of these proteins in the fraction of complexes that are able to recruit dynein and dynactin and thus support processive movement on microtubules.</p><p>We first produced Egl/BICD2 complexes with SNAP-tagged BICD2 and labelled them with a mixture of SNAP-reactive dyes such that approximately half of BICD2 polypeptides in the preparation were labelled with TMR, and approximately half were labelled with Alexa647.

However, incomplete labelling of SNAP::BICD2 meant that an obligate BICD2 dimer would result in 40% of complexes labelled with both dyes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The capacity of BicD to bind two Egl molecules is compatible with the symmetrical nature of the Egl-binding region of CC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we investigated the copy number of RNA in transport complexes by performing motility assays with equimolar amounts of <italic>hairy</italic> RNA preparations that were labelled by random incorporation of either Cyanine3 (Cy3) or Cy5. Of the labelled motile RNPs, 14% had signal from both dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). Considering that the same proportion of complexes should have two Cy3 dyes or two Cy5 dyes, and that the labelling efficiency means that a small fraction of RNA molecules will contain neither dye, these data indicate that 30% of RNPs contained two RNAs and 70% contained one RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We previously found that transported <italic>hairy</italic> RNPs assembled in <italic>Drosophila</italic> extracts exclusively contain a single RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soundararajan and Bullock, 2014</xref>). The subset of complexes containing two <italic>hairy</italic> RNAs in our current assay presumably reflects a degree of non-specific RNA-RNA interaction or RNA-protein interaction, which is normally blocked in extracts by the binding of other proteins. We observed very little co-localisation of Cy3-<italic>hairy</italic> and Cy5-<italic>hairy</italic> on a glass surface in the absence of Egl, BICD2 dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the presence of two copies of the RNA in a subset of transport complexes is predominantly due to an interaction of the second RNA molecule with one of the proteins in the transport machinery. Motile complexes containing both Cy3 and Cy5 exhibited similar velocity distributions and only a modest increase in run length compared to those containing only a single dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the presence of a second RNA does not have substantial functional consequences.</p><p>In summary, the results of the dual-labelling experiments are consistent with the vast majority of BicD dimers in active transport complexes associating with two Egl polypeptides, and most associating with a single RNA. Together with our earlier results, these data support a model in which the RNA localisation signal licenses BicD to bind dynein and dynactin by facilitating the association of BicD CC3 with two Egl molecules (see below).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have succeeded in reconstituting microtubule-based mRNA transport in vitro using purified proteins and have used this system to define a minimal transport-competent RNP. Although genetic experiments indicate that other proteins can modulate the mRNA transport process in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hain et al., 2014</xref>), no other factors appear to be obligatory for linkage of the RNA to dynein.</p><p>There has recently been considerable focus on the regulation of dynein motility, stemming from the discovery that the isolated N-terminal region of BicD proteins can bridge the interaction of dynein and dynactin and thereby activate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent structural studies have provided important insights into how dynein activity is controlled in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grotjahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, because full-length BicD proteins interact with dynein and dynactin poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>), it is unclear how dynein activity is controlled within intact cargo-motor complexes.</p><p>Previous observations suggested that binding of a cargo-associated protein such as Egl to the C-terminal region of BicD is sufficient to overcome the autoinhibited state of the full-length protein, and thereby lead to recruitment of dynein and dynactin. Our study reveals that a purified Egl/BicD complex does not efficiently associate with dynein and dynactin in the absence of an RNA localisation signal. Thus, the availability of the cargo gates robust activation of dynein motility. This mechanism presumably limits unproductive long-range movement of the motor complex in the absence of an RNA consignment.</p><p>We show that the previously reported interaction of Egl with LC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>) is not required for RNA-directed activation of dynein motility. Characterisation of the features of LC8 that mediate interaction with its binding partners also argue against a role for LC8 as an adaptor between Egl and dynein; the groove that LC8 uses to associate with the consensus binding motif present in Egl is also used for incorporation into the dynein complex, suggesting mutually exclusive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rapali et al., 2011</xref>). However, disrupting the Egl-LC8 interaction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does significantly compromise the function of Egl in the maintenance of oocyte fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>). There are several examples of LC8 acting as a chaperone for binding partners independently of its association with dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rapali et al., 2011</xref>), and it may serve the same function for Egl in vivo.</p><p>Our data indicate that a key consequence of RNA binding to Egl is stimulation of the interaction of BicD with dynein and dynactin. Thus, RNA-bound Egl must overcome the autoinhibition of full-length BicD that prevents CC1/2 from engaging with dynein and dynactin. Negative stain electron microscopy in a contemporary study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>) lends further support to this notion; a folded back conformation of full-length DmBicD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stuurman et al., 1999</xref>), which is likely to represent the autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), was retained in the presence of Egl alone, but not detected in the presence of both RNA and Egl.</p><p>Our single-molecule analysis is also consistent with the activation of transport by RNA being mediated by CC1/2. The recruitment of RNA to dynein by Egl/BICD2 is dependent on dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), as is also the case for the interaction of BICD2N with the motor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of RNA-bound Egl/BICD2 to augment dynein’s binding to microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), as well as its velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and run length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), is also shared with BICD2N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>). Very recently, it has been shown that a single BICD2N dimer and a single dynactin can recruit one or two dynein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grotjahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>), with the binding of the second motor increasing velocity and run length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>). The two-motor state is associated with a subtle difference in the position of the N-terminal region of BICD2 CC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref> provide evidence that two dynein motors are present in the majority of their transport RNPs, raising the possibility that interaction of RNA-bound Egl with BICD2 modulates the velocity and run length of transport complexes by favouring the two-motor-binding conformation of CC1.</p><p>An in vitro study of a yeast actin-based mRNA transport complex also reported stimulation of processive movement by the RNA cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sladewski et al., 2013</xref>) (although an independent investigation of the same complex reported no influence of the RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heym et al., 2013</xref>]). The mechanism that we and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref> propose for RNA-mediated activation of dynein – involving relief of autoinhibition of an adaptor – is distinct from the one proposed for the yeast transport complex, which is based on RNA-dependent dimerisation of monomers of the myosin motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sladewski et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, multiple strategies may have evolved to co-ordinate the processivity of cytoskeletal motors with the availability of an RNA cargo.</p><p>How could binding of RNA to Egl relieve BicD autoinhibition? Although a complex of Egl bound to BicD can be purified in the absence of RNA following overexpression in insect cells, our data indicate that it readily dissociates into constituent species. The interaction between Egl and BicD is mediated by the first 79 amino acids of Egl and a 42-amino-acid region of BicD CC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Although we cannot rule out additional mechanisms of RNA-mediated activation of BicD, the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that the RNA localisation signal promotes the occupancy of CC3 with Egl, thereby freeing CC1/2 to interact with dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is not clear how binding of RNA-associated Egl (or Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> for that matter) to BicD CC3 releases CC1/2. One possibility is that binding of Egl/Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> competes directly with the interaction of CC3 with the N-terminal sequences. Alternatively, occupancy of the Rab6<sup>GTP</sup>- and Egl-binding site in CC3 could induce changes in coiled-coil architecture that are propagated along the molecule to release a discrete autoinhibitory interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The discovery of crystal forms of CC3 with different coiled-coil registers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terawaki et al., 2015</xref>) lends support to the involvement of coiled-coil dynamics in the activation of BicD.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36312.049</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for the mechanism of RNA-stimulated assembly of an active dynein-dynactin complex.</title><p>The RNA favours the interaction of Egl with CC3 of BicD, which promotes release of CC1/2 of BicD to interact with dynein and dynactin. A single RNA molecule is shown in the transport complex as our data indicate that this scenario is common.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36312-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>It is striking that the vast majority of active transport complexes contain two Egl polypeptides per BicD dimer, even when the transport process is compromised by the omission of RNA. This finding suggests that occupancy of both Egl-binding sites of BicD CC3 favours the relief of BicD autoinhibition and recruitment of dynein and dynactin. How could the RNA localisation signal stabilise the heterotetrameric Egl/BicD complex? Purified BicD was found not to interact directly with RNA localisation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dienstbier et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the RNA does not act as a bridge between Egl and BicD. Our single-molecule experiments are consistent with two Egl proteins being able to associate with a single RNA molecule. A structure-function study of an Egl-binding RNA localisation signal revealed two structurally-related helices that must be precisely registered with each other in order to trigger mRNA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullock et al., 2010</xref>). Our SEC-MALS analysis indicates that free Egl is monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the two helices of the RNA localisation signal are discrete binding sites for Egl monomers, as this offers a simple explanation for how the RNA facilitates the association of two Egl molecules with a BicD dimer. Alternatively, binding of the RNA localisation signal could induce a conformational change in Egl that stabilises the protein or increases its affinity for CC3, thereby favouring full occupancy of BicD. High-resolution structures of RNA-protein complexes will be required to discriminate between these possibilities.</p><p>In addition to Rab6<sup>GTP</sup>-associated vesicles and Egl-associated mRNAs, BicD proteins are implicated in transport of a diverse range of cellular cargoes and pathogens by dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dharan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoogenraad and Akhmanova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Indran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>). It is conceivable that the cargo also promotes the activation of dynein in these systems by scaffolding the association of two cargo-associated proteins with CC3. It is easy to envisage how this could occur during membrane trafficking, when the diffusion of CC3-interacting proteins within the membrane would greatly facilitate co-incident association. The finding that BicD CC3 can simultaneously bind two Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) is compatible with this scenario.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Dynein, BICD2, Egl/BICD2 and Egl/DmBicD complexes were affinity purified via an N-terminal ZZ-LTLT on DHC (ZZ-LTLT-SNAP::DHC) and BICD2 (ZZ-LTLT-BICD2), or a C-terminal LTLT-ZZ tag on Egl (Egl::LTLT-ZZ or Egl::SNAP-LTLT-ZZ). Frozen Sf9 cells were thawed on ice. For dynein purification, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM MgATP, 2 mM PMSF, 1 x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)). For purification of Egl/BICD2 and Egl/DmBicD complexes, lysis buffer was modified to include 500 mM NaCl to disrupt any association of Egl with native RNA species.

Clarified lysate was added directly to the affinity matrix in the column, which was then sealed and agitated by gentle rolling for 3 hr. After incubation, the lysate was allowed to flow through the column by gravity and the retained affinity matrix washed twice with five column volumes of lysis buffer and twice with five column volumes of TEV buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM KOAc, 2 mM MgOAc, 1 mM EGTA-KOH pH 7.3, 10% glycerol). If required, bound SNAP-tagged proteins were fluorescently labelled on-column before proceeding to elution (see below). Bound proteins were eluted by overnight TEV cleavage of the ZZ affinity tag using gentle rolling agitation and ~0.03 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> TEV protease in a final volume of 15 ml TEV buffer.

For SEC-MALS and SE-AUC experiments, GF150 was modified to include 5 mM TCEP instead of DTT. For the dynein complex, a TSKgel G4000SWxl with guard column (TOSOH Bioscience Ltd, Reading, UK) was used, while a Superose 6 Increase 3.2/300 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was used for BICD2, Egl/BICD2 and Egl/DmBicD complexes. Fractions containing the dynein complex were pooled and concentrated to ~1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>. Fractions containing BICD2, Egl/BICD2 or Egl/DmBicD complexes were pooled without an additional concentration step. All purified proteins were dispensed in aliquots for single use, flash frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Coomassie Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). To assess purity, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris precast gels (ThermoFisher Scientific) and MES-SDS running buffer. Protein bands were visualised using Coomassie Instant Blue protein stain (Expedeon, Over, UK) and imaged with a ChemiDoc XRS + system (Bio-Rad).

Typically, three independent chambers were imaged using protein complexes from at least two independent assembly reactions for each experimental condition. The positions of microtubules were determined by the fluorescent tubulin signal or a projection of RNA/protein signals over the course of the movie. From each of these chambers, 5–10 microtubules were typically selected for analysis with preference given to those that were longer and better isolated from adjacent microtubules. No power analysis was used to determine sample size. Instead the sample size was chosen to allow the identification of a range of effect sizes. To avoid the risk of subconscious bias, microtubules were selected before visualising the motile properties of complexes on them.</p><p>Interactions of fluorescently labelled proteins and RNA with microtubules were scored as binding events if they were ≥1.5 s (three frames) in duration and as processive events if they achieved predominantly minus end displacement &gt;500 nm (five pixels) without significant diffusive behaviour. These parameters were chosen in advance of image acquisition following discussion within the team and all particles that fulfilled the criteria were analysed. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>), some motile complexes changed velocity during a run, leading us to calculate velocities of individual constant-velocity segments. Run lengths were calculated from the total displacement of individual particles regardless of changes in velocity or pauses. For both velocity and run length calculations, only particles for which the entire run was observed or those with runs beginning &gt;5 μm from the microtubule minus end were considered. When velocities and run lengths were calculated in the presence of RNA, only those complexes clearly associated with RNA were analysed. Although plots of 1 - cumulative frequency for run lengths were fitted to a one-phase exponential decay for visualisation purposes, statistical comparison of run lengths were performed on unfitted data.

A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare two groups with non-Gaussian data distributions. An ANOVA test with Dunnett’s correction was used for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to members of the Bullock lab, Carter lab and microscopy facility at MRC-LMB for advice and support, Andrew Carter for comments on the manuscript, Jianguo Shi for maintenance and propagation of Sf9 insect cells, Thomas Sladewski and Kathleen Trybus for sharing unpublished results, and Vladimir Gelfand for the p150 antibody.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by McClintock and coworkers reports the establishment of an in vitro system to study dynein-dependent mRNA transport mediated by the adaptor Bicaudal D and its binding partner Egalitarian (Egl), which interacts with a specific subset of mRNAs containing appropriate targeting sequences. Using purified proteins (including BicD from both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse) and different mRNAs known to be transported in vivo, the authors define a minimal set of components required for RNP motility in vitro. They then systematically dissect the requirements for RNP assembly, which identifies a crucial and unexpected role for the mRNA cargo. A combination of single-molecule motility assays and rigorous biochemical analysis allows the authors to present an insightful model for motile RNP assembly, which postulates that overcoming the autoinhibited state of BicD requires the binding of two Egl proteins to a BicD dimer, and that the Egl-BicD interaction is stabilized by mRNA binding to Egl.</p><p>All three reviewers are excited by the manuscript and recognize that the results represent a very important advance in our mechanistic understanding of polarized mRNA transport.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #3 raised a concern related to the stoichiometry of the RNA in the complex. After an open discussion of the manuscript and of the comments, Reviewers #1 and #2 agreed that this point is very important in terms of understanding the nature of the complex and that it requires further attention.</p><p>• Figure 6B shows that BICD2 and Egl are fully complexed under the conditions used for SEC-MALS (since the Egl/BICD2 peak does not show a BICD2-like shoulder). This suggests that the RNA (<italic>ILS</italic>) is not required to recruit (at least some) Egl to BICD2. However, the SDS-PAGE below shows that more Egl is present in the larger complexes when <italic>ILS</italic> is added. This raises a few questions:</p><p>1) How much more Egl is recruited to BICD2 in the presence of <italic>ILS</italic>? Given that the authors have all the components purified, they should be able to quantitate a gel like that shown in this figure and use standards to determine the stoichiometry. Is there a single Egl in the Egl/BICD2 complex with a second one recruited by the <italic>ILS</italic>?</p><p>2) Since the <italic>ILS</italic> is present in a 10-fold molar excess in these experiments, why do the authors think it does not compete in what appears to be an <italic>ILS</italic>-mediated recruitment of additional Egl to the Egl/BICD2 complex?</p><p>• The data in Figure 7 suggest that a significant fraction of the transport complexes contain two RNAs. Figure 7B-E show that about 40% of complexes contain BICD2s and Egls with different dyes. Since one would expect 50% of the dimers to have two colors, this means that 80% of the complexes have two copies of BICD2, or Egl. Figure 7F,G shows that only 14% of complexes have RNAs with different dyes, meaning that 28% of complexes have two RNAs. Given all the data shows elsewhere in the paper, we can assume that those 28% of complexes come from the 80% containing two BICD2s and Egl. Therefore, 35% (28/80% ) of motile complexes have two RNAs. This does not seem to me to be &quot;substantially lower&quot; than the 65% of complexes that would have one RNA and two BICD2s and Egls, as the authors state. The composition of the activated transport complex is a major point of this work and thus I think this stoichiometry needs to be worked out more convincingly.</p><p>• It would be useful to include scrambled <italic>ILS</italic> controls for the SE-AUC and SEC-MALS, or at least the SEC-MALS if the SE-AUC is more demanding experimentally. Right now there is nothing in these experiments to rule out non-specific binding.</p><p>• The distribution of velocities in Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 all show increases in velocity in the presence of RNA. However, these distributions appear bimodal, with low and high velocity populations. It seems it would be very useful, from a mechanistic point of view, to establish whether the RNA-induced increase in velocity is due to a shift of transport complexes from the slower to the faster population, without changing the velocities of each population. Since the general observation that dynein is faster in the presence of the RNA would not change, this is not a weakness of the manuscript, but if additional analysis of the data could answer the question it would add to it. Could this be an indication of a second dynein being recruited to the transport complex?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36312.056</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #3 raised a concern related to the stoichiometry of the RNA in the complex.

This conclusion is supported by the mean masses of the complexes measured in the absence of RNA compared to the BICD2 only sample, as well as the gel images. It is unfortunate that we did not make it clear in our first submission that these data are not consistent with a fixed stoichiometry of a BICD2 dimer and a single Egl in the absence of RNA. Rather, the relatively small increase in mean molar mass of the peak fraction compared to the BICD2 only sample, together with the gel images, indicates a mixture of complexed Egl/BICD2 (of indeterminate stoichiometry) and a large excess of free BICD2 dimer. The homogeneous values for mean molar mass across this peak and the lack of a BICD2-like shoulder suggest rapid association and dissociation of the minority Egl population with BICD2 dimers.</p><p>Similarly, although there is a clear overall increase in the occupancy of BICD2 with Egl in Figure 6B when RNA is present, the data do not support a uniform recruitment of two Egl proteins per BICD2 dimer. The broad range of mean masses across the Egl/BICD2 peak indicates that our experimental conditions captured an equilibrating mixture of different constituent species, which is likely to include both single and double occupancy of Egl with BICD2. Since these species were not sufficiently resolved by SEC (presumably due to relatively small differences in size/shape and/or rapid exchange), the MALS analysis provided the abundance-weighted mean mass of all of the species throughout the peak rather than masses of discrete states of complexation. Similar situations have been observed in SEC-MALS analysis of self-associating systems (e.g. van Breugel et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014 (PMID: 24596152)).</p><p>We have now modified the sections of the Results describing our SEC-MALS experiments (from the last paragraph of the subsection “The RNA localisation signal stabilises the Egl/BicD complex”) and the Figure 6 legend to clarify the key points discussed above.</p><p>The major conclusion we draw from the SEC-MALS experiments is that RNA pushes existing equilibria in favour of the occupancy of the BICD2 dimer with Egl (as illustrated in Figure 8). An important prediction of this model is that the equilibria can be shifted by modulating the concentration of Egl/BICD2. We now include additional data from a SEC-MALS experiment with a series of Egl/BICD2 concentrations (Figure 6D), which show that this is indeed the case.</p><p>As the reviewer indicates, a quantitative representation of this shift can be derived from gel images of peak SEC-MALS fractions. Making these measurements highly quantitative would require standards of Egl alone, which we were unable to purify (as now documented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B). We are, however, able to measure the intensity of Egl bands relative to BICD2 bands from the peak fractions in the presence and absence of the <italic>ILS</italic>, providing an estimate of the relative increase in Egl signal when the RNA is present. This analysis is included in the legend to Figure 6. To further demonstrate the RNA-mediated increase in Egl/BICD2 association, we also include gel images from a new SEC-MALS experiment with lower ionic strength buffer (Figure 6—figure supplement 4B). The quantitative comparison of Egl to BICD2 signals in the gels is included in the legend.</p><p>Although the upper limits of the mean molar masses of mixtures of Egl, BICD2 and <italic>ILS</italic> in the SECMALS data are compatible with a fraction of complexes containing two Egl molecules and a BICD2 dimer, the analysis of single transport complexes in Figure 7 is much better suited to analyse protein copy number (a point we now make in the first paragraph of the subsection “The copy numbers of RNA, Egl and BicD in active transport complexes”). We believe that the analysis of protein copy number in active transport complexes in Figure 7 has been strengthened significantly as a result of the feedback from the reviewers (please see below). We now also present evidence from SEC-MALS that free Egl is indeed monomeric (Figure 6—figure supplement 3), which helps clarify possible mechanisms of RNA-mediated assembly of active adaptor protein complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since the ILS is present in a 10-fold molar excess in these experiments, why do the authors think it does not compete in what appears to be an ILS-mediated recruitment of additional Egl to the Egl/BICD2 complex?</p></disp-quote><p>As our data suggest dynamic association/dissociation of Egl and BICD2 it seems likely that the RNA-free Egl that is bound to BICD2 will be replaced with <italic>ILS</italic>-bound Egl. However, RNA-free and RNA-bound Egl complexes cannot be discriminated in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The data in Figure 7 suggest that a significant fraction of the transport complexes contain two RNAs.

The composition of the activated transport complex is a major point of this work and thus I think this stoichiometry needs to be worked out more convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we did not adequately explain the implications of a small fraction of unlabelled protein for the interpretation of this experiment. As stated only in the Materials and methods, we achieved 90% of SNAP polypeptides labelled with a dye with our optimised procedures. Thus, the expected fraction of complexes that are dual-labelled assuming an obligate dimer is 0.405 ((0.9x0.9)/2). Our data therefore fit very well with there being two Egl polypeptides and two BICD2 polypeptides in almost all active transport complexes. We now explain this point in the Results (subsection “The copy numbers of RNA, Egl and BicD in active transport complexes”, second and third paragraphs), and include tables illustrating the calculations (Supplementary file 1 and 2).</p><p>To more accurately assess the fraction of transported complexes that contain two RNAs in the experiments documented in Figure 7F,G, we have now calculated the labelling efficiency of the labelled <italic>hairy</italic> RNA samples. Correcting for these values, our data indicate that 30% of motile complexes have two RNAs and 70% have one RNA (summarized in the Results, in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “The copy numbers of RNA, Egl and BicD in active transport complexes”, with supporting calculations in Supplementary file 3). We think that this is a substantial difference but do not make this point explicitly in light of the reviewer’s comment. The key conclusion is that transport of a single mRNA molecule by a complex containing two Egl molecules is not only possible but occurs frequently. This conclusion is consistent with our previous work showing that a single RNA can be transported by the native complex in an extract-based motility assay (Amrute-Nayak and Bullock, 2012; Soundararajan and Bullock, 2014) (cited in the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p>We have also clarified the basis of the association of two RNA molecules with a single transport complex by performing dual colour analysis of a mixture of Cy3-<italic>hairy</italic> and Cy5-<italic>hairy</italic> in the absence of the proteins. We find a very low incidence of co-localisation of these RNAs. This result indicates that in our motility assay, in which the RNA is present in a large molar excess, the presence of a second RNA in a subset of complexes is due to association with a protein(s) in the complex. This interaction was presumably blocked in our previous studies with extracts, as we always observed one RNA per transport complex. This observation calls into the question the physiological relevance of the binding of an additional RNA molecule. We have further analysed the data presented in Figure 7F and G to assess what affect, if any, the presence of multiple RNAs has on motility. Although there is a small effect on run length, the velocity distribution of complexes containing both Cy3-<italic>hairy</italic> and Cy5-<italic>hairy</italic> is very similar to that of complexes with signal from a single fluorophore. Thus, the presence of an additional RNA does not have substantial functional consequences for transport. We have included these analyses as Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and 3 and have revised the manuscript accordingly (see the aforementioned paragraph).</p><p>We believe that the new analyses strengthen significantly the section of the manuscript on the composition of active transport complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It would be useful to include scrambled ILS controls for the SE-AUC and SEC-MALS, or at least the SEC-MALS if the SE-AUC is more demanding experimentally. Right now there is nothing in these experiments to rule out non-specific binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The SE-AUC experiments require large amounts of protein, instrument time and analysis, which would indeed make this experiment very demanding. We have therefore taken up the option of performing this specificity control in the SEC-MALS format. We show in a new panel (Figure 6C) that the scrambled RNA elicits a relatively small shift in molar mass of Egl/BICD2 compared to the <italic>ILS</italic>. Our data indicate there is some interaction of the mutant RNA, which is in a 10-fold molar excess, with Egl/BICD2. This does not surprise us based on previous evidence that Egl is not a highly selective RNA-binding protein (Bullock et al., 2006; Dienstbier et al., 2009; Dix et al., 2013) (subsection “The RNA localisation signal stabilises the Egl/BicD complex”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The distribution of velocities in Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 all show increases in velocity in the presence of RNA.

Although it is possible to fit two Gaussian distributions to the data, we do not find the fits compelling. We therefore think it would not be appropriate to include them in the manuscript. We intend to investigate the potential role of dynein copy number in RNA transport in a separate study. We draw attention to the possible influence of dynein copy number in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
