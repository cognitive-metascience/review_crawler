Extensive research has focused on pathways that activate mTORC1 like growth factors and amino acids; however, much less is known about signaling cues that directly inhibit mTORC1 activity. Here, we report that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) paired to Gα<sub>s</sub> proteins increase cyclic adenosine 3’5’ monophosphate (cAMP) to activate protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibit mTORC1. Mechanistically, PKA phosphorylates the mTORC1 component Raptor on Ser 791, leading to decreased mTORC1 activity. Consistently, in cells where Raptor Ser 791 is mutated to Ala, mTORC1 activity is partially rescued even after PKA activation. Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs stimulation leads to inhibition of mTORC1 in multiple cell lines and mouse tissues. Our results uncover a signaling pathway that directly inhibits mTORC1, and suggest that GPCRs paired to Gα<sub>s</sub> proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for human diseases with hyperactivated mTORC1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>cells</kwd><kwd>cancer cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

coordinating anabolic and catabolic processes to control cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. Sufficient nutrients fuel anabolism such as protein synthesis, whereas nutrient deficiency results in catabolism like autophagy. When this sensing mechanism is lost, the end result can be unfavorable, often leading to human disease. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr kinase that is a key component of a complex referred to as mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), and is essential in cell growth regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jewell et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zoncu et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomes and Blenis, 2015</xref>). Elevated mTORC1 activity is typically seen in many human diseases including cancer, obesity, type two diabetes, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders. Besides mTOR, the mTOR Complex 1 comprises regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), which aids in mTOR substrate recognition; mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8; also known as GβL), which positively regulates mTORC1; and the two negative regulators of mTOR, 40 kDa proline-rich AKT substrate (PRAS40; also referred to as AKT1S1) and DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR). As the mTOR name infers, a natural product called rapamycin targets and potently inhibits mTORC1. Because high mTORC1 activation is commonly seen in human disease, therapeutics like rapamycin and rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) that target and inhibit mTORC1, are currently being used in the clinic. However, there are many limitations to rapalogs, for example they are cytostatic rather than cytotoxic and fail to inhibit all mTORC1-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, by understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in mTORC1 regulation and inhibition, we can further our understanding of cell growth regulation and develop more efficient therapeutics.</p><p>Growth factors, amino acids, stress, and energy status are stimuli sensed by mTORC1. Amino acids are thought to be the most potent and are essential for mTORC1 activation. For example, growth factors cannot activate maximal mTORC1 activity when amino acids are limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). Through a mechanism not yet entirely clear, elevated amino acid concentrations are thought to promote mTORC1 lysosomal localization, where mTOR comes into close proximity and is activated by the small G-protein Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). Rheb is targeted to the lysosomal surface through the last 15 amino acids, including isoprenylation of its C-terminal CAAX (C = cysteine, A = aliphatic, X = terminal amino acid) box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Menon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). Growth factors activate Rheb and mTORC1 by inhibiting the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressor. TSC is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rheb and promotes Rheb-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis, converting Rheb into its inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tee et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, loss-of-function mutations in TSC hyperactivate mTORC1, resulting in TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carsillo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inoki and Guan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwiatkowski and Manning, 2005</xref>). Patients with TSC and LAM rely on rapamycin as a main pharmacological treatment.</p><p>The Rag GTPases were identified to couple amino acid signaling to mTORC1 activation at the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). In mammals there are four Rag genes: RagA and RagB have high sequence similarity and are functionally redundant, whereas RagC and RagD are highly related in sequence and also redundant. RagA or RagB forms a heterodimer with RagC and RagD, and this dimerization is imperative for mTORC1 activation and Rag protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>). RagA or RagB loaded with GTP interacts with the mTORC1 component Raptor at the lysosome. RagA or RagB GTP-bound forms a heterodimer with RagC or RagD loaded with GDP. Interestingly, RagC somatic gain of function missense mutations are found in approximately 17% of patients with follicular lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okosun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cyclic adenosine 3’5’ monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger with diverse physiological functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rocha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumaz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho-Chung, 1990</xref>). Upstream of cAMP are seven transmembrane domain receptors called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which like cAMP have been linked to the development of cancer and have been found highly expressed in multiple cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lappano and Maggiolini, 2011</xref>). The human genome has over eight hundred GPCR members, which are among the most heavily investigated drug targets in pharmaceutical industry, comprising well over 27% of all FDA-approved drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Overington et al., 2006</xref>). Heterotrimeric G-proteins are coupled to GPCRs, and consist of an α-subunit that binds and hydrolyzes GTP as well as β- and a γ-subunits that form a stable complex . GPCRs paired to Gαs proteins are activated in response to their corresponding ligand or hormone and increase cAMP levels. For example, epinephrine or glucagon increases intracellular cAMP levels through interaction with the β2 adrenergic receptor or glucagon receptor, respectively. Ligand-GPCR interaction causes a GPCR conformational change promoting Gαs to be GTP-bound, resulting in dissociation of Gαs from the β- and γ-subunits. The free GTP-bound Gαs then binds to and activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes conversion of ATP to cAMP. Increased cAMP concentrations can lead to activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, guanine exchange proteins activated by cAMP (EPAC), popeye domain containing proteins (Popdc), or protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altarejos and Montminy, 2011</xref>). In the absence of cAMP, PKA is an enzymatically inactive tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>). Downstream of GPCR-Gαs signaling, cAMP activates PKA by cooperatively binding to the regulatory subunits, leading to release and activation of the catalytic subunits. When PKA is activated, it phosphorylates a variety of substrates, preferably on the recognition motif Arg-Arg-X-Ser/Thr-Y (RRXS/TY), where Y tends to be a hydrophobic residue, and Ser/Thr are the phosphorylatable residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taylor et al., 2008</xref>). PKA substrates play diverse roles in multiple signaling cascades and different tissues.</p><p>In this study, we report that GPCRs coupled to Gαs proteins can inhibit mTORC1 activity in multiple cell lines and in mice. GPCR-Gαs signaling increases intracellular cAMP levels to activate PKA, and PKA phosphorylates the mTORC1 component Raptor at Ser 791. Functionally, phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser 791 leads to a decrease in mTORC1 signaling and mTORC1-mediated biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><bold>G</bold>α<bold>s-coupled GPCRs increase cAMP to inhibit mTORC1 activation and protein synthesis</bold></title><p>Despite extensive research mapping signaling cascades that activate mTORC1 like amino acids and growth factors, less is known about signals that can directly inhibit mTORC1. By performing a small GPCR screen, we found that overexpression of GPCRs coupled to Gαs proteins in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293A) potently inhibited mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, expression of the Gαs-coupled GPCRs such as the adrenergic receptor, dopamine receptor D1, and glucagon receptor inhibited mTORC1 activity. In contrast, some GPCRs not coupled to Gαs proteins increased mTORC1 activity, like frizzled homolog D4, lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5, purinergic receptors 1 and 9, and thrombin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Because activation of Gαs-coupled GPCRs increased intracellular cAMP, we treated cells with forskolin, a pharmacological activator of adenylyl cyclase. HEK293A cells were treated with or without forskolin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and mTORC1 activity was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). mTORC1 activity was measured by phosphorylation of S6K at Thr 389, a well-characterized mTORC1 substrate. Phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) at Ser 133 is a direct target of PKA downstream of GPCR-Gαs-cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989</xref>).

To assess whether or not the v-ATPase was involved in mTORC1 inhibition by PKA, we investigated lysosomal acidification in the presence or absence of forskolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). MEF cells were treated with or without forskolin and v-ATPase function and lysosomal pH was monitored using Lysotracker, a fluorescent dye used to label acidic organelles. The lysosomal pH was unchanged in forskolin-treated cells when compared to untreated cells. In contrast and as expected, the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin increased lysosomal pH when compared to untreated cells.

The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 was slightly elevated under normal conditions in the Raptor S791A mutant cells when compared to wild-type cells, and the levels of Raptor-S791A and mTOR protein were reduced in the two independent clones when compared to wild-type HEK293A cells. Importantly, forskolin treatment did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling in the Raptor S791A mutant cells to the same degree as in control cells as indicated by the higher phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4EBP1, two physiological mTORC1 substrates. Treatment of HEK293A cells with forskolin decreased mTORC1 activity ~70% (pS6K1 decreased ~72% and p4EBP1 decreased ~65%) in the control cells. In Raptor S791A mutant cells, forskolin treatment decreased mTORC1 activity anywhere from ~19 to 50% (S791A-1 clone: pS6K1 decreased ~45% and p4EBP1 decreased ~19%; S791A-2 clone: pS6K1 decreased ~50% and p4EBP1 decreased ~31%).

Here, we report that Gαs-coupled GPCR signaling cascades directly regulate mTORC1 function. GPCRs coupled to Gαs increase cAMP levels and activate PKA, which potently inhibits the activation of mTORC1, protein synthesis, and cell proliferation in multiple cell lines. Our data indicate that PKA directly phosphorylates Raptor on Ser 791. This phosphorylation contributes to functional inhibition of mTORC1 i<italic>n vivo</italic>, although the mTORC1 protein kinase activity may not be directly inhibited by Raptor Ser 791 phosphorylation. It is worth noting that the Raptor S791A knock-in HEK293A cell lines did not completely block PKA-induced mTORC1 inhibition. It is possible that PKA phosphorylates another substrate in addition to Raptor at Ser 791 inhibiting mTORC1. Future studies are needed to reveal the precise mechanism of Ser 791 phosphorylation in mTORC1 functional regulation.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that increased cAMP levels can regulate mTORC1; however, the exact mechanistic insights are not clear and these studies lack physiological <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scott and Lawrence, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monfar et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, it has been known for some time that increased cAMP levels have anti-proliferative effects in many cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rocha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumaz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naderi et al., 2005</xref>). Epinephrine signaling through the β2 adrenergic receptor, agonists binding to the β1 adrenergic receptor, glucagon signaling through the glucagon receptor, and vasopressin signaling through the vasopressin receptor inhibit mTORC1 activity in cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, glucagon was reported in 1962 as the first hormone to stimulate autophagy in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashford and Porter, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deter and De Duve, 1967</xref>). Later, it was also reported that epinephrine could promote autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mortimore and Pösö, 1987</xref>). When mTORC1 activity is high it inhibits autophagy directly through the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser 758 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is possible that glucagon and epinephrine signaling may promote autophagy through phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser 791 and subsequent mTORC1 inhibition. Because GPCRs are excellent biological targets and are highly druggable, we believe that our results may have important implications for inhibiting mTORC1 function in cancer cells. Furthermore, in addition to agonists that activate Gαs-coupled GPCRs, other FDA-approved drugs alter cAMP levels. For example, many phosphodiesterase inhibitors are currently used in the clinic.</p><p>Raptor Ser 791, an evolutionally conserved residue, resides in the WD40 region of Raptor, a domain well known to facilitate and assemble multi-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Min, 2011</xref>). Recently, it was reported that PKA phosphorylates Raptor at Ser 791 to promote mTORC1 activation in 3T3L-1 adipocytes and adipose browning in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). We do not have a simple explanation for the discrepancy. Multiple studies likewise show that elevated cAMP levels may lead to activation of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancquaert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). It is worth noting that cAMP is growth inhibitory in many cell lines, but also can be growth stimulatory in other cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rocha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumaz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scott and Lawrence, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monfar et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Naderi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blancquaert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Different tissues and cell types may behave differently to cAMP levels in respect to mTORC1 signaling. However, it is worth noting that in ~12 different cell lines we have tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), increased cAMP levels always inhibited mTORC1 activity. β-adrenergic signaling in respect to mTORC1 regulation may change in different cell types. Therefore, it appears clear that Gαs-coupled GPCRs activate PKA to phosphorylate Raptor on Ser 791, altering the regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC1-mediated processes.</p><p>Raptor has previously been reported to be phosphorylated by other kinases such as AMPK and Nemo-like kinase (NLK). In low energy conditions, AMPK directly phosphorylates Raptor at Ser 792 to induce 14-3-3 binding to Raptor and mTORC1 inhibition. Because Raptor Ser 791 is adjacent to Ser 792, it is possible that Raptor Ser 791 phosphorylation similarly inhibits mTORC1. However, increased PKA activation does not appear to enhance Raptor-14-3-3 binding in HEK293A cells (data not shown). Additionally, Raptor was recently shown to be phosphorylated by NLK at Ser 863 in response to osmotic and oxidative stress signals, leading to a decrease in mTORC1 lysosomal localization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). It is conceivable to think that mTORC1 regulation by negative signals may converge on Raptor to block the activity of mTORC1 rapidly and efficiently. Therefore, Raptor like TSC, appears to mediate signaling cascades in which mTORC1 is inhibited. We feel that the observations presented here have important implications in nutrient sensing, cell growth control, the mTORC1 field, and cancer biology in general. Because mTORC1 is hyperactivated in many human diseases, targeting Gαs-coupled GPCRs or phosphodiesterases with FDA-approved drugs may be beneficial in inhibiting mTORC1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were purchased from Cell signaling and used at the indicated dilution for western blot analysis: phospho-S6K1 (#9234, 1:1000), S6K1 (#9202, 1:1000), 4EBP1 (#9452, 1:000), pCREB (#9198, 1:1000), CREB (#9197, 1:1000), pULK1 (#6888, 1:1000), pAKT (#4058, 1:1000), AKT (#9272, 1:1000), pAMPK (#2535, 1:1000), AMPK (#5831, 1:1000), pACC (#11818, 1:1000), ACC (3676, 1:1000#), pERK (#9101), ERK (#9102, 1:1000), mTOR (#2983, 1:1000), Raptor (#2280, 1:1000), PRAS40 (#2610, 1:1000), mLST8 (#3227, 1:1000), Deptor (#11816, 1:1000), RagA (#4357, 1:1000, also recognizes RagB), RagC (#3360, 1:1000), TSC1 (#6935, 1:1000), pPKA Sub (RRXS*/T*) (#9624, 1:1000), and PKA Cat α/β (#4782, 1:1000).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cyclic AMP inhibits mTORC1 via PKA phosphorylation of Raptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reports that GPCRs paired to Gαs inhibit mTOR via cAMP generation and PKA activation. The authors further show that the mTORC1 component Raptor is phosphorylated by PKA on Ser 791, which may be responsible for mTORC1 inhibition. This work identifies a signaling pathway that inhibits mTORC1 activity and provides potential therapeutic implications for mTORC1-related diseases. There are several points that should be addressed or clarified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The link between PKA-mediated Raptor phosphorylation and cAMP-induced mTORC1 inhibition need to be further substantiated. Shown in Figure 6E and F, the K791A knock-in 293 cells seem to have limited effect on preventing the effects of PKA activation on mTOR signaling. This needs to be clarified or further investigated. For example, the exact genotype of these cells should be clearly defined. 293 cells have a complex karyotype (hypotriploid according to ATCC website). Do all copies contain the desired mutation? Or maybe that wildtype alleles remain or small insertions/deletions arise from non-homologous end joining?</p><p>How the percentage of pS6K1 or p4EBP1 is calculated should be explained, and the total protein level of 4EBP1 should be included. Additional mTOR downstream targets such as pULK1 or autophagy should be tested. Cell numbers counted in Figure 6F should be examined in the presence and absence of forskolin.</p><p>2) As PKA and AMPK phosphorylation occurs on adjacent serine residues in Raptor, a potential coordination of the two signaling pathways should be examined.</p><p>Does phosphorylation of Raptor S791 create a 14-3-3 binding site and/or interfere with the binding site generated by AMPK-dependent phosphorylation on S792?</p><p>Is pAMPK signal elevated in Figure 1—figure supplement 2? Images with shorter exposure time should be provided. The effect of forskolin treatment on mTORC1 activity should be tested in AMPK knock out cells or in Raptor S792A knock-in cells.</p><p>3) How PKA phosphorylation of Raptor inhibits mTORC1 activity warrants further investigation or explanation. What is the implication of impaired mTORC1 signaling without an effect on mTORC1 lysosome recruitment in response to PKA activity? Does Raptor phosphorylation on S791 affect interactions between Raptor and Rags?</p><p>Does S791A affect the stability of Raptor? Shown in Figure 6E, the protein levels of mTOR and Raptor reduced greatly in K791A cell lines.</p><p>4) Others.mTOR staining on lysosomes should be quantified in Figure 4A. In addition, western blotting in Figure 4A shows that protein level of CREB is significantly elevated in the presence of forskolin, which appears to be contradictory to other data in the manuscript.</p><p>A constitutively active RagA/B should be tested in Figure 2 to show cAMP inhibits mTORC1 downstream of RagGTPases.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;GPCR signaling inhibits mTORC1 via PKA phosphorylation of Raptor&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate that you have made a substantial effort to address the comments and criticisms of the first review round. We have assessed this revised version with consultation with the two original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The reviewers remained concerned about the effect of Raptor S791A.</p><p>a) The explanation of the genotyping of the HEK293 cell lines with the S791A knockin mutation needs to be further clarified as pointed out by reviewer 2 as follows:</p><p>The explanation of the genotyping of the HEK293 cell lines with the S791A knockin mutation remains vague. No details are provided concerning how the genotyping was performed. As a result, it is not possible for me to evaluate the claims that the authors were successful in introducing the desired mutation into all copies of the Raptor gene. This has an impact on deciding how to interpret the findings that the S791A mutation only partially protects mTORC1 signaling from PKA-dependent inhibition. The expectation is that these cells have 3 copies of the Raptor gene. How was it determined that all three contain the S791A mutation? If there is heterogeneity in the mutations at this locus, what effect does this have on interpretation of the results.</p><p>b) Quantification analyses should be provided in Figure 6—figure supplement 5A and in Figure 6F.</p><p>c) The total protein level of 4EBP1 should be provided in Figure 6E, as pointed out by reviewer 3 in the first review round.</p><p>d) The issue regarding CREB protein level in Figure 4A should be addressed experimentally.</p><p>2) Given that Raptor S791 phosphorylation only partially explains the effect of PKA on mTORC1, this point should be clearly indicated in the Abstract.</p><p>3) The result that Forskolin treatment did not lead to increase in Raptor-14-3-3 binding should be acknowledged and discussed (even without showing the data). The current discussion related to this point is in fact contradictory to this result.</p><p>4) The statistical analyses should be explained more clearly in both figure legends and in the Materials and methods part, including tests that were used to calculate p-vaules and meanings of the error bars (SD or SEM). Moreover, it would be more informative if individual data points in addition to mean and error bars are shown with the graphs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43038.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The link between PKA-mediated Raptor phosphorylation and cAMP-induced mTORC1 inhibition need to be further substantiated.

Below are the sgRNA sequences, templates, and primers used for sequencing. <underline>[…]</underline> We screened ~70-80 clonal cell lines by sequencing, and only had 1 homologous (all 3 alleles repaired the same way) knock-in cell line for each guide (referred to as S791A-1 and S791A-2 in the manuscript).”</p><p>Our knock-in cells only show a single peak in the sequencing chromograph, suggesting they are homozygous knock-ins (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">3</xref>). We believe that RPTOR has 3 alleles in HEK293A cells because we saw some clonal cell lines repair 3 different ways from some of our other sequencing results (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref> as an example).
