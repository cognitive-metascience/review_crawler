The relative recruitment of inhibitory and excitatory neurons within an area controls the gain of neurons for appropriate stimulus coding. We examined how such a balance of inhibition and excitation is differentially recruited across multiple levels of a cortical hierarchy by mapping the locations and strengths of synaptic inputs to pyramidal and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons in feedforward and feedback pathways interconnecting primary (V1) and two higher visual areas. While interareal excitation was stronger in PV than in pyramidal neurons in all layer 2/3 pathways, we observed a gradual scaling down of the inhibition/excitation ratio from the most feedforward to the most feedback pathway. Our results indicate that interareal gain control depends on the hierarchical position of the source and the target, the direction of information flow through the network, and the laminar location of target neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19332.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19332.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19332.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The visual cortex is the part of the brain responsible for the conscious sense of vision. It is made up of multiple connected areas, and each area has a different expertise for analyzing images. The areas exchange information about the outside world via connections between cells called neurons. Communication between the areas works like a hierarchy with deeper, more connected areas in the brain extracting more complex information from a visual scene.</p><p>Communication in the cortex requires repeated stimulation or “excitation” of pathways of neurons; this risks damage or loss of sensitivity. But all of the communication in the hierarchy is excitatory, meaning that a signal from one area activates other areas in the visual cortex. So, how does the brain avoid becoming over-stimulated? The answer is that connections between the areas of the visual cortex also contact inhibitory neurons that suppress brain activity. However, it is not clear how the level of inhibition in different areas of the visual cortex is fine-tuned to avoid over-stimulation while maintaining accurate perception of vision.</p><p>D’Souza et al. now report how three distinct areas of the mouse visual cortex communicate to process visual signals. The approach involved making particular pathways of neurons sensitive to light, such that they could be activated separately with a laser. Next, D’Souza et al. measured the activity of both inhibitory and excitatory neurons that link the different brain areas. The experiments showed that the inhibitory neurons are more strongly activated in the areas of the brain that are further up the hierarchy. This indicates that our ability to make sense of more complex features of visual signals requires higher levels of inhibitory control. The next step is to examine how the brain activates and controls inhibitory neurons, and how this depends on the situation an animal is in and the task it is performing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19332.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19332.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>extrastriate cortex</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin interneurons</kwd><kwd>circuit mapping</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY016184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkhalter</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009607</institution-id><institution>McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkhalter</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY022090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkhalter</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The relative recruitment of excitatory and inhibitory neurons by cortico-cortical interareal pathways depends on the hierarchy of areas and the laminar location of the neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visual perception and visually guided actions result from the coordinated neuronal communication between multiple, functionally diverse areas of visual cortex. Within visual cortex, interareal communication is achieved through the axons of pyramidal (Pyr) cells carrying feedforward (FF) information from lower to higher areas and feedback (FB) signals through ‘top-down’ connections descending across the hierarchy of visual areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>). How neurons within such a highly interconnected network and increasing densities of inputs at higher levels of the cortical hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elston, 2003</xref>) maintain stimulus-specificity without saturating their spike output has been studied by modelling the effects of inhibitory synaptic inputs and by recording the balance of excitation and inhibition in local networks of sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pouille et al., 2009</xref>). However, the rules by which the inhibition/excitation (I/E) balance changes along processing pathways from early to deep stages of the brain and back are incompletely understood.</p><p>In the rodent visual system, interareal FF and FB pathways communicate through excitatory synapses contacting Pyr and GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson and Burkhalter, 1996</xref>). In the target area, both cell types are reciprocally connected by a fine-scale circuit embedded within the global network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Although interareal FF and FB connections terminate on multiple types of GABAergic neurons, most of them synapse onto PV-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hangya et al., 2014</xref>), which provide feedforward inhibition (FFI) to local Pyr cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>FFI is a common functional motif throughout the brain, capable of regulating the I/E balance and thereby influencing the gain, the integration window, and the temporal precision of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardin et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to the thalamocortical and local circuits in mouse barrel cortex and in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>), FFI is also involved in interareal communication across the visual cortical hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, our studies in mouse visual cortex have shown that FF input to Pyr cells is more strongly counterbalanced by inhibition than FB input, suggesting pathway-specific differences in the gain and dynamic range of recurrent excitation involved in cortical computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okun and Lampl, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that higher relative inhibition in FF than in FB pathways is part of a more general rule of cortico-cortical communication. We studied the strengths of FF and FB inputs interconnecting mouse V1 with Pyr and PV neurons in the extrastriate area PM (posteromedial) situated high in the hierarchy, and compared the I/E balance with input to and from the hierarchically intermediate area LM (lateromedial). Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and laser-scanning photostimulation of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing FF and FB connections in acute cortical slices, we show that the relative strength of excitatory input to Pyr and PV cells is pathway-specific and depends on the position of the source and target areas within the hierarchy. Interareal inputs to PV interneurons in upper layers, but not in lower layers, are stronger than to Pyr cells, and the asymmetry of I/E balance was greater for V1 to PM than for LM to PM connections, suggesting weaker FFI by inputs from hierarchically higher areas. In support of the notion that pathways from sources deeper in the brain, which deliver input that vary over a narrower range than input from the outside world, would require lower levels of inhibitory control, we found that FFI is weaker in FB connections and weakest in FB input to V1, at the bottom of the hierarchy. Our findings therefore suggest that in FF and FB pathways targeting neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3), excitation is more strongly counterbalanced by inhibition and that the imbalance is gradually rectified according to hierarchical distance from the most feedforward to the most feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hierarchy between V1, LM and PM</title><p>To study interareal inhibition across different levels of the cortical architecture, we first asked whether the visual areas V1, LM and PM lie at distinct levels of an interconnected hierarchical network. To do this we traced the outputs from V1, LM and PM with the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and studied the laminar patterns of axon terminals in each of the visual cortical target areas: V1, LM, POR (postrhinal), AL (anterolateral), P (posterior), LI (laterointermediate), PM, AM (anteromedial), RL (rostrolateral) and A (anterior) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Projections were assigned to areas by their locations relative to retrogradely bisbenzimide-labeled callosal landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>), which we imaged in situ before sectioning the brain, and by their relative positions to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Sections were numbered from the posterior pole of cortex so that the callosal landmarks seen in the coronal plane could be matched to specific locations of the in situ pattern. BDA labeled fibers were then superimposed onto the callosal pattern observed in the same section, and projections were assigned to specific areas according to the map by Wang and Burkhalter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Optical density maps of projections showed striking laminar differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Although most projections involved L1-6, inputs from V1 consistently showed dense terminations in L2-4 of each of the higher areas with much sparser projections in L1. In contrast, projections from both LM and PM strongly targeted L1 of V1 while weakly targeting L2-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). The selective targeting of L1 by FB projections is consistent with observations in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rockland and Virga, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henry et al., 1991</xref>). To analyze these patterns quantitatively, we computed the density ratio (DR) of terminations in L2-4 to that in L1 of axons from V1, LM and PM to each of the other nine areas and plotted DRs in a 3 × 9 matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We reasoned that FF projections from lower areas would, on average, have a higher DR than FB projections from higher areas. The matrix showed that the average DRs in all targets of V1 were &gt;2.52 ± 0.31, whereas the DRs for projections to V1 were &lt;0.72 ± 0.08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Pairwise comparisons of average DRs of projections from each of V1, LM, and PM to the other areas showed significant (p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) differences, demonstrating that V1, LM and PM are at distinct hierarchical levels, with LM at the intermediate level between V1 and PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19332.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hierarchy between V1, LM, and PM.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Rostrocaudal series of coronal slices through the left hemisphere showing anterogradely labelled axonal projections (yellow/orange) after V1 was injected with BDA.

As a first step in the analysis of the recruitment of interareal inhibition, we first confirmed the role of PV interneurons in inhibiting neighboring Pyr cells. These experiments were performed in area PM, one of the targets of V1, in acute slices from mice in which PV cells expressed tdTomato (tdT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The axonal projections from V1 to PM were labeled by anterograde tracing with adeno associated virus (AAV) expressing a ChR2-Venus fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–f</xref>). PM is the posterior projection zone medial to the densely type 2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2)-expressing area V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). Similar to other cortical areas, PM contained tdT-PV cell bodies in L2-6, with axons and dendrites reaching into L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We performed paired recordings to examine whether increasing the excitation of PV cells results in stronger inhibition of neighboring synaptically connected Pyr cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). To do this, we evoked action potentials by injecting current steps (100, 200, 300, and 400 pA; 50 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c–f</xref>) into PV cells and recorded inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in connected Pyr cells. Similar to recordings in other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Packer and Yuste, 2011</xref>) we found a high connection probability. Recordings from PV and Pyr neurons within ~100 µm of each other resulted in 11/13 (84.6%) and 7/15 (46.6%) synaptically connected pairs in L2/3 and L5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2g</xref>).

To study connections in the FF<sub>V1→PM</sub> pathway, we expressed ChR2-Venus in axons projecting from V1 to PM, and recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from PV and Pyr cells centered at the peak of the PM projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing axon terminals was achieved by a 473 nm laser delivered one spot at a time in a grid pattern separated by 75 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Recordings were performed in the presence of 1 µm TTX (tetrodotoxin) and 50 µm 4-AP (4-aminopyridine) in the bath to block polysynaptic currents and repolarization of axon terminals, respectively. Resulting EPSCs were measured by whole cell patch clamp recordings from PV and Pyr neurons voltage-clamped at −70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We compared EPSCs between PV and Pyr neurons whose cell bodies were in the same layer of the same slice, within ~100 µm of each other.</p><p>In the L2/3 FF<sub>V1→PM</sub> pathway, EPSCs recorded from PV cells were larger than those from Pyr cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>). On average, the largest EPSCs were evoked from synaptic inputs to proximal dendrites at the bottom of L2/3 whereas inputs to distal dendrites were weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). The mean total current in PV cells was 12.85 ± 4.48-fold stronger than that in neighboring Pyr cells (p&lt;0.001, n = 14 pairs). To illustrate the relative excitation of PV and Pyr cells, we plotted the total EPSC in each PV cell against the total EPSC in its Pyr neighbor, and measured the mean slope for all such pairs in this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). We also computed the mean slope after normalizing the EPSC to the mean cell conductance to control for cell size. Similar to observations in thalamocortical and local circuits, the time to peak of EPSCs was significantly shorter in PV than in Pyr cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>; n = 14 pairs, p&lt;0.05, paired t-test), consistent with the notion that PV interneurons can be recruited more rapidly than Pyr neurons in diverse brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hull et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Povysheva et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether connections to PV and Pyr cells in the FB<sub>PM→V1</sub> pathway showed a different I/E balance.

In contrast to the FF<sub>V1→PM</sub> pathway, however, the excitation of PV cells in the FB<sub>PM→V1</sub> pathway was only 1.93 ± 0.44-fold stronger than Pyr cell excitation. Thus, the excitation of PV cells, relative to that of neighboring Pyr cells, was weaker in the FB<sub>PM→V1</sub> than in the FF<sub>V1→PM</sub> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>; n = 14 pairs for FF<sub>V1→PM</sub>, n = 21 pairs for FB<sub>PM→V1</sub>; p&lt;0.001), similar to previous observations in the L2/3 FF<sub>V1→LM</sub> and FB<sub>LM→V1</sub> pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). The larger EPSCs in PV cells could be a result of either a higher density of excitatory input or due to a larger area over which individual PV cells are contacted by interareal projections, or both.

The results in L2/3 support the notion that in FF and FB pathways, excitation is more strongly counterbalanced by inhibition and that the imbalance is gradually rectified according to hierarchical distance from the most FF to the most FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4j</xref>). The results further suggest that the hierarchical distance rule of normalization is independent of the absolute magnitude of EPSCs across the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). Our findings argue that excitation ascending across multiple hierarchical levels is gradually adjusted to keep the dynamic range of L2/3 Pyr cell firing constant and compensate for the increased density of synaptic input to Pyr cells in higher cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elston, 2003</xref>). Strong activation of PV neurons may narrow the window for effective excitation and result in high frequency gamma-band synchronization of activity found in FF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, in FB pathways excitation is weakly counterbalanced by inhibition, which may broaden the window for synaptic integration and result in slower synchronization frequencies found in FB communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, variation in I/E balance, through the differential recruitment of PV and Pyr neurons in different cortical pathways, is a key feature of distributed hierarchical processing.</p><p>Reciprocal connections between areas are a highly conserved feature of the mammalian cortex. However, the exact pattern of termination of FF and FB axonal projections in the target area appears to vary between species, particularly in the termination patterns of FF pathways in layers 2, 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price and Zumbroich, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1990</xref>). Despite these differences, a consistent observation among different species is a tendency for FF projections to avoid L1 and the selective targeting of L1 by FB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rockland and Virga, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henry et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cauller, 1995</xref>). We therefore used the average DR of axonal terminations in L2-4 to those in L1 to classify pathways on a sliding scale as being FF or FB. In this reference frame, V1, LM and PM constitute a clear hierarchy, which broadly matches that of rat visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>) and is consistent with the increasing size of receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). The hierarchical ordering of V1, LM and PM based on average DRs is consistent with the ordering based on the difference of DRs between reciprocally connected pairs. This is notable because differences in the laminar patterns of reciprocal projections between two areas have traditionally been used to arrange areas in a hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>). While our method of averaging DRs provides a hierarchy based on how individual visual areas project to every other area within the network, it is conceivable that such a hierarchical arrangement may not be consistent with defining pathways between every reciprocally connected pair of areas as being FF or FB by comparing the DRs of projections to each other. The absolute value of the difference between DRs of reciprocally connected areal pairs therefore remains an open issue for defining hierarchical distance and designating connections as FF, FB, or lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Cortical Pyr cells typically receive thousands of synaptic contacts, raising the question of how these neurons successfully generate graded spike outputs, without saturating their spike output, in response to varying levels of excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>). This problem is compounded by the need for deeper parts of the brain, which are further separated from the outside world than lower areas, to respond robustly and appropriately to sensory input varying in intensity over several orders of magnitude. Pertinently, Pyr cells in higher areas have been shown to have a higher density of dendritic spines than those in lower areas in both primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elston, 2003</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elston et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that Pyr neurons in higher areas must integrate a larger number of excitatory inputs. To maintain a wide dynamic range over which Pyr cells can signal, inhibitory neurons have been proposed to be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pouille et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, PV neurons normalize cortical activity by inhibiting Pyr cells by a level that is proportional to the latter’s excitation, thus controlling their gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Because they are strongly targeted by interareal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999</xref>), PV cells are also ideally suited to mediate long-range FFI between areas. Such an interareal inhibitory circuit would make Pyr cells coincidence-detectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>), leading to a reduction of noise levels and the preservation of temporal precision in the target area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Coincidence-detection has also been proposed to help achieve a wide dynamic range by allowing only a fraction of excitatory inputs to summate and evoke a spike response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>). Our observation that L2/3 PV cells are recruited most strongly by pathways transmitting signals from V1 to higher cortical areas imply that signals sent to deeper parts of the brain from more peripheral areas are more potently controlled by inhibition than pathways originating in higher areas. Such a high level of inhibition may be crucial in order for Pyr cells to efficiently integrate excitatory input from a large number of areas. On the other hand, lower I/E levels in FB pathways would broaden the 'window of opportunity' for spikes to be integrated and trigger an output in the postsynaptic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>), suggesting that FB signals originating in association cortex require less gain control than FF signals. Rather, by broadly modulating the excitability of neurons in lower areas (such as by targeting the primary dendrites of Pyr cells in L1/2), FB pathways are well-placed to prime Pyr cells to selectively respond to FF input in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larkum, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although synaptic inputs to L5 Pyr cells are also denser in higher areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elston and Rosa, 2000</xref>), we found that excitation of these neurons in FF and FB pathways is similar and appears to be less strongly counterbalanced by inhibition. This provides a putative mechanism for the previously observed sparse coding in L2/3 Pyr cells and dense excitation in intrinsically burst-spiking L5 Pyr cells, allowing for distinct computational strategies within individual neurons depending on their postsynaptic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hefti and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schubert et al., 2007</xref>). The laminar difference may indicate that, similar to thalamocortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>), interareal inputs to L5 are driving Pyr cells. This may enable interareal communication through cortico-thalamo-cortical loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</xref>) as well as with subcortical motor targets, thereby linking perception and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While PV neurons are a critical component of cortical gain control, it must be noted that they are only one of a number of inhibitory sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonchar et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, neocortical GABAergic interneurons that express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are thought to be an important target of long-range and neuromodulatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), and in turn, primarily inhibit other interneurons leading to disinhibition of cortical Pyr cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karnani et al., 2016</xref>). Somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons, which include Martinotti cells, make extensive inhibitory contacts with local Pyr cells, and can consequently mediate disynaptic inhibition between neighboring Pyr cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>). SOM neurons have also been shown to provide inhibitory inputs to other interneurons, including PV cells, suggesting a role in the disinhibition of Pyr cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). A perhaps surprising source of inhibition and disinhibition is glutamate. By activating pre- and postsynaptic metabotropic receptors in various neocortical circuits, glutamate release can induce suppression of GABA release and inhibition of L4 neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Sherman, 2009</xref>). Thus, multiple, partially overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonchar et al., 2007</xref>) sources of inhibition may be differentially recruited depending on context, providing a multilayered control of cortical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington University.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For analyzing projection patterns between cortical areas, we used 6–8 week-old C57BL/6J male and female mice.

To compare the total interareal input to pairs of PV and Pyr neurons in the target area, we summed the pixel values for each cell, and compared the total EPSC value of PV and Pyr neurons lying within ~100 µm of each other, either in L2/3 or in L5. For comparison of mean EPSCs per stimulation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we averaged pixel values with significant responses (&gt;4 times standard deviation of baseline) for each cell. For statistical analysis of differences of interareal input to PV and Pyr cells for a particular pathway, we generated scatter plots (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) in which each data point plotted the total EPSC<sub>sCRACM</sub> from a PV neuron (vertical axis) against the total EPSC<sub>sCRACM</sub> from its Pyr neighbor (horizontal axis). The solid black line in such a scatter plot was generated by connecting the origin (0, 0) to the geometric mean of all EPSC<sub>PV</sub>/EPSC<sub>Pyr</sub> ratios for the respective pathway. The solid blue line was plotted in a similar fashion, but after normalization to the average cell conductance. The non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparing total EPSCs between cell types within pairs. For average heat maps of multiple PV or Pyr neurons, we used a smoothening function in MATLAB that interpolates EPSC values between pixels.</p><p>All box plots show mean (black squares), median (horizontal line within box), 25–75 percentile range (horizontal lines bounding box) and outermost points within upper and lower inner fences (whiskers). The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare mean EPSC<sub>PV</sub>/EPSC<sub>Pyr</sub> ratios between pathways, while the One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for comparing the means of groups whose probability distributions were expected to be parametric. Statistical significance was p&lt;0.05. No statistical method was used to predetermine the number of neurons, slices, or animals used (sample size), but our sample sizes were consistent with other comparable experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Katia Valkova and Weiguo Yang for technical assistance.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pathway-specific recruitment of inhibition and excitation across the counterstream mouse visual cortical network&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Andrew King as the Senior Editor and three reviewers: Sandra Kuhlman (Reviewer #2); Ed Callaway (Reviewer #3), and Sacha B Nelson who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and important paper that explores anatomical and functional differences that help to both define and characterize feedforward (FF) versus feedback (FB) corticortical systems in the mouse visual cortex. How the relative recruitment of inhibitory and excitatory neurons is distributed across the visual hierarchy, both in terms of feedforward and top-down feedback is of great importance for constraining models of visual function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the reviewers was concerned by the absence of normalized input plots for FB connections to L5 neurons. Did this imply technical concerns with these data? If so, these should be discussed. If there are no such concerns it would probably be better to include the plots in Figure 7 to allow comparison with other figures.</p><p>2) The reviewers felt that it was important to modify the Discussion to acknowledge the caveat of other sources of inhibition not studied by focusing on parvalbumin positive interneurons.</p><p>3) The reviewers felt that the observation of delayed spiking following activation of interneurons added little. If indeed the authors would like to conclude that interareal connections for FFI form local subnetworks, more direct evidence such as anatomical connectivity, is required.</p><p>4) Revision of the title – the title is jargony and should be revised.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19332.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One of the reviewers was concerned by the absence of normalized input plots for FB connections to L5 neurons.

We have therefore replaced the old title which now reads: “Recruitment of inhibition and excitation across mouse visual cortex depends on the hierarchy of interconnected areas”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
