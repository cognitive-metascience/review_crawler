phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Despite an increase in glycolysis, however, here we show that non-transformed mouse fibroblasts also increase oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by nearly two-fold and mitochondrial coupling efficiency by ~30% during proliferation. Both increases are supported by mitochondrial fusion. Impairing mitochondrial fusion by knocking down mitofusion-2 (Mfn2) was sufficient to attenuate proliferation, while overexpressing Mfn2 increased proliferation. Interestingly, impairing mitochondrial fusion decreased OXPHOS but did not deplete ATP levels. Instead, inhibition caused cells to transition from excreting aspartate to consuming it. Transforming fibroblasts with the <italic>Ras</italic> oncogene induced mitochondrial biogenesis, which further elevated OXPHOS. Notably, transformed fibroblasts continued to have elongated mitochondria and their proliferation remained sensitive to inhibition of Mfn2. Our results suggest that cell proliferation requires increased OXPHOS as supported by mitochondrial fusion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41351.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cells in the body contain many small compartments called mitochondria.

The metabolic adaptation that has received the most attention is a phenomenon known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect, which is characterized by a high level of glucose consumption and a high rate of glucose fermentation to lactate irrespective of oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). Although the Warburg effect is recognized as a typical feature of dividing cancer cells and is the basis for imaging many tumors in the clinic with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>), it is also found in normal proliferating cells such as non-transformed fibroblasts, lymphocytes, macrophages, thymocytes, endothelial cells, and embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hedeskov, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hume et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Munyon and Merchant, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 1976</xref>). Accordingly, even in non-cancerous contexts, the Warburg effect has been classified as a hallmark of rapid proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Haleem et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although there is a general consensus that glycolytic flux increases in proliferating cells, the extent to which oxidative metabolism is altered has been historically complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Seyfried, 2015</xref>). Warburg originally proposed that cancer cells rely on enhanced glycolysis because of defects in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Warburg, 1956</xref>). Some cancers do have defective mitochondrial enzymes (e.g. succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase), but it is now well established that most proliferating cells (including cancer) have functional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn and Metallo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vyas et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, functional mitochondria are essential to the proliferation of some cell types. Studies have shown that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) may provide the majority of ATP during proliferation and function to support the synthesis of important molecular building blocks such as aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rodríguez-Enríquez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zu and Guppy, 2004</xref>). Elevated levels of OXPHOS, however, may not necessarily be required to fulfill such functions. To the contrary, many reports have suggested that proliferating cells suppress mitochondrial respiration and statements that glycolysis is preferred over OXPHOS during proliferation are prevalent in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Whitaker-Menezes et al., 2011</xref>). Certain cancers of the bladder, breast, and kidney are depleted of mitochondrial DNA and have decreased expression of respiratory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reznik et al., 2016</xref>). Some cancer cells exhibit high levels of mitochondrial fission and have associated decreases in respiratory capacity as mediated by an imbalance of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Chan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rehman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Serasinghe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xie et al., 2015</xref>). In other cases, increasing glucose oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase has been shown to slow the proliferation of transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonnet et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A challenge of quantitating changes in OXPHOS as a function of proliferation has been the confounding experimental factors that are often associated with cancer studies. Tumors contain non-proliferating cell types that may shift the average of metabolic measurements from bulk tissues. Additionally, cancer cells from tumors often have restricted access to oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brahimi-Horn et al., 2007</xref>). Although oxygen limitation can similarly lead to an enhanced glycolytic phenotype, this metabolic program is distinct from the Warburg effect. Finally, many studies have focused on the proliferative state of cancer cells without having an appropriately matched non-proliferating comparison with the same genetic background tested under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zu and Guppy, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In this study, to directly compare oxidative metabolism in the same cells of the quiescent and proliferative state, we exploited the cell-density-dependent phenotype of non-transformed fibroblasts. We find that even though proliferating fibroblasts exhibit enhanced glycolysis that is consistent with a Warburg phenotype, they also increase OXPHOS by nearly two-fold and increase their mitochondrial coupling efficiency by ~30%. Interestingly, both increases are supported by mitochondrial fusion. Although transformation with the <italic>Ras</italic> oncogene further elevated OXPHOS, the additional increase was supported by mitochondrial biogenesis rather than changes in mitochondrial dynamics. Blocking mitochondrial fusion slowed proliferation in both non-transformed and transformed cells. Taken together, our results indicate that proliferation of fibroblasts requires an increase in OXPHOS supported by mitochondrial fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proliferation increases oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial coupling efficiency</title><p>Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts are immortalized, non-transformed cells that retain sensitivity to contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green and Kehinde, 1975</xref>). They provide a simple, well-controlled model to compare metabolism in the proliferative and quiescent states, as has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yao et al., 2016a</xref>). The first step in our analysis was to verify that proliferating fibroblasts exhibit the Warburg effect. Relative to quiescent fibroblasts in the contact-inhibited state, proliferating cells had increased glucose consumption and lactate excretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, proliferating cells excreted a greater percentage of glucose as lactate (47%) compared to quiescent cells (32%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Of note, the absolute amount of glucose having a non-lactate fate was also increased by over two-fold in the proliferative state (0.38 pmol/cell/hr) relative to the quiescent state (0.16 pmol/cell/hr) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Given that proliferating cells are larger in size relative to quiescent cells, we also independently normalized the oxygen-consumption data by protein content instead of cell number. Even when normalized by protein content, the respiration rate of proliferating cells was ~59% higher than quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Intriguingly, proliferating cells also exhibited a decrease in proton leak and a ~ 112% increase in ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Taken together, the coupling efficiency of proliferating cells was determined to be 34% higher than quiescent cells. We note that the coupling efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the ATP production rate and the basal respiration rate, which is therefore independent of sample normalization method. These data suggest that proliferating fibroblasts with Warburg metabolism not only have increased OXPHOS, but also that they respire more efficiently.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Glutamine is the major carbon source for fueling the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration</title><p>We next aimed to investigate which carbon sources fuel mitochondrial respiration by analyzing the utilization of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids. In addition to increasing glucose consumption and lactate excretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), proliferating fibroblasts take up two-fold more glutamine compared to quiescent fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since the rate of glutamate excretion was unchanged, more glutamine carbon was being used for anaplerosis. We also found that the consumption rates of palmitate and oleate were increased in proliferation by 194% and 98%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Since proliferating fibroblasts showed increased utilization of all three nutrients we examined, we next applied stable isotope tracing and metabolomics to access the relative contribution of each carbon source to the TCA cycle. In three separate experiments, cells were fed either uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose (U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose), uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glutamine (U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine), or uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labeled palmitate (U-<sup>13</sup>C palmitate) for 6 hr. The isotope enrichments in citrate, a representative TCA cycle intermediate, were evaluated to infer the relative contribution of each carbon source to the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration. Even though proliferating cells consumed more glucose and more fatty acids, citrate labeling from these two carbon sources was significantly decreased in the proliferative state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, labeling of citrate by glutamine was substantial and significantly increased in proliferating cells relative to quiescent cells, suggesting that glutamine is a major energy source to fuel mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This result is consistent with reports from other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2013</xref>).

Both techniques showed that proliferating cells have elongated mitochondria, while mitochondria in quiescent cells were relatively short and fragmented. Quantitative analysis of 100 random mitochondria in each condition showed a statistically significant increase in the mitochondrial length of proliferating cells compared to quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

When we inhibited mitochondrial fusion by knocking down Mfn2, a protein required for the fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane, the elongated mitochondrial phenotype in proliferating fibroblasts was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To determine whether mitochondrial fusion is required for increased OXPHOS during proliferation, we compared the oxygen consumption rates of proliferating scrambled siRNA controls (SSC) to Mfn2 knockdowns (Mfn2<sup>KD</sup>). We point out that these comparisons were conducted when cells were in the proliferating exponential growth phase. Notably, Mfn2 knockdowns had a statistically significant decrease in respiration rate, ATP production, and mitochondrial coupling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>).

Consistent with the notion that energy is not limiting during proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Locasale and Cantley, 2011</xref>), we found that Ras cells had a higher intracellular level of ATP compared to EV controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In addition to increased ATP production, elevated OXPHOS activity in Ras cells also contributed to higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The associated oxidative stress could be buffered by treating Ras cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Alternatively, oxidative stress could be further induced by treating Ras cells with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). We suspected that the elevated levels of ROS in Ras cells may lead to increased DNA damage. We verified this to be the case by showing that Ras cells had increased phosphorylation on histone H2A.X (Ser139), which has been suggested as a sensitive marker for DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sharma et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>). These findings suggest that the increase in OXPHOS upon constitutive Ras activation leads to elevated oxidative stress and DNA damage, while not directly contributing to the anabolic demands of proliferation. Given the pleiotropic effects of <italic>Ras</italic> and other oncogenes, the generality of these findings to additional cell types will require further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most proliferating cells assume a metabolic phenotype known as the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>). Although the enhanced glycolytic characteristics of the Warburg effect are generally well established, metabolic changes associated with mitochondria have proven more challenging to interrogate. In part, this is because proliferation has largely been studied in the context of cancer where some experimental factors are complicated to control (e.g. tumor microenvironment, oxygen availability, genetics, proliferation, etc.). Here, we applied a well-controlled fibroblast model to quantify changes in mitochondrial respiration that occur in quiescent cells, non-transformed proliferating cells, and transformed proliferating cells.</p><p>Strikingly, despite the frequent assumption that increased glycolysis in cells exhibiting the Warburg effect is associated with decreased OXPHOS, we found that mitochondrial respiration increased by nearly two-fold in non-transformed proliferating cells relative to quiescent cells. Moreover, mitochondrial respiration increased by nearly another factor of two when the cells were transformed with H-<italic>Ras</italic>. We wish to point out that the regulatory mechanism for increasing respiration between quiescent and non-transformed proliferating cells was different from that between non-transformed and transformed cells. The quiescent to proliferating transition was supported by mitochondrial fusion without any increase in mitochondrial mass, whereas the non-transformed to transformed transition was supported by mitochondrial biogenesis without any further increase in mitochondrial elongation. Similar increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS upon Ras activation have been reported in other cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Funes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moiseeva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Telang et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to Ras, various other signaling pathways that regulate cellular proliferation (e.g. c-Myc and mTOR) have also been found to activate mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vyas et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, however, our data suggest that the proliferation rate of both non-transformed and transformed fibroblasts is dependent on mitochondrial fusion.</p><p>It is interesting to consider why OXPHOS is increased by mitochondrial fusion in proliferating cells. Since ATP levels actually increased when OXPHOS was impaired by Mfn2 knockdown, mitochondrial fusion does not seem to be required to support energetic demands. Instead, increased respiration during proliferation seems to be needed to recycle reducing equivalents in support of aspartate synthesis. Only after mitochondrial fusion was inhibited did cells start consuming aspartate from the media. Moreover, proliferation could be partially restored in Mfn2 knockdowns by supplementing cell media with aspartate. Building on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>), these data suggest not only that respiration is required to meet aspartate demands, but that a high level of OXPHOS may be necessary to fulfill this role. On the other hand, too much OXPHOS may be detrimental to cells. Increasing OXPHOS beyond the level observed in non-transformed proliferating fibroblasts with the H-<italic>Ras</italic> oncogene did not increase the rate of proliferation. Instead, the considerably higher levels of OXPHOS induced by mitochondrial biogenesis resulted in oxidative stress and DNA damage. These results suggest that, unlike the mechanisms that increase mitochondrial respiration in normal proliferating cells, Ras activation may promote additional malignant transformations by creating genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite the association between the Warburg effect and rapid proliferation, a rationalization for the preference of glycolysis over OXPHOS has proven elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>). A challenge has been explaining how the switch to a metabolic program that is less energetically efficient supports the synthetic burden of cell replication. Transformation of glucose to lactate yields only two moles of ATP per mole of glucose, whereas complete oxidation of glucose by the TCA cycle yields ~ 32 moles of ATP per mole of glucose. Hypotheses have emerged that proliferating cells sacrifice ATP yield from glucose for other advantages such as a high rate of ATP production, decreased volume of enzymatic machinery, or increased concentrations of macromolecular precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Slavov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vazquez et al., 2010</xref>). Yet, to date, the benefits of using glycolysis over OXPHOS for proliferation have remained controversial. In this study, we provide evidence that the Warburg effect does not necessitate decreased OXPHOS. Rather, in the cells we examined here, glycolysis and OXPHOS are both elevated by significant levels during proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the need to rationalize a preference for glycolysis over OXPHOS during proliferation may be unnecessary.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41351.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the metabolic differences between quiescent and proliferating fibroblasts.</title><p>Compared to quiescent fibroblasts, proliferating cells increase both glycolysis and OXPHOS.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ralph DeBerardinis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper compares mitochondrial function and dynamics between proliferating and non-proliferating fibroblasts. The authors find that proliferation activates glycolysis and respiration concurrently. The gain in respiration is associated with enhanced glutamine-dependent labeling of TCA cycle intermediates and enhanced mitochondrial fusion and is reversed by silencing the fusion factor Mfn2. Blocking Mfn2 also reduces cell proliferation, and a compound reported to induce mitochondrial fusion modestly increases respiration. Expressing an oncogenic allele of HRAS induces both cell proliferation and respiration, with the latter effect being related to an increase in mitochondrial mass rather than a specific effect of fusion. The authors conclude that enhanced mitochondrial function, via mitochondrial fusion, supports fibroblast proliferation. Although some of these points have been made elsewhere in the literature, overall the paper provides a clear and convincing view of the metabolic transitions that accompany and enable mammalian cell proliferation, at least in this system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Perhaps the most interesting question is how proliferating cells induce mitochondrial fusion.

Our results are consistent with mitochondrial fusion being supported by increased protein levels. The process occurs as fast as 3 hours after proliferation begins. We elaborate below.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dynamics remain incompletely understood (Salazar-Roa et al., 2017). However, emerging evidence indicates that mitochondrial fusion is regulated (at least in part) by protein levels. Specifically, it has been suggested that OPA1 is regulated by proteolysis and Mfn1 and Mfn2 by ubiquitin-mediated degradation (van der Bliek et al., 2013). Accordingly, we examined the protein levels of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 in our quiescent and proliferating fibroblasts. Indeed, we observed that mitochondria in proliferating cells have significantly higher levels of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 compared to mitochondria in quiescent cells. These data are now presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript. These data support that mitochondrial fusion involves increasing protein levels.</p><p>To assess how quickly mitochondrial fusion begins after cells start to proliferate, we needed to switch models. Our contact-inhibition system is well suited to study the transition from proliferation to quiescence upon contact inhibition at 100% confluence. It is not possible, however, to study the reverse transition from quiescence to proliferation by using contact inhibition. As such, to address the reviewers’ question, we established quiescence in 3T3 fibroblasts by serum starvation. We then induced proliferation by re-introducing serum and quantified mitochondrial elongation at three different time points (3 hours, 16 hours, and 30 hours). As expected, we observed that serum-starved quiescent cells have significantly shorter mitochondria. Notably, in as fast as 3 hours after serum was reintroduced to induce proliferation, there was a statistically significant increase in mitochondrial length. Mitochondrial length continued to increase with time. These data were added as Figure 2—figure supplement 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One could argue that Mfn2 loss decreases OXPHOS overall rather than specifically preventing OXPHOS gain during cell proliferation. Can the authors show whether Mfn2 loss also decreases OXPHOS in quiescent cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and performed the recommended experiment. Knocking down Mfn2 in quiescent cells led to only a minimal decrease in OXPHOS (~5%) compared to the substantial decrease in OXPHOS we observed upon knocking down Mfn2 in proliferating cells (~30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41351.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of Mfn2 knockdown on basal respiration in quiescent (<bold>Q</bold>) and proliferating (<bold>P</bold>) fibroblasts.</title><p>Loss of Mfn2 had only minimal effects on oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in quiescent cells but had a substantial impact on proliferating cells.

When we measured the oxygen consumption rates of scrambled siRNA controls (SSC) and Mfn2 knockdowns in the quiescent state, we found only a small difference. This contrasts to the substantial differences observed for proliferating cells (Figure 2E-F). These new data, which support that Mfn2 loss prevents gain of OXPHOS during proliferation rather than merely decreasing OXPHOS overall, are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Because the main readout of Mfn2 silencing is reduced proliferation (i.e. loss of fitness), the key experiments need to be controlled for off-target toxicity by re-expressing an siRNA-resistant cDNA of Mfn2.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, we constructed a codon-modified cDNA that expresses wildtype Mfn2 but is resistant to the siRNA added (please see source file for sequences for siRNA and siRNA-resistant Mfn2).

But more data are needed. Does this dose enhance fusion in these cells? Does it cause metabolic changes consistent with enhanced fusion? Is the effect on cell proliferation dose-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is important to test whether increased mitochondrial fusion is sufficient to drive proliferation. In the original manuscript, we attempted to increase mitochondrial fusion pharmacologically with a drug known as M1. The reviewers suggested that we perform three M1-related experiments: (i) dose-response analysis for M1, (ii) quantify change in mitochondria length after M1 treatment, and (iii) analyze metabolic changes due to M1 treatment. We did these experiments but determined that M1 was not the best approach to test our predictions. Instead of using a drug to increase mitochondrial fusion, we found it to be more effective to overexpress Mfn2 in our wildtype 3T3 fibroblasts. As mentioned in response to point 1 above, previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial dynamics may be regulated by protein levels. Increasing levels of Mfn2 protein in fibroblasts increased mitochondrial respiration and cellular proliferation. Our results support that increased fusion is sufficient to drive proliferation.</p><p>First, we performed the three suggested experiments related to M1. Since we decided to remove M1 from the study (specifically Figure 3A in the original manuscript), we did not include these data in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We used EM imaging on DMSO controls and cells treated with M1. We did not observe a statistically significant difference between controls and M1-treated cells. Similarly, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in respiration between control cells and M1-treated cells.</p><p>Based on these data, M1 treatment did not induce enough mitochondrial fusion in our system to test whether an increase in mitochondrial fusion is sufficient to drive proliferation with the M1 drug. As an alternative strategy to test this prediction, we overexpressed wildtype Mfn2 (Mfn2<sup>res</sup>) in wildtype 3T3 fibroblasts. The overexpression resulted in a ~2-fold increase in protein level from whole-cell lysate (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). The increase in protein led to a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B) and a significant increase in proliferation rate (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). These data are presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Any insights into how HRAS induces PGC1α would improve the paper.

(2010) which first reported the role of oncogenic HRAS and KRAS on ROS and respiration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for providing this reference, which we now cite. In terms of how HRAS induces PGC1α, the exact signaling cascade is not well defined (Dard et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, two pathways have been suggested as a potential link: the ERK/AMPK pathway (López-Cotarelo et al., 2015; Weinberg et al., 2010) and the KSR1 pathway (Fisher et al., 2011).</p><p>Based on these previous studies, we analyzed the expression levels and phosphorylation levels of ERK, AMPK, and KSR1. Phosphorylated AMPK and phosphorylated KSR1 were not detected. AMPK and KSR1 were not changed between empty vector controls (EV) and Ras transformed fibroblasts (Ras). We also did not observe any difference in Erk1/2 and phospho-Erk1/2 levels. These data are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. They suggest that the mechanism for how Ras induces PGC1α in our fibroblast system may not involve a change in the ERK/AMPK or KSR1 pathways as has been suggested for other cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Are some of these metabolic changes enabled by changes in membrane transporter expression? Assessing the levels of SLC7A11 (cystine-driven glutamine anaplerosis) and SLC1A2/3 (glutamate/aspartate uptake) in the quiescent and proliferating states with and without Mfn2 expression might help explain some of these changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The metabolic changes that we observe do not seem to be enabled by changes in expression of the SLC7A11 or SLC1A2/3 membrane transporters between proliferating and quiescent cells. Consistent with this idea, however, we did find that cystine uptake was elevated by over 2-fold in wildtype proliferating cells compared to wildtype quiescent cells. In contrast, when Mfn2 was knocked down, cystine uptake was decreased by ~40%. Thus, while the observed metabolic changes may not be enabled by differential expression of membrane transporters, they do seem to be enabled by differential activity of the transporters.</p><p>We first analyzed the protein level of the cystine/glutamate transporter, SLC7A11, in quiescent and proliferating fibroblasts, with and without Mfn2 expression.

In addition, we assessed the protein level of another glutamate/aspartate transporter SLC1A1 (EAAT3). Proliferation did not affect the protein expression of any of these transporters, while Mfn2 knockdown seemed to decrease the expression of SLC1A3 but not SLC1A1/2 (see Author response image 3). Since these transporters can carry amino acids in either direction (i.e., in or out of a cell), it is difficult to interpret whether this change in transporter expression is the cause of the change in uptake or excretion rates observed in Figure 3B,3E.</p><fig id="respfig5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41351.030</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Immunoblot of SLC1A1/2/3 transporters from whole-cell lysates for scrambled siRNA control cells in the quiescent state (SSC_Q), siRNA control cells in the proliferating state (SSC_P), Mfn2 knockdown cells in the quiescent state (Mfn2<sup>KD</sup>_Q), and Mfn2 knockdown cells in the proliferating state (Mfn2<sup>KD</sup>_P).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41351-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
