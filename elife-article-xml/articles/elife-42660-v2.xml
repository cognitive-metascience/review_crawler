Here we look at variation in natural isolates of the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and their relationships with bacterial symbionts, <italic>Burkholderia hayleyella</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia agricolaris</italic>. Only about a third of field-collected amoebae carry a symbiont. We cured and cross-infected amoebae hosts with different symbiont association histories and then compared host responses to each symbiont type. Before curing, field-collected clones did not vary significantly in overall fitness, but infected hosts produced morphologically different multicellular structures. After curing and reinfecting, host fitness declined. However, natural <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> hosts suffered fewer fitness costs when reinfected with <italic>B. hayleyella,</italic> indicating that they have evolved mechanisms to tolerate their symbiont. Our work suggests that amoebae hosts have evolved mechanisms to tolerate specific acquired symbionts; exploring host-symbiont relationships that vary within species may provide further insights into disease dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42660.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A species can benefit or be hurt by other species. For example, honeybees and flowering plants help each other to flourish, while lions and gazelles behave in ways that decrease each other’s populations. Understanding these relationships is important for controlling pests and diseases.</p><p>Sometimes it is easiest to study such interactions by looking at simple ones that happen on a small scale. Amoebas are common soil organisms that have the same basic organization as human cells. They are much larger and more complex than the bacteria that also live in the soil. How exactly the amoebas and bacteria interact in the soil is an important question, particularly as some of the bacteria can also live inside amoebas. Does this intimate relationship help or harm the amoeba?</p><p>Shu, Brock, Geist et al. studied the relationship between a widely studied species of social amoeba and two species of bacteria that can live inside it. Some of the amoebas naturally contained one of the bacteria species, and others were infected with the bacteria in experiments.</p><p>Throughout the entire life cycle of the amoebas, the bacteria lived inside them. During one part of the life cycle, amoebas form so-called fruiting bodies, which release spores that can develop into new amoebas. Shu et al. found that both types of bacteria alter the structure of the fruiting bodies in ways that reduce how well the spores disperse.</p><p>One of the bacteria species, called <italic>Burkholderia hayleyella</italic>, harmed the amoebas a lot. It caused most harm to amoebas that do not naturally host the bacteria. This indicates that the amoebas that do host this species may have evolved to avoid its worst effects.</p><p>The amoebas have many similarities to the white blood cells that clear bacteria from the human body. Certain bacteria can get inside white blood cells, causing diseases such as tuberculosis. Understanding how bacteria harm amoebas might be useful for understanding such diseases, and developing treatments for them. Though the bacteria Shu et al. studied are not toxic to humans, they are closely related to bacteria that are harmful. It is therefore possible that some bacteria that infect humans first evolve to infect amoebas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Burkholderia</kwd><kwd>amoebae</kwd><kwd>symbiosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB1146375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Queller</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name><name><surname>Strassmann</surname><given-names>Joan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shu</surname><given-names>Longfei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>43667</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Queller</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name><name><surname>Strassmann</surname><given-names>Joan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS1256416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Queller</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS1656756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Queller</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shu</surname><given-names>Longfei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Morphological and fitness defects imposed on amoebae hosts by Burkholderia symbionts demonstrates symbiont species-specific effects and provides evidence of host adaptation to naturally acquired symbionts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Relationships are complicated because each party has evolved to maximize its own interests. Mutualisms arise when different parties can contribute unique abilities or resources to one another, under conditions where exploitation is controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bronstein, 2015</xref>). Mutualisms where one or both parties are microbial fall under the general category of symbiosis. Symbioses are rife with potential conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dale and Moran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estrela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia and Gerardo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oliver et al., 2005</xref>). Despite this, symbiotic relationships are pervasive and persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wernegreen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). The stability and ubiquity of these interactions implies that conflict can be managed or minimized by partners over multiple generations. However, stability does not imply stagnation. Recent studies suggest that examining extant symbiotic associations may not reveal the underlying mutualism to parasitism continuum that drives evolutionary change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Queller and Strassmann, 2018</xref>). Indeed, the view that symbiotic associations fluctuate along a mutualism-to-parasitism continuum is increasingly appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular endosymbiosis involves a particularly intricate dance between partners. Intracellular endosymbionts must invade, survive, and replicate within host cells and move to new hosts. To exploit their host niche, mutualistic endosymbionts evolve specialized lifestyles that parallel those of intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casadevall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCutcheon and Moran, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soto et al., 2009</xref>). Despite initial exploitative strategies, some endosymbionts become beneficial or even obligate for host survival, a situation common for many insect nutritional endosymbioses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douglas, 2009</xref>). Strict vertical transmission of endosymbionts typically promotes a more tranquil relationship as the evolutionary fates of the two parties become increasingly interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferdy and Godelle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hosokawa et al., 2016</xref>). Host dependency also often leads to the reduction in size of symbiont genomes as they become more streamlined for life within their host, something true for both beneficial and pathogenic endosymbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dale and Moran, 2006</xref>). Horizontally acquired facultative symbionts are more likely to retain active conflicts. This has been experimentally demonstrated by manipulating the jellyfish symbiont <italic>Symbiodinium microadriaticum</italic> towards solely vertical or horizontal transmission modes, leading to the evolution of more mutualistic or parasitic lineages respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sachs and Wilcox, 2006</xref>). Though horizontal transmission can favor symbionts that behave more parasitically, selection can favor hosts that employ more severe countermeasures to limit symbiont entry or growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ratzka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reynolds and Rolff, 2008</xref>). Indeed, host-driven control can be extreme, as demonstrated by the ability of <italic>Paramecium bursaria</italic> to manipulate its facultative nutritional symbiont (<italic>Chlorella</italic> sp.) in a relationship that provides no apparent benefit for the imprisoned symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Symbiotic relationships may be positive or negative under different environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung and Poulin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pérez-Brocal et al., 2011</xref>). An interesting example of context dependency occurs in the <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum-Hamiltonella defensa</italic> symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oliver et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oliver et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>H. defensa</italic> infection confers host resistance to parasitoid attack, with resistance being greater for hosts co-infected with <italic>Serratia symbiotica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>). However, co-infection comes at a high fecundity cost, such that in parasitoid free environments, host fitness is reduced compared to uninfected counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>). This interplay between reproductive strategy, context, and evolutionary history illustrates the complexity and fluidity of symbiosis.</p><p>The facultative endosymbiosis between the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> bacteria provides a promising system for revealing insights into symbiosis dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is a soil dwelling amoeba with an interesting life cycle involving unicellular and multicellular stages. During the unicellular stage, amoebae consume bacteria by phagocytosis and divide. When prey are scarce, amoebae aggregate by tens of thousands to form multicellular slugs that move towards heat and light, seeking out a location to form fruiting bodies. These fruiting bodies consist of a stalk of sacrificial dead cells which support a globular sorus containing hardy spore cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kessin, 2001</xref>). When spores are dispersed, they germinate into vegetative amoebae and the cycle continues. Processes employed by specialized immune-like cells (sentinel cells) during slug migration and fruiting body formation remove any remaining bacteria, typically producing bacteria-free sori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosson and Lima, 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, some <italic>D. discoideum</italic> isolates harvested from the wild are infected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>). Infection persists in the lab throughout the social cycle, where intracellular bacteria can be visualized within spores and sori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>). Infection can be terminated by treating hosts with antibiotics and induced by exposing naïve hosts to <italic>Burkholderia,</italic> thereby allowing us to easily mix and match partners and study subsequent fitness consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brock et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> also has a meiotic sexual process, that occurs much less frequently than the asexual proliferation process of binary fission that amoebae go through every few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloomfield et al., 2010</xref>). The asexual binary fission process results in lineages that can be quite different, though all of the same species. Thus, a lineage that has acquired a bacterial endosymbiont can evolve to tolerate it independent of uninfected lineages at least for the thousands of generations that might pass before sexual recombination occurs. Comparing such lineages can illuminate how natural selection operates in early stages of symbiosis.</p><p>The <italic>Dictyostelium-Burkholderia</italic> association is particularly compelling for studying the parasitism to mutualism continuum in endosymbiosis because the fitness consequences of infection are context dependent. Under standard laboratory growth conditions, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infection is detrimental for hosts because it decreases slug migration and spore production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brock et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>). However, infection can be beneficial. Infection induces secondary carriage of edible bacteria (<italic>Burkholderia</italic> is typically inedible), which can increase host fitness in food scarce conditions when the carried food bacteria reseed new environments with a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>). For this reason, field-infected host amoebae are also called ‘farmers’ and uninfected host amoebae are called ‘non-farmers.’ Additionally, infected hosts are less harmed by ethidium bromide exposure, possibly mediated by bacterial degradation of the toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brock et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>We have identified three <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species associated with <italic>Dictyostelium: B. agricolaris, B. hayleyella,</italic> and <italic>B. bonniea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brock et al., 2018</xref>). Most of our work has been conducted with the first two species, which differentially impact host fitness. Here we probe the interaction between host and symbiont genotypes (with regards to their association history) with infection outcomes using a set of previously field-collected and characterized amoebae isolates and their associated <italic>Burkholderia</italic> symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>). We use standard laboratory conditions in which symbiont infection is shifted towards host detrimental outcomes. Since all three <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species can be cultured on Petri plates with standard media, none of them are entirely dependent on <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> for survival.</p><p>We find that <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> is most detrimental for <italic>D. discoideum</italic> hosts in general, but is most costly to those first exposed to it in the lab. We also document symbiont localization and morphological symptoms in hosts throughout development. Although both species of bacteria can be observed within phagocytic vacuoles, <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> infects more cells and damages fruiting body structures. These morphological aberrations are also less severe in native<italic>-hayleyella</italic> hosts, suggesting that native hosts have evolved mechanisms to withstand symbiont colonization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of B. agricola and B. hayleyella on <italic>D. discoideum</italic> spore production</title><p>Our first goal was to clarify how infection of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> by <italic>Burkholderia</italic> symbionts differentially influences host fitness.

We looked at their impact on <italic>D. discoideum</italic> by comparing wild type, cured, and re-infected hosts. We assessed fitness measured as production of viable spores, and also evaluated morphological changes in amoebae, slugs, and fruiting bodies with numerical and microscopic data. We found that both <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are a burden to <italic>D. discoideum</italic> under our experimental conditions. However, wild collected hosts did not differ in viable spore production according to whether or not they carried either species of <italic>Burkholderia.</italic> Even so, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with their field-collected state of infection did differ in fruiting body dimensions, with uninfected hosts generally having taller, larger stalks, and larger sori. What explains the differences from experimental infection is unclear. Infection in the wild may be at a lower level than we used experimentally or may have initiated at a lower level that slowly amplified over time, allowing host acclimation to the metabolic costs of infection.</p><p>Once <italic>D. discoideum</italic> hosts are cured with antibiotics, so all comparisons can start from the same baseline, we found that there were few within treatment differences according to host type. The only exception to this is that native<italic>-hayleyella</italic> hosts produced more viable spores than did naïve or native-<italic>agricolaris</italic> hosts. This fitness difference is an indication of co-adaptation.</p><p>When we map naïve, native-agricolaris, and native-hayleyella host types from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haselkorn et al. (2018)</xref> on a previously generated phylogeny, we see no phylogenetic differentiation whatsoever between host types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Douglas et al., 2011</xref>). It is most likely that diverse amoebae isolates get infected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> in nature, and then adaptations that provide these hosts with increased resilience are selected for over time. Perhaps the general lack of difference among host types with infection is due to sex, which not only recombines genes, but also exposes new clones horizontally to endosymbionts like <italic>Burkholderia. Dictyostelium</italic> recombination rates are high in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flowers et al., 2010</xref>). The differences reported here among clones of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> indicate that specific co-adaptation in clones infected with <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> can occur during the long periods between sexual reproduction. Thus, reproduction by binary fission and vertical transmission of <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> is likely to occur much more often than sexual reproduction which could result in horizontal transmission.</p><p>Our previous work demonstrated that <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections have contextually dependent costs and benefits for their hosts. In food abundant conditions (which we used here) <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections are generally detrimental to host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>). However, when dispersed to food scarce conditions, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infected hosts are able to transport food bacteria with them which restocks their food source and results in higher host fitness (‘farming’). These fitness outcomes may result from the ongoing dynamics underlying long-term symbiosis.</p><p>A compelling question is what mediates this tolerance to <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> infection in its native host? It is possible that native hosts better inhibit infection events or better control intracellular replication of symbiont cells. The percent of spore cells infected in the population post symbiont exposure are not significantly different between a native-<italic>hayleyella</italic> host and naïve hosts, which does not support the idea that infection events are inhibited by hosts conditioned to that species. Further, we did not see a significantly different intracellular density of <italic>B. hayleyella</italic>-RFP across hosts from confocal micrographs, suggesting that intact spores from different hosts can accommodate similar numbers of bacterial cells. However, our TEM analysis qualitatively points to the idea that after infection, intracellular replication rates may differ between naïve and native-<italic>hayleyella</italic> hosts. TEM images of native and naïve <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> hosts consistently suggest a higher load of intracellular bacterial cells at each stage. For instance, naïve <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> hosts produce paltry stalks that appear to be overwhelmed by bacterial cells and infected spore cells that look on the verge of deteriorating. Neither of these extreme states were observed in the native host. This could be mediated by host countermeasures that control intracellular symbiont growth or disarm potential toxic symbiont byproducts.</p><p>Compared to <italic>B. hayleyella, B. agricolaris</italic> infections result in more modest (and statistically insignificant) drops in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> viable spore production for naïve and cured re-infected native-<italic>agricolaris</italic> hosts. <italic>B. agricolaris</italic> appears to be less invasive to the host population as it is found in only about a quarter of spore population after exposure. Despite this, it is maintained in infected populations throughout the social stage and over multiple social cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiSalvo et al., 2015</xref>). However, <italic>B. agricolaris</italic> establishes a higher intracellular density within infected spores than <italic>B. hayleyella</italic>. These observations may be explained by reduced intracellular entrance efficiency coupled with higher intracellular replication rates. Alternatively, <italic>B. agricolaris</italic> could be more efficiently cleared by host mechanisms and requires a higher multiplicity of infection to overcome clearance, something that might help explain its more modest detrimental effect on host populations.</p><p>Earlier studies have identified other differences between naïve <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and those carrying <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brock et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stallforth et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>D. discoideum</italic> hosts carrying <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> harmed symbiont-free <italic>D. discoideum</italic> clones, causing them to lose in social competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brock et al., 2013</xref>). In another study we compared cured and uncured clones of <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> and found that slugs from uncured clones move less far across a Petri plate, a cost of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in the current study we detected no visible differences between cured and uncured slug cells. The recent discovery of sentinel cells as innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>) made us wonder about how they fare with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infected hosts. We found that <italic>D. discoideum</italic> hosts with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> do not produce as many sentinel cells but even so seem as resistant to toxins as uninfected lines with normal levels of sentinel cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brock et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stallforth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting recent result on the interaction between <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and bacteria involves the role of the lectin discoidin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dinh et al., 2018</xref>). Clones infected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> produced much greater quantities of lectins early in the social stage compared to uninfected clones. These lectins coated the food bacterium <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> allowing it to avoid digestion. This is undoubtedly just a beginning, though a fascinating one, in our understanding of how <italic>Burkholderia</italic> take over <italic>D. discoideum</italic> cellular machinery to change relationships with bacteria.</p><p>D.<italic>D. discoideum</italic> is already a popular system for examining the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis for a variety of important pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cosson and Soldati, 2008</xref>). However, this work demonstrates several properties of this interaction that are distinct from other <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>-bacterial associations, possibly owing to its natural prevalence. For instance, <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> can intracellularly infect vegetative <italic>D. discoideum</italic> amoebae and persist in sorus contents. However, in contrast to <italic>Burkholderia, B. bronchiseptica</italic> is localized extracellularly in sori rather than inside spore cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taylor-Mulneix et al., 2017</xref>). Infections of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with other intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> often produce secreted multilamellar bodies which harbor the bacterial pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoncourt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paquet and Charette, 2016</xref>), while in this study we found no evidence of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> excreted in multilamellar bodies. In addition, many bacteria resistant to amoebae are found packaged in multilamellar bodies, a process speculated to enhance their resistance to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denoncourt et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> symbionts are most likely employing alternative tactics to not only evade digestion, but to also evade expulsion.</p><p><italic>Burkholderia</italic> is important in another model symbiosis system, that with the bean bug, <italic>Riptortus pedestris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takeshita and Kikuchi, 2017</xref>). These bugs acquire <italic>Burkholderia insecticola</italic> horizontally. They reside in the bean bug gut where they are presumably active in nutrition. They are a good model because it is a facultative symbiosis and both partners can be cultured independently.</p><p>We are in a new age of symbiosis studies where we can apply Koch’s principles of curing, re-infecting, and looking for evidence of disease. We can use genomics, experimental evolution and many other methods to ever more systems. The <italic>D. discoideum-Burkholderia</italic> system holds unique potential for studying eukaryote-bacterial associations. Given its natural occurrence, we can perform long-term ecological surveys, easily isolate new host-symbiont pairs, investigate naturally derived vs newly induced associations using a variety of partner pairing, and we can do experiments in evolution allowing each partner to evolve together or separately.

We used the first plate to ascertain total spore production as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brock et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, spores were collected by washing plates with starvation buffer supplemented with 0.01% NP-40 alternative (Calbiochem).

Z-sections were taken every 0.5 microns with an average of 2 at 1024 × 1024 resolution pixels or 600 × 600 pixels. We excited RFP using the 561 laser, GFP with the 488 laser, Calcoflour-white with the 408 laser, and Alexa Fluor 680 Phalloidin with the 640 laser.

Five days after fruiting, we carefully cut and removed a thin strip of agar approximately 5 mm wide from the central area of an experimental plate and laid it on its side in a Petri plate. We placed dampened Kimwipes around the agar slice to prevent desiccation. We used a Leica EC3 scope with the LASD core package LAS V4.1) to collect data. Fruiting body images were taken randomly along with graticule images for calibration. We took six measurements of each fruiting body: sorus width, sorus length, stalk height and the width of the stalk at its base, midpoint and at the top just below the sorus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buttery et al., 2009</xref>). Stalk height was measured from the base of stalk to the tip of the sorus. We calculated sorus volume applying the formula for the volume of a sphere using diameter, V = 1/6 π d<sup>3</sup>. We calculated stalk volume using the formula of a cylinder, V= π r<sup>2</sup> h, where height (h) is the stalk height and radius (r) is half the mean of the three stalk width measurements. We measured about 80 sori and 20 stalks for each clone for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were done in R. For fitness assays, we tested the effect of antibiotic treatment using random-slope linear mixed models (LMM) on those <italic>D. discoideum</italic> hosts not reinfected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic>. Our models included either spore numbers or proportion of viability as the response variable, host as random effect, and antibiotic treatment as a fixed effect. We similarly tested the effects of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infection in the field and in the lab using random-slope LMMs on data from hosts cured with antibiotics. Our models included spore numbers or proportion viability as response variable, host as random effect, lab or field-infection status and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> type as fixed effects, as well as an interaction between field-infection status and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infection. For all LMMs, we fitted models and assessed model fit with likelihood ratio tests executed with the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) in the R environment (v. 3.3.3, R Core Team 2017).

Finally, for all <italic>post hoc</italic> multiple comparisons, we performed pairwise contrasts of least-square means with a multivariate <italic>t</italic> distribution adjustment as implemented with the package lsmeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lenth, 2016</xref>).</p><p>For morphometric analyses, we also tested the effect of antibiotic treatment on those hosts not re-infected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic>.

Similarly, we tested the effects of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> colonization from the field and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infection in the lab on the amoeba hosts with 2-way ANOVAs on amoebae cured with antibiotics. Again, one of the four morphological measurements was the response variable with field-colonization status, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infection, and an interaction between them as fixed effects.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Antonio Ruzzini as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Adam Kuspa (Reviewer #2); Eric Harvill (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Through a simple but elegant experimental design to measure variation in <italic>Dictyostelium's</italic> responses to different <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, rendered interpretable with a sophisticated statistical treatment, the authors arrive at the important conclusion that amoebal physiology can be evolutionarily shaped by its naturally occurring symbionts. The authors describe biological phenomena that result from <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> colonization by symbiotic <italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp. (<italic>B. agricolaris</italic> and <italic>B. hayleyella</italic>) using a laboratory model of infection. The colonization of both field-collected naïve and infected protists was systematically assessed to define the relationships between pairs of micro-organisms. Antibiotics were used to cure the amoebae from their respective co-isolated bacterial symbionts, and the naturally symbiont-free (naïve) and cured D<italic>. discoideum</italic> were subsequently infected with one of three <italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp. A comparison of host reproductive fitness, fruiting boding morphology, symbiont localization and abundance during uni- and multicellular life stages, and the subcellular effects of bacteria on four distinct hosts is summarized. The authors describe species-specific correlations between host-exposure and fitness upon curing and re-infection with an individual bacterium. A number of the effects of colonization are visualized using confocal and transmission electron microscopy. Overall, the results show a trend consistent with co-adaptation among ecological (co-isolated) pairs. In the aggregate, co-isolated protist-bacterium pairs appear healthier under laboratory conditions than the mixed pairs generated by substituting one of the co-isolated species for an ecologically disparate partner. Differences between the two <italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp. are also highlighted: the <italic>B. agricolaris</italic> symbionts only moderately decreased fitness whereas infection with <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> more drastically impacted the amoebae, particularly naïve and previously <italic>B. agricolaris</italic>-harboring clones.</p><p>It is clear that this report will set the stage for a number of future investigations into the protist-bacterium symbiosis.

We elected to use “naïve” and “native” as opposed to farmers and non-farmers in light of our more recent work demonstrating that <italic>Burkholderia</italic> symbionts endow farming traits to non-farmers. This complicates the use of the farming terminology because it can either be interpreted in reference to the original field infected state of an amoebae isolate, or in reference to any isolate subsequently infected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (whether infected in the field or in lab). Field-infected clones have had an unknown number of generations to deal with their bacterial indwellers. We agree that adding reference to previous nomenclature benefits the overall clarity of the paper and provides context for readers familiar with the field. To this aim we have added the following sentence to the Introduction:</p><p>“Infection induces secondary carriage of edible bacteria (<italic>Burkholderia</italic> is typically inedible), which can increase host fitness in food scarce conditions when the carried food bacteria reseed new environments with a food source (Brock et al., 2011; DiSalvo et al., 2015). For this reason, field-infected host amoebae are also called “farmers” and uninfected host amoebae are called “non-farmers.”</p><p>We also see how our description of the amoebae isolates could lead a reader to infer that we harvested them explicitly for this work. This was an unintentional consequence of our attempt at conciseness.</p><p>To clarify this, we added the following to the Introduction:</p><p>&quot;Here we probe the interaction between host and symbiont genotypes (with regards to their association history) with infection outcomes using a set of previously field-collected and characterized amoebae isolates and their associated <italic>Burkholderia</italic> symbionts (Brock et al., 2011; DiSalvo et al., 2015). &quot;</p><p>And modified a sentence within the Results section to read:</p><p>&quot;We used 12 natural isolates of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, each from three original conditions, uninfected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, infected with <italic>B. agricolaris</italic>, or infected with <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> (Table 1).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relatively clear separation between the three groups of amoebae suggests that they may belong to (at least) three different evolutionary lineages or even subspecies.

Furthermore, we can place strains carrying either <italic>B. hayleyella</italic> or <italic>B. agricolaris</italic> or neither in the phylogeny from Douglas et al. 2011. We were able to put 4 <italic>B. agricolaris</italic> carriers, 8 B<italic>. hayleyella</italic> carriers, and the 4 non carriers used in this study in that phylogeny. Clearly there is no phylogenetic differentiation defined by host type.</p><p>We have added the following sentences to the Discussion section of this paper:</p><p>“Previous genetic analysis of a collection of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> isolates revealed no phylogenetic differentiation between naive, native-<italic>agricolaris</italic>, and native-<italic>hayleyella</italic> host types (Douglas et al., 2011).

This reinfection strategy corresponds to the clone “sets” listed in table one. To better clarify these reinfections for the fitness assays (wherein multiple clone types were used) we added the following:</p><p>&quot;To test the effects of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> on all types of field-collected hosts, we grouped host types into four sets, with each set representing a unique naïve, native-<italic>agricolaris</italic>, and native-<italic>hayleyella</italic> host (Table 1).

For example: For set one clones, QS9 was infected with Bh11 or Ba70, QS11 was reinfected with Bh11 or Ba70, and QS70 was reinfected with Bh11 or Ba70. For set two clones, QS18 was infected with Ba159 or Bh23, QS159 was reinfected with Ba159 or Bh23, and QS23 was reinfected with Ba159 or Bh23 (and so on). We hope this is clarified by our above additions.</p><p>In the case of electron and confocal microscopy, only the set one clones were used (QS9, QS11, and QS70) along with their corresponding symbionts (Bh11 and Ba70).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experimental differences between the 'field-harvested' and 're-infected' samples are somewhat unclear.

In this case, we are using the term to indicate that apart from maintaining these clones normally in the laboratory environment (by growing on nutrient media with bacterial food, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>) we have not intentionally manipulated them by curing them of bacterial associates or exposing them to any non-food bacteria. Thus, in all cases, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> clones come from frozen spore stocks and are pre-grown with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> before each experimental assay. For all assays, all clone types are either grown only with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> food (for field harvested or cured clones) or are grown with <italic>Burkholderia</italic> supplemented <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> mixtures (to infect naive or reinfect cured clones). In each inoculation, we set all bacterial suspensions to an OD600 of 1.5. For <italic>Burkholderia</italic>:Food inoculations, we used 5% <italic>Burkholderia</italic> with 95% <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> by volume (as described in the Materials and methods section). In the case of native field infected clones, we do not have a quantification for the <italic>Burkholderia</italic>:food ratio, as each clone is carrying in its already pre-established dose of <italic>Burkholderia</italic>. Because of the possibility that native hosts could be inoculated with a different dose of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> than we are providing for artificial infections, in addition to making comparisons between naïve and native hosts in their field infected conditions we analyze cured and reinfected hosts. In the former condition, there is the possibility that natural infection densities play a role in distinct host outcomes, while in the later condition, symbiont densities are controlled to reveal differences in host outcomes that are products of factors other than symbiont exposure loads.</p><p>In order to clarify this point, we added the following to the Results section:</p><p>&quot;The word “host” always means <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, and sometimes refers to potential hosts not actually infected with <italic>Burkholderia</italic>.

Our flow cytometry approach did not show an obvious shift in fluorescence intensity among different strains, so instead we tried to address this as best possible by counting visible bacterial cells per spore in the confocal images generated for this study.
