pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42995.001</object-id><p>We have developed a method to introduce novel paratopes into the human antibody repertoire by modifying the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes of mature B cells directly using genome editing technologies. We used CRISPR-Cas9 in a homology directed repair strategy, to replace the heavy chain (HC) variable region in B cell lines with that from an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb), PG9. Our strategy is designed to function in cells that have undergone VDJ recombination using any combination of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes. The modified locus expresses PG9 HC which pairs with native light chains (LCs) resulting in the cell surface expression of HIV specific B cell receptors (BCRs). Endogenous activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in engineered cells allowed for Ig class switching and generated BCR variants with improved HIV neutralizing activity. Thus, BCRs engineered in this way retain the genetic flexibility normally required for affinity maturation during adaptive immune responses. Peripheral blood derived primary B cells from three different donors were edited using this strategy. Engineered cells could bind the PG9 epitope and sequenced mRNA showed PG9 HC transcribed as several different isotypes after culture with CD40 ligand and IL-4.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CAR-B</kwd><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>engineering</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>bnAb</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1183956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voss</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DE025167-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burton</surname><given-names>Dennis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ramón y Cajal Merit Award RYC-2016-21155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez-Martin</surname><given-names>Alicia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011264</institution-id><institution>FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IOF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCoy</surname><given-names>Laura E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Antibody paratopes can be added to the human repertoire by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of B lymphocytes using a strategy that allows for hypermutation and class switching of resulting B cell receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protective antibodies against some pathogens require features not easily elicited through affinity maturation from the human antibody repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kepler and Wiehe, 2017</xref>). We wanted to add these features into the repertoire directly by modifying BCRs using genome-editing technologies. The existence of antibodies with protective paratopes encoded mostly within their HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heydarchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sui et al., 2009</xref>) suggested that it might be possible to achieve this goal through replacement of the recombined HC variable region alone. In order for engineered HCs to then function as desired, they must pair with endogenous LCs and retain their ability to recognize antigen as chimeric cell surface-expressed BCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feige et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We used HIV as a model because, while broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against this virus are protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pegu et al., 2017</xref>) and their gene sequences have been well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCoy and Burton, 2017</xref>), they remain exceedingly difficult to elicit by vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mascola and Haynes, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that the breadth and neutralization potency of a number of bnAbs targeting the HIV Envelope glycoprotein (Env) 'V2 apex’ region are largely encoded within unusually long HC complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) loops, which form the majority of contacts with Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Julien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McLellan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pejchal et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the IgG HC from the V2 apex-targeting bnAb PG9 could pair and be secreted with a diversity of lambda (λ) and kappa (k) LCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) when co-transfected in HEK293 cells. These included a LC endogenous to a well characterized human B cell line in which we wanted to develop BCR engineering strategies, the Ramos (RA 1) Burkitt’s lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 1975</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles and SDS-PAGE gels of these secreted chimeric antibodies were comparable with the normal PG9 HC/LC pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Chimeras were evaluated for their ability to neutralize HIV pseudovirus using the TZM-bl assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014</xref>). Twelve HIV pseudoviruses representing the global diversity of HIV-1 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">deCamp et al., 2014</xref>) were examined along with six viruses known to be highly sensitive to neutralization by PG9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrabi et al., 2015</xref>). All PG9 chimeric antibodies neutralized one or more of the PG9-sensitive viruses, and most neutralized multiple viruses from different clades in the global panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). No chimeric antibody was as broadly neutralizing as the original PG9 HC/LC pair, indicating significant LC-dependent restriction to neutralization breadth for this HIV bnAb. Most chimeras had measurable binding affinity to 5 strains of recombinant soluble HIV envelope native trimers (SOSIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrabi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voss et al., 2017</xref>) by biolayer interferometry (BLI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frenzel and Willbold, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Autoreactivity was detected for about 60% of PG9 chimeras in the HEp-2 assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Copple et al., 2012</xref>) as might be expected because of novel HC/LC interfaces in these antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We opted to move forward with the development of engineering strategies using the PG9 HC paratope in Ramos B cells because, despite a loss of neutralization breadth with some LCs, the PG9 HC pairs well with diverse LCs (including the functional Ramos λLC). Further, these LC chimeras can be readily detected with a variety of available recombinant native trimer probes, giving us a simple and specific method for detecting successfully engineered B cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42995.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PG9 IgG heavy chains neutralize HIV when paired with a diversity of light chains.</title><p>Sensitivity of 19 HIV isolates to PG9 HC-chimeric LC antibodies are shown in a heat map.

This replacement DNA must be flanked by regions of sequence homology (HR) to the genome upstream and downstream of the two break sites in order to be incorporated by homology directed repair (HDR) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwank et al., 2013</xref>). This presented a unique challenge for the development of donor DNA HRs that would be universally present on either side of the VDJ region in polyclonal human B cells. This is because each human B cell undergoes genomic rearrangements during its genesis to assemble the HC VDJ gene from; 1 of at least 55 functional V genes (along with its individual 5’ promoter); 1 of 23 functional D genes; and 1 of 6 functional J genes. Together, these gene segments span nearly one megabase (Mb) when in germline configuration and constitute the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) locus on chromosome 14 (at 14q32.33) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giudicelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson and Breden, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To respond to this challenge, we developed a long-range HDR strategy that introduced dsDNA breaks after the most 5’ V-gene promoter (V7-81), and after the most distal J gene (J6), because HRs 5’ and 3’ to these sites respectively are retained in all B cells. The distance between these cut sites will vary depending on which V and J genes were assembled in a given B cell. Thus, regardless of which genes were previously assembled, our editing strategy introduces the new VDJ gene in a way that allows transcription using a naturally regulated V-gene promoter from its native locus where it would be subject to hypermutation by AID. When paired with an endogenous cell LC, a chimeric immunoglobulin (Ig) will be secreted as the isotype determined by the genomic configuration of the HC constant region in the engineered cell.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42995.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Engineering the HC VDJ locus in Ramos B cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Germline configuration of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.

It starts with the variable gene region containing at least 55 functional V-genes (in red), 23 functional D-genes (in orange), and six functional J-genes (in yellow) to span almost 1 Mb. The variable region is followed by an intron containing an enhancer element that activates the 5’ proximal V-gene promoter in mature B-cells after VDJ recombination. This is followed by the constant gene region (in blue) comprised of 8 functional genes, which is followed by more enhancer elements. The 5’ most functional V gene promoter is V7-81 followed by V3-74.

V4-34 lies halfway through the IGHV locus placing the 5’ most V-gene promoter (V7-81) about 0.5 Mb upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to our universal B cell editing strategy, which grafts the PG9 VDJ gene between the V7-81 promoter and J6 splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we developed an engineering strategy specific for this line that introduced a dsDNA cut 3’ of the V4-34 promoter (instead of the V7-81), and which used donor DNA with a V4-34 promoter sequence 5’ HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This strategy replaces only the 400 bp Ramos VDJ rather than a 0.5 Mb region using the ‘universal’ BCR editing strategy.

Once the highest efficiency cutters were detected using this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), corresponding mutations in the PAM sites in donor DNA plasmids were mutated to prevent Cas9 cutting of the donor DNA inside transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We introduced either the ‘V4-34/Ramos-specific’ or the ‘V7-81/universal B cell’ VDJ editing reagents into cells as two plasmids encoding 5’ and 3’ dsDNA cutting by Cas9, and one plasmid encoding PG9 VDJ donor DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) using nucleofection. Cells were cultured for 3 days to allow for PG9 VDJ gene replacement and HC expression to occur.</p><p>To distinguish between the chimeric PG9 HC BCR and the unmodified BCR endogenous to Ramos cells, we used fluorescently labeled soluble HIV envelope trimer (SOSIP) from an isolate of HIV shown to be neutralized by an IgG chimera composed of PG9 HC and Ramos λLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), clade AE isolate C108.c03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrabi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voss et al., 2017</xref>).

It was encouraging that the universal editing strategy that removed 0.5 Mb of the IGHV locus was only about 8 times less efficient than the Ramos-specific strategy that replaces just 400 bp. It remains to be determined if this success is particular to the Ig locus in Ramos cells or is a general feature of B cells, which naturally undergo such long distance recombinations during B cell ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ebert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montefiori et al., 2016</xref>).

C108 SOSIP was used to sort successfully engineered HIV-specific cells to produce enriched subpopulations for further experiments.

Sanger sequencing of these products confirmed that the new PG9 gene was grafted as expected between Cas9 cut sites within the IGHV locus by HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>).</p><p>Amplification-free whole genome sequencing of C108 SOSIP-selected cells (engineered with either the V434 or V781 strategy) was performed using fragmented gDNA from these lines using the Illumina HiSeq X.

Coverage depth was consistent with removal of the V781-J6 region in the expressed allele in C108 SOSIP-selected cells engineered with the universal strategy, but not from the excluded allele which is not expressed due to a chromosomal translocation of the IGHV region to chr8 in this Burkitt's lymphoma line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 1975</xref>). Coverage depth analysis showed a deletion between the V3-11 and V3-7 genes in the excluded allele (relative to the reference genome), and a D-J recombination event in this allele between D3-9 and the J6 gene that would have occurred during the maturation of this B cell in vivo. The high read coverage depth for the 5’ and 3’ HRs in engineered cells (especially using the V7-81 strategy), suggests the integration of multiple donor DNAs by NHEJ mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). The presence of donor DNA backbone sequences in this assembly on the outside of HR mapped reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">8</xref>) confirms that integration did occur in both V781 and V434-engineered, C108 SOSIP-selected cells by NHEJ, in addition to the intended HR driven graft of PG9 VDJ into the expected sites. It is normal for DNA introduced as plasmid to be incorporated into the mammalian genome at the site of dsDNA breaks non-specifically by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vasquez et al., 2001</xref>). The donor DNA format should be adapted to skew repair towards HDR mechanisms if incorporation by NHEJ is to be reduced or eliminated in future experiments. Our design should not allow for expression of PG9 HC when the donor is incorporated by most off-target repair mechanisms because the PG9 VDJ gene promoter must be in proximity to the downstream enhancer for transcription, and because the gene must be transcribed with the downstream constant gene and spliced in order to make a functional heavy chain protein.</p><p>Some predicted, off-target editing events were detected by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>) in V781 PG9-engineered unselected or C108 SOSIP-selected cells. Deletions between Cas9 cut sites as have been previously reported to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al., 2017</xref>) were detected in unselected cells, but not in cells enriched for C108 SOSIP binding. One SOSIP selectable off-target donor DNA incorporation event was detected. This event involved HDR within the 3’ HR of the donor DNA, allowing for promoter activity (encoded within the 5’HR of the donor) and transcription with downstream constant regions for expression of functional PG9 HC, but with no accompanying 5’ HDR from within the same donor DNA plasmid, indicated by the PCR product shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9D</xref>. Integration of donor DNA completely by NHEJ mechanisms was also detected and appeared in both unselected and C108-selected cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9F</xref>). While evidence for incorporation by NHEJ exists at Cas9 cut sites from these data, it remains to be determined if integration events also occurred elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>We then assessed the ability of engineered B cells to undergo two key genome alterations that occur during affinity maturation; class switching and somatic hypermutation. Both of these processes are mediated by AID, which is active in Ramos B cells and is regulated to direct the bulk of its activity within the Ig loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenter et al., 2016</xref>). It was previously shown that in vitro class switching occurs only in a specific Ramos sub-clone, 2G6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ford et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, we repeated the engineering and selected PG9 HC expressing cells in the 2G6 line. RT-PCR amplification using PG9 forward and IgM or IgG reverse primers generated amplicons which were sequenced to show that the engineered locus successfully transcribed PG9 and spliced it in the correct reading frame to either the native Ramos µ constant gene (PG9-IgM), or after culture with CD40 ligand-expressing feeder cells, IL-2 and IL-4, the native Ramos Y constant gene (PG9-IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). Thus, the engineered locus retained the ability to undergo isotype switching.</p><p>While isotype switching is not inducible in Ramos RA1, random somatic hypermutation does occur due to constitutive activity of AID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sale and Neuberger, 1998</xref>). We assessed the ability of edited V781-engineered Ramos RA1 B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation to generate higher affinity variants of the PG9-Ramos chimeric antibody in vitro by repeatedly selecting B cell populations with superior binding to Env using flow cytometry. We chose to use Env SOSIP trimers derived from strains MGRM8 (clade AG) and WITO.4130 (clade B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrabi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voss et al., 2017</xref>) as sorting probes because these proteins showed relatively weak binding to engineered cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and therefore gave the greatest scope for improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Sorts were designed using an anti-human lambda light chain probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) to eliminate the selection of cells with brighter antigen staining that could result from an upregulation of BCR expression on the cell surface. Three rounds of selection and expansion in culture improved the binding of engineered cell lines to SOSIP probes in FACS experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). mRNA was purified from cell cultures at the time points indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Ig variable genes were then amplified from cDNA using gene specific primers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briney et al., 2016</xref>). Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq and quality trimmed reads were aligned and filtered to remove all sequences corresponding to the Ramos VDJ or a non-functional lambda chain transcript, confirmed in this study by IMGT analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2013</xref>) to derive from a VJ recombination event between IGLV2-23 and IGLJ3 on the excluded lambda allele in this cell line. Sequences from different samples were compared to detect the enrichment of coding changes during subsequent rounds of selection that could account for improved binding of the cell lines to HIV Env by FACS. A dominant change within the functional Ramos λLC was increasingly enriched in both MGRM8 and WITO SOSIP-selected lines at an AID hotspot, an S97N substitution within the CDRL3. This mutation predicts a shift in a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) from N95 to 97. Coding changes resulting in the deletion of this glycan were also observed to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Because no interesting residues in the HC of these lines were likewise selected, we investigated whether the LC changes had a functional effect by expressing the PG9-RamosλLC chimeras as IgG with mutations to either remove or shift the PNGS to 97 as selected (LC S97G or S97N). Antibodies with either of these mutations generally improved affinity for HIV SOSIPs from different clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, these mutations resulted in more potent neutralization of a number of HIV strains, including a virus from the panel designed to represent global HIV diversity, not neutralized by the original chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These mutants remained non-autoreactive in the HeP-2 assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) and did not strongly alter expression based on SEC profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). PG9 crystal structures and homology modeling suggest that, in this chimera, steric clashes involving the Ramos CDRL3 N-linked glycan at position 95 may impede access of the PG9 CDRH3 to its bnAb epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This result also suggests that breadth of neutralization by PG9 chimeras may be relatively easy to recover through affinity maturation by a number of possible pathways requiring few mutations to adapt the new light chain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42995.019</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Engineered Ramos cells undergo somatic hypermutation and BCR variants with improved HIV neutralizing breadth and potency can be selected.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ramos cells engineered to express the PG9 HC VDJ using the V781 universal strategy were enriched using the C108 SOSIP and subsequently passaged without selection (passaged unselected, ‘PU’) or with three rounds of selection using either WITO or MGRM8 SOSIP strains, (W1-3 and M1-3). gDNA and mRNA samples were obtained for analysis from cultures as indicated by black arrows.

The replacement and selection of a defined starting VDJ sequence greatly simplified assessment of mutations introduced at this locus. To eliminate confounding changes in the PG9 VDJ sequence accumulated during RT-PCR amplification, we incorporated unique nucleotide sequence molecular identifiers (UMIs) into the 5’ end of each Ig HC mRNA molecule using a barcoded 5’ template switch adapter during first strand synthesis by 5’ RACE with Ig constant region primers as has been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turchaninova et al., 2016</xref>). Illumina adapters were added to PCR amplified libraries for MiSeq sequencing. Consensus sequences derived from reads with identical UMIs (molecular identifier groups, MIGs), were constructed using the previously referenced method. We analyzed only MIGs derived from &gt;29 reads and eliminated unique sequences from the data set to reduce or eliminate chimeric PCR product and any polymerase-introduced mutations from the analysis. We compared data sets coming from two cell lines that had spent the longest time in culture since the original transfection with VDJ gene editing reagents (about 2.5 months). One of these underwent three consecutive selections steps using MGRM8 SOSIP (M3), and one was simply passaged after the initial C108 enrichment and experienced no further selection pressure for SOSIP binding (PU), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Clear differences from the starting PG9 VDJ gene sequences were observed in both data sets and the positions of many of these mutations appear to fall within regions known to be canonical AID hotspots (WRCY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This suggests that genes being introduced into the locus undergo normal somatic hypermutation which could be manipulated through the use of codon optimization to encourage or discourage mutations at certain positions by modifying AID hotspot motifs in donor DNA-introduced antibody genes.</p><p>We then wanted to test the universal editing strategy in human primary polyclonal B cells that have undergone a diversity of VDJ recombination events, use a variety of different LCs, and which are readily available in the periphery. We changed the system from one which uses the V7-81 promoter, to one which uses V3-74, (the V gene immediately downstream of V7-81 in the IGHV locus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In engineered Ramos cells, PG9 expressed using the V3-74 promoter stained more brightly with the HIV envelope probe than did those using V7-81, presumably due to differing promoter strengths. Switching to V3-74 would thus allow for maximal PG9 staining in primary cells which may express lower levels of BCR than the Ramos lymphoma cell line. In addition, engineering efficiency was routinely higher (0.35% of the live cell gate) compared with V7-81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). PBMCs from different donors were purified by density gradient centrifugation. CD19+ B cells were positively selected by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and placed into culture with human CD40L and IL-4 to activate and induce cell proliferation. Because cell cycling and/or persistence in the S/G2 phases promote HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hung et al., 2018</xref>), we stained cells with CFSE to assess the dynamics of B cell division in order to correctly time the introduction of our engineering reagents. Cells were mostly static for the first three days in culture but went through a burst of division by day five under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore chose to engineer cells on day 4 of culture. We first tested AMAXA nucleofection of a 7.7 Kb GFP plasmid (HR210-PA) into cells at different concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that 2 or 3μgs of plasmid per million cells resulted in acceptable levels of transfection allowing us to continue forward testing our engineering reagents in plasmid format. We tested nucleofection of our three-plasmid system at different DNA concentrations and used a ‘PG9 chimera’ gating strategy (below) to detect successful engineering and expression of the new BCR in cells by FACS at 2, 3 and 6 days post engineering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). 2 or 3 μg each of the 5’ Cas9, the 3’ Cas9, and the V374 donor plasmids/million cells yielded engineering efficiencies approaching 0.1% of the live single cell gate. Because 9 μg of total DNA was significantly toxic to cells reducing their numbers dramatically, we chose to test engineering of B cells from three different donors using 2 μg of each plasmid for a total of 6 μg/million cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To detect cells expressing PG9 HC as chimeric BCRs with native cell LCs 6 days after engineering, we used ZM233 HIV envelope (in SOSIP format) as a FACS probe, because this strain of virus was observed to be the most broadly neutralized virus in our panel by PG9 chimeras regardless of the LC pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We stained cells using a biotinylated version of this probe bound to either streptavidin-BB515 or streptavidin-APC and selected BB515/APC positive cells to eliminate non-specific or fluorophore-specific binders. We also stained with a version of ZM233 SOSIP (bound to streptavidin-BV421) with a deletion of the N160 glycan, which is a critical component of the PG9 HC binding epitope, in order to gate-out cells binding to other epitopes on the SOSIP. All three engineered donor samples had at least 10-fold more cells in the APC+/BV421-/BB515+ ‘PG9 chimeric BCR gate’ than did non-engineered controls. After a further 7 days in CD40L/IL-4 culture, cells were harvested, and mRNA was purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). RT-PCR using PG9-specific primers amplified PG9 (confirmed by Sanger sequencing) both as IgM and IgG from engineered cell mRNA (+) but not from nonengineered controls (-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To quantify PG9 transcripts, RACE-PCR was also performed in order to amplify all transcribed HCs from engineered cell samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turchaninova et al., 2016</xref>). NGS sequencing of these amplicons showed PG9 mRNA-read frequencies similar to the PG9 chimeric BCR-gated cell frequencies observed by FACS seven days earlier (for two of three donors), suggesting survival and similar rates of division for engineered and non-engineered cells in culture. No PG9 mRNA could be detected in non-engineered negative controls. Moreover, PG9 isotypes observed in NGS datasets from engineered cells included IgM, IgD, IgG1 and IgG4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). 3 PG9 MIGs (derived from at least 17 reads) in the donor 1 and 3 error compensated datasets had nucleotide mutations. One of these was a substitution of a C for a T at a predicted AID hot spot motif (WRCY), suggesting the new genes could be undergoing somatic hypermutation as might be expected for primary B cells under these culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moens and Tangye, 2014</xref>). Despite effective compensation for errors introduced during library preparation by the repertoire analysis methods applied here, there is still a small possibility that these mutations could have arisen during cDNA synthesis, or very early on in PCR amplification of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turchaninova et al., 2016</xref>). The AID dependence of observed mutations in engineered genes could be confirmed by comparing these with sequences from engineered cells cotransfected with a guide RNA designed to knock out the AID gene.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42995.022</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Engineering primary human B cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CD19 +B cells were stained with CFSE after purification and cultured in CD40L/IL-4 media.

The ability to introduce novel paratopes into the human antibody repertoire in this way, could help to surmount difficulties eliciting protective antibody responses against evolved pathogens if it could be done safely and efficiently enough in primary B cells to reproducibly expand protective, self-tolerant antibody responses upon autologous re-engraftment through vaccination.

The top 5 gRNA targets identified were developed for each of the target cut sites; 5’ of the V7-81/V3-74 (GenBank: AB019437) and V4-34 (GenBank: AB019439) ORFs; and 3’ of the J6 ORF (GenBank: AL122127). Roughly 250 bp sequences containing the CRISPR/cas9 target sequences were either synthesized based on the IMGT annotated reference sequence (Geneart), or PCR amplified from both 293T and Ramos B cell gDNA samples. These targets were cloned into the pCAG-EGxxFP vector (Addgene plasmid #50716), and sanger sequenced (Eton Bioscience). The gRNAs were tested for their efficacy in directing cas9 mediated dsDNA cleavage by co-transfection of the pX330 and corresponding pCAG targets into 293 T cells using PEImax 40K as previously described. Target DNA cutting was scored as GFP expression compared with target DNA only transfected cells because dsDNA cuts within the target will result in HDR that restores the GFP reading frame in the pCAG plasmid as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mashiko et al., 2013</xref>). Donor DNA was synthesized as three separate genes (Geneart): The V7-81, V3-74 or V4-34 5’ UTR HRs, (5’ segment) and the PG9 VDJ ORF and 3’ HR (3’ segment). A functional PG9 VDJ ORF was designed by grafting the PG9 VDJ nucleotide sequence (GenBank GU272045.1), after the V3-33 start codon, leader peptide, and V-gene intron (GenBank: AB019439), because V3-33 is the germline from which PG9 evolved. The 3’ segment (PG9-3’HR) was cloned into the HR110PA-1 donor DNA vector (System Biosciences) using restriction enzymes. Stbl4 electrocompetent bacteria cultured at 30°C was used to propagate the donor DNA vector to prevent modifications in bacteria in HR sequences. The V781, V374 or V434 homology region was then cloned 5’ of the PG9 gene by the same methods. PAM sites in CRISPR/cas9 targets within donor DNA homology regions were also mutated using site directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) to prevent donor DNA cutting in B cells also transfected with nuclease plasmids. Donor DNA plasmid sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Eton Bio). Final nucleotide sequences for donor DNAs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Ramos B cell culture and engineering</title><p>Ramos (RA I) and (2G6) cells (mycoplasma negative) were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1596 and CRL-1923 respectively) and cultured as directed in IMDM media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin.

The advance comes with a modestly efficient strategy to target the desired insert into some substantial number of different VDJ joins that arise naturally by chance. There are obvious and substantial possibilities for this technology. For example, although it is unlikely to be utilized in human therapy (CRISPR/cas off-target effects are now known to be substantial) one could imagine using this approach in non-human primates to great effect in studies of protection and/or virus selection.

By targeting productive VDJ to endogenous genomic Ig locus of B cells, their method allows endogenous control of targeted Ig HC at expression level, light chain paring, somatic mutation, and isotype switching, potentially without damaging genome elsewhere. Interestingly, targeting is designed to enable VDJ replacement in any type of B cells and targeted BCR variable region can be further modified by in vitro affinity based selection system. Present engineering work based on cell lines will provide useful information for future advance in this field, i.e. BCR genome engineering of primary B cells aiming transplantation therapy or vaccination.</p><p>[Minor comments not shown.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Voss et al. describes the use of CRISPR-cas9 to engineer Ramos cells, and later EBV transformed B cells to express the heavy chain of an HIV-directed bNAb, PG9. Pairing of this mAb with the endogenous Ramos light chain resulted in functional antibodies with some degree of breadth, a reflection of the H3-dominant mode of binding of this antibody, and the authors show evidence of class-switching and somatic hypermutation. The authors speculate that this may form the future basis of human genome editing, though more immediately this approach may be valuable in the evaluation of immunogens.</p><p>Main text, second paragraph, Figure 1 – the loss of breadth for the PG9 heavy chain with any of these light chains is greater than implied by the authors.

The authors state that antibodies with the N95 glycan deleted or shifted to 97 showed improved affinity for HIV SOSIPS. While this seems generally true, it is not true for WITO, one of the selecting antigens, where loss of the glycan results in a drop in affinity. Since WITO-selected cells lose the glycan as often as they shift it, how do the authors explain the selection of deleterious mutations at this level?</p><p>Figure 3E – how similar are the Ramos and PG9 light chains?

Two of three reviewers were very positive about publishing the study because it is the first to describe a successful genome editing approach for introducing novel antibody paratopes into the human repertoire through B cell receptor (BCR) modification in polyclonal human B cells. Introducing new paratopes in such a way could aid in the development of vaccines against evolved pathogens for which failed efforts are mostly the result of genetic limitations imposed by the human antibody repertoire itself. The study uses HIV as an example, because while protective broadly neutralizing antibodies to this virus do exist and have been well characterized, they are extremely difficult to elicit through vaccination because they derive from rare precursor BCRs which further require extensive somatic hypermutation. Here, we show it may be possible to bypass these bottlenecks by introducing the protective paratope from an HIV broadly neutralizing antibody (PG9) directly into the repertoire using genome editing technologies.</p><p>One reviewer felt that our system, developed in cell lines, should be shown to function in human primary B cells in order to complete this study for publication in eLife. We agree that including such a result would dramatically improve the impact of this report. We therefore have replaced data showing success engineering in polyclonal EBV transformed human B cells, with data showing similar success in human primary B cells purified from fresh PMBCs. Here, activated cells were engineered using the plasmid reagents developed in cell lines. 6 days after engineering, healthy live single B cells could be observed to bind the PG9 epitope of HIV envelope probes by FACS. 13 days after engineering and continuous passage in culture, mRNA was harvested and characterized. PG9 transcripts could be detected in engineered cell cultures at frequencies consistent with PG9 epitope binding frequencies observed by FACS. Moreover, these transcripts were expressed as several different isotypes and were accumulating mutations in the VDJ region consistent with AID activation by IL-4 in this culture condition. In this version of the manuscript we have also addressed all of the other reviewer´s concerns.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The weakness of this manuscript is that it does not really approach this interesting goal.

CRISPR/Cas9 and other nucleases are continually being evolved for improved cutting efficiency and elimination of off-target effects. In addition, other nuclease free methods exist for initiating homology directed repair in cells using single stranded donor DNA (German G Gornalusse et al., Nature Biotechnology 15 May 2017). We agree that in the shorter term, this strategy may prove most useful in various experimental models which we now specifically discuss in the conclusions. In this study, we chose to target mature B cells rather than hematopoietic stem cells for several reasons. Because engineered cells must eventually be autologously engrafted in most animal models, using substrate cells readily obtained in the periphery would make eventual re-engraftment easier. Additionally, we might not need high engineering efficiencies in mature B cells compared with that which might be required for progenitor cells because we can exploit their natural potential for antigen dependent expansion and maturation in vivo through the use of immunogens during engraftment. We agree that engineering primary B cells rather than B cells adapted for growth in culture would make the study significantly more impactful. We have therefore replaced Figure 4 showing engineering success in polyclonal EBV transformed cells with results in human primary B cells purified from fresh PBMCs. NGS mRNA sequence datasets from these experiments will be uploaded to Dryad and NCBI for review.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Main text, second paragraph, Figure 1 – the loss of breadth for the PG9 heavy chain with any of these light chains is greater than implied by the authors.

We have also added percentage values for the number of viruses from the global panel showing at least some neutralization sensitivity to the indicated PG9 chimera. We agree with the reviewer that it is intriguing that 3 viruses from the global panel are more ubiquitously neutralized by PG9 chimeras. Indeed, we looked into this and there does not seem to be an obvious common feature shared between these three viruses compared with the other nine based on sequence alignments of the V1/V2 apex epitope region (Figure 9, DeCamp et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 – the legend for parts B and C seems to have been reversed.

The X axis in Figure 2D is now correctly labeled as ‘APC’. We were also curious about the detection of what looked to be PG9 IgG in unstimulated engineered (C108 selected) V781PG9 HC-expressing cells. Sanger sequencing indeed confirmed that this band was PG9 IgG and not an off-target product amplified during PCR. Because no IgG bands could be detected in any other unstimulated sample, we wonder if we may have selected a 2G6 sub-clone during the V781 engineering bottleneck which had the ability to class-switch in culture without cytokine stimulation, perhaps at low levels, such that class switching in the minority (Ramos) heavy chain in this C108-selected line could not be seen by PCR amplification of IgG mRNA. We think that the low level of Ramos HC mRNA in engineered, selected cell lines is the reason we do not see amplification of Ramos HC IgG in stimulated cultures even though it can be detected as IgM. We have modified Figure 2G to make the labelling less cumbersome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main text, fourth paragraph – is CRISPR-cas editing efficiency generally known to be related to the size of the segment being replaced?</p></disp-quote><p>In most genome editing studies, employing two Cas9 cut sites, the desired outcome is a deletion of the region between these sites using NHEJ mechanisms. It has been observed in several reports (referenced in Yuning Song et al. Oncotarget v.8(4):5647, 2017), that this outcome is observed at lower frequencies when the size of the segment being replaced is large. This makes sense as distant cut sites should less frequently come into close proximity to allow NHEJ between them. There is currently no evidence to suggest the general repair machinery can play a role in bringing distant cut sites together. Pax5 positive maturing B cells undergoing V(D)J recombination do not show a proximity bias when recombining V/D or V/J genes within Ig loci using RAG dependent recombination. Long distance recombination events in this case are facilitated by reorganization of the chromosome into ‘V gene loops’ or ‘recombination centers’ which bring V/D and V/J switch sites into proximity during this stage of B cell development (David Schatz, Nature Reviews Immunology, 11, 251-263 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main text, ninth paragraph and Figure 3B. Was equivalent sequencing performed for the light chains of cells that were not exposed to selection by WITO and MGRM8? This should be shown for comparison with W1,2,3 and M1,2,3. Also do positions 95 and 97 fall within AID hotspots?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, sequencing on the PU ‘passaged unselected’ cell line was also performed. Because no FACS selection pressure was applied to this line after the original C108 selection for engineered cells, the light chain did not show an enrichment of mutations deleting or moving the N95 and the sequences were very similar to the non-engineered Ramos cell line for the light chain. Results from this sample have now been included in the bar graph in Figure 3B. The accepted AID hotspot motif is WRCY, where W= A or T; R= A or G; and Y= C or T. The CDRL3 indeed has an AID hotspot motif spanning residue 97. We have now covered this in the text of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B does not make it easy to see which of the mutations result in the shift or deletion of the glycan at position 95 which is the focus of the following section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified this figure and now categorize mutations in the CDRL3 into three phenotypes; 1) N95, 2) N97 and 3) N95 deletion. We hope this improves the clarity of the result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main text ninth paragraph. The authors state that antibodies with the N95 glycan deleted or shifted to 97 showed improved affinity for HIV SOSIPS. While this seems generally true, it is not true for WITO, one of the selecting antigens, where loss of the glycan results in a drop in affinity. Since WITO-selected cells lose the glycan as often as they shift it, how do the authors explain the selection of deleterious mutations at this level?</p></disp-quote><p>The size exclusion profiles of the three variant antibodies expressed in 293F cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) suggest the possibility that the PG9HC/RamosLLC chimeric antibody may be more stable without a PNGS in the CDRL3 loop based on the fact that the variant with the glycan deletion showed a smaller aggregate peak (around 8-14 ml) compared to those with glycans at 95 and 97. While relative amounts of these three antibodies expressed by 293 cells appear similar, it may also be that the presence of a CDRL3 glycan impairs pairing with the PG9 heavy chain in Ramos cells resulting in reduced levels of cell surface expressed BCR. If this is true, it may be that higher levels of glycan deleted BCR on the cell surface compensate for the slight decrease in affinity (for WITO) and allow these cells to end up in our FACS gate despite our attempts to normalize for BCR expression levels using an anti-λ FITC (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). These antibodies may not have been selected if we set a lower anti-λ (FITC) cut-off. Interestingly, while the affinity of this antibody seems to decrease slightly (on the level of on rate), neutralization by this variant is better than for the N95 against WITO. It may be that a slower off rate plays a role in selecting this variant during FACS and in neutralizing the WITO virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3E – how similar are the Ramos and PG9 light chains? Would homology modelling with the correct light chain provide additional confirmation?</p></disp-quote><p>The Ramos and PG9 λ light chains use the same V gene (IGLV2-14*01). Ramos uses the IGLJ2*01 gene while PG9 uses the IGLJ3*02 (Figure 1). CDR1 and 2 loops are almost identical in size and sequence. The CDRL3s are significantly different in sequence. The Ramos CDRL3 is one residue longer (11 amino acids) and of course contains the PNGS at position 95. Because of this glycan’s proximity to the N160 glycan of the HIV Env epitope, it is easy to imagine how it may impede approach and binding of the PG9 HC due to steric hinderance. Removal or shifting of its position to reduce this clash could thus improve affinity. WITO, which is less glycan dense than MGRM8 at the apex (missing glycans both within the hypervariable V2 loop (185-187) and at position 130, both in close proximity to the N160 glycan, Voss et al. Cell Reports Figure 1A and B), could mean that the epitope on WITO better accommodates a glycan projecting down towards the epitope from the CDRL3. Atomic resolution structures could clarify matters here, but we feel this is beyond the scope of this report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3F – related to the comment above, a similar comparison between PU, M3 and W3 would be informative, given the substantial SHM in the H chain in PU, some of which overlaps that of the antigen selected SHM in M3.</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment, we only wanted to prove that somatic hypermutation was occurring in the new PG9 VDJ gene. We therefore repeated the RT-PCR using a protocol which incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) into each mRNA as it is transcribed to DNA. Then we amplified by PCR and chose two samples to fill a MiSeq chip (25m reads total) in order to generate enough reads to achieve an average UMI frequency of 30 reads/UMI to deal with PCR based artifacts which complicate AID mutation analysis. We chose the unselected line and one selected line to illustrate how mutations in these genes may become skewed as a result of selection pressure acting on the final protein. This figure proves that AID mutations occur, and that selected genes do show differences compared with unselected ones. We do not think that significant conclusions can be made about the details of this selection in this specific example. For example, one could argue that the presence of a green bar in the coding mutation graph where no purple bar exists means that the mutation results in a BCR which shows lower affinity to the FACS probe which is therefore not selected. But at such low frequency, another option is that a founder effect is occurring during the antigen selection bottleneck whereby this particular mutation is reduced in frequency by chance, especially when very small numbers of cells are selected from the total. Similarly, a purple bar which is higher than a green bar suggests a site where positive selection pressure (improved FACS probe binding) is enriching a mutation. But these could also be founder effects during population bottlenecks during the sort, emergence of mutations after selection, or genetic linkages to other sites which are undergoing purifying selection for example.</p></body></sub-article></article>
