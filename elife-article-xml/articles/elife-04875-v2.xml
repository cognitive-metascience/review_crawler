We expressed yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from a yeast promoter and selected for a regular alternation between low and high fluorescence over a 24-hr period. This selection produced changes in cell adhesion rather than YFP expression: clonal populations oscillated between single cells and multicellular clumps. The oscillations are not a response to environmental cues and continue for at least three cycles in a constant environment. We identified eight putative causative mutations in one clone and recreated the evolved phenotype in the ancestral strain. The mutated genes lack obvious relationships to each other, but multiple lineages change from the haploid to the diploid pattern of gene expression. We show that a novel, complex phenotype can evolve by small sets of mutations in genes whose molecular functions appear to be unrelated to each other.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04875.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04875.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04875.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In living things, many important behaviors—including animal heartbeats and sleep patterns—happen in cycles. Machines called oscillators, which are found inside cells, control these behaviors. There are many different oscillators and they share some common features, despite involving different genes.</p><p>Each oscillator is formed of a set of genes that interact with each other to drive regular cycles lasting seconds, hours, or even months. The oscillators do not need any cues from the environment to maintain these cycles. However, cues such as light or temperature can keep the oscillator synchronized with the environment.</p><p>To ask how complex machines like oscillators could evolve, Wildenberg and Murray inserted a gene that makes a fluorescent protein into budding yeast, a single-celled species that does not have an oscillator with a period of 24 hr. These yeast cells were then selectively grown through a few hundred generations to experimentally evolve a yeast strain where the levels of protein fluorescence regularly alternated over 24-hr periods.</p><p>Wildenberg and Murray then carried out further experiments to discover the cause of the pattern of protein fluorescence. These revealed that the pattern was due to the yeast cells alternating between forming clumps of multiple cells and living separately. The genes that mutated to create the cycles of cell clumping in the yeast all appear to have unrelated roles.</p><p>The 24-hr oscillator that evolved in the yeast has some of the features of the biological oscillators found in nature. It maintains regular cycles even without any cues from the environment and it can control a cell behavior, but the oscillator appears to be unable to accept cues from the environment, a universal property of naturally evolved circadian clocks. Further work to understand how the genes work together in the oscillator will help to better understand how 24-hr oscillators in nature can evolve from genes that lack any 24-hr behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04875.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04875.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>genome</kwd><kwd>evolutionary novelty</kwd><kwd>complex trait</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centers of Excellence in Complex Biomedical Systems Research P50 GM068763-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship 1F32GM085920-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wildenberg</surname><given-names>Gregg A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New complex traits can evolve through the elimination of genes in multiple unrelated pathways, rather than through the creation of new gene functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological oscillators demand dynamical interactions between multiple components and have evolved many times to drive various behaviors, from heartbeats, on the timescale of seconds, to circadian clocks and seasonal clocks, on the time scale of days and years.

As an example of a novel trait, we evolved a 24-hr oscillator in the budding yeast to determine how biologically complex machinery could evolve from proteins and signaling networks that lack any known connection to oscillatory behavior. Because circadian clocks can be entrained by environmental signals and have a temperature-independent period, whereas the behavior we have evolved represents an autonomous oscillator with a period of roughly 24 hr that controls a biological output, we refer to the circuit we have evolved as a diurnal oscillator, referring to its period, rather than the distinction between day and night.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our initial goal was to use fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescent reporters to select for diurnal regulation of gene expression.

We used FACS to select for variation in YFP fluorescence over a 24-hr period: each cycle began with selection of the dimmest events, the selected cells were allowed to proliferate, and the population was then selected, 10 hr later; for the brightest events, the selected cells were allowed to proliferate, and the dimmest events were selected, 14 hr later, completing the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We evolved two parallel populations using two different strengths of selection: the top and bottom 6% (E6) or 15% (E15) of the events detected by FACS. The selected cells proliferated for roughly six divisions before the next selection. Our scheme selects for synchrony rather than entrainment: twice a day, we select the cells with high or low fluorescence, rather than varying an environmental cue and selecting for a response to it. The human analogy would be to go to a large, international airport and select only those travelers who had arrived from the same time zone, rather than taking all newly arrived passengers and using alternating light and dark cycles to entrain their clocks over a period of several days.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04875.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell association clock evolves from selecting for high and low YFP expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Selection scheme for a 24-hr oscillator: cells were collected from the dimmest 6% (E6) of the distribution of YFP fluorescing events, grown exponentially at &lt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml for ∼10 hr and then the brightest 6% of events were collected and the cells in this population were grown for ∼14 hr at &lt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml.

To analyze the behavior of the evolved populations in more detail, we cultured them from stocks frozen that had been prepared at the end of the original selection. When they are first thawed, these populations are asynchronous, presumably because the manipulations associated with freezing and thawing disrupt the synchrony between the oscillations of different individuals. We therefore subjected these cultures to the same, twice daily, selection used for the evolution: the dimmest events are collected, cells are allowed to proliferate for 10 hr, the population distribution of fluorescence is recorded by FACS, and the brightest events are collected. After 14 hr of proliferation, distributions are recorded, and the dimmest events are collected to complete the cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This protocol is a form of selection synchrony: it synchronizes a population by selecting those members that are at the peaks and troughs of a cycle of fluorescence intensity, rather than by applying a stimulus that alters the phase of the oscillations until all members of the population have the same phase (induction synchrony or entrainment). After synchronization, both evolved populations showed a cyclical change in the fluorescence distribution, with the E6 population giving larger shifts than the less strongly selected E15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It takes more cycles of synchronization of E15 to achieve the full amplitude of daily oscillation than it does for E6, which is largely synchronized within 24 hr of selection.</p><p>Our starting strain also contained red fluorescent protein (RFP) under the control of the <italic>ACT1</italic> (actin) promoter, allowing us to ask if RFP fluorescence, which had not been selected on, also cycled. To our surprise, the distribution of RFP also cycled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), prompting us to examine the cells at different phases of the cycle. Just before their scheduled selection for low fluorescence, the population was predominantly single-celled, and just before their selection for high fluorescence, most cells were in multicellular clumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The fluorescence per cell is constant over 24 hr, for both YFP and RFP, and thus the cyclical variation in intensity seen by FACS is entirely due to changes in cell association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because we see similar fluctuations in the fluorescence from <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub><italic>-RFP</italic> as we do from <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>FLO1</italic></sub><italic>-YFP</italic>, we believe that we would have selected for oscillations in cell aggregation with any promoter that drove the expression of a fluorescent protein to levels that were sufficient for our FACS-based selection.</p><p>The cyclical behavior of our evolved populations could be due to interactions between two or more different genotypes. To eliminate this possibility, we isolated and analyzed fifteen clones from each population after subjecting them to FACS-based synchronization: all 30 clones produced strong oscillations in YFP and RFP distributions, and we analyzed the clone that showed the strongest oscillations (E6-1) in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Except for the free-run experiments, described later in the paper, all other experiments examined populations that were subject to FACS-based selection twice a day with a 10-hr interval between the selection for the dimmest and brightest events and a 14-hr interval between the selection for the brightest and dimmest events.</p><p>The cycle is not a response to daily variations in environmental factors such as temperature. If populations were responding to environmental fluctuations, they should eventually synchronize in response to these fluctuations. To look for this behavior, we subdivided a single population of clone E6-1 and subjected it to two different treatments: synchronizing it by FACS selection, as described above, or subjecting it to identical manipulations, except that we collected all the events that passed through the FACS, without regard to their fluorescence intensity. The first population oscillated, showing primarily single cells just before the selection for low YFP fluorescence, and primarily clumps just before the selection for high YFP fluorescence, whereas the unsynchronized population showed very similar distributions at these two times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We conclude that we have evolved a cyclical change in cell association with a period of about 24 hr, and cells that show this oscillation can be synchronized by selecting on their level of fluorescence as a proxy for the number of cells in a clump.</p><p>To analyze the oscillations in cell association, we followed the behavior of E6-1 cells grown at low population density using two different labels. The first, cerulean fluorescent protein (CFP) was expressed from a constitutive promoter (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub>) to distinguish two genetically identical subclones: one expressed CFP (CFP<sup>+</sup>) and the other did not (CFP<sup>−</sup>). The second was introduced by labeling cells, just after FACS selection, by covalently linking Oregon Green 488-X, a yellow fluorescent molecule, to their cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hoch et al., 2005</xref>). Because a daughter’s cell wall is entirely new, the original cells retain the yellow label and their daughters are unlabeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barral et al., 2000</xref>). We followed these cultures as they proliferated and eventually switched to the other phase of the morphological oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Single cells that were selected for by sorting for low YFP fluorescence and covalently labeled (T = 0 hr), proliferated to become clumps composed of a single yellow cell surrounded with non-yellow cells that had the same CFP expression state as the original single cell. The absence of clumps containing more than one yellow cell or both CFP<sup>+</sup> and CFP<sup>−</sup> cells in the same clump shows that cells emerging from the single-cell phase build lineage-based clumps. Consistent with this interpretation, we saw synchronous oscillations in cell association even at very high dilution (∼10<sup>3</sup> cells/ml). Multicellular clumps, which were covalently labeled at the time of peak aggregation gave rise to single cells by a combination of two mechanisms: fragmenting to produce smaller clumps and proliferating to produce single-celled offspring. Smaller clumps consisting of yellow cells and newly born non-yellow cells were observed 3 hr after (T = 13 hr) the peak aggregation time (10 hr). By 18 hr, the population was a mixture of medium-sized and smaller clumps and single cells, and by 24 hr non-yellow, single cells, and small clumps were the bulk of the population, representing the completion of one cycle. When unsynchronized CFP<sup>+</sup> and CFP<sup>−</sup> subclones were sonicated to break up all the clumps and cultured together for 90 min, clumps that re-associated were composed of a mixture of CFP<sup>+</sup> and CFP<sup>−</sup> cells showing that clumps form by cells sticking together rather than failing to separate after division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results show that cells oscillate between two states over a 24-hr period: single cells produce offspring that immediately stick to their mothers to assemble a lineage-based clump, which later produces a population of single cells and small clumps as a result of clumps fragmenting and producing single cells which divide to produce a mixture of small clumps and single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04875.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>24-hour autonomous oscillations in dynamic aggregate assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of a synchronized E6-1 population at different points through the 24-hr cycle.

We therefore asked if our synchronized populations could free run: continue to oscillate in the absence of both entraining signals and periodic selection for cells in particular phases of the oscillation. We performed two experiments: one on populations and another to follow lineages initiating from single cells. In the population experiment, E6-1 was subjected to three different conditions. (1) Unsynchronized: cells that had been passaged without earlier synchronization were passed through the FACS machine and diluted twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions, but all cells that passed through the FACS machine were collected, regardless of their fluorescence level and then diluted. (2) Synchronized: a population was synchronized by selection for 3 days with selection at alternating 10 and 14 hr intervals. The culture was synchronized by FACS for another 3 days, by FACS selection and dilution twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions. (3) Free run: a population was synchronized by selection for 3 days at 10:14-hr intervals. After 3 days of synchronization (marked by a dotted line), this culture was not subject to FACs but was simply diluted twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions for an additional 3 days. The initial, synchronized population used to start the free run was the same one that was used to start the population with continuing synchronization. Thus, all three conditions were diluted with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two daily dilutions and maintained at a density that allowed continual exponential proliferation. The free run populations continued to show detectable oscillations, which were undetectable in a control population that had not been synchronized (Unsynch) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We next monitored how individual lineages oscillate without any prior FACS-based synchronization. A single cell was grown in a well of a 96-well plate and imaged every 3.5 hr. After 24 hr, the resulting population was collected and diluted back to single objects, regardless of clump size, into three separate new wells and followed every 3.5 hr for another 24 hr. This procedure was repeated one more time for each lineage (i.e<italic>.</italic>, 3 cells from each of 3 sub-lineages) for a third day, as shown by the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. This protocol dilutes cells once every 24 hr to keep cells in exponential growth throughout the experiment. Cell lineages produced sustained oscillations for 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) with many lineages remaining in phase with each other. In some lineages, their phase shifted within a 24-hr period, but the overall period, over 3 cycles was approximately 24 hr. These results suggest that we have evolved an autonomous oscillator capable of sustained oscillations in the absence of an environmental stimulus.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04875.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The evolved oscillator free runs for at least three cycles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three populations were compared. (1) Unsynchronized: cells that had been passaged without earlier synchronization were passed through the FACS machine and diluted twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions, but all cells that passed through the FACS machine were collected, regardless of their fluorescence level and then diluted. (2) Synchronized: a population was synchronized by selection for 3 days with selection at alternating 10 and 14 hr intervals. The culture was synchronized by FACS for another 3 days, by FACS selection and dilution twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions. (3) Free run: a population was synchronized by selection for 3 days at 10:14 hr intervals. After 3 days of synchronization (marked by a dotted line), this culture was not subject to FACs but was simply diluted twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions for an additional 3 days. All populations were diluted to ensure the population always reached the same final, pre-dilution density of ∼ 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml, well below the density that corresponds to the end of mid-log phase growth for budding yeast (3 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml). The initial, synchronized population used to start the free run was the same one that was used to start the population with continuing synchronization (Synch). The measured variable, F75/F25 is based on the distribution of fluorescence and pulse widths at each time point. For both measurements, the lowest value is set to 0% and the highest to 100%, with values scaled linearly in between and the number of events that lie between 0 and 25% for both fluorescence intensity and pulse width is counted as F25, and the number of events that lie between 75 and 100% for both fluorescence intensity and pulse width is counted as F75, and we plot log(F75/F25). (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the protocol for analyzing individual lineages. A single cell is deposited in a microtiter well, and its progeny are observed every 3.5 hr for 24 hr, before taking 3 objects randomly (single cells or cell clumps), and depositing them in fresh wells, observing for 24 hr, and finally taking 3 objects randomly (cells or cell clumps), from each of the three wells and depositing them in fresh wells, and observing for 24 hr. (<bold>C</bold>) Individual traces of lineages originating from three separate cells (Lineage 1, 2, 3). An unsynchronized population was used to establish lineages that arose from single cells, which were diluted once every 24 hr and never experienced any FACS synchronization. A single cell was placed in 100 µl of medium in a microtiter well and allowed to proliferate for 24 hr that corresponds to a maximum of 16 divisions, a 64,000-fold increase in cell density from 10 cells/ml to 640,000 cells/ml, more than 40-fold below the density at which the exponential rate of cell proliferation starts to fall. Individual cells and clumps were imaged every 3.5 hr for 72 hr. At each time point, at least 50% of the cells and clumps in the wells were imaged and the average two-dimensional area was calculated. All lineages produce approximately 24-hr oscillations without any FACS-based synchronization. Some lineages alter their phase but continue to produce ∼24-hr oscillations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04875.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04875.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04875-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Because there could be multiple oscillating lineages, each with a different genetic basis, in our evolved population, we analyzed the behavior of four individual clones from the E6 population, focusing on the clone E6-1.

The full set of mutations needed to cause cycling should be present in the vast majority of the selected progeny, whereas the allele frequency of the neutral mutations that have accumulated during evolution should be ∼50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birkeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koschwanez et al., 2013</xref>).

We investigated the role of removing genes because two of the causative mutations were stop codons, suggesting that other causative mutations might also inactivate the genes in which they occurred. Each causative mutation could be individually replaced by a gene deletion without destroying the oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

To determine how the mutations whose wild-type expression had no effect were contributing to the oscillator, pools of spores from a diploid heterozygous for the eight mutations were selected for four ‘sub-traits’ of the oscillator: batch culture was used to select for exponential growth and FACS to select for constitutive clumps, single cells, and stochastic clumping. After 5 days of selection, the eight mutations were PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced from genomic DNA of the surviving pool of spores to estimate the frequency of the ancestral and evolved allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koschwanez et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

In search of other clues, we measured gene expression to look for changes in E6-1. We performed two comparisons. The first was between synchronous and asynchronous populations. We isolated RNA at the same times from three cultures: the peak periods of single cells and multicellular clumps for a synchronized E6-1 culture, an unsynchronized E6-1 culture passaged through the FACS machine, but without sorting, and an ancestral population subjected to the synchronization protocol. We compared each population to the other two and failed to find a significant excess of genes that appeared to cycle in the evolved, synchronized population.</p><p>The second comparison was to examine the mean expression of genes in the evolved and the ancestral populations. There were 155 genes whose expression differed between the ancestral and evolved populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The most striking of these were genes involved in sexual behavior. Haploid-specific genes (hsg), which are normally expressed in haploids and repressed in diploids, were repressed in the evolved clone; 8 of the 10 most strongly repressed genes were haploid-specific. This phenotype is due to the causal mutation that inactivates <italic>SIR4</italic>, a gene required for transcriptional silencing of sub-telomeric genes, and the mating genes at the two silenced loci, <italic>HML</italic>α and <italic>HMR</italic><bold>a</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Herskowitz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Pillus and Rine, 1989</xref>). In <italic>sir4</italic> cells, the expression of <bold>a</bold> and α information from these two loci mimics a diploid cell and represses haploid-specific genes. Consistent with the effect of expressing <italic>SIR4</italic> in E6-1, deleting <italic>HML</italic>α from the evolved clone, which removes the only source of α information restores the haploid pattern of gene expression and eliminates cell clumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the evolutionary trajectory of the E6 population by asking when the causative mutations found in the E6-1 clone appeared and how widespread they were by the end of our evolution. Each mutation was PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced at different time points over the course of the evolution to determine its frequency to an accuracy of roughly 10%. None of the mutations in E6-1 reached a frequency above 0.4, two were undetectable in the overall population, and the remaining six were first detected between 12 and 30 days of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The low allele frequencies at the final time point of our evolution have two possible interpretations: the evolved population contains a single oscillating lineage, which has yet to eliminate a substantial fraction of non-oscillating lineages, or it is a mixture of genetically distinct oscillator lineages. All the clones from the evolved populations cycled suggesting that the populations have multiple lineages. We therefore performed bulk segregant analysis on three additional clones from the strongly selected population (E6-2,3,4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1A</xref>). Our results show that two cycling populations have evolved entirely independent, and each of these has split into two subpopulations. E6-2 contained 6 of the 8 causative mutations found in E6-1 and had three additional putative causative mutations. E6-3 and E6-4 share three mutations, but have no mutations in common with the lineage that produced E6-1 and E6-2. Analyzing the entire open reading frame of <italic>WHI2</italic>, the one gene that was mutated in all 4 sequenced clones, suggests that there are at least five independently evolved oscillators in the E6 and E15 populations, since one population (E6) contains 2 mutant and one wild-type allele, and the other contains one mutant and one wild-type allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 6—source data 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04875.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Genetically distinct clones evolve same oscillator through similar molecular changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The frequencies of the causal mutations found in E6-1 were measured by Sanger sequencing a region surrounding each mutation from frozen stocks of the E6 population taken at the indicated times during the experimental evolution.

Fluctuations in metabolic activity can be driven by temperature oscillations with a 24-hr period but rapidly die out at constant temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eelderink-Chen et al., 2010</xref>), and a particular regime of growth to high density can induce prolonged metabolic oscillations whose period is 4–5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tu et al., 2005</xref>). We think it is unlikely that either of these cycles are connected to the behavior we observe: the 24-hr cycles do not free-run and the shorter cycles have the wrong period and can only be seen at cell densities higher than those that we used. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the behavior we see is the result of coupling changes in cell–cell adhesion to a previously unknown circadian clock in budding yeast.</p><p>How similar is the diurnal oscillator we evolved to naturally occurring circadian clocks? All circadian clocks share four features: (1) a limit-cycle, cell autonomous cellular oscillator that continues to oscillate in the absence of environmental cues (free run); (2) the oscillator maintains a roughly 24-hr period over a range of temperatures (temperature compensation); (3) the period of the internal oscillator can be synchronized, or entrained, to the phase of a daily environmental cue (e.g., light, temperature); and (4) the ability to control cellular and organismal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Young and Kay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Tauber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rosbash, 2009</xref>). Our results show the yeast oscillator we evolved has two of these four behaviors: its roughly 24-hr period is maintained in the absence of environmental cues or selection on the output of the oscillator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2B, 3A, 3C, 4C, and 4D</xref>), and it regulates a cellular behavior, the ability of cells to form clumps. Further investigations are required to determine if the yeast oscillator uses the combination of positive and negative feedback loops that form the core of circadian clocks and could be evolved to be temperature-compensated and entrained by environmental signals.</p><p>Our experiment shows that mutating genes in multiple, unrelated biochemical networks can produce evolutionary novelty and reveals that identifying adaptive mutations is often insufficient to explain the mechanism of these new phenotypes. The ability of multiple combinations of mutations to produce the same complex phenotype leads to two inferences. First, we know relatively little about the circuitry of many existing molecular pathways and evolving novel traits may help illuminate previously unknown connections between pathways. Second, that multiple mutations are capable of producing unexpected changes in cellular physiology by connecting previously unrelated pathways to produce new circuits. The few mutations that are shared between different oscillating lineages suggest that there are multiple, functionally different ways that such rearrangements can lead to the same phenotype.</p><p>The common loss of silencing despite little commonality in other mutated genes between evolved clones has two implications. First, it suggests that wild yeast may regulate their clumpiness during the diploid phase, which accounts for most of their life cycle, and that our evolved populations have exploited this regulation to respond to our selection for oscillatory behavior. Second, the independent evolution of the same trait appears to have a mixture of common and diverse features. All nine of the populations we examined have switched from the haploid- to the diploid-specific pattern of gene expression and all four lineages analyzed in detail have mutated <italic>WHI2</italic>. The repeated occurrence of these genetic changes suggests that they greatly increase the number of subsequent mutations that could lead to the appearance of an oscillator. Whether the later mutations act on a single pathway or multiple, different pathways will require the detailed dissection of the oscillator's mechanism. It would be interesting to determine whether a selection for oscillation in diploids, where the inactivation of genes requires two independent genetic changes, would take a similar trajectory and produce the same mechanism that we have uncovered in haploids.</p><p>The inconsistency among bulk segregant analysis, gene deletions and wild type reversions illustrates the difficulty in identifying the contribution of different mutations to a complex, evolved phenotype. We can nevertheless make inferences about the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary novelties. Four of the six mutations that are strongly identified as causal mutations are loss of function mutations. The mutations in <italic>SCW11</italic> and <italic>WHI2</italic> are nonsense mutations, whereas those in <italic>SIR4</italic> and <italic>YJL070C</italic> can be replaced by gene deletions, but not by restoration of the wild-type gene. The preponderance of loss of function mutants suggests that sophisticated functions can be produced primarily by inactivating genes, rather than modifying or increasing their activities. Whether similar paths are followed in nature is likely to depend on the strength and unidirectionality of selection and the extent of antagonistic pleiotropy: the contrast between the benefits of a mutation in one environment and its costs in others. We speculate that short bursts of intense selection, such as those that occur when a species occupies a new and unoccupied niche, could lead to adaptation that is primarily driven by gene inactivation, whose short-term benefits exceeds its costs. These costs could later be reduced either by suppressor mutations that would minimize the harmful effects of loss of function mutations, while maintaining the evolved phenotype, or even by reversion of the original mutation, once the evolved phenotype had been stabilized by further mutations. Further investigation will be required to determine how often loss of function mutations participate in a variety of evolutionary processes, ranging from cancer to the formation of new species and forms of biological organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains</title><p>The W303 <italic>S.</italic> cerevisiae strain background was used for all experiments. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> provides a detailed list of each strain used.

A small portion of the evolving population was occasionally frozen in 15% glycerol to establish a historical record. After 30 days of selection, clonal lines were isolated by spotting single events with FACS from the top 6% or 15% of the YFP distribution onto YPD plates. Resulting colonies were restreaked again on YPD to ensure the colonies were from a single cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Synchronization of populations by FACS</title><p>For evolved populations, E6 and E15, a portion of the frozen stock was inoculated directly into liquid media and diluted to first grow exponentially overnight for &gt;12 hr at 30°C. For clones, a single colony was inoculated into liquid media and diluted overnight for &gt;12 hr, 30°C. At a fixed time of the day, which differed between different experiments, cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5–10 min, placed on ice, and immediately brought to the FACS machine. The dimmest 6–10% YFP expressing cells were collected from the unsynchronized population and grown in liquid media at &lt;5 × 10^5 cells/ml for 10 hr at 30°C. Cells were then centrifuged, placed on ice, and brought to the FACS. Data were collected from the first several thousand cells to set the gates for the selection that immediately followed. The brightest 6–10% YFP cells were collected and grown at &lt;5 × 10^5/ml for 14 hr at 30°C. Cells were prepared for FACS, data were collected while gates were set and the dimmest 6–10% YFP cells were collected to begin the next cycle. Unsynchronized populations were prepared for FACS in an identical manner to synchronized populations but cells were collected randomly from the entire YFP distribution. For free run experiments, populations were synchronized by FACS for 3 days and then split into two cultures. One culture was synchronized for another 3 days and the other was kept exponentially growing by transferring ∼1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells into fresh media and analyzing the remaining cells by FACS every 10 and 14 hr for 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Lineage oscillation free run</title><p>A time 0 hr, a single cell was deposited into a well of a 96-well plate containing 10 µl of YPD and immediately imaged with an inverted microscope. 190 µl of YPD was slowly added to the well, and the plate was placed at 30°C, unshaken. Every 3.5 hr, the plate was removed from the incubator, gently tapped by hand, quickly imaged, and placed back at 30°C. After 24 hr, the cells were collected and three cells regardless of their clump size were randomly chosen from the population by depositing every 200<sup>th</sup> FACS event from the entire YFP distribution into new individual wells containing 10 µl of YPD. Cells were imaged and 190 µl of YPD was added to each well and placed at 30°C, unshaken and imaged every 3.5 hr as described above. After another 24 hr, the three populations were removed from the plate and three cells from each population were randomly deposited into new individual wells (9 total) using FACS as described above and imaged every 3.5 hr for 24 hr. For each time point, the average area of cell clumps was determined using ImageJ. A minimum of 250 cells were counted for each time point always making sure to count at least 50% of the population by choosing random fields of view to quantify.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>qPCR</title><p>qPCR was performed using published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koschwanez et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quartile plots of oscillations</title><p>See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> for a definition of the F75:F25 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Time course measurements of E6-1 clock mutations from the E6 population</title><p>A small fraction of the glycerol stock from each time point of the evolved population was collected and genomic DNA was immediately purified.

To determine the clump size that corresponded to the pulse width of 14.5 µM beads, ancestor and E6-1 cells were collected by FACS onto a glass slide from a narrow gate that matched the 14.5 µM beads pulse width distribution. ∼500 cells were scored for their clump size three separate times by eye with a microscope.

Equal numbers of cells from each media were pooled together, a fraction of this pool was frozen down to measure the initial frequency of each mutation (starting population) and the remaining cells were selected by FACS for the noted traits twice a day for 5 days. For exponential growth, cells were diluted by batch culture twice a day to keep them in exponential phase.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom, Michael Laub, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Michael Rosbash, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>After careful consideration and discussion of your work, we have decided that we cannot consider it further for publication unless several issues can be resolved, through changes to the text and/or additional experiments. Most notably, there was uncertainty among the reviewers as to whether the evolved populations exhibited truly free-running oscillations. At the heart of this issue is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> showing YFP levels in several different populations over three days. The E6-1 line seems to oscillate between high and low YFP, but it was not clear whether this population was being subjected to FACS at 10 and 14 hour intervals or was simply being grown for 3 days and then analyzed periodically by flow cytometry. If it's the latter, then how long do oscillations persist? Related to this point of confusion, it was not clear why a synchronization process is required before performing the flow cytometry analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: after 30 days of selection, shouldn't the evolved population already be synchronized? In this same vein, why doesn't the entire E6 population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> show stronger oscillations? Although it is comprised of multiple clones, weren't they all oscillating by the end of the 30 day selection scheme that produced this population? And finally, there was a concern raised about whether the evolved population was oscillating or was being entrained by the selective regime imposed (FACS-based selection at 10 and 14 hour intervals).</p><p>There was general agreement that your work is exciting and creative, and it was considered potentially suitable for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>, provided you can adequately address the concerns summarized above. What would be most critical is a clear, unequivocal demonstration that the evolved population exhibits free running, circadian oscillations in the absence of any selection or specific growth procedure.</p><p>Further detail is provided below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this interesting study, budding yeast was evolved to develop circadian rhythms; or something vaguely similar. The authors attempted to generate cycles of circadian gene expression, which ended up somewhat surprisingly selecting for daily cycles of cell-cell adhesion or clumping. There is no evident oscillating gene expression, which makes a marked distinction between this (these) evolved oscillator(s) and real circadian oscillators in different biological systems. The authors mapped their phenotype to eight mutations, all of which probably correspond to hypomorphic or amorphic alleles of the eight genes. At least they can be replaced by gene knock-outs. Finally, the authors demonstrate that independently evolved yeast clones have mutations in distinct sets of genes, which do not appear related in any obvious way. By this I mean the different mutant genes are not related to each other, nor is there a relationship between the different mutant genes in the different clones. An exception is the repression of haploid-specific gene expression, which is present in all but one of the clones. The paper in general is first rate; the experiments, figures and text are models of clarity. A key judgment call is significance. I come down positive despite my comments. Requests for experiments were kept minimal, in the spirit of <italic>eLife</italic> policy.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors might consider extending the issue of free-running oscillations as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. How long do they persist in the absence of selection, is there a rapid loss of amplitude and what is their period? Are other clones similar to E6-1, which appears to have a fairly strong period that persists for at least two days? A period determination may require higher-density time-points.</p><p>2) Importantly, is the period temperature-compensated like all natural circadian oscillators?</p><p>3) I would replace individual mutant genes with wild-type versions, for at least a few of the mutant genes. The question is, are the oscillations completely eliminated by eliminating a single mutant gene, i.e., are all 8 mutations required for any perceptible cycling? I would begin this with Sir4, i.e., does this prediction hold based on what has been done? In other words, are oscillations eliminated for 7 of the 8 clones when WT Sir4 is restored, i.e., all but E6-5, as predicted from the hsg expression phenotypes? This would test the importance of mating type gene expression in a different way. This replacement of the mutant gene by a WT version should then be done for 2 or 3 more of the genes, in 2 or 3 more of the clones. The request is because it is unclear whether there are really 8 required mutations in all cases and whether this number or something like it is representative of all 8 clones.</p><p>4) Similarly, please check hsg in all 8 clones to see if this is really a common feature or not. This is especially important for clone E6-5, which did not respond to the deletion of HMLalpha. In other words, is it the only clone not to repress hsg? Check HMLalpha and HMLa expression too, to verify that this is truly the source of hsg regulation. Does upregulation of hsg expression itself inhibit clumping?</p><p>5) I would also check diploids with these 8 genes knocked out (both copies obviously). Do they undergo oscillations of adhesion? This is related to the statement:“[...]wild yeast may regulate their clumpiness during the diploid phase[...]” However, diploid yeast, although capable of filamentation, show very low levels of flocculation and expression of the flocculins. What about a direct assessment, if it is possible?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I very much appreciate this paper and the creative nature of the science. I am bothered though by one potentially significant matter: evidence supporting the claim that the authors have evolved a circadian oscillator. There exists the possibility that the cells have adapted to the selective regime and that continuing to propagate the cells under the same 10 h and 14 h regime, even without FACS is at least in part responsible for the observed changes between single cells and clumps. I think that it is necessary to exclude this possibility. I do recognise that the authors report an experiment that attempts to rule out entrainment, but this still uses, from what I can, the 10 and 14 h regime. Perhaps take the cells and propagate them in a chemostat, or simply change duration of the cycle: take cells that are about to experience the 10 h phase and provide them with 14 h (and vice versa).</p><p>I would like to see the differences in intensity distributions after 30 days. I would also like to see the dynamics that take place during the synchronisation phase.</p><p>It wasn't clear to me how many cycles were used to synchronise the cells. It would be good to see the intensity distributions arising during the sync period. Actually this whole paragraph leaves a lot of detail unclear. For example, it is not stated that the purpose of the analysis is to determine whether oscillations in fluorescence continue following termination of selection (this is though mentioned in the caption to the figure).</p><p>It struck me as odd that after 72 hours and no FACS that the oscillations were still so regular. In the absence of any means to synchronisation I would expect to see regularity of oscillations decline. It makes me think there might be cues from the environment. See comment above. What happens if you continue to run through, say 10 days?</p><p>Analysis with OG is elegant. I take it though that the cells were always subjected to either 10 or 14 h regimes (and analysed at the end point). I am looking for an indication that clumping might be independent of culture conditions.</p><p>I found many aspects of the genetic analysis intriguing even if answers are few. The point that finding the mutations does not equate to doing genetics is well made. It seems quite remarkable that individual populations could contain independent oscillators. It suggests this phenotype is readily evolved and the possibility that yeast is already well set to switch between clumping and non-clumping states (the authors raise this possibility).</p><p>I felt the discussion of the genetic aspects to be less that compelling and rather too speculative; out in part out of kilter (context) with the rest of the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Evolving a circadian oscillator in budding yeast” for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and the original reviewers.</p><p>We had a long discussion among the two editors and the two reviewers how strong the evidence is that you have evolved de novo a circadian oscillator. In the end, we do not think that the evidence for a truly circadian, free running oscillator that reacts to entrainment and that is temperature compensated is all that strong. However, just evolving an oscillator is already an important finding that should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. You should therefore remove the claim of a “circadian” oscillator from the title and the Abstract. You may discuss in the Introduction the properties of a circadian oscillator, and then develop in the Discussion what features of the de novo evolved oscillator possibly make it a diurnal, if not circadian oscillator.</p><p>In addition, the methodological details of the experiments done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to provide evidence for a free-running oscillator should be described in more detail in both the text and methods section. In particular, a clear description is needed of the growth and culturing conditions and how they differ (or not) from those used during the selection process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04875.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>After careful consideration and discussion of your work, we have decided that we cannot consider it further for publication unless several issues can be resolved, through changes to the text and/or additional experiments.

The first is that lineages which do not oscillate or show irregular fluctuations in clump size may still be present because the lineages that produce regular oscillations have yet to entirely take over the population. The second is that the lineages that do oscillate could have subtly different periods (for example 22, 24, and 26 hours) and the E6 oscillation is a superposition of these different populations. Finally, as we state in the manuscript, the clone we chose to analyze, E6-1, is the clone that produces the strongest oscillations.</p><p><italic>Although it is comprised of multiple clones, weren't they all oscillating by the end of the 30 day selection scheme that produced this population? And finally, there was a concern raised about whether the evolved population was oscillating or was being entrained by the selective regime imposed (FACS-based selection at 10 and 14 hour intervals)</italic>.</p><p>We have provided a clearer explanation of how the unsynchronized controls account for any affect the selective regime may have on the oscillations and we show in two different experiments that populations and individual cell lineages produce ∼24-hour free-running oscillations in the absence of the FACS selective regime.</p><p>Experiments we performed:</p><p>Free running oscillations. We asked whether cells oscillate in the absence of environmental cues and periodic selection in two ways: 1) populations of E6-1 and recreated cells were synchronized by FACS and then kept exponentially growing by batch culture for three days at a constant temperature (30°C) in the dark and we recorded distributions from a sample of the culture at 10 and 14 hour intervals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3A and 4C</xref> show that the clone E6-1 and the recreated populations can free run for at least three days. 2) We followed the behavior of individual lineages starting from a single cell by taking images with a microscope every 3.5hrs for 72 hours. Every 24 hours the population that grew from the single cell was diluted back to a single object (regardless of clump size) so that we could follow the behavior of individual lineages each circadian cycle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3B</xref> for schematic of experiment). All cells continue to produce oscillations with an ∼24-hour period though some cells alter their phase relative to others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3C and 4D</xref>).</p><p>Expression of wild type alleles in E6-1. We expressed a wild type copy of each of the eight mutated genes at the <italic>LEU2</italic> locus in an E6-1 strain deleted for the mutant copy of the same gene and tested for oscillations. To our surprise, only two strains had an obvious phenotype and the other six oscillated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To ask which mutations were necessary for the oscillator we selected for “sub-traits” of the oscillator from a pool of spores containing different combinations of the eight E6-1 mutations and asked which mutation segregated with each sub-trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This provides evidence that five mutations contribute to the evolved phenotype. Thus we have evidence that mutations in six genes (one gene was implicated both by the phenotype of the wild type replacement and the segregation experiment) contribute to the evolved phenotype, but variability between replicate experiments makes it difficult to know whether mutations in <italic>HBN1</italic> and <italic>IDS2</italic> are required for oscillations.</p><p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) of haploid-specific genes (hsgs). We measured the expression levels of the two known transcriptional regulators of haploid-specific genes (<italic>MATα1</italic> and <italic>MATα2</italic>) and three representative haploid-specific genes (<italic>FUS3, MFA2</italic>, and <italic>RME1</italic>) in the four other E6 clones and five E15 clones we reported on and found that the expression of the regulators rose and that of the haploid-specific genes fell in all of the clones we investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Additional changes we have made:</p><p>We lengthened the manuscript and divided the data into six figures to fit the additional experiments and to make the text clearer.</p><p>We quantified the populations from the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that initially only showed qualitative images of the population dynamics.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) The authors might consider extending the issue of free-running oscillations as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>.

Our primary focus was to determine how evolution can select for novel complex traits, regardless of how well they reproduce what has been evolved in nature. In organisms that cannot regulate their internal temperature, circadian oscillators will be selected for temperature compensation, but no such selection existed in our experiment, which was performed at a constant temperature.</p><p><italic>3) I would replace individual mutant genes with wild-type versions, for at least a few of the mutant genes. The question is, are the oscillations completely eliminated by eliminating a single mutant gene, i.e., are all 8 mutations required for any perceptible cycling?</italic></p><p>We performed this experiment and the results are discussed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>).</p><p><italic>I would begin this with Sir4, i.e., does this prediction hold based on what has been done? In other words, are oscillations eliminated for 7 of the 8 clones when WT Sir4 is restored, i.e., all but E6-5, as predicted from the hsg expression phenotypes? This would test the importance of mating type gene expression in a different way</italic>.</p><p>We only expressed <italic>SIR4</italic> in E6-1 because all of the other clones except E6-2 (a genetic relative of E6-1) are wild type for <italic>SIR4</italic>. Sir4 functions in a large complex with other proteins and the clones that are wild type for <italic>SIR4</italic> likely have a mutation in another gene with a role in silencing. The facts that deleting <italic>HMLα</italic> reduced clump size in every clone except E6-5, and haploid-specific genes were repressed in all the evolved clones argue very strongly that all the evolved lineages have acquired mutations that repress expression of haploid-specific genes, and that in all but one lineage, derepression of <italic>HML</italic>α has produced this change.</p><p><italic>This replacement of the mutant gene by a WT version should then be done for 2 or 3 more of the genes, in 2 or 3 more of the clones</italic>.</p><p>For clone E6-1, we tested the phenotype of introducing the wild type versions of the genes that harbored the eight putative causative mutations, as discussed above.</p><p>Since most of these genes were not mutated in other lineages, they already contain the wild type version of the genes mutated in E6-1. Before we could perform the analogous experiment for other clones, we would first need to demonstrate that engineering the putative causative mutations into the ancestral strain would be sufficient to produce oscillations and this seems like an unreasonable amount of work to ask for.</p><p><italic>The request is because it is unclear whether there are really 8 required mutations in all cases and whether this number or something like it is representative of all 8 clones</italic>.</p><p>This comment appears to contain two questions: 1) Does the oscillation of clone E6-1 really require the presence of all 8 putative causative mutations, and 2) do oscillations in other clones require similar numbers of mutations? On the first question, we present evidence that at least 6 of the 8 mutations in E6-1 contribute to the evolved phenotype. The bulk segregant analysis done on 3 other clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>) identifies from 5 to 13 putative causative mutations.</p><p><italic>4) Similarly, please check hsg in all 8 clones to see if this is really a common feature or not. This is especially important for clone E6-5, which did not respond to the deletion of HMLalpha. In other words, is it the only clone not to repress hsg?

Does upregulation of hsg expression itself inhibit clumping?</italic></p><p>We checked expression of selected haploid-specific genes in all E6 and E15 derived clones. We show that deleting <italic>HMLalpha</italic> in E6-1 restores mating and reduces clump size, demonstrating that the expression of haploid-specific genes, which are required for mating, has been restored and that this restoration reduces clumping. A similar reduction in clump-size and restoration of mating was seen in six of the other seven evolved clones that we tested.</p><p><italic>5) I would also check diploids with these 8 genes knocked out (both copies obviously)</italic>. <italic>Do they undergo oscillations of adhesion?

The reviewer is correct that diploids have different adhesion behaviors than haploids. The RNA-seq data and the effect of deleting <italic>HMLα</italic> shows that E6-1 shows the same pattern of gene expression (all haploid-specific genes are repressed, and candidate diploid specific genes are up) as bona fide <italic>MAT</italic>a/<italic>MATα</italic> diploids and thus argues that the experiment that the reviewer suggests is unnecessary.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>I very much appreciate this paper and the creative nature of the science.

We have even stronger evidence that the populations are responding to internal rather than external cues. We mixed single cells selected from the peak single cell phase and single cells selected from the peak multicellular phase, when the majority of cells are in clumps, with the two populations distinguished from each other by the expression of CFP. Examining this mixed population 10 hours later shows that the cells from single cell phase have produced substantially larger clumps than those from the multicellular phase, which produce a mixture of small and medium-sized clumps. This experiment demonstrates that cells from the different phases of the oscillator behave differently even when they share the same environment.
