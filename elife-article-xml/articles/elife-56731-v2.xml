of transposons and other germline genes. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, regulation of piRNA target genes is mediated by the <italic>mutator</italic> complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the <italic>mutator</italic> complex are unknown. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, as acting downstream of piRNA production and upstream of <italic>mutator</italic> complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. Interestingly, SIMR-1 also localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and <italic>mutator</italic> complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. Thus, our data suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the <italic>mutator</italic> complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the biological world, a process known as RNA interference helps cells to switch genes on and off and to defend themselves against harmful genetic material. This mechanism works by deactivating RNA sequences, the molecular templates cells can use to create proteins.</p><p>Overall, RNA interference relies on the cell creating small RNA molecules that can target and inhibit the harmful RNA sequences that need to be silenced. More precisely, in round worms such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, RNA interference happens in two steps. First, primary small RNAs identify the target sequences, which are then combatted by newly synthetised, secondary small RNAs. A number of proteins are also involved in both steps of the process.</p><p>RNA interference is particularly important to preserve fertility, guarding sex cells against ‘rogue’ segments of genetic information that could be passed on to the next generation. In future sex cells, the proteins involved in RNA interference cluster together, forming a structure called a germ granule. Yet, little is known about the roles and identity of these proteins.</p><p>To fill this knowledge gap, Manage et al. focused on the second stage of the RNA interference pathway in the germ granules of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, examining the molecules that physically interact with a key protein. This work revealed a new protein called SIMR-1.</p><p>Looking into the role of SIMR-1 showed that the protein is required to amplify secondary small RNAs, but not to identify target sequences. However, it only promotes the creation of secondary small RNAs if a specific subtype of primary small RNAs have recognized the target RNAs for silencing.</p><p>Further experiments also showed that within the germ granule, SIMR-1 is present in a separate substructure different from any compartment previously identified. This suggests that each substep of the RNA interference process takes place at a different location in the granule.</p><p>In both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and humans, disruptions in the RNA interference pathway can lead to conditions such as cancer or infertility. Dissecting the roles of the proteins involved in this process in roundworms may help to better grasp how this process unfolds in mammals, and how it could be corrected in the case of disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piRNAs</kwd><kwd>siRNAs</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>RNA silencing</kwd><kwd>germ

nucleotides in length, regulate cellular mRNAs through sequence complementarity. Argonaute proteins are key mediators of RNA silencing; by binding to small RNAs, which interact with fully or partially complementary mRNAs, the Argonaute proteins can promote transcription repression, translation inhibition, and RNA decay of targeted mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hutvagner and Simard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claycomb, 2014</xref>). Through this regulation of both endogenous and foreign RNAs, small RNAs play key roles in maintaining proper gene expression and silencing deleterious RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claycomb, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ketting, 2011</xref>).</p><p>A subclass of small RNAs, known as piRNAs, is critical for germ cell function, including silencing of transposons and other germline mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ketting, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Weick and Miska, 2014</xref>). piRNAs are bound by a subgroup of Argonaute proteins called Piwi proteins, of which <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a single functional homolog, PRG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Das et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang and Reinke, 2008</xref>). In many organisms, including mammals, flies, and zebrafish, piRNAs are amplified through the ping-pong mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gunawardane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Houwing et al., 2007</xref>). This mechanism, however, is not found in nematodes. Rather, <italic>C. elegans</italic> employs a different mechanism to reinforce silencing at piRNA target loci. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a small RNA amplification pathway dependent on the <italic>mutator</italic> complex, which includes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, synthesizes secondary downstream siRNAs from piRNA-targeted mRNAs to trigger robust and heritable silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Das et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagijn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>). These siRNAs are approximately 22-nt long, often start with a 5’G, and are bound by the WAGO clade of Argonaute proteins, including WAGO-1, therefore, they are often referred to as WAGO-class 22G-siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pak and Fire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sijen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the Piwi proteins, a major player in the piRNA pathway is the Tudor domain protein family. Tudor domain proteins in many organisms, including both mouse and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> play critical roles in piRNA accumulation and mRNA target regulation through their interaction with PIWI proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reuter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>). The Tudor domain is a conserved structural motif originally identified in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Tudor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boswell and Mahowald, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ponting, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Callebaut and Mornon, 1997</xref>). Tudor domains, which function as protein-protein interaction modules, recognize methylated arginines or lysines and thus can mediate protein interactions in a methylation-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Friesen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Most often, methylarginine-binding Tudor domain proteins are associated with RNA metabolism, while methyllysine-binding Tudor domain proteins are involved in chromatin biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Tudor domain proteins affiliated with the piRNA pathway often interact with an additional conserved element flanking the Tudor domain core referred to as the extended Tudor domain, which is required for their ability to recognize peptides containing a methylated arginine modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2010b</xref>). The extended Tudor domain preferentially recognizes symmetrically dimethylated arginine (sDMA) modifications over monomethylated arginines (MMA), asymmetrically dimethylated arginines (aDMA), or unmodified peptides; however, some extended Tudor domain proteins have lost the ability to bind the methylated arginine mark and recognize only unmodified peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). These arginine methylation modifications are often found within the context of arginine-glycine (RG) and arginine-alanine (RA) repeats and are catalyzed by the activity of Protein Arginine Methyl Transferases (PRMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kirino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vagin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reuter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Webster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Many components of the piRNA pathway, including some Piwi and Tudor domain proteins, are localized to membrane-less, cytoplasmic compartments at the periphery of germline nuclei. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the piRNA pathway components localize to a compartment referred to as nuage, and in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> these components localize to the P granule. Seminal work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has shown that P granules assemble by intracellular phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, both <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, the sites of secondary siRNA biogenesis by the <italic>mutator</italic> complex, and Z granules, which are required for RNAi inheritance, have been shown to be phase-separated biomolecular condensates which lie adjacent to one another and the P granule at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). This assembly of condensates can be referred to as PZM granules or as nuage. These discoveries have led to an intriguing model where the small RNA pathway is temporally and spatially organized into membrane-less organelles, with distinct steps of the silencing pathway occurring in neighboring condensates, while still allowing for trafficking of RNAs and perhaps some proteins between condensates.</p><p>Here we identify a protein required to coordinate RNA silencing between the piRNA pathway in P granules and siRNA amplification in <italic>Mutator</italic> foci. Specifically, through proteomic analysis of MUT-16, we identified an uncharacterized Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1 (<bold>si</bold>RNA-defective and <bold>m</bold>o<bold>r</bold>tal germline). Unlike <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants, <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants are not defective in exogenous RNAi, but do have a transgenerational sterility phenotype at elevated temperature. Interestingly, while SIMR-1 is not required for production of piRNAs or the expression of PRG-1, <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants fail to produce high levels of siRNAs from many piRNA-target loci. These data suggest that SIMR-1 may act at a step in between PRG-1 targeting and siRNA biogenesis by the <italic>mutator</italic> complex.

These data suggest that an increase in germ cell dysfunction in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant animals after multiple generations of growth at 25<bold>°</bold>C is associated with both increased germ cell apoptosis and reduced fertility. Nonetheless, it is important to note that similar levels of apoptotic germ cells are observed in fertile wild-type animals after only one generation at 25<bold>°</bold>C, indicating that a high level of apoptosis is not always directly correlative with sterility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mutations in <italic>simr-1</italic> desilence a piRNA sensor but not an ERGO-1-dependent siRNA sensor</title><p>In a previously described mutagenesis screen, we identified novel genes acting in the piRNA-mediated silencing pathway using a strain expressing GFP::H2B carrying a piRNA target in its 3’UTR (the ‘piRNA sensor’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagijn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Albuquerque et al., 2014</xref>). Because the piRNA sensor is subject to siRNA-mediated heritable silencing (RNAe) making it no longer susceptible to desilencing when the piRNA pathway is compromised, the screen was performed in a <italic>henn-1</italic> mutant background, which partially desilences this transgene and allows for the identification of both piRNA pathway and secondary siRNA pathway mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kamminga et al., 2012</xref>).

Nonetheless, restoration of the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway, and therefore RNA silencing by WAGO-class 22G-siRNAs, in a strain lacking both the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway and the piRNA pathway, causes sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">de Albuquerque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Phillips et al., 2015</xref>). This sterility is a direct result of the routing of essential genes into the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway and indicates that inheritance of piRNAs from one generation to the next is critical to ensuring that the correct genes are silenced by the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway. To determine whether <italic>simr-1</italic>, like <italic>prg-1</italic>, is required to maintain fertility when resetting the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway, we crossed two strains to one another containing distinct mutations in the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway, <italic>mut-7</italic> and <italic>mut-14 smut-1</italic>, such that their progeny would inherit a wild-type copy of <italic>mut-7</italic> from one parent, a wild-type copy <italic>mut-14 smut-1</italic> from the other, and thus would be competent to produce WAGO-class 22G-siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The hermaphrodite strain always additionally carried the <italic>unc-119</italic> mutation, which allowed us to easily distinguish between self progeny which have the Uncoordinated (Unc) phenotype and cross progeny which have wild-type movement. If <italic>simr-1</italic> is required for the proper functioning of the piRNA pathway, we would predict that when it, like <italic>prg-1</italic>, is introduced into the two strains used to reset the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway the progeny of the cross will be sterile. In fact, this result is what we observed. In the control cross (<italic>mut-14 smut-1</italic> males mated to <italic>mut-7 unc-119</italic> hermaphrodites), only 13.0% of the F1 heterozygous progeny were sterile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To identify the small RNA pathway(s) in which SIMR-1 plays a role, we looked at the change in total small RNA levels at groups of genes known to be targets of the CSR-1, <italic>mutator</italic>, piRNA, or ERGO-1 pathways in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type at both 20<bold>°</bold>C and a single generation at 25<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Phillips et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>). Small RNAs derived from CSR-1-target genes were modestly up-regulated at 20<bold>°</bold>C and more dramatically up-regulated after a single generation 25<bold>°</bold>C in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, small RNAs from <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes and piRNA-target genes were reduced in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants at both 20°C and 25<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). piRNA target genes make up the majority of <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To determine if piRNA-target genes are more severely reduced of small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants than other <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes, we generated a list of <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes whose small RNAs are either unchanged or increased in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (log<sub>2</sub>(fold change small RNA abundance)≥0 in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants relative to wild-type). These PRG-1-independent <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes are not reduced of small RNAs compared to all siRNA target genes and are significantly less depleted of small RNAs compared to all <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes or piRNA-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, the well-characterized endogenous RDE-1 target, Y47H10A.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Corrêa et al., 2010</xref>), was not depleted of small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants at either 20<bold>°</bold>C or 25<bold>°</bold>C or in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants at 20<bold>°</bold>C, but was severely depleted of small RNAs in <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants at both 20°C and 25<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), demonstrating that like exogenous RNAi targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), small RNA levels at endogenous RDE-1 targets are not affected in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. Small RNAs from ERGO-1 target genes were reduced mildly at 20<bold>°</bold>C and more severely at 25<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), however because <italic>simr-1</italic> was unable to desilence the 22G-siRNA sensor and did not have an Eri phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), we did not pursue further investigation of the ERGO-1 pathway. Therefore, these data indicate that SIMR-1 is important for the production of high levels of endogenous small RNAs at many <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes, including primarily piRNA-target genes, but is not required for small RNA production at CSR-1-target genes or at endogenous and exogenous RDE-1-target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>SIMR-1 is not required for piRNA biogenesis or stability</title><p>84% of genes with reduced small RNAs in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant at 20<bold>°</bold>C also have reduced small RNAs in a <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant at 20<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This reduction of siRNAs at piRNA-target genes could result from a loss of piRNAs in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant animals, or alternatively, piRNAs could be expressed at wild-type levels and only the downstream siRNAs could be affected. To address these possibilities, we counted the number of reads mapping to annotated piRNA loci in wild-type and <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants. Similarly to what has been previously reported, piRNA expression is significantly reduced at 25<bold>°</bold>C compared to 20<bold>°</bold>C in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belicard et al., 2018</xref>). However, we observed no significant difference between total piRNA levels in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type animals at either temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We next determined whether individual piRNAs are increased or reduced in expression in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants. In contrast to <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants in which 83% of piRNAs are reduced by at least two-fold, in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants less than 1% of piRNAs are reduced by at least two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We next identified predicted piRNA target genes for the piRNAs that were reduced by at least two-fold in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zhang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).

At all generations, SIMR-1-dependent siRNA target genes largely overlapped with <italic>mut-16</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes. Specifically, 80%, 88%, 97% and 89% of SIMR-1-dependent small RNA target genes at 25<bold>°</bold>C for one, two, seven, and 10 generations are reduced of small RNAs in <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants, respectively, compared to 84% for SIMR-1-dependent siRNA target genes at 20<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We next examined the overlap of SIMR-1-dependent small RNA target genes with <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants at 20<bold>°</bold>C. 55%, 64%, 72%, 70% of SIMR-1-dependent small RNA target genes at 25<bold>°</bold>C for one, two, seven, and 10 generations are reduced of small RNAs in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants at 20<bold>°</bold>C, respectively, compared to 84% for SIMR-1-dependent siRNA target genes at 20<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While the overlap of SIMR-1-dependent small RNA target genes with piRNA-dependent small RNA target genes is reduced at 25<bold>°</bold>C compared to 20<bold>°</bold>C, at least some of this difference may be attributed to the sequencing of <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant small RNA libraries from animals raised at 20<bold>°</bold>C only. In fact, the total number of genes reduced of small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants that overlap with piRNA-target genes remains similar between temperatures and across generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, while the number of piRNA-target genes that lose small RNAs in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant doesn’t change significantly with temperature or later generations, we do observe a modest but significant progressive reduction in the number of small RNAs mapping to all piRNA-target genes corresponding to the number of generations at 25<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because the number of <italic>simr-1</italic>-target genes does not become substantially greater after 10 generations at elevated temperature, these data indicate that the observed sterility is not due to loss of small RNAs from more loci after 10 generations. Furthermore, while many piRNA-target genes become more depleted of small RNAs after 10 generations at elevated temperature, this loss of small RNAs is unlikely to be a contributing factor to the progressive loss of fertility in these animals because small RNA loss is even more severe in fertile <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants at 20<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and S5D).</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>SIMR-1 is required for small RNA production at many piRNA-targeted transposons and repetitive elements</title><p>The <italic>mutator</italic> pathway is required for the production of siRNAs at many transposons and repeat loci, and in the absence of <italic>mut-16</italic> or other <italic>mutator</italic> complex proteins transposon activity has been detected for at least seven distinct families of DNA transposons (Tc1-Tc5, Tc7, CemaT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eide and Anderson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collins et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Levitt and Emmons, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yuan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Collins and Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rezsohazy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bessereau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brownlie and Whyard, 2004</xref>).

To address the role of SIMR-1 in the regulation of transposons and repeat loci, we first defined a list of <italic>mut-16</italic>-dependent transposons and repeats using a cutoff of two-fold reduction of small RNAs in the <italic>mut-16</italic> mutant compared to wild-type at 20<bold>°</bold>C. All features also met the requirements of having at least 10 RPM in either mutant or wild-type and a DESeq2 adjusted p-value of ≤0.05. Of these <italic>mut-16</italic>-dependent transposons and repeats, 11% and 25% of transposons at 20°C and 25<bold>°</bold>C respectively, and 35% and 45% of repeat loci, at 20°C and 25<bold>°</bold>C respectively, were reduced by two-fold or greater of small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, 82% of the <italic>mut-16</italic>-dependent transposons depleted of small RNAs by greater than two-fold in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants at 20<bold>°</bold>C were also depleted in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants at 20<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We next focused on transposons for which silencing is known to be either piRNA-dependent or piRNA-independent. Transposon Tc3 becomes active in mutants of the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway and the piRNA pathway, while Tc1 and Tc4 activity is specific to the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Das et al., 2008</xref>).

We next determined the number of small RNAs mapping to these four transposon sequences in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type.

These data would indicate that the SIMR-1, along with PRG-1 and MUT-16, plays a more significant role in production or maintenance of small RNAs rather than in suppression of small RNA production. Nonetheless, 213 genes gain small RNAs by greater than two-fold in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, 49% of which also gain small RNAs in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>).

Of the 104 genes enriched for small RNAs in both <italic>simr-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, 28 are histone genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pettitt et al., 2002</xref>). These 28 genes make up 38% of all <italic>C. elegans</italic> histone genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Nonetheless, this enrichment of small RNAs at histone genes in both <italic>simr-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants is clearly in contrast to <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants at 20°C and 25<bold>°</bold>C, where the majority of histone genes are unchanged or depleted of small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We further examined the histone genes by histone gene class and we observed that some histone genes classes such as H2A and H3 genes are enriched for small RNAs in both <italic>simr-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic>, whereas others such as H2B are enriched for small RNAs primarily in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These data suggest that enrichment of small RNAs at certain classes of histone genes is a signature unique to the <italic>simr-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants and not the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway, and thus provides additional evidence that SIMR-1 plays a key role in the piRNA pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-16"><title>Most SIMR-1-target genes are not desilenced in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant</title><p>To determine whether the observed changes to small RNA levels alter gene expression in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, we next sequenced mRNAs isolated from wild-type, <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant and <italic>mut-16</italic> mutant animals at 20<bold>°</bold>C and from wild-type and <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant animals after one, two, seven, or 10 generations at 25<bold>°</bold>C.

However, when we directly compared the list of genes with increased mRNA expression in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant (164 genes) to the genes with reduced small RNAs in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant (817 genes) we found only 18 genes in common and, furthermore, we do not see a significant change in mRNA expression for the genes depleted of small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants, we do not observe a substantial change in mRNA expression for the genes depleted of small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), which is consistent with recent findings that the majority of <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes and PRG-1-target genes are not desilenced in <italic>mut-16</italic> or <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barucci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reed et al., 2020</xref>).

These data indicate that the majority of SIMR-1-target genes are not derepressed in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant, which suggests that either SIMR-1-dependent siRNAs are required only to initiate but not maintain silencing of their targets or that additional layers of regulation maintain silencing of these genes in the absence of SIMR-1-dependent siRNAs.</p><p>We next focused on the genes down-regulated in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants and found that those genes were also enriched for <italic>mutator</italic>-target genes and PRG-1-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), indicating that some <italic>mutator</italic> and PRG-1-target genes are up-regulated, while others are down-regulated in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants. When we looked exclusively at the genes enriched for small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, we observed a modest down-regulation of these genes at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), indicating that the small RNA gained in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant are sufficient to promote down-regulation of their target mRNAs. The same trend was not observed for genes enriched for small RNAs in <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Histone genes, including H2A and H3, were amongst those genes enriched for small RNAs and with reduced mRNA expression in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E and I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>), similar to what has previously been observed in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barucci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reed et al., 2020</xref>).

In contrast, the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway is non-functional in the <italic>mut-16</italic> mutant, therefore the small RNAs gained in this mutant are likely to be a distinct class of small RNAs, possibly CSR-1-class siRNAs, which do not generally silence their mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wedeles et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to determine whether the sterility observed in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants raised at 25<bold>°</bold>C for 10 generations could be attributed to gene expression changes, we looked for mRNAs up or down-regulated in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants raised at 25<bold>°</bold>C for 10 generations compared to wild-type raised under the same conditions that were not up or down-regulated in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants raised at 20<bold>°</bold>C or in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants raised at 25<bold>°</bold>C for only a single generation (exclusive to gen. 10).

While we cannot attribute the sterility observed in these animals directly to the misregulation of any specific genes, we hypothesize that an increase in the expression of spermatogenesis genes during oogenesis, along with the expression of <italic>mutator</italic> and PRG-1-target genes could contribute to germ cell dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-17"><title>SIMR-1 forms foci near <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, P granules and Z granules</title><p>P granules, <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, and Z granules are all phase-separated biomolecular condensates which lie adjacent to one another at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>).

SIMR-1 foci are closely associated with both P granules and with Z granules (100% of the time with P granules, n = 56 SIMR-1 foci, and 100% of the time with Z granules, n = 62 SIMR-1 foci). However, we found that SIMR-1 foci do not fully colocalize with either structure, and in some cases multiple SIMR-1 foci can associate with a single focus of another granule type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, see inset for SIMR-1 and ZNFX-1 localization). SIMR-1 foci do appear to be more closely associated with Z granules than with P granules and quantification of distances between fluorescence centers of each foci supports this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Because SIMR-1 promotes siRNA biogenesis at piRNA target genes, we also examined the colocalization of SIMR-1 and PRG-1, which has previously been shown to localize to P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang and Reinke, 2008</xref>).

Furthermore, SIMR-1 is not required for PRG-1 localization or expression, and PRG-1 is not required for SIMR-1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

Following immunostaining, we observed that SIMR-1 and RSD-2 were highly coincident, suggesting SIMR-1 and RSD-2 may localize to the same perinuclear structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). These results indicate that SIMR-1 and RSD-2 interact closely with one another at perinuclear foci near but distinct from <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, P granules and Z granules.

Here we identify a Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, required to mediate effective production of siRNAs from many piRNA-target mRNAs. We demonstrate that SIMR-1 has a phenotype similar to that of PRG-1, in that <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants can desilence a sensitized piRNA sensor and SIMR-1 is required to prevent sterility after reestablishing WAGO-class 22G-siRNA production. However, the phenotypes associated with <italic>simr-1</italic> are often weaker than those of <italic>prg-1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B–E</xref>), suggesting that <italic>simr-1</italic> is not absolutely required to mediate siRNA amplification at all piRNA target genes, or it acts cooperatively with other pathways or proteins. SIMR-1 is not RNAi-defective, it cannot desilence a piRNA sensor silenced by RNAe, and it cannot desilence the ERGO-1-dependent siRNA sensor, all phenotypes associated with the downstream <italic>mutator</italic> pathway. Furthermore, siRNAs are reduced at many piRNA-target loci in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, but piRNAs themselves are unaffected. Like PRG-1 and the <italic>mutator</italic> complex, SIMR-1 forms foci near the nuclear periphery of germ cells, and while these perinuclear condensates are adjacent to one another, they all appear to be distinct substructures. Thus, our work identifies a novel player acting at a step in between piRNA biogenesis and siRNA amplification by <italic>mutator</italic> complex and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote piRNA-mediated siRNA production.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tudor domain proteins in piRNA-mediated silencing</title><p>Tudor domain proteins are thought to act as scaffolds in the piRNA pathway, to engage and assemble multiple partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pek et al., 2012</xref>). Through promotion of protein-protein interactions, they can drive piRNA biogenesis and piRNA target silencing. For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tudor domain protein, Krimper, interacts with two Piwi proteins, Aubergine and Ago3, to coordinate assembly of the ping-pong processing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, sDMA of Aubergine is required for interaction with Krimper, but Ago3 can interact with Krimper independently of sDMA, emphasizing that Tudor domain proteins can play critical roles in the piRNA pathway independent of sDMA. In fact, like SIMR-1, many human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tudor domain proteins carry mutations in aromatic cage residues, indicating they may have lost the ability to bind methylated arginine substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Handler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, mammalian Tudor domain protein, TDRD2, which is missing one of the four aromatic cage residues, preferentially recognizes an unmethylated peptide of PIWIL1 over a dimethylated peptide. This recognition occurs through a negatively charged groove that occurs at the interface of the canonical Tudor domain and the flanking conserved elements making up the extended Tudor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). This data would suggest that Tudor domain proteins that are missing the aromatic cage residues, like SIMR-1, may still make functional interactions with Piwi proteins or other small RNA pathway proteins. They may mediate interactions preferentially with unmethylated substrates and/or compete with other Tudor domain proteins for substrates dependent on methylation status. While we have not yet identified the relevant protein-binding partners of the SIMR-1 Tudor domain, we hypothesize that they are likely members of the piRNA pathway or <italic>mutator</italic> complex and contain the RG repeat motif preferentially recognized by the Tudor domain. An obvious candidate is PRG-1 itself, as it contains a ‘GRGRGRG’ sequence near its N-terminus, however there are certainly other candidates and further experiments will be necessary to test this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of piRNA-target genes by perinuclear condensates</title><p>While we do not have direct evidence for a physical interaction between SIMR-1 and PRG-1, it is likely that SIMR-1 interacts with either PRG-1 or some other member of the piRNA pathway to promote the downstream regulation of piRNA target mRNAs by the <italic>mutator</italic> complex. Similarly, because SIMR-1 was initially identified in a MUT-16 immunoprecipitation, it may also interact directly with the <italic>mutator</italic> complex, even if transiently. It is therefore interesting that PRG-1, SIMR-1, and the <italic>mutator</italic> complex all localize to distinct sub-compartments of nuage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We have observed that Z granules localize between SIMR-1 foci and P granules, similar to the organization of <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, Z granules and P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). We have not been able to image SIMR foci with <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, Z granules, and P granules simultaneously, so it remains to be determined how these four substructures assemble together and whether SIMR foci bridge <italic>Mutator</italic> foci and Z granules, <italic>Mutator</italic> foci bridge SIMR foci and Z granules, or whether all three interact. <italic>Mutator</italic> foci, P granules, and Z granules all assemble through intracellular phase separation, which brings about the question as to whether SIMR foci may also behave in a liquid-like manner. While we have not tested this formally, the localization of SIMR-1 nestled among these three other biomolecular condensates is certainly suggestive. The dynamic nature of these various condensates could facilitate exchange of RNAs or protein components between compartments, which may explain how piRNA pathway proteins, SIMR-1, and the <italic>mutator</italic> complex could occupy distinct substructures while facilitating regulation of the same mRNA target genes. Perhaps some proteins have properties making them immiscible in multiple condensates allowing them to promote transfer of RNAs between compartments, or alternatively, the exchange of RNAs may occur at their interface.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RSD-2 and SIMR-1 promote the interaction between distinct primary and secondary siRNA pathways</title><p>The colocalization of SIMR-1 and RSD-2 is somewhat surprising given that SIMR-1 and RSD-2 act in distinct small RNA pathways.

Interestingly, there is no data to suggest that any of these proteins act with SIMR-1 downstream of PRG-1, suggesting that there could be a completely different set of factors that interact with SIMR-1 at piRNA targets. While no localization has been determined for RDE-10 and RDE-11, RSD-6 localizes to foci near P granules that may be coincident with SIMR-1 foci. RDE-12 localizes to both RSD-6 foci and P granules, suggesting it can traverse the boundary between perinuclear condensates, and it has been proposed that RDE-12 may shuttle primary siRNA bound target mRNAs from P granules to RSD-6 foci to initiate <italic>mutator</italic>-dependent siRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that we cannot presently accept the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see in the detailed comments by the reviewers below, we appreciate the many interesting insights that your manuscript describes. However, there was an overall concern that, while interesting, the many observations described do not coalesce into a coherent picture at present. Several of the results presented were considered too preliminary and not fully flashed out. You will see that the reviewers propose a number of additional experiments. However, if you are able to successfully address the reviewers’ concerns, <italic>eLife</italic> may be interested in looking at a new version of this manuscript. Since the required revisions are quite substantial, such a manuscript would need to be considered a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, small RNAs antisense to mRNAs regulate gene expression. The small RNAs are synthesized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) that accumulate in perinuclear condensates called mutator foci. How specific mRNAs are chosen for small RNA synthesis is not known, but genomically-encoded piRNAs appear to be involved for at least a subset of loci including transposable elements.</p><p>The manuscript by Manage et al., reports on a new component of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> small RNA synthesis machinery. SIMR-1 contains a TUDOR-like domain, a domain often found in Argonaute-interacting proteins. Proteomic analyses of SIMR-1 indicate that SIMR-1 interacts with MUT-16, other Mutator foci proteins, and WAGO-1, an Argonaute that also interacts with MUT-16. Like Mutator foci proteins, SIMR-1 is required for the synthesis and/or maintenance of small RNAs targeting many loci (&gt;600), including ~100 loci also targeted by piRNAs. SIMR-1 localizes to a new granule adjacent to Mutator foci. The authors speculate that SIMR-1 may function in the &quot;handoff&quot; of mRNAs targeted by piRNAs to mutator foci. This conclusion, however, does not seem well supported by the data since SIMR-1 mutants affect many more genes beyond those targeted by piRNAs (point #1). SIMR-1 interacts with the Argonaute WAGO-1, but a functional connection between SIMR-1 and WAGO-1 was not explored (point #5).</p><p>1) The authors do a comprehensive analysis of small RNA defects in SIMR-1 mutants raised at different temperatures and identify nearly ~1000 affected loci. Consistent with SIMR-1 interacting with the Mutator scaffold MUT-16, &gt;90% of the genes affected in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants are also affected in mut-16 mutants. These genes include genes targeted by piRNAs, but the latter represent only a minority (&lt;20%) of genes affected in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, so it is not clear why the authors focus so much on those genes.</p><p>2) '<italic>simr-1</italic> mutants fail to produce high levels of siRNAs from the majority of piRNA-target loci' Figure 4C seems to contradict this statement since at 20°C only &lt;50% of piRNA-target loci are affected. Also, what criteria were used to define &quot;piRNA-targeted loci&quot;? New analyses by the Mello and Lee labs have identified piRNA binding sites in 100s of mRNAs targeted by PRG-1/piRNA complexes. What happens to those loci in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants? Are the small RNAs completely gone or reduced? Are small RNAs nearest piRNA-binding sites most or least affected? is there a specific pattern of loss?</p><p>3) The authors argue that the defect must be &quot;downstream of the piRNAs&quot; because piRNAs levels overall are not affected in SIMR-1 mutants. They don't report however the levels of the specific piRNAs that target the ~100 piRNA-targeted genes affected in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. The levels of PRG-1 protein (piRNA associated Argonaute) also are not reported.</p><p>4) Do the small RNA changes observed in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants correlate with changes in mRNA levels?</p><p>5) SIMR-1 interacts with the Argonaute WAGO-1, but the authors do not explore potential functional connections between SIMR-1 and WAGO-1 – why? Is there a good overlap between WAGO-1-dependent loci and SIMR-1-dependent loci?</p><p>6) Figure 6: Systematic quantification of relative granule positions shown is missing. See Wan et al., 2018, for examples of quantification metrics. The authors' findings suggest that they are 4 different types of perinuclear condensates in germ cells – are they all present in a 1:1:1:1 proportion? Is every P granule next to a Z granule next to a SIMR-1 granule next to a mutator focus or does the order and composition vary?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>In this manuscript, Manage et al. have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, called SIMR-1, which interacts with a component of mutator foci, MUT-16, and participates in the accumulation of a subset of endo-siRNAs antisense to piRNA and mutator target genes. They also show that <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant displays a temperature-dependent progressive loss of fertility similarly to mutation in downstream components of the piRNA pathway. Interestingly, they have shown that SIMR-1 has a perinuclear localization in a region distinct from p-granule, z-granule or mutator foci, and that its localization is independent from mutator foci. Moreover, they have identified by sequence alignment an extended Tudor domain protein which might potentially interact with methylated PIWI protein. Based on these results, they propose that SIMR-1 constitutes a distinct germ-granule that acts downstream of PIWI and piRNAs to transport mRNAs targeted by piRNAs from p-granule to mutator foci (the granule involved in the amplification of endo-siRNAs). Overall, the distinct perinuclear localization of this protein is exciting, however there are no experiments that substantiate the claim that this protein has a role in transporting mRNAs form piRNA pathway to downstream mutator foci nor that the putative Tudor domain is functional. I also express some concerns about the methods, data analysis, and interpretation of some key results as listed below.</p><p>A) The authors performed a MUT-16 IPs coupled with mass spectrometry to identify novel interacting factors of mutator complex. My first concern is related to the fact that the authors did not specify how many IP replicates they have used and which statistical methods they have performed to identify specific interactors in MUT-16 IPs versus control IPs. It appears that they have considered interacting proteins that have peptides only in MUT-16 GFP and FLAG IPs and not in the control. This approach can limit the number of interacting proteins identifiable in the IPs. Also, the number of peptides they have identified for SIMR-1 is extremely low (2 peptides in FLAG IPs and 1 peptide in GFP IPs) rising doubt that SIMR-1 is a real interactor of MUT-16. Because of the lack of statistical tools used to identify interacting proteins I suggest them to perform Co-IP experiments to confirm this interaction. It is also not known whether this interaction is direct or mediated by RNA, and an experiment such as Co-IP can help to distinguish the nature of their interactions. Also, in Figure 1A they have included the proteins RSD-2, WAGO-1, and MATH-33, which have been identified following another (not clear) approach (their peptides are not uniquely present in MUT-16 IPs). Therefore, it should be removed from this table. Again, if they want to take in consideration such cases they should perform a quantitative proteomic approach, using more replicates and statistical tools.</p><p>B) There are no functional data or structural information to asses that the conserved residues contained in SIMR-1 constitute a Tudor domain capable of recognizing a methylated substrate such as PIWI. Moreover, SIMR-1 IP and mass spec experiments failed to identify PRG-1/PIWI protein. The major interactor identified by mass spec is instead RSD-2, which they show to colocalize in the same perinuclear foci as SIMR-1, although it appears to have a different function (RSD-2 is involved in RNAi and not 22G-RNA amplification from piRNA targets and SIMR-1 is not involved in RNAi but in the accumulation of 22G-RNAs from piRNA targets). Therefore, the distinct localization of SIMR-1 per se does not implicate that SIMR-1 mediates the handoff of mRNAs from the piRNA pathway to the downstream Mutator components. Also, the peptide counts of the putative interactors of SIMR-1 shown in Supplementary Figure 6 are extremely low, a factor that rises concerns on the quality of the IP/mass spec experiments. Again, it is not specified how many replicates have been performed. Therefore, some of these interactions, such as MUT-16/SIMR-1 should be confirmed by Co-IP.</p><p>C) The authors performed a small RNA-seq analysis to check whether specific population of small RNAs are affected in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. They have performed profiles of small RNAs in different conditions (normal temperature of grow or 25°C at several generations), perhaps to correlate gene expression changes with the temperature-dependent progressive loss of fertility phenotype. However, the lack of corresponding RNA-seq profiles does not allow to investigate the effect of temperature on gene expression and how it correlates with the progressive sterility phenotype. Moreover, the most dramatic changes in small RNAs in SIMR-1 mutant occur at 25°C after just one generation. Thus, there is no correlation between progressive loss of fertility and changes in small RNAs. I wonder then if the results across generation of SIMR-1 mutant grown at 25°C are relevant for the current manuscript at all. Therefore, the only conclusion from all the analyses performed is that SIMR-1 is somehow participating in the accumulation of a subset of mut-16 and piRNA targets. The effect of the temperature on small RNA biogenesis is instead not clear.</p><p>D) In addition, the small RNA analysis they have performed is not very compelling. For instance, in some cases is not clear if the criteria they have used to define genes with decrease or increase small RNAs. Also, the methods don't clearly show which small RNAs they are considering (22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs, sense, antisense, broad range of small RNAs 21-26nt, etc.). Because these are small RNAs cloned from total RNAs and not from AGO IPs, the authors cannot be sure that the increases or decreases of small RNAs observed belong to a specific AGO pathway (it is known that mutation in some small RNA biogenesis factor causes misrouting of small RNAs into AGOs). In general, it appears that mutation in SIMR-1 causes a general downregulation (not completely loss) of small RNAs, which are considered to be mut-16 dependent (including some previously defined piRNA targets). Among these affected genes, the piRNA targets appear more affected than the whole mut-16 targets.</p><p>E) The authors claim that SIMR-1 acts downstream of the piRNA pathway, however they haven't performed any experiment to prove that piRNA silencing is impaired in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. They should use the canonical piRNA sensor strain (Ashe et al., 2012), and check whether the silencing of the piRNA sensor reporter is impaired in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. This experiment goes well with the other assays they have used to show that RNAi is not affected in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Add in Figure 2C the statistical significance of those changes.</p><p>2) Add in Figure 2D genes that are statistically significant up-regulated and down-regulated (or &gt;2-fold change). They can label the significant dots with different colours as well. Same in 2E, if any.</p><p>3) In Figure 4C the total number of genes belonging to piRNA, ERGO-1, and mut-16 is changing in the different Venn diagram. This is not clear. Shouldn't be constant?</p><p>4) Subsection “<italic>simr-1</italic> mutants have increased levels of germ cell apoptosis”, the paragraph title is misleading. The level of germline apoptosis in SIMR-1 is similar to WT at 20°C and lower than WT at 25°C (first generation). It is slightly higher than the corresponding WT at generation 2, 10, 11 and not changing at generation 4,7. Importantly, the WT at 25°C (1 generation) has the highest level of germline apoptosis compared to all the other data points and yet is still fertile. Therefore, the reported level of germline apoptosis is not correlated with the sterility phenotype. This is why I disagree with the Authors' interpretation of the results shown in Figure 3E and the conclusion they wrote in the subsection “<italic>simr-1</italic> mutants have increased levels of germ cell apoptosis”.</p><p>5) The first paragraph of the subsection “SIMR-1 is required for small RNA production at piRNA target genes”, contains results that are not shown in any figures. Please, provide a figure that reports these results. Also, it is not written which criteria they have used to identify changes in small RNA populations (fold changes, p-value?), nor it is known from the Materials and methods or text which small RNAs they are considering (22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs, sense, antisense, broad range of small RNAs 21-26nt, etc.). Also, do the small RNA-depleted genes at 25°C (which are not depleted in subsequent generations) reacquire the small RNAs in progressive generations?</p><p>6) The results from the analyses shown in the subsection “<italic>simr-1</italic> mutants have increased levels of siRNAs mapping to histone genes”, are also not clear and maybe not relevant for the current manuscript. The results described lack a figure reference. Are they shown in Supplementary Figure 5B? Also, in Supplementary Figure 5B they only show depleted siRNAs and not enriched siRNAs. Also, they only consider lists of genes depleted of 22G-RNAs. Maybe if they consider log2(fold changes) they will find more insightful results. In regard to the small RNAs targeting histone mRNAs they have cited a submitted paper (not sure if it is possible to cite the journal where the paper is submitted) and conclude this might be relevant. Mutation in MUT-16, which is linked to piRNA pathway, do not show the same histone small RNAs. Moreover, histone small RNAs are present at all temperature, therefore also do not correlate with the progressive loss of fertility in SIMR-1 mutant. Again, I am not sure how this paragraph fits with the whole manuscript.</p><p>7) In the Discussion, the authors claim that their work &quot;provides insight into how mRNAs move between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote piRNA-mediated mRNA silencing&quot;. This has not been demonstrated. There are no experiments showing that the mRNAs targeted by piRNAs move through perinuclear SIMR-1 condensates to Mutator foci, nor that SIMR-1 is required for piRNA silencing. The reduction in a subset of piRNA targets might be an indirect consequence of SIMR-1 function, which still remains unknown. Thus, I suggest to remove this sentence. Same for sentences in the last paragraph of the subsection “RSD-2 and SIMR-1 promote the interaction between distinct primary and secondary siRNA pathways”.</p><p>8) In the Materials and methods section the authors should add the detailed protocol used for Immunoprecipitation and mass spec (buffer used etc.). The referenced Uebel et al. do not contain such information. Also, the raw proteomic data has not been released. Moreover, they should add a full description of the small RNA analysis performed as mentioned above.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, promotes siRNA production at piRNA-targeted mRNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Specifically, they have included data showing that SIMR-1 protein with mutation in a critical residue for the structure of the extended Tudor domain fails to localize to perinuclear granule and affects the fertility of the animal at 25°C, similar to the loss of function allele. Moreover, they have placed the reduction in small RNAs upon mutation of SIMR-1 in the context of piRNA pathway. Indeed, the mutant protein fails to silence a piRNA reporter transgene, in accordance to what I previously asked to show. They have also changed the text according to my suggestion and added more statistical tests (where it was possible) upon my request. However, I do have some additional comments that the authors should address:</p><p>1) Even if the Authors have removed all statements that &quot;SIMR-1 &quot;hands-off&quot; RNAs from the piRNA to mutator pathway&quot; in the main text, the passage in the Abstract that says &quot;However, how mRNAs first recognized by the piRNA pathway are then handed off to the mutator pathway is unclear. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, as acting at this step between piRNA production and mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis&quot; is still confusing, suggesting that SIMR-1 acts at that step.</p><p>2) The Authors have shown that there is a gradual reduction in small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant compared to WT across generations at 25°C in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1D. However, the heat map shown in Figure 5C suggests that the reduction in small RNAs (even at generation 10) in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant is milder compared to <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant. Therefore, I recommend to include in Figure 5—figure supplement 1D data from <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant at 20°C and to calculate the significant changes in siRNAs between <italic>prg-1</italic> and <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants. If the small RNA depletion in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant is more severe than in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant (as it appears from Figure 5C), then the Authors should reconsider their claim that SIMR-1 act downstream the piRNA pathway to produce siRNAs in mutator foci. SIMR-1 might cooperate to accumulate small RNAs downstream of piRNAs together with other pathways or proteins (acting together or independent of SIMR-1 in piRNA-dependent small RNA accumulation). Also, the effect on small RNA accumulation can be still indirectly linked to piRNA-dependent small RNA biogenesis, since no interaction between SIMR-1 and PIWI or MUT-16 has been shown by Co-IP. Therefore, these alternative possibilities should be discussed in the text.</p><p>3) The increased siRNAs in simr-1 mutant also appear to be less severe than piRNA mutant (Figure 5C). Similarly, the changes in mRNAs (including histone mRNAs) might be less severe that piRNA mutant. In my opinion this can be an important determinant in explaining the different phenotype between piRNA and <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>4) In the paragraph now called &quot;<italic>simr-1</italic> Mrt phenotype is associated with increased levels of germ cell apoptosis&quot; the Authors speculate that the significant increase in apoptotic cells at later generation in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant compared to the relative WT is correlated to sterility. As I have already mentioned in my first review, although WT animals at 25°C have levels of apoptotic cells similar to those of later generation of sterile simr-1 mutant at 25°C, yet they are fertile. Thus, the number of apoptotic cells detected with this assay in simr-1 mutant do not suggest that they contribute to sterility. As a comparison, mutants of H3K9me (met-2, set-25) show 4-fold increases in apoptotic cells at 25°C compared to WT (in Zeller et al., 2016, Figure 2B). Therefore, in my opinion this data is inconclusive and can induce to misinterpretation. This is why, if the Authors are willing to show this result, they should comment on the fact that WT animals with similar number of apoptotic cells are fertile and that the number of apoptotic cells detected in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant might not contribute to the sterility.</p><p>5) In the Introduction, the Authors wrote: &quot;Here we identify a protein required to mediate the interaction between PRG-1 and piRNAs in P granules with siRNA amplification in Mutator foci.&quot; The interaction between these factors has not been confirmed by Co-IP or other experiments, thus the statement needs to be changed.</p><p>6) In the Introduction, the Authors claim that &quot;this work identifies one of the first factors to act downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs&quot;. This is not accurate because many factors involved in the accumulation of piRNA-dependent small RNAs have been identified thus far. Also, the result presented pointed out that <italic>simr-1</italic> might directly or indirectly participate in the accumulation of those siRNAs (see also comment 2).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56731.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The manuscript by Manage et al., reports on a new component of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> small RNA synthesis machinery. SIMR-1 contains a TUDOR-like domain, a domain often found in Argonaute-interacting proteins. Proteomic analyses of SIMR-1 indicate that SIMR-1 interacts with MUT-16, other Mutator foci proteins, and WAGO-1, an Argonaute that also interacts with MUT-16. Like Mutator foci proteins, SIMR-1 is required for the synthesis and/or maintenance of small RNAs targeting many loci (&gt;600), including ~100 loci also targeted by piRNAs. SIMR-1 localizes to a new granule adjacent to Mutator foci. The authors speculate that SIMR-1 may function in the &quot;handoff&quot; of mRNAs targeted by piRNAs to mutator foci. This conclusion, however, does not seem well supported by the data since SIMR-1 mutants affect many more genes beyond those targeted by piRNAs (point #1). SIMR-1 interacts with the Argonaute WAGO-1, but a functional connection between SIMR-1 and WAGO-1 was not explored (point #5).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all statements that SIMR-1 “hands-off” RNAs from the piRNA to <italic>mutator</italic> pathway and have instead indicated that SIMR-1 acts at a step between piRNA production and <italic>mutator</italic>-complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. To provide additional evidence that SIMR-1 acts in the piRNA pathway and not the downstream <italic>mutator</italic> pathway, we have included data showing that <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, like mutants in the piRNA pathway, de-silence a sensitized piRNA sensor but not a piRNA sensor silenced by RNAe or an ERGO-1 dependent siRNA sensor (Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B). Furthermore, SIMR-1 is required to promote fertility after re-establishing production of WAGO-class 22G-siRNAs, a phenotype also associated only with mutants in the piRNA pathway (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors do a comprehensive analysis of small RNA defects in SIMR-1 mutants raised at different temperatures and identify nearly ~1000 affected loci. Consistent with SIMR-1 interacting with the Mutator scaffold MUT-16, &gt;90% of the genes affected in simr-1 mutants are also affected in mut-16 mutants. These genes include genes targeted by piRNAs, but the latter represent only a minority (&lt;20%) of genes affected in simr-1 mutants, so it is not clear why the authors focus so much on those genes.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first version of this manuscript, we used Supplementary Table 2 from Lee et al., 2012, to define piRNA targets. This list contains approximately 300 genes for which the authors observed 8-fold enrichment of 22G-siRNAs in FLAG::PRG-1 compared to <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants and is likely not a comprehensive list of <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent 22G-siRNA target loci. Therefore, we generated new small RNA libraries from wild-type and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants at 20°C and defined <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes as those with at least 2-fold reduction in total small RNAs and at least 10RPM in wild-type or mutant libraries (the same criteria by which we defined <italic>simr-</italic>1-dependent siRNA target genes). Using these new libraries, we generated a more <italic>comprehensive</italic> list of 1758 <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes. With this larger list, now 686 (out of 817) or 84% of <italic>simr-1</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes overlap with <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes at 20°C (Figure 5D). At 25°C, 693 (out of 1258) or 55% of <italic>simr-1</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes overlap with <italic>prg-</italic>1-dependent siRNA target genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). It is important to note that in the latter case the <italic>simr-1</italic> libraries, collected at 25°C, are being compared to <italic>prg-1</italic> libraries collected at 20°C and this difference in temperature may account for the lower overlap between <italic>simr-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes. At both temperatures, the majority of <italic>simr-1</italic> targets (94% at 20°C and 80% at 25°C) still overlap with <italic>mut-16</italic>-dependent siRNA target genes (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>We have also, since the first submission, obtained two alleles of <italic>simr-1</italic> out of a screen to de-silence a piRNA sensor strain (Figure 4A) and demonstrated that SIMR-1 is required to promote fertility after re-establishing WAGO-class 22G-siRNA production, a phenotype previously observed only with mutants in known piRNA pathway factors <italic>prg-1</italic>, <italic>pid-1</italic>, and <italic>henn-1</italic> (Figure 4B), providing further evidence that SIMR-1 is important for production of siRNAs at piRNA-target loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 'simr-1 mutants fail to produce high levels of siRNAs from the majority of piRNA-target loci' Figure 4C seems to contradict this statement since at 20°C only &lt;50% of piRNA-target loci are affected. Also, what criteria were used to define &quot;piRNA-targeted loci&quot;? New analyses by the Mello and Lee labs have identified piRNA binding sites in 100s of mRNAs targeted by PRG-1/piRNA complexes. What happens to those loci in simr-1 mutants? Are the small RNAs completely gone or reduced? Are small RNAs nearest piRNA-binding sites most or least affected? is there a specific pattern of loss?</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence was changed to say that <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants fail to produce high levels of siRNAs at many piRNA-target loci. See previous response for more detail on how we defined piRNA-target loci (those with at least 2-fold reduction in total small RNAs in <italic>prg-1</italic> mutants and at least 10RPM in wild-type or <italic>prg-1</italic> libraries). While there is a significant overlap between the genes we defined as <italic>simr-1</italic>-dependent siRNA loci and <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent siRNA loci there are also many <italic>prg-1</italic>-dependent siRNA loci that do not meet the criteria that we used to define <italic>simr-1</italic>-dependent siRNA loci. Note, however, that many of these had reduced siRNAs in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant but did not meet the 2-fold cutoff we used (see boxplot in Figure 5B where more than 75% of piRNA target genes have reduced siRNAs in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant).</p><p>Regarding piRNA binding sites, we decided to focus specifically on piRNAs whose expression changes in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant (Figure 5F and Supplementary file 4). We identified 77 piRNAs (less than 1% of all piRNAs) that are at least 2-fold down-regulated in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. Using piRTarBase (which compiles piRNA binding sites identified by the Mello and Lee labs) we identified 37 mRNAs that are predicted targets of these piRNAs by the piRScan relaxed targeting rules (Lee lab) and the CLASH data (Mello lab). We chose to examine sites that were in common between both of these methods because Wu et al., 2019, demonstrate that only when they examined the piRNA target sites in common between these two methods was it predictive of an increase in mRNA expression and a reduction in 22G levels in a <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant; genes identified by either method alone were not significantly predictive. Of these 37 mRNAs that are predicted targets of piRNAs affected in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant, only five have reduced levels of siRNAs in a <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant (see Supplementary file 4). These data indicate that the <italic>simr-1</italic>-depleted piRNAs are not a major driver of siRNA depletion in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that the defect must be &quot;downstream of the piRNAs&quot; because piRNAs levels overall are not affected in SIMR-1 mutants. They don't report however the levels of the specific piRNAs that target the ~100 piRNA-targeted genes affected in the simr-1 mutant. The levels of PRG-1 protein (piRNA associated Argonaute) also are not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>See previous response. We first identified all piRNAs whose expression is reduced by 2-fold in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants (77 total piRNAs) and then demonstrate that the predicted target mRNAs for these piRNAs are, overall, not depleted of small RNAs in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant. In total, only five of the 817 genes reduced of small RNAs by at least 2-fold are predicted to be direct targets of these 77 “<italic>simr-1</italic>-dependent” piRNAs. We have additionally added a western blot for PRG-1 showing that the levels of PRG-1 are not affected by the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the small RNA changes observed in simr-1 mutants correlate with changes in mRNA levels?</p></disp-quote><p>The majority of the genes that are depleted of small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> are not affected at the mRNA level. In contrast, the genes that are enriched for small RNAs tend to have reduced expression at the mRNA level (Figure 6H). The failure of the genes depleted of small RNAs to increase in expression at the mRNA level is consistent with the recent observations by Reed et al., 2019, looking at all <italic>mutator</italic> targets and Barucci et al., 2020, looking at piRNA targets. In both cases, the majority of genes that were depleted of small RNAs failed to increase in mRNA expression. This data indicates that there may be additional layers of gene regulation that maintain silencing of these genes in the absence of siRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) SIMR-1 interacts with the Argonaute WAGO-1, but the authors do not explore potential functional connections between SIMR-1 and WAGO-1 – why? Is there a good overlap between WAGO-1-dependent loci and SIMR-1-dependent loci?</p></disp-quote><p>MUT-16 interacts via immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid with WAGO-1, but we have no evidence that SIMR-1 interacts with WAGO-1. Therefore, we did not follow up on this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6: Systematic quantification of relative granule positions shown is missing. See Wan et al., 2018, for examples of quantification metrics. The authors' findings suggest that they are 4 different types of perinuclear condensates in germ cells – are they all present in a 1:1:1:1 proportion? Is every P granule next to a Z granule next to a SIMR-1 granule next to a mutator focus or does the order and composition vary?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added quantification showing the percentage of SIMR-1 foci that are associated with P granules, Z granules, and <italic>Mutator</italic> foci. Additionally, we have included quantification of the distances between fluorescence centers for each of these foci relative to SIMR-1 foci (Figure 7B) and pointed out that in some cases we can observe multiple SIMR-1 foci interacting with another type of granule (see Figure 7A, arrow in inset for SIMR-1 and ZNFX-1 localization). These data show that while SIMR-1 is usually associated with the other three granules, it is not necessarily in a 1:1:1:1 proportion. We have also noticed that not all P granules are associated with SIMR/Mutator/Z granules. We do not know at this time why only some P granules are associated with these other granules however we are quantifying and exploring further in another manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Manage et al. have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, called SIMR-1, which interacts with a component of mutator foci, MUT-16, and participates in the accumulation of a subset of endo-siRNAs antisense to piRNA and mutator target genes. They also show that simr-1 mutant displays a temperature-dependent progressive loss of fertility similarly to mutation in downstream components of the piRNA pathway. Interestingly, they have shown that SIMR-1 has a perinuclear localization in a region distinct from p-granule, z-granule or mutator foci, and that its localization is independent from mutator foci. Moreover, they have identified by sequence alignment an extended Tudor domain protein which might potentially interact with methylated PIWI protein. Based on these results, they propose that SIMR-1 constitutes a distinct germ-granule that acts downstream of PIWI and piRNAs to transport mRNAs targeted by piRNAs from p-granule to mutator foci (the granule involved in the amplification of endo-siRNAs). Overall, the distinct perinuclear localization of this protein is exciting, however there are no experiments that substantiate the claim that this protein has a role in transporting mRNAs form piRNA pathway to downstream mutator foci nor that the putative Tudor domain is functional. I also express some concerns about the methods, data analysis, and interpretation of some key results as listed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all statements that SIMR-1 transports RNAs from the piRNA to <italic>mutator</italic> pathway and have instead indicated that SIMR-1 acts at a step between piRNA production and <italic>mutator</italic>-complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. We have also added data demonstrating that the Tudor domain is functional (see response to point “B” below). Finally, we have addressed all specific comments about data analysis and would be happy to provide any other information, if requested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) The authors performed a MUT-16 IPs coupled with mass spectrometry to identify novel interacting factors of mutator complex. My first concern is related to the fact that the authors did not specify how many IP replicates they have used and which statistical methods they have performed to identify specific interactors in MUT-16 IPs versus control IPs. It appears that they have considered interacting proteins that have peptides only in MUT-16 GFP and FLAG IPs and not in the control. This approach can limit the number of interacting proteins identifiable in the IPs. Also, the number of peptides they have identified for SIMR-1 is extremely low (2 peptides in FLAG IPs and 1 peptide in GFP IPs) rising doubt that SIMR-1 is a real interactor of MUT-16. Because of the lack of statistical tools used to identify interacting proteins I suggest them to perform Co-IP experiments to confirm this interaction. It is also not known whether this interaction is direct or mediated by RNA, and an experiment such as Co-IP can help to distinguish the nature of their interactions. Also, in Figure 1A they have included the proteins RSD-2, WAGO-1, and MATH-33, which have been identified following another (not clear) approach (their peptides are not uniquely present in MUT-16 IPs). Therefore, it should be removed from this table. Again, if they want to take in consideration such cases they should perform a quantitative proteomic approach, using more replicates and statistical tools.</p></disp-quote><p>Only a single replicate was performed for each immunoprecipitation (MUT-16-FLAG, MUT-16-GFP, control-FLAG, control GFP) so we did not perform statistical analysis. The approach was treated as a screen, to identify candidate genes for further exploration, rather than a comprehensive list of true MUT-16 interactors. We have removed RSD-2, WAGO-1, and MATH-33 from the table in Figure 1, as requested. Because we did perform further analysis with these proteins (localization and small RNA seq) that appear in other figures, they were instead included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, along with the peptide counts in the control strains to make clear that these three proteins were identified at much lower coverage in the control FLAG IP.</p><p>We have attempted to confirm the SIMR-1-MUT-16 co-IPs to demonstrate that this is a true interaction, however our results were inconclusive. We believe that this result suggests that the interaction between MUT-16 and SIMR-1 may be weak or transient, which is not surprising given their localization to distinct compartments and the fact that SIMR-1 is not required for exogenous RNAi or small RNA production at many mutator target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) There are no functional data or structural information to asses that the conserved residues contained in SIMR-1 constitute a Tudor domain capable of recognizing a methylated substrate such as PIWI. Moreover, SIMR-1 IP and mass spec experiments failed to identify PRG-1/PIWI protein. The major interactor identified by mass spec is instead RSD-2, which they show to colocalize in the same perinuclear foci as SIMR-1, although it appears to have a different function (RSD-2 is involved in RNAi and not 22G-RNA amplification from piRNA targets and SIMR-1 is not involved in RNAi but in the accumulation of 22G-RNAs from piRNA targets). Therefore, the distinct localization of SIMR-1 per se does not implicate that SIMR-1 mediates the handoff of mRNAs from the piRNA pathway to the downstream Mutator components. Also, the peptide counts of the putative interactors of SIMR-1 shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 are extremely low, a factor that rises concerns on the quality of the IP/mass spec experiments. Again, it is not specified how many replicates have been performed. Therefore, some of these interactions, such as MUT-16/SIMR-1 should be confirmed by Co-IP.</p></disp-quote><p>To demonstrate that the Tudor domain of SIMR-1 is functional, we made a single point mutation in a critical residue for the structure of the extended Tudor domain and found that SIMR-1 no longer localizes to perinuclear granules (Figure 4C). Furthermore, these mutant animals have transgenerational fertility defects at elevated temperature similar to the <italic>simr-1</italic> deletion allele (Figure 4D). This same allele was also identified in an unbiased screen for de-silencing of a piRNA sensor (Figure 4A). While this data does not prove that the SIMR-1 Tudor domain can recognize methylated peptides, it does support the identification of the Tudor domain and indicate its critical role in SIMR-1 function.</p><p>We have removed the SIMR-1 mass-spec experiment due to the low peptide counts and lack of replicates. We attempted to replicate the MUT-16-SIMR-1 interaction by co-IP, but as described in the previous point, the results were inconclusive. Nonetheless, SIMR-1 clearly has a role in the production of siRNAs from piRNA targets based on its phenotypes. We plan to revisit the direct interactors of SIMR-1 in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The authors performed a small RNA-seq analysis to check whether specific population of small RNAs are affected in simr-1 mutant. They have performed profiles of small RNAs in different conditions (normal temperature of grow or 25°C at several generations), perhaps to correlate gene expression changes with the temperature-dependent progressive loss of fertility phenotype. However, the lack of corresponding RNA-seq profiles does not allow to investigate the effect of temperature on gene expression and how it correlates with the progressive sterility phenotype. Moreover, the most dramatic changes in small RNAs in SIMR-1 mutant occur at 25°C after just one generation. Thus, there is no correlation between progressive loss of fertility and changes in small RNAs. I wonder then if the results across generation of SIMR-1 mutant grown at 25°C are relevant for the current manuscript at all. Therefore, the only conclusion from all the analyses performed is that SIMR-1 is somehow participating in the accumulation of a subset of mut-16 and piRNA targets. The effect of the temperature on small RNA biogenesis is instead not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a panel showing a reduction in small RNAs mapping to piRNA target genes in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants over the course of 10 generations at 25°C (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). Additionally, we have added mRNA-seq data to the manuscript, in part, to address whether we can correlate any gene expression changes to the progressive sterility phenotype. We find that some <italic>mutator</italic> targets, PRG-1 targets, and spermatogenesis genes are up-regulated exclusively at late (sterile or nearly sterile) generations, however, similar classes of genes are also up-regulated at 20°C (Figure 6G). Thus, it is difficult to attribute the sterility phenotype to reduced or increased expression of a specific gene class. We do observe defects in histone mRNA expression (Figure 6I and Figure 6—figure supplement 1G) which Barucci et al., 2020) propose leads to sterility in <italic>prg-1</italic> animals; however, in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants the reduction in histone mRNA expression is observed even at 20°C, which suggests that it cannot be the sole cause of the fertility defect. We therefore agree with the reviewer that much of the changes in small RNA expression occur even at 20°C or after a single generation at 25°C – we hypothesize that this loss of piRNA and <italic>mutator</italic>-target small RNAs is sensitizing the animals to fertility defects at elevated temperature but this may not be a direct effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) In addition, the small RNA analysis they have performed is not very compelling. For instance, in some cases is not clear if the criteria they have used to define genes with decrease or increase small RNAs. Also, the methods don't clearly show which small RNAs they are considering (22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs, sense, antisense, broad range of small RNAs 21-26nt, etc.). Because these are small RNAs cloned from total RNAs and not from AGO IPs, the authors cannot be sure that the increases or decreases of small RNAs observed belong to a specific AGO pathway (it is known that mutation in some small RNA biogenesis factor causes misrouting of small RNAs into AGOs). In general, it appears that mutation in SIMR-1 causes a general downregulation (not completely loss) of small RNAs, which are considered to be mut-16 dependent (including some previously defined piRNA targets). Among these affected genes, the piRNA targets appear more affected than the whole mut-16 targets.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the figures and figure legends to indicate what classes of small RNAs we are examining. In general, we are looking at total small RNAs mapping to a particular gene class and have not restricted it by size, 5’ nucleotide, or strandedness. For piRNAs, we looked only at small RNAs mapping to annotated piRNA loci. We do not argue that these small RNAs are binding particular Argonaute proteins, only that they map to known <italic>mutator</italic>, piRNA, CSR-1, etc target genes. Finally, using our new <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant small RNA data, we show that the majority of <italic>simr-1</italic> targets are also piRNA targets, in addition to being <italic>mutator</italic> targets (Figure 5D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) The authors claim that SIMR-1 acts downstream of the piRNA pathway, however they haven't performed any experiment to prove that piRNA silencing is impaired in simr-1 mutant. They should use the canonical piRNA sensor strain (Ashe et al., 2012), and check whether the silencing of the piRNA sensor reporter is impaired in simr-1 mutant. This experiment goes well with the other assays they have used to show that RNAi is not affected in simr-1 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the isolation of two alleles of <italic>simr-1</italic> from a piRNA sensor screen (first described in de Albuquerque, Genes Dev 2014) to demonstrate that <italic>simr-1</italic> can de-silence a sensitized piRNA sensor (Figure 4A) but not a piRNA sensor silenced by RNAe (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that SIMR-1 is required to promote fertility after re-establishing WAGO-class 22G-siRNA production, a phenotype previously observed only with mutants in known piRNA pathway factors <italic>prg-1</italic>, <italic>pid-1</italic>, and <italic>henn-1</italic> (Figure 4B), providing further evidence that SIMR-1 is important for production of siRNAs at piRNA-target loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Add in Figure 2C the statistical significance of those changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The libraries in Figure 2C were considered part of the screen to identify new small RNA factors and were not performed with replicates, so statistics was not included. All subsequent small RNA and mRNA seq focused on <italic>simr-1</italic> (Figures 5-6 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) were performed with multiple replicate libraries and include statistics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Add in Figure 2D genes that are statistically significant up-regulated and down-regulated (or &gt;2-fold change). They can label the significant dots with different colours as well. Same in 2E, if any.</p></disp-quote><p>Colors have been changed to highlight genes with log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) in small RNA abundance greater or less than 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 4C the total number of genes belonging to piRNA, ERGO-1, and mut-16 is changing in the different Venn diagram. This is not clear. Shouldn't be constant?</p></disp-quote><p>These particular Venn diagrams have been replaced, however in the original figure, overlaps of less than 10 genes were not shown on the diagram for simplicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “simr-1 mutants have increased levels of germ cell apoptosis”, the paragraph title is misleading. The level of germline apoptosis in SIMR-1 is similar to WT at 20°C and lower than WT at 25°C (first generation). It is slightly higher than the corresponding WT at generation 2, 10, 11 and not changing at generation 4,7. Importantly, the WT at 25°C (1 generation) has the highest level of germline apoptosis compared to all the other data points and yet is still fertile. Therefore, the reported level of germline apoptosis is not correlated with the sterility phenotype. This is why I disagree with the Authors' interpretation of the results shown in Figure 3E and the conclusion they wrote in the subsection “simr-1 mutants have increased levels of germ cell apoptosis”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title of this section to indicate that the increase in apoptosis is specifically associated with the Mrt phenotype in generations 10 and 11. We agree that it is strange that apoptosis increases so significantly in the first generation at 25°C, however we interpret this to be a response to the heat stress. By generation 2 at 25°C, the animals have acclimated to the elevated temperature and apoptosis is reduced. Only in the late generation 25°C animals do we observe apoptosis elevated in the <italic>simr-1</italic> mutant compared to wild-type. While we are not arguing that the apoptosis is causative of the sterility, we do believe that the increase in apoptosis in the late generations, which is far more significant than any differences observed in earlier generations, is correlated with reduced fertility in these animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The first paragraph of the subsection “SIMR-1 is required for small RNA production at piRNA target genes”, contains results that are not shown in any figures. Please, provide a figure that report these results. Also, it is not written which criteria they have used to identify changes in small RNA populations (fold changes, p-value?), nor it is known from the Materials and methods or text which small RNAs they are considering (22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs, sense, antisense, broad range of small RNAs 21-26nt, etc.). Also, do the small RNA-depleted genes at 25°C (which are not depleted in subsequent generations) reacquire the small RNAs in progressive generations?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added tables to indicate the total number of genes with changes in small RNAs or mRNAs in each genotype and condition (Figure 5A and Figure 6F). Details regarding criteria used to define genes with small RNA and mRNA changes and types of small RNAs being analyzed has been added to appropriate figure legends and Materials and methods.</p><p>For the genes that lose small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, the majority are found to lose small RNAs across multiple conditions (temperature or generation). For the genes that lose small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants only in the first generation at 25°C, but not at 20°C or later generations at 25°C (~300 genes in total), some of these genes have increased small RNAs in the wild-type strain only in this condition and are lost in subsequent generations while others lose small RNAs that are then regained at later generations. In the cases of genes that appear to gain small RNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants only in the first generation at 25°C, but not at 20°C or later generations at 25°C, many of these genes actually have reduced small RNAs in the wild-type strain at this generation that are recovered at later generations. In fact, there are many genes that gain and lose small RNAs in the wild-type strain at elevated temperature and across generations, but this analysis seemed beyond the scope of the current paper so we did not include the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The results from the analyses shown in the subsection “simr-1 mutants have increased levels of siRNAs mapping to histone genes”, are also not clear and maybe not relevant for the current manuscript. The results described lack a figure reference. Are they shown in Supplementary Figure 5B? Also, in Supplementary Figure 5B they only show depleted siRNAs and not enriched siRNAs. Also, they only consider lists of genes depleted of 22G-RNAs. Maybe if they consider log2(fold changes) they will find more insightful results. In regard to the small RNAs targeting histone mRNAs they have cited a submitted paper (not sure if it is possible to cite the journal where the paper is submitted) and conclude this might be relevant. Mutation in MUT-16, which is linked to piRNA pathway, do not show the same histone small RNAs. Moreover, histone small RNAs are present at all temperature, therefore also do not correlate with the progressive loss of fertility in SIMR-1 mutant. Again, I am not sure how this paragraph fits with the whole manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the histone data supports our argument that <italic>simr-1</italic> acts in the piRNA pathway (and not the <italic>mutator</italic> pathway). The paper referenced in the original submission of this manuscript is now published in Nucleic Acids Research (Reed et al., 2019). An additional paper has also recently been published on this topic (Barucci et al., 2020), both demonstrating that increased small RNAs mapping to histone genes and reduced histone mRNA expression is a phenotype associated with the piRNA pathway. Both papers also demonstrate that these small RNAs mapping to histones are dependent on the <italic>mutator</italic> complex for their biogenesis, thus if they are present, the <italic>mutator</italic> complex must be functional. Therefore, these data places <italic>simr-1</italic> in the piRNA pathway, upstream of the <italic>mutator</italic> complex-dependent biogenesis of these histone small RNAs.</p><p>The sentences which were lacking a figure reference have been removed. Supplementary Figure 5B has been removed and replaced with Figure 6B-C, which shows genes enriched for small RNAs in <italic>prg-1</italic>, <italic>mut-16</italic>, and <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants, and the correlation of those enriched for small RNAs in <italic>prg-1</italic> and <italic>simr-1</italic> mutants with histone genes. All of the lists of genes enriched for small RNAs are described in Figure 5A and Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the Discussion, the authors claim that their work &quot;provides insight into how mRNAs move between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote piRNA-mediated mRNA silencing&quot;. This has not been demonstrated. There are no experiments showing that the mRNAs targeted by piRNAs move through perinuclear SIMR-1 condensates to Mutator foci, nor that SIMR-1 is required for piRNA silencing. The reduction in a subset of piRNA targets might be an indirect consequence of SIMR-1 function, which still remains unknown. Thus, I suggest to remove this sentence. Same for sentences in the last paragraph of the subsection “RSD-2 and SIMR-1 promote the interaction between distinct primary and secondary siRNA pathways”.</p></disp-quote><p>Both sentences have been edited to remove language indicating trafficking or handover between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex, and simply state that SIMR-1 acts downstream of piRNA biogenesis and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the Materials and methods section the authors should add the detailed protocol used for Immunoprecipitation and mass spec (buffer used etc.). The referenced Uebel et al. do not contain such information. Also, the raw proteomic data has not been released. Moreover, they should add a full description of the small RNA analysis performed as mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>The IP/mass spec section of the Materials and methods has been updated to include buffers used and the Bioinformatics Analysis section has been modified to include more detail about the packages used and the analysis performed. A table of all mass spec data has been included as Supplementary file 2. We would be happy to provide any additional details, if requested by the reviewer.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) Even if the Authors have removed all statements that &quot;SIMR-1 &quot;hands-off&quot; RNAs from the piRNA to mutator pathway&quot; in the main text, the passage in the Abstract that says &quot;However, how mRNAs first recognized by the piRNA pathway are then handed off to the mutator pathway is unclear. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein, SIMR-1, as acting at this step between piRNA production and mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis&quot; is still confusing, suggesting that SIMR-1 acts at that step.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Abstract to eliminate the suggestion that a “hand-off” is occurring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Authors have shown that there is a gradual reduction in small RNAs in simr-1 mutant compared to WT across generations at 25°C in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1D. However, the heat map shown in figure 5C suggests that the reduction in small RNAs (even at generation 10) in simr-1 mutant is milder compared to prg-1 mutant. Therefore, I recommend to include in Figure 5—figure supplement 1D data from prg-1 mutant at 20°C and to calculate the significant changes in siRNAs between prg-1 and simr-1 mutants. If the small RNA depletion in prg-1 mutant is more severe than in simr-1 mutant (as it appears from Figure 5C), then the Authors should reconsider their claim that SIMR-1 act downstream the piRNA pathway to produce siRNAs in mutator foci. SIMR-1 might cooperate to accumulate small RNAs downstream of piRNAs together with other pathways or proteins (acting together or independent of SIMR-1 in piRNA-dependent small RNA accumulation). Also, the effect on small RNA accumulation can be still indirectly linked to piRNA-dependent small RNA biogenesis, since no interaction between SIMR-1 and PIWI or MUT-16 has been shown by Co-IP. Therefore, these alternative possibilities should be discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a line in Figure 5—figure supplement 1D below which all piRNA targets fall (since the list of piRNA-target genes was defined as those reduced by 2-fold in a <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant). We agree that the reviewer makes a good point that piRNA-target genes are reduced of siRNAs in <italic>prg-1</italic> more severely than <italic>simr-1</italic>, even at late generations. Thus, we have adjusted the text to reflect that sterility is unlikely to be caused by this loss progressive loss of siRNAs in <italic>simr-1</italic>, as <italic>prg-1</italic> was fertile at the time it had an even greater loss of siRNAs to these genes. We have additionally modified the first paragraph of the Discussion to point out that the <italic>simr-1</italic> phenotypes are weaker than those of <italic>prg-1</italic>, suggesting that <italic>simr-1</italic> is not absolutely required to mediate siRNA amplification at all piRNA target genes, or it acts cooperatively with other pathways or proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The increased siRNAs in simr-1 mutant also appear to be less severe than piRNA mutant (Figure 5C). Similarly, the changes in mRNAs (including histone mRNAs) might be less severe that piRNA mutant. In my opinion this can be an important determinant in explaining the different phenotype between piRNA and simr-1 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in previous comment, we have edited the first paragraph of the Discussion to discuss the difference in phenotypes between <italic>simr-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic> and offer possible reasons for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the paragraph now called &quot;simr-1 Mrt phenotype is associated with increased levels of germ cell apoptosis&quot; the Authors speculate that the significant increase in apoptotic cells at later generation in simr-1 mutant compared to the relative WT is correlated to sterility. As I have already mentioned in my first review, although WT animals at 25°C have levels of apoptotic cells similar to those of later generation of sterile simr-1 mutant at 25°C, yet they are fertile. Thus, the number of apoptotic cells detected with this assay in simr-1 mutant do not suggest that they contribute to sterility. As a comparison, mutants of H3K9me (met-2, set-25) show 4-fold increases in apoptotic cells at 25°C compared to WT (in Zeller et al., 2016, Figure 2B). Therefore, in my opinion this data is inconclusive and can induce to misinterpretation. This is why, if the Authors are willing to show this result, they should comment on the fact that WT animals with similar number of apoptotic cells are fertile and that the number of apoptotic cells detected in simr-1 mutant might not contribute to the sterility.</p></disp-quote><p>An additional sentence has been added to this section of the Results to make it clear that high levels of apoptosis are not always correlated to sterility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the Introduction, the Authors wrote: &quot;Here we identify a protein required to mediate the interaction between PRG-1 and piRNAs in P granules with siRNA amplification in Mutator foci.&quot; The interaction between these factors has not been confirmed by Co-IP or other experiments, thus the statement needs to be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited this sentence so as not to imply a direct physical interaction between SIMR-1 and these other pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Introduction, the Authors claim that &quot;this work identifies one of the first factors to act downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs&quot;.

Also, the result presented pointed out that simr-1 might directly or indirectly participate in the accumulation of those siRNAs (see also comment 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited this sentence so as not to indicate that SIMR-1 is the first factor identified with this role.</p></body></sub-article></article>
