Intriguingly, T cell-monocyte complex frequency and phenotype fluctuate with the onset of immune perturbations such as infection or immunization, reflecting expected polarization of immune responses.

In particular, the physical interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is critical for the initiation of immune responses. APCs such as monocytes can take up debris from the extracellular environment, and will display fragments of it on their surface to T cells, which can identify potentially harmful, non-self antigens. There is paucity of data regarding T cell-APCs interactions in humans in vivo, but they appear to be highly diverse in terms of structure, length and function, depending on the nature and degree of maturation of the T cell and APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedl and Storim, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of interactions between immune cells, many experimental techniques in immunology specifically avoid studying cell:cell complexes, in particular for the analysis of clinical samples obtained ex vivo. The most notable example for this is in flow cytometry, in which cells are labeled with a panel of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, and each cell is then individually hit by a laser and its corresponding fluorescence emission spectra recorded. In this process, doublets (a pair of two cells) are routinely observed but are believed to be the results of technical artifacts due to ex vivo sample manipulation and are thus usually discarded, or ignored in data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kudernatsch et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Blood is the most readily accessible sample in humans with high immune cell content. We and others have shown circulating immune cells contain critical information that can be used for diagnostic-, prognostic- and mechanistic understanding of a given disease or immune perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bongen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grifoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roy Chowdhury et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zak et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, whereas blood does not fully reflect what is occurring in tissues, it contains relevant information from circulating immune cells that have been either directly impacted by the perturbation, or indirectly through cell contact with tissue-resident cells in the affected compartment, including lymphoid organs.</p><p>However, the presence of dual-cell complexes (and their content) has never been studied in the peripheral blood and in the context of immune perturbations. Monocytes are a subtype of phagocytes present in high abundance in the peripheral blood, which play a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jakubzick et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, monocytes have the capacity to differentiate into highly specialized APCs such as macrophages or myeloid DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sprangers et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, it has been highlighted that they might directly function as APCs and thus contribute to adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jakubzick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Randolph et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We recently identified a gene signature in memory CD4+ T cells circulating in the peripheral blood that distinguishes individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) from uninfected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burel et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, this dataset also led to the discovery of a group of monocyte-associated genes co-expressed in memory CD4+ T cells whose expression is highly variable across individuals. We ultimately traced this signature to a population of CD3+CD14+ cells that are not single cells but T cell:monocyte complexes present in the blood and that can be detected following immune perturbations such as disease or vaccination. The frequency and T cell phenotypes of these complexes appear to be associated with the nature of pathogen or vaccine. Thus, studying these complexes promises to provide insights into the impact of immune perturbation on APCs, T cells and their interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unexpected detection of monocyte gene expression in CD4+ memory T cells from human subjects</title><p>We initially set out to investigate the inter-individual variability of gene expression within sorted memory CD4+ T cells from our previously characterized cohort of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burel et al., 2018</xref>). Within the 100 most variable genes, we identified a set of 22 genes that were highly co-expressed with each other (22-var set, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Strikingly, many of the genes contained within the 22-var set were previously described as being highly expressed in classical monocytes (and to a lower extent non-classical monocytes) but not in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schmiedel et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the 22-var set contained the commonly used monocyte lineage marker CD14, the lysozyme LYZ and the S100 calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9, which are known to be extremely abundant in monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By examining the flow cytometry data that were acquired during cell sorting and applying our memory CD4+ T cell gating strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we identified that indeed there was a subpopulation within sorted memory CD4+ T cells that stained positive for CD14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). More importantly, the proportion of memory CD4+ T cells that were CD14+ was positively correlated with the 22-var set expression (spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.42, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that this cell subset is responsible for the expression of the monocyte-associated genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The CD14+ memory CD4+ T cell population has similar forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC) values to other memory CD4+ T cells and was thus sorted along with conventional CD14- memory CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In particular, there was no indication that CD14+ memory CD4+ T cells were the product of a technical artifact, such as dead cells or a compensation issue.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46045.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two cell populations expressing both T cell (CD3) and monocyte (CD14) surface markers exist in the live singlet cell population of PBMC from human subjects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The top 100 most variable genes in memory CD4+ T cells across TB uninfected (TBneg) and LTBI infected subjects.

We could readily detect T cell:monocyte complexes in freshly isolated PBMC, and at similar frequencies as the same samples after cryopreservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In another set of samples, using red blood cell (RBC) magnetic depletion (and thus minimal sample manipulation), we could successfully identify T cell:monocyte complexes directly from whole blood at frequencies matching the same sample after PBMC isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also assessed the effect of the anti-coagulant used for blood collection, and found similar frequencies of T cell:monocyte complexes using either heparin or EDTA, in both fresh and frozen PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). More strikingly, in a small healthy population bled longitudinally one week apart, their frequency was variable between individuals, but highly stable over time within each individual (non-parametric spearman correlation r = 1 and r = 0.9 for fresh and frozen PBMC, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, to rule out that non-specific binding of antibody conjugates used for flow cytometry staining could be the result of complex formation (via Fc-receptors, known to be highly abundant in the surface of monocytes), we compared the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes obtained from cryopreserved PBMC in the presence or absence of a Fc-receptor blocking reagent. The frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes frequencies was unchanged when blocking Fc-receptor binding of conjugated antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these data rule out that ex vivo manipulation of the blood sample could be responsible for T cell:monocyte complexes formation and thus suggest their presence in vivo in peripheral blood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>T cell:monocyte complexes show increased expression of adhesion molecules at their interface</title><p>During T cell recognition of epitopes on APCs such as monocytes, the two cells are known to form an ‘immune synapse’ at their contact point, which is stabilized by key adhesion molecules such as LFA1 on the T cell, and ICAM1 on the APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dustin, 2014</xref>). Upon interaction these two molecules undergo a drastic redistribution by focusing almost exclusively at the cell:cell point of contact, thus forming a ‘ring’ that can be visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wabnitz and Samstag, 2016</xref>). To identify candidate immunological synapses in T cell:monocyte complexes, we used high resolution Airyscan images of sorted doublets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for sorting strategy). Almost a third (thirty out of 105, 29%) of doublets analyzed from three different individuals displayed accumulation and polarization of ICAM1 and LFA1 at their interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The percentage of polarized doublets ranged from 17% to 67% between the subjects. In seven doublets, CD3 also accumulated together with LFA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we did not find well developed, classical immunological synapses, defined by central accumulation of CD3 and LFA1 exclusion from central region of a synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thauland and Parker, 2010</xref>). Overall, this suggests that a significant fraction of the detected T cell:monocyte complexes utilizes adhesion markers associated with T cell:APC synapse formation to stabilize their interaction, but they do not appear to undergo active TCR signaling at the moment of capture and acquisition.</p><p>To assess the strength of the adhesion between the T cell and the monocyte within complexes, we explored various in vitro conditions in which we attempted to break down their interaction. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, in all three individuals tested, the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes was reduced after vigorous pipetting up/down, and the strongest ‘destructive effect’ was observed with mild sonication. Incubation with RBC lysis buffer disrupted the T cell:monocyte complexes in one out of three individuals, while addition of high concentration of anti-chelating agent EDTA had no effect on their frequency. Thus, it appears that it is possible to disrupt T cell:monocyte complexes with physical methods. Conversely, we tried to promote their in vitro formation by stimulating PBMC for two hours to several days, with various concentrations of highly antigenic stimuli (such as LPS, PHA, SEB or live BCG) without success, which might be due to issues with monocytes attaching to the culture plates (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conventional flow cytometry parameters could not differentiate between T cells and monocytes in a complex versus not in a complex</title><p>So far, our identification of T cell:monocyte complexes has been solely relying on the co-expression of CD3 and CD14 within cells falling into the live singlet gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In order to fine-tune their detection, we investigated whether we could identify some additional flow cytometry parameters that could separate T cells and monocytes in a complex vs. not in a complex. The area (A), height (H) and width (W) of the peak from forward and side scatter parameters are routinely used in flow cytometry to identify doublets. A non-linear staining between any 2D combination of these three parameters is indicative of cell aggregates. The density plot of CD3+CD14+ cells overlapped with both CD3+ cells and especially CD14+ cells for any combination of A, H and W for both FSC and SSC parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). An additional parameter often used to ‘clean up’ the gating of cells within biological samples is the use of CD45-SSC gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harrington et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes was not affected by applying an initial CD45-SSC gate filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, see gating in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To correct for this, we elected to express the abundance of T cell:monocytes complexes as a constant of association Ka, where similarly to a constant of chemical complex association, the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes is divided by the product of the frequency of both T cells and monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As T cell and monocyte frequencies in the blood can fluctuate greatly during immune perturbations, the Ka is a more accurate readout of the likelihood of T cell:monocyte complex formation as opposed to raw frequencies, the latter being biased towards the overall abundance of each subset forming the complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46045.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The constant of association Ka between monocytes and T cells (and T cell subsets) varies with the presence and nature of immune perturbations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-parametric spearman correlation between the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes and the product of singlet T cells and monocyte frequencies in healthy subjects (n = 59).

In the case of TB, although macrophages are known to be the primary target for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection and replication, monocytes can also be infected and contribute to the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>). In active TB subjects, we found a significant decrease in T cell:monocyte Ka at 2 months post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). At the time of diagnosis, some subjects displayed a Ka much higher than any uninfected or LTBI individuals, but because of the high heterogeneity within the active TB cohort, these differences did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dengue virus predominantly infects monocytes in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kou et al., 2008</xref>), and circulating monocyte infection and activation is increased in dengue hemorrhagic fever (the more severe form of dengue fever) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durbin et al., 2008</xref>). In subjects with acute dengue fever from Sri Lanka, patients that developed hemorrhagic fever had higher T cell:monocyte Ka upon hospitalization compared to healthy, previously infected subjects (blood bank donors seropositive for dengue antibodies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast, patients with a less severe form of acute dengue infection showed no significant difference in T cell:monocyte Ka compared to healthy, previously infected donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether vaccination also impacted the formation of T cell:monocyte complexes, we obtained samples from healthy adults that received the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) booster vaccination. We indeed observed a significantly higher T cell:monocyte Ka at three days post boost compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), but no significant changes at one, seven or fourteen days post boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these data confirm that circulating T cell:monocyte complexes can be found directly ex vivo in different immune perturbations, and their likelihood of formation is associated with clinical parameters such as disease severity, and they fluctuate as a function of time post treatment and post vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>T cells with different phenotypes are found in T cell:monocyte complexes dependent on the nature of the immune perturbation</title><p>Finally, we reasoned that if immune perturbations increase the formation of T cell:monocyte complexes, then the nature of the T cells contained in the complexes could provide insights into which T cells are actively communicating with monocytes in vivo. In particular, the T cell subsets that will associate with an APC for the different perturbations studied above are expected to be distinct, and thus their likelihood to form a complex with a monocyte might differ too. The Tdap vaccine contains exclusively protein antigens and is known to elicit predominantly memory CD4+ T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">da Silva Antunes et al., 2018</xref>). Mtb is a bacterial pathogen known to trigger strong CD4+ responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2016</xref>) as opposed to dengue virus, which is a viral antigen and thus expected to elicit CD8+ responses.</p><p>Similarly to global T cell:monocyte complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>), we calculated the constant of association Ka with monocytes for each CD4/CD8 T cell subset individually. In subjects with active TB, the Ka between monocytes and CD4+CD8+ (DPOS) T cells or CD4+ T cells was significantly higher than for CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and both DPOS and CD4+ T cell:monocyte complexes had higher Ka in active TB compared to dengue hemorrhagic fever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Dengue hemorrhagic fever showed a higher T cell:monocyte Ka for CD8+ over CD4+ cells whereas Tdap day three post boost showed the opposite, with highest Ka for CD4+ over CD8+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The CD8+ T cell:monocyte Ka was also higher in Dengue and active TB compared to Tdap boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the magnitude of Ka in CD4+ vs CD8+ T cell subsets matched what is expected based on the nature of immune perturbation. Interestingly, for all three immune perturbations studied the highest Ka with monocytes across all T cell subsets was for CD4-CD8- (DNEG) T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and this effect was most pronounced in dengue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These cells could constitute gamma-delta T cells that are known to be strongly activated in the peripheral blood during acute dengue fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these data indicate that the T cell subsets that are preferentially associated with monocytes differ from their individual frequencies in PBMC, and follow different patterns in the three systems studied, further supporting the notion that these complexes are not the result of random association, and are specific to the nature of the immune perturbation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The unexpected detection of monocyte genes expressed in cells sorted for memory T cell markers led to the discovery that a population of CD3+CD14+ cells exist within the ‘live singlet’ events gate and that these cells are T cells that are tightly associated with monocytes, and less frequently, with monocyte-derived debris. Their presence in freshly isolated cells and the fact that a significant fraction of the complexes showed enriched expression for LFA1/ICAM1 adhesion molecules at their interface, suggest that they are not the product of random association of cells during processing, but represent interactions that occurred in vivo prior to the blood draw. The frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes fluctuated over time in the onset of immune perturbations such as following TB treatment or Tdap boost immunization and correlated with clinical parameters such as disease severity in the case of dengue fever. Furthermore, the T cell subset in preferential association within the monocyte in a complex varies in function of the nature of the immune perturbation.</p><p>Our initial observation of the presence of monocyte genes within the transcriptome of T cells was focused on memory CD4 T cells. This cell population was elected since our study aimed to define novel immune signatures associated with Mtb-specific CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burel et al., 2018</xref>), which are expected to almost exclusively fall into the memory compartment in the context of latent TB infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lindestam Arlehamn et al., 2013</xref>). However, since we have found that both CD4 and CD8 T cells, from both memory and naïve phenotype, can be found in a complex with a monocyte, we think similar results would have been obtained with other sorted T cell populations. We have since detected the expression of monocytes-associated genes in several other T cell subsets, including memory CD8 T cells, and total CD4 T cells (unpublished observations).</p><p>Intact T cell:monocyte complexes were almost exclusively found in the top area of the FSC/SSC 2D plot, and were associated with high CD14 expression. In contrast, T cells with monocyte debris were associated with FSC/SSC values similar to regular non-complex T cells and an intermediate CD14 expression. This cell population might be the result of T cell:monocyte complexes from which the monocyte was disrupted during sample preparation or flow cytometry acquisition. Alternatively, these CD3+CD14mid cells could be the result of plasma membrane fragments exchange from monocytes to T cells following interaction. This phenomenon, known as trogocytosis, has been described to occur during cellular encounters between several immune cell types, including monocytes and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daubeuf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">HoWangYin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest circulating CD3+CD14+ complexes appear to be the result of in vivo interaction between T cells and monocytes. The origin and location of the complexes’ formation is still unknown. These interactions might be occurring directly in the blood. Alternatively, it is possible that T cell:monocyte complex formation does not initially occur in peripheral blood, but rather in tissues or draining lymph nodes, and these complexes are then excavated into the peripheral circulation. The most studied physical interaction between T cells and monocytes is the formation of immune synapses. We found that about a third of complexes displayed LFA1/ICAM1 mediated interaction similarly to immune synapses, but no CD3 polarization. The immune synapse formation is a highly diverse event in terms of length and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedl and Storim, 2004</xref>), so it is possible that not all detected complexes are at the same stage in the interaction. In some complexes, the nature (and structure) of the architectural molecules forming the cell:cell contact might differ from traditional immune synapses, too. Studying the nature and physical properties of these interactions could provide insights into how T cells and monocytes can physically interact. Additionally, because monocytes are not the only cell type known to associate with T cells, we think the ability to form complexes with T cells should not be restricted to monocytes, but could apply more broadly to any APC. Thus, it is possible that other types of complexes pairing a T cell and other APCs such as B cells or dendritic cells can be found in the peripheral blood.</p><p>Increased immune cell:cell interactions might not necessarily always correlate with onset of immune perturbations. Nevertheless, our preliminary data suggest that determining the constant of association Ka of the T cell:monocyte (and likely more broadly any T cell:APC) complexes can indicate the presence of an immune perturbation to both clinicians and immunologists. We think that the Ka, rather than the frequency of live cells, is a more relevant parameter to measure the occurrence of T cell:monocyte complexes (and thus the in vivo affinity between T cells and monocytes) since it corrects for random/aleatory association that is directly dependent on the T cell subset or monocyte abundance. For instance, DNEG T cells are in lower abundance than CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood, and thus DNEG T cells in a complex with a monocyte are found at a lower frequency compared to CD4+ or CD8+ T cell:monocyte complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>). However, interestingly, their Ka is consistently much higher than CD4+ or CD8+ T cells across all disease cohorts analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting a higher affinity of DNEG cells to monocytes. This information would have been missed if only frequencies were considered. In dengue infected subjects, a higher T cell:monocyte Ka at time of admission was associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever, the more severe form of disease. The distinction between hemorrhagic vs. non-hemorrhagic fever may become clear only days into hospitalization, so the ability to discriminate these two groups of individuals at the time of admission has potential diagnostic value. In the case of active TB, subjects presented a very high variability at diagnosis that might reflect the diverse spectrum associated with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pai et al., 2016</xref>), but for all subjects a significant decrease in T cell:monocyte Ka was observed upon treatment. This could thus be a tool to monitor treatment success and predict potential relapses. It will of course be necessary to run prospective trials to irrefutably demonstrate that the likelihood of association between T cells and monocytes have predictive power with regard to dengue disease severity or over the course of TB treatment. Additionally, the T cell:monocyte Ka was increased three days following Tdap booster vaccination. Therefore, in vaccine trials, it could be examined as an early readout to gage how well the immune system has responded to the vaccine. Finally, in apparently ‘healthy’ populations, or those with diffuse symptoms, an unusually high T cell:monocyte Ka in an individual could be used as an indicator of a yet to be determined immune perturbation.</p><p>Beyond detecting abnormal frequencies of T cell:monocyte complexes, characterizing the T cells and monocytes in these complexes might provide insights into the nature of immune perturbation and subsequent immune response based on which complexes were formed. Our data suggest that there are drastic differences in terms of T cell subsets in the complexes. As aforementioned, despite their lower frequency over CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood, DNEG T cells show a clear increased association with monocytes. Gamma-delta T cells constitute the majority of circulating DNEG T cells in humans, and LFA1 dependent crosstalk between gamma-delta T cells and monocytes has been shown to be important in the context of bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eberl et al., 2009</xref>), which might be also generalized to viral infections. Thus, the DNEG T cell:monocyte complexes might well represent a novel type of interaction between T cells and monocytes, not necessarily involving classical alpha-beta T cells or involving the formation of ‘traditional’ immune synapses. Aside from the enrichment for DNEG cells in T cell:monocyte complexes, we also observed a relatively high Ka for DPOS cells in T cell:monocyte complexes in all samples analyzed, despite their very low abundance amongst T cells. Circulating DPOS T cells have been described in the context of several infections, in particular from viruses. They are associated with enhanced effector functions such as proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitchen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nascimbeni et al., 2004</xref>). DPOS cells might thus represent a specific subset of T cells with enhanced surveillance and cell:cell communication functions, and thus have higher affinity for APCs hence higher likelihood to be found in a complex with a monocyte. Finally, we also found that the CD4 vs CD8 phenotype of the T cell present in complexes depends on the nature of the immune perturbation studied, and reflects the expected polarization of immune responses. Thus, looking for additional characteristics from T cells and monocytes present in the complexes, such as the expression of tissue homing markers, specific TCRs and their transcriptomic profile might provide further information about the fundamental mechanisms underlying immune responses to a specific perturbation.</p><p>Why were T cell:monocyte complexes not detected and excluded in flow cytometry based on gating strategies to avoid doublets? Surprisingly, all usual parameters (pulse Area (A), Height (H) and Width (W) from forward and side scatter) looked identical between T cell:monocyte complexes and singlet T cells or monocytes. The only parameter that could readily distinguish between intact CD3+CD14hi complexes and single T cells or monocytes was the brightfield area parameter from the imaging flow cytometer, which is a feature absent in non-imaging flow cytometry. Thus, it seems that gating approaches and parameters available in conventional flow cytometry are not sufficient to completely discriminate tightly bound cell pairs from individual cells.</p><p>Given that T cell:monocyte complexes are not excluded by conventional flow cytometry gating strategies, why were they not reported previously? Examining our own past studies, a major reason is that lineage markers for T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19) and monocytes (CD14) are routinely used to remove cells not of interest in a given experiment by adding them to a ‘dump channel’. For example, most of our CD4+ T cell studies have CD8, CD19 and CD14, and dead cell markers combined in the same channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlehamn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burel et al., 2018</xref>). Other groups studying for example CD14+ monocytes are likely to add CD3 to their dump channel. This means that complexes of cells that have two conflicting lineage markers such as CD3 and CD14 will often be removed from datasets early in the gating strategy. Additionally, the detection of complexes by flow cytometry is not straightforward. In our hands, we have found that conventional flow analyzers give low frequency of complexes and poor reproducibility in repeat runs. This is opposed to cell sorters, presumably due to differences in their fluidics systems, which puts less stress on cells and does not disrupt complexes as much. Both the routine exclusion of cell populations positive for two conflicting lineage markers and the challenges to reproduce such cell populations on different platforms has likely contributed to them not being reported.</p><p>Moreover, even if a panel allows for the detection of complexes, and there is a stable assay used to show their presence, there is an assumption in the field that detection of complexes is a result of experimental artifacts. For example, we found a report of double positive CD3+CD34+ cells detected by flow cytometry in human bone marrow, which followed up this finding and found them to be doublets using microscopy imaging. The authors concluded that these complexes are the product of random association and should be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kudernatsch et al., 2013</xref>). Their conclusion may well be true for their study, but it highlights a common conception in the field of cytometry that pairs of cells have to be artifacts. Another study described CD3+CD20+ singlets cells observed by flow cytometry as doublets of T cells and B cells, and also concluded them to be a technical artifact, in the sense that these cells are not singlets double expressing CD3 and CD20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henry et al., 2010</xref>). In this case however, authors pointed out that ‘Whether the formation of these doublets is an artifact occurring during staining or is a physiologic process remains to be determined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henry et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We ourselves assumed for a long time that we might have an artifact finding, but given the persistent association of T cell:monocyte complexes frequency and phenotype with clinically and physiologically relevant parameters, we came to a new conclusion: cells are meant to interact with other cells. Thus, detecting and characterizing complexes of cells isolated from tissues and bodily fluids, can provide powerful insights into cell:cell communication events that are missed when studying cells as singlets only.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">CCR7-PerCpCy5.5;

Dengue previously infected samples were obtained from healthy adult blood donors from the National Blood Center (NBC), Ministry of Health, Colombo, Sri Lanka, in an anonymous fashion as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weiskopf et al., 2013</xref>). Acute dengue fever samples were collected at National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Gothatuwa, Angoda, Sri Lanka and the North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Ragama, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Longitudinal Tdap booster vaccination samples and non-vaccinated healthy samples were obtained from healthy adults from San Diego, USA. LTBI status was confirmed in subjects by a positive IFN-γ release assay (IGRA) (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, Cellestis or T-SPOT.TB, Oxford Immunotec) and the absence of clinical and radiographic signs of active TB. TB uninfected control subjects were confirmed as IGRA negative. Active Pulmonary TB was defined as those exhibiting symptoms of TB, and are positive by sputum and culture as confirmed by the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL, Welisara, Sri Lanka). Sputum was further confirmed positive for TB by PCR at Genetech (Sri Lanka). Active TB patients in this study were confirmed negative for HIV, HBV and HCV. Upon enrollment within seven days of starting their anti-TB treatment, active TB patients provided their first blood sample, followed by a second blood sample two months after initial diagnosis. Acute dengue fever and previously infected samples were classified by detection of virus (PCR+) and/or dengue-specific IgM and IgG in the serum. Laboratory parameters such as platelet and leukocyte counts, hematocrit, hemoglobulin, AST, ALT and if applicable an ultrasound examination of the chest and abdomen or an X-ray were used to further diagnose patients with either dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a more severe form of disease, according to WHO’s guidelines. Longitudinal Tdap booster vaccination samples were obtained from individuals vaccinated in childhood, and boosted with the DTP vaccine Tdap (Adacel). Blood samples were collected prior, one day, three days, seven days and fourteen days post boost. Longitudinal healthy samples were obtained from two consecutive bleeds of healthy adults, at seven days apart. For some latent TB and TB negative subjects, leukapheresis was performed instead of a whole blood donation in order to increase the number of PBMC obtained. Samples from Peru were exclusively collected by leukapheresis, whereas 65% of samples from San Diego were collected by leukapheresis (33 out of 51 subjects). No leukapheresis samples were collected in Sri Lanka. We have found no difference in T cell:monocyte complexes frequencies in samples collected by leukapheresis versus whole blood (data not shown), and have thus defined our cohorts based on TB diagnosis status (TB negative, latent TB or active TB), regardless of the blood draw technique. All blood samples were drawn in Lithium or Sodium heparin, except for the analysis of the effect of anti-coagulant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) where some healthy samples were also collected in EDTA.

To assess the effect of Fc-receptor blocking on the formation of T cell:monocyte complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), 2 μl of Trustain FcR blocking reagent (BioLegend) was added along with the antibodies. After two washes in staining buffer (PBS containing 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), cells were resuspended into 100–500 μl of staining Buffer, transferred into a 5 ml polypropylene FACS tube (BD Biosciences) and stored at 4°C protected from light for up to 4 hr until flow cytometry acquisition. Acquisition was performed on a BD LSR-II cell analyzer (BD Biosciences) or on a BD FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Compensation was realized with single-stained beads (UltraComp eBeads, eBiosciences) in PBS using the same antibody dilution as for the cell staining. Performance of both instruments were checked daily by the flow cytometry core at La Jolla Institute for Immunology with the use of CS and T beads (BD Biosciences), and PMT voltages were manually adjusted for optimum fluorescence detection on each time it was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging flow cytometry</title><p>For the visualization of CD3+CD14+ cells, frozen PBMC were thawed and stained with CD3-AF488 and CD14-AF647 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for antibody details) as described in the flow cytometry section above.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Circulating T cell-monocyte complexes are markers of immune perturbations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jos W van der Meer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claude Lambert (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report on the existence of monocytes and T-lymphocytes that are found complexed using the cell sorter. The interaction does not seem to occur as a classical immunological synapse, but rather as LFA1 ICAM1 interaction.</p><p>They provide evidence that this feature varies under different clinical conditions and that the most prevalent T-cell subset in the complex also varies. They also manage to define a new, convenient parameter based on biochemistry Ka calculation (although this parameter may not be easy to use in routine diagnosis). All together, the reviewers agree that this study is of high interest.</p><p>The major question however is whether there is convincing proof in the paper that this is indeed occurring in vivo (and thus in the blood stream) and it is not an ex-vivo artefact.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the critical issue whether this is an in-vivo or an ex-vivo phenomenon, it is amazing that the pre-analytical procedures are so poorly (i.e., not at all) described. What time of the day was the bleeding performed? How many were leukapheresis samples? Why leukapheresis? Which anticoagulants were used? What tubes were used? How long were the tubes at room temperature waiting to be processed? How long was the total procedure?</p><p>Probably the conditions were different in San Diego, Peru and Sri Lanka. These should also be reported.</p><p>2) In line with the criticism under point 1, data on the intra-individual variation and the effect of cryopreservation are lacking. It would be good to do a carefully controlled experiment in perhaps 3 volunteers, in which these individuals are bled on two separate days. Cells are processed immediately for FACS analysis and are cryopreserved for later testing. On the second occasion the cryopreserved cells are used as well as freshly processed cells from the second bleed. Ideally, the role of different anticoagulants (EDTA, heparin, citrate) could be assessed in the same setting.</p><p>3) The exact experimental conditions of the magnetic depletion (subsection “T cell:monocyte complexes are not the result of cryopreservation or PBMC isolation”) are also lacking in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>4) In the Materials and methods section a very poor description of the FCM procedures is given. No data about panel compositions, PMT setting, compensation, titrations etc. as well as composition of buffers are described. This is essential to check the value of data.</p><p>5) The stability of the complexed cells is not mentioned. Can the complexes be disrupted by pipetting or by (mild) sonification?</p><p>6) Conversely, do more complexes occur when a small dose of LPS or a bioactive cytokine is added in vivo for say 2-3 hours?</p><p>7) Although authors give arguments (also in Discussion) to underline their hypothesis of T cell-monocyte complexes, it cannot be excludes that the binding of the conjugates for immunophenotyping (the MoAb-fluorochrome) can be the result of the complex formation (as is known in studies of monocytes),. Fc-receptor binding may occur and result in capping of the adhesion molecules/receptors or non-specific binding as such. This should be ruled out and clarified.</p><p>8) The data show that cell-cell interaction can end in exchange of cellular material (in this case, CD14+ monocyte membrane fragments on T cells) This could certainly have something to do with &quot;trogocytosis&quot;, previously described by Hudrisier and co-workers (Daubeuf et al., 2010) This should be discussed.</p><p>9) Supplementary file 1 lists a number of MoAbs used in this study, but the gating when using these antibodies is not adequately shown. Furthermore, the reviewers would like to have additional information on antibodies, such as CD45 (for gating); CD36, CD64, CD33, CD163, CD68 (monocyte identification, CD14 is also expressed dimly on neutrophils); CD2, CD5, CD7, CD27 (T cells) etc.</p><p>10) The definition of memory T cells is not correct and the need in this study is not clearly documented.</p><p>11) Gating procedures do not seem to be correctly performed and will cause contamination of gates by non-target cells. No use of CD45/SS (eliminate debris, RBCs and platelets) and sequential back gating (to check the correct population of interest) is applied in the various figures. By example CD4 is dimly expressed on monocytes and should be excluded.</p><p>12) Ka is used to correct for variation in T cells and monocytes during immune processes, however the absolute amount of T-Mono complexes should be given and not only the frequencies. This may also explain why CD4+CD8+ and CD4-CD8, which represent relatively small populations, have high frequencies.</p><p>13) As such the higher amount of Ka frequencies in CD4+CD8+ (double positive) and CD4-CD8- (double negative) T cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 4) are not discussed and explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46045.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the critical issue whether this is an in-vivo or an ex-vivo phenomenon, it is amazing that the pre-analytical procedures are so poorly (i.e., not at all) described.

Some individuals from San Diego and all from Peru donated by leukapheresis since we needed a large number of cells for multiple studies under the same scope of understanding TB immunity. Leukapheresis typically results in 10x more PBMC as compared to a full unit blood draw (450ml=450 million PBMC, whereas leukapheresis typically yield ~5 billion PBMC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In line with the criticism under point 1, data on the intra-individual variation and the effect of cryopreservation are lacking.

Strikingly, whereas the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes was variable between individuals, it was highly stable over time within each individual, and this was true for both fresh and frozen PBMC (non-parametric spearman correlation r=1 and r=0.9 for fresh and frozen PBMC, respectively). In parallel, we have also compared the effect of the anti-coagulant used for blood collection, and we have found no differences in the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes between blood samples drawn with either EDTA or Heparin, in both fresh and frozen PBMC. Results have been reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B for the anti-coagulant comparison, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C for the longitudinal bleeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The exact experimental conditions of the magnetic depletion (subsection “T cell:monocyte complexes are not the result of cryopreservation or PBMC isolation”) are also lacking in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission.

Accordingly, we have now included a full detailed description of the flow cytometry procedures in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript (”Flow cytometry” section, and Supplementary file 1) including Ab panels/dilutions, centrifugation parameters, composition of staining buffers and acquisition parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The stability of the complexed cells is not mentioned. Can the complexes be disrupted by pipetting or by (mild) sonification?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we investigated various in vitro conditions in which we attempted to break down the cell-cell interaction in T cell:monocyte complexes. We assessed the effect of 4 ‘disruptive’ conditions on T cell:monocyte complexes frequency in frozen PBMC samples from 3 independent healthy individuals. In all 3 individuals tested, the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes was reduced after vigorous pipetting up/down or mild sonication, the strongest ‘destructive’ effect observed with the later condition. Incubation with RBC lysis buffer disrupted the T cell:monocyte complexes in 1 out of 3 individuals, while addition of high concentration of anti-chelating agent EDTA had no effect on their frequency. These results are reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) Conversely, do more complexes occur when a small dose of LPS or a bioactive cytokine is added</italic> in vivo <italic>for say 2-3 hours?</italic> </p><p>During the course of this project, we have on several occasions attempted to promote the formation of T cell:monocyte complexes in vitro, by incubating PBMC with various concentrations of highly antigenic stimuli including LPS, SEB or PHA, as well as live pathogens such as live BCG. Our length of stimulation was variable from as little as 2h, to as long as 5 days. In none of these attempts did the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes increase after stimulation. If anything, we saw a trend for a lower frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes over time, in particular in the unstimulated samples, suggesting the process of cell culture in itself might impact their frequency. Since monocytes (and thus likely T cell:monocyte complexes) are known to stick to plastic from plates used for cell culture, these experiments are not conclusive. While we agree that it would be of interest to set up an in vitro model that promote the formation of T cell:monocyte complexes and allows to reliably quantifying them, potentially through the use of non-sticky cell culture consumables or post culture detaching protocols specific to monocytes, this will require more carefully designed experiments, which goes beyond the scope of this current manuscript revision.. Nevertheless, we have included the following sentence in the Results section in the revised manuscript: “Conversely, we tried to promote their in vitro formation by stimulating PBMC for two hours to several days, with various concentrations of highly antigenic stimuli (such as LPS, PHA, SEB or live BCG) without success, which might be due to issues with monocytes attaching to the culture plates (data not shown).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Although authors give arguments (also in Discussion) to underline their hypothesis of T cell-monocyte complexes, it cannot be excludes that the binding of the conjugates for immunophenotyping (the MoAb-fluorochrome) can be the result of the complex formation (as is known in studies of monocytes),. Fc-receptor binding may occur and result in capping of the adhesion molecules/receptors or non-specific binding as such. This should be ruled out and clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>To rule out that non-specific binding of antibody conjugates used for flow cytometry staining could be the result of complex formation, we compared the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes obtained from frozen PBMC in the presence or absence of a Fc-receptor binding reagent. No difference in T cell:monocyte complexes frequencies was observed when blocking Fc-receptor binding of conjugated antibodies. The results are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The data show that cell-cell interaction can end in exchange of cellular material (in this case, CD14+ monocyte membrane fragments on T cells) This could certainly have something to do with &quot;trogocytosis&quot;, previously described by Hudrisier and co-workers (Daubeuf et al., 2010) This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that some CD3+CD14mid cells might well be the result of T cells that have acquired some monocyte membrane fragments after interaction. We have thus incorporated the concept of trogocytosis in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Supplementary file 1 lists a number of MoAbs used in this study, but the gating when using these antibodies is not adequately shown. Furthermore, the reviewers would like to have additional information on antibodies, such as CD45 (for gating); CD36, CD64, CD33, CD163, CD68 (monocyte identification, CD14 is also expressed dimly on neutrophils); CD2, CD5, CD7, CD27 (T cells) etc.</p></disp-quote><p>An additional column has now been incorporated in Supplementary file 1, specifying for each MoAb, the figure in which it was used to generate the data. As for the gating, the gating strategy to identify T cell:monocyte complexes was consistent throughout the manuscript, as represented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Whenever another gating strategy was used (for instance to detail CD3+CD14hi and CD3+CD14mid, or when CD45-SSC gating was used), this is clearly mentioned in both text and figure legends, and the alternative gating strategy is available in supplemental figures. To improve clarity, we have now included the following sentence in the Results section of the revised manuscript: “For the remaining of the manuscript, we refer to T cell:monocyte complexes as the CD3+CD14+ population gated from live singlets cells, as represented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.” This was also specified in each figure’s legend.</p><p>The use of CD45 staining for better identification of T cell:monocytes complexes has been addressed and discussed later in essential revision point #11. For better identification of the nature of the T cell and monocyte present in the complexes, we analyzed the expression of various canonical markers for monocytes and T cells within T cell:monocyte complexes from healthy individuals. Monocytes in a complex (CD14+CD3+) vs. not in a complex (CD14+CD3-) had similar expression for monocyte canonical markers: CD33, CD36, CD64 and CD163. Similarly, no difference in the levels of expression of T cell canonical markers: CD2, CD5, CD7 and CD27, was observed between T cells in a complex (CD3+CD14+) vs. not in a complex (CD3+CD14-). Additionally, both CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets could be found in association with a monocyte, as well as naïve and memory phenotypes. Thus, there was no obvious T cell or monocyte marker that could differentiate between monocytes or T cells present in a complex vs. not in a complex, suggesting the ability to form complexes is a general property of all CD14+ monocytes and T cell subsets. Accordingly, these results have now been incorporated in Figures 3C-F of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The definition of memory T cells is not correct and the need in this study is not clearly documented.</p></disp-quote><p>The gating definition of memory CD4 T cells is following the standard cell ontology (including CD45RA-CCR7+ central memory T cells, CD45RA-CCR7- effector memory T cells and CD45RA+CCR7- effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA) and has been used by us and several others groups (Campion et al. PMID: 24958850, Becattini et al. PMID: 25477212, Tian et al. PMID: 29133794, Burel et al. PMID: 29602771). We acknowledge that recent findings suggest that this definition will exclude stem-cell like memory T cells, which present a ‘naïve’ CD45RA+CCR7+ phenotype. Considering that they represent a very small fraction of total CD4 T cells in the blood, we think it is unlikely that their inclusion would have changed the results obtained here. Additionally, we are reporting on our previous study of memory CD4 T cells in the context of latent TB infection as our first observation of the existence of CD3+CD14+ cells. This observation arose from the analysis of their transcriptomic profile, which contained some monocyte-associated genes consistently across all subjects analyzed, regardless of their TB infection status. The focus on this primary study was to define novel gene signatures that can distinguish between latent TB and TB negative subjects, and gain insights into the phenotype of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells. Because all Mtb-reactive CD4 T cells were expected to fall into the memory CD4 T cell compartment, this particular cell population was sorted to analyze their transcriptomic profile. In this new manuscript, we are solely referring to this dataset (and thus to memory CD4 T cells) as the starting point of our study, to explain our scientific rationale behind looking further into CD3+CD14+ cells. However, we think similar results would have been obtained by looking into other T cell subsets such as naïve CD4 T cells, or CD8 T cells. Indeed, we have found that both CD4 and CD8 T cells are able to form complexes with monocytes, and present both naïve and memory phenotypes (see essential revision point #9, Figure 3E-F). Accordingly, we have clarified the rationale behind looking at memory CD4 T cells in the Discussion (second paragraph) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Gating procedures do not seem to be correctly performed and will cause contamination of gates by non-target cells. No use of CD45/SS (eliminate debris, RBCs and platelets) and sequential back gating (to check the correct population of interest) is applied in the various figures. By example CD4 is dimly expressed on monocytes and should be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that the frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes was not affected by applying an initial CD45-SSC filtering to our gating strategy. Similarly, there was no difference between the density plots of CD3+ cells, CD14+ cells and CD3+CD14+ cells for any combination of A, H and W for both FSC and SSC parameters. Thus, our conclusion is that we could not find any parameter from conventional flow cytometry that could differentiate between singlets and T cell:monocyte complexes. These results have been incorporated in Figure 3A (for FSC/SSC parameters) and Figure 3B (for CD45-SSC gating) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As for the expression of CD4 in monocytes, we indeed observe a higher MFI for CD4 in monocytes (and in T cell:monocyte complexes) than for CD8+ T cells, but this does not preclude the breakdown into CD4/CD8 subsets, as seen in Figure 3E. Furthermore, CD4 is not being used in the upstream gating strategy to identify T cell:monocyte complexes, which is solely based on the expression of CD3 and CD14 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Thus, CD4 expression cannot impact T cell:monocyte frequencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Ka is used to correct for variation in T cells and monocytes during immune processes, however the absolute amount of T-Mono complexes should be given and not only the frequencies. This may also explain why CD4+CD8+ and CD4-CD8-, which represent relatively small populations, have high frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it would be of great interest to compare the absolute counts in complexes between our different disease cohorts. However, since no full blood counts were performed on the blood draws from any of these donors, it is unfortunately not possible to get absolute counts for any cell population, including T cell:monocyte complexes. Frequencies of T cell:monocyte complexes as percent of live cells are already included in Figure 4—figure supplement 4. Indeed, as predicted by the reviewers, we see a lower frequency of DPOS and DNEG T cell:monocyte complexes compared to CD4+ or CD8+ T cell:monocyte complexes, likely due to their low frequency within T cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 4D). However, interestingly their Ka is much higher than with single positive CD4 and CD8 T cells, especially for DNEG T cells (Figure 4F). This suggests that, despite of being in low abundance, DPOS and DNEG have a higher likelihood to form a complex with a monocyte. This information would have been missed by looking at frequencies only. This is the reason why we think the Ka is a more accurate parameter to measure the likelihood of in vivo formation of T cell:monocyte complexes (and correct for aleatory/random association). We acknowledge that this point might not have come across clearly in our first manuscript version and have thus emphasized it in the Results section “The frequency of T cell:monocyte complexes varies in the context of diverse immune perturbations” and in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) As such the higher amount of Ka frequencies in CD4+CD8+ (double positive) and CD4-CD8- (double negative) T cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and 4) are not discussed and explained.</p></disp-quote><p>A discussion on the enrichment for DNEG cells in T cell:monocyte complexes was included in the original manuscript submission. The enrichment for DPOS T cell:monocytes complexes was not mentioned in our original submission and is now discussed in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
