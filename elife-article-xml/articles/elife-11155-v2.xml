However, expansion of vertebrate 3'UTR functions has required a physical expansion of 3'UTR lengths, complicating the process of detecting nonsense mutations. We show that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) shields specific retroviral and cellular transcripts from NMD. When bound near a stop codon, PTBP1 blocks the NMD protein UPF1 from binding 3'UTRs. PTBP1 can thus mark specific stop codons as genuine, preserving both the ability of NMD to accurately detect aberrant mRNAs and the capacity of long 3'UTRs to regulate gene expression. Illustrating the wide scope of this mechanism, we use RNA-seq and transcriptome-wide analysis of PTBP1 binding sites to show that many human mRNAs are protected by PTBP1 and that PTBP1 enrichment near stop codons correlates with 3'UTR length and resistance to NMD.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11155.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11155.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11155.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are used as templates to create molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA) that contain all the information needed to make a protein. This information begins with a 'start site' and ends with a 'stop site.' The regions of the mRNA outside of the start and stop sites are called untranslated regions.</p><p>Not all mRNAs are correctly made, and cells combat this problem by detecting and destroying faulty mRNAs before they are translated into protein. One way cells do this is by recognizing and destroying mRNAs that include long untranslated regions, which can indicate that the mRNA might have a stop site too early in its sequence. A key problem with this mechanism, however, is that long untranslated regions also serve important roles in the cell: for example, by determining where and when mRNA molecules are read to make protein. How then do mRNAs with long but important untranslated regions escape detection and degradation?</p><p>Ge et al. have now investigated this question using an approach that allows a 'handle' to be attached to particular RNA molecules. This allows the RNA and any proteins bound to it to be purified away from all other RNAs and proteins in the cell, and the proteins can then be identified by a technique called mass spectrometry.</p><p>Ge at al. found that mRNAs can recruit a protein called PTBP1 to part of the RNA sequence near the stop site. This prevents an RNA decay protein recognizing and triggering the degradation of the mRNA, even if the mRNA has a long untranslated region.</p><p>Thus, PTBP1 plays a crucial role in protecting human RNAs with long untranslated regions from destruction by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. Some viral RNAs are also able to evade decay, and so Ge et al. hypothesize that the virus stole this method for maintaining its RNAs from host cells. A future goal is to understand whether this system works the same way in all cell types or protects different RNAs in different cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11155.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11155.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PTBP1</kwd><kwd>Rous sarcoma virus</kwd><kwd>retrovirus</kwd><kwd>nonsense-mediated mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>3'UTR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM103297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beemon</surname><given-names>Karen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA048746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beemon</surname><given-names>Karen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogg</surname><given-names>J Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA-binding protein PTBP1 is recruited to sites near stop codons in retroviral and human mRNAs, shielding them from detection and degradation by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an evolutionarily conserved co-translational mRNA turnover pathway responsible for degrading diverse eukaryotic mRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schweingruber et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to its well-known role in detecting aberrant transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs), NMD has also been shown to target a broad range of cellular mRNAs under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lelivelt and Culbertson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mendell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rehwinkel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weischenfeldt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weischenfeldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Longman et al., 2013</xref>), including those with spliced introns downstream of the TC, upstream open reading frames (uORFs), or long 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs). Together, the pathway is commonly estimated to regulate 5–10% of all human genes. NMD thus has an enormous impact on the human transcriptome in all cells, while also performing a surveillance role that modulates the phenotypic consequences of numerous human genetic diseases arising from nonsense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keeling et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A core set of dedicated NMD proteins works in conjunction with general mRNA metabolism and translation factors to accurately select and degrade specific mRNAs. The superfamily I RNA helicase UPF1 is the focal point of the NMD pathway, with characterized functions throughout the process of target discrimination, translational repression, RNase recruitment, and post-decay RNP remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czaplinski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hogg and Goff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Okada-Katsuhata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unterholzner and Izaurralde, 2004</xref>). UPF2 and UPF3B stimulate UPF1’s ATPase and decay-promoting activities and serve as a physical link between UPF1 and the exon junction complex (EJC), a strong activator of decay in vertebrate NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamieh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Le Hir et al., 2001</xref>). Interaction of UPF1 with release factors eRF1/3 at the terminating ribosome promotes phosphorylation of UPF1 by the SMG1 kinase, which in turn mediates recruitment and/or activity of the SMG6 endonuclease, the SMG5/7 complex, and decapping and deadenylation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jonas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Loh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakrabarti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glavan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huntzinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kashima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nicholson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohnishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Okada-Katsuhata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eberle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Unterholzner and Izaurralde, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The UPF1 helicase domain forms an extensive surface for high-affinity, sequence-nonspecific RNA binding, allowing the protein to associate with the full diversity of NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiorini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kurosaki et al., 2014</xref>). Elongating ribosomes can disrupt UPF1’s promiscuous RNA binding activity, leading to preferential UPF1 accumulation on 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hogg and Goff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zund et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously proposed that this property of UPF1 effectively allows it to sense 3’UTR length, predisposing transcripts containing long 3’UTRs to decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hogg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hogg and Goff, 2010</xref>). This model is supported by recent comprehensive analysis of UPF1 targets demonstrating correlations among mRNA 3’UTR length, UPF1 association, and de-repression of gene expression following NMD inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Extensive experiments in several eukaryotic model systems have established a tight link between 3’UTR length and decay susceptibility, suggesting a conserved mechanistic basis for NMD target selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amrani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buhler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muhlrad and Parker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singh et al., 2008</xref>). Directly probing the relationship between 3’UTR length and NMD-sensitivity in human cells, systematic analyses of reporter transcripts revealed a progressive UPF1-dependent decrease in mRNA half-life with increasing 3’UTR length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buhler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberle et al., 2008</xref>). While global correlations between 3’UTR length and NMD susceptibility have been described in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mendell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yepiskoposyan et al., 2011</xref>), these studies have been complicated by the fact that a large number of eukaryotic transcripts with long 3’UTRs appear to evade NMD through as-yet-unknown mechanisms. This is particularly true in human cells, in which the average 3’UTR length has evolved to exceed that necessary to induce NMD of reporter transcripts. Indeed, several TC-proximal human mRNA sequences capable of protecting mRNAs from NMD have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toma et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, mechanisms to protect specific mRNAs from NMD are likely to be a major force shaping human gene expression.</p><p>Retroviruses have long served as excellent model systems to explore the functions of host mRNA processing, translation, and decay pathways. As a consequence of evolutionary pressures to maximize the coding potential of compact RNA genomes, retroviral RNAs possess features that are predicted to be targeted by host cell RNA surveillance machineries, including long 3’UTRs, multiple open reading frames, and retained introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolinger and Boris-Lawrie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Withers and Beemon, 2011</xref>). Consequently, some retroviruses have developed protein-based protective mechanisms against NMD to ensure RNA integrity and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mocquet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakano et al., 2013</xref>). Of known cellular or viral mechanisms for NMD evasion, the most extensively characterized is a cis-acting RNA sequence found in the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), designated the RNA stability element (RSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrigo and Beemon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker and Beemon, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1994</xref>). The RSE is a 400-nt element located immediately downstream of the <italic>gag</italic> TC in the unspliced RSV viral RNA that robustly protects the viral RNA from UPF1-dependent decay in chicken cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Quek and Beemon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weil and Beemon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Withers and Beemon, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">2011</xref>). Despite thorough studies of the RSE structure and function, its mechanism of action has remained unclear.</p><p>Here, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the ability of the RSE to protect mRNAs from NMD and show that numerous human transcripts containing long 3’UTRs also exploit this strategy to maintain stability. By affinity purifying endogenously assembled mRNPs containing the RSE, we identify the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) as the key mediator of RSE function. We show that mutations preventing PTBP1 binding to the RSE abolish protection from NMD, while artificial recruitment of PTBP1 immediately downstream of an NMD-triggering TC recapitulates RSE activity. Together, our findings indicate that PTBP1 functions to exclude UPF1 from 3’UTRs, disrupting its ability to accurately discriminate 3’UTR length and induce decay. Furthermore, we performed RNA-seq analysis on human cells depleted of PTBP1 and UPF1 together and in isolation to identify endogenous transcripts with long 3’UTRs protected from NMD by PTBP1. Transcriptome-wide analysis of PTBP1 interaction sites reveals preferential binding of PTBP1 near TCs, a binding pattern correlated with 3’UTR length and resistance to NMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The RSE protects mRNAs from NMD in human cells</title><p>We first set out to test whether the avian retrovirus-derived RSE retains its anti-NMD function in human cells, reasoning that the ability to function in highly divergent vertebrates would imply a conserved mechanism for mRNA stabilization. For these studies, we used tetracycline (tet)-regulated reporter mRNAs containing a β-globin mini-gene and the SMG5 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singh et al., 2008</xref>). The SMG5 3’UTR triggers NMD as part of an extensive program of autoregulation by the NMD pathway, in a manner proposed to be due to its length (1342 nt; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yepiskoposyan et al., 2011</xref>). We inserted the 400 nt RSE sequence or a control sequence of the same length (the antisense RSE sequence, AS-RSE) into the reporter mRNAs immediately downstream of the TC, mimicking the natural context of the RSE in the RSV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To assess the specific antagonistic activity of the RSE against NMD, constructs encoding reporter mRNAs were co-transfected with a vector constitutively expressing a control RNA into 293 Tet-off cells treated with control or anti-UPF1 siRNAs. The expression of the tet-regulated mRNAs was induced for 4 hr before transcription was inhibited by addition of doxycycline, and mRNA decay was monitored at the indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Transcripts containing only the SMG5 3’UTR exhibited a half-life of ~120 min in cells treated with control siRNAs, in agreement with its previous characterization as an NMD substrate. Transcripts containing the RSE were substantially more stable (half-life ~400 min) than transcripts containing the AS-RSE sequence (&lt;120 min), confirming the protective activity of the RSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). In contrast, in cells depleted of UPF1, all transcripts had half lives of greater than 240 min, indicating that the observed decay in siNT-treated cells was due to the activity of UPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower panel).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11155.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The RSE protects reporter mRNA from NMD in mammalian cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the Rous sarcoma proviral genome.

Indeed, the RSE retained the capacity to antagonize UPF1 binding in the absence of translation termination events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In addition to its established role in alternative splicing, PTBP1 has been implicated as an RNA stability factor (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Romanelli et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, as expected for a protein responsible for protecting specific mRNAs, PTBP1 has been found to be preferentially associated with long 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gama-Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, a variety of techniques have been used to characterize the interaction specificity of PTBP1 and establish that the protein’s four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) each contribute to binding of degenerate pyrimidine-rich sequences. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments indicate that PTBP1 binding is driven both by high-affinity heptameric or hexameric motifs and by local enrichment of pyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Indicative of the potential for robust PTBP1 binding, examination of the RSE sequence revealed as many as eleven CU-rich clusters corresponding to putative PTBP1 binding sites spread throughout the 400 nt element. This includes three instances of CU-rich hexameric sequences identified as over-represented in PTB CLIP sequence tags, as well as five additional clusters containing heptamers enriched in CLIP tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; see Materials and methods for sequences). Therefore, we predicted that multiple PTBP1 molecules might be recruited to RSE-containing mRNPs, forming an RNP refractory to UPF1 association.</p><p>To test this idea, we constructed two RSE sequence variants. First, we mutated all putative PTBP1 binding sites in the RSE by replacing a subset of U and C residues in CU-rich clusters with G and A residues, respectively (RSE-ΔPTB; see Materials and methods for sequences). Next, we inserted six previously characterized PTBP1 binding sites into the RSE-ΔPTB sequence at arbitrary positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xue et al., 2009</xref>), with ~60 nt between each site (RSE-ΔPTB+6xPTBBS). The wild-type RSE and the RSE mutants were inserted into reporter mRNAs upstream of the artificial GAPDH-derived 3’UTR, and the extent of PTBP1 association with the reporter transcripts was assayed by monitoring the co-purification of reporter mRNAs with immunopurified endogenous PTBP1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and C</xref>, PTBP1 association with the RSE-ΔPTB-containing transcripts was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type RSE-containing transcripts. Reintroducing six PTBP1 binding sites into the RSE-ΔPTB led to recovery of PTBP1 association to levels similar to those found in association with the wild-type RSE. </p><p>We next investigated whether UPF1 binding was affected by eliminating the putative PTBP1 binding sites in the RSE sequence. To test the possibility that PTBP1 binding causes exclusion of UPF1 from the mRNP, we assayed the co-purification of the same reporter mRNAs with immunopurified endogenous UPF1. Northern blots of co-purified mRNAs indicated transcripts containing the RSE-ΔPTB sequence displayed substantially increased UPF1 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and C</xref>). The inverse relationship between PTBP1 and UPF1 association is consistent with our hypothesis that PTBP1 prevents UPF1 from associating with the 3’UTRs. Interestingly, although the level of UPF1 association on the transcripts containing RSE-ΔPTB+6xPTBBS is significantly reduced compared to RSE-ΔPTB, it was still higher than that of the wild-type RSE, indicating that the natural arrangement of the PTBP1 binding sites in the RSE may be optimal for antagonizing UPF1 binding. As a control to ensure that the PTBP1-mediated inhibition of UPF1 binding was due to cellular interactions rather than a consequence of protein-RNA reassortment in extracts, we further tested the ability of stably expressed tandem protein A-tagged UPF1 to co-purify mRNAs expressed in distinct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mili and Steitz, 2004</xref>). In these experiments, we observed co-purification of mRNAs when tagged UPF1 and mRNAs were expressed in the same cells, but none when reporter RNA-containing extracts from cells lacking tagged protein were mixed with extracts containing tagged UPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1E)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PTBP1 binding sites promote accumulation of RSV RNAs in chicken cells</title><p>As the physiological role of the RSE is the stabilization of unspliced RSV RNAs, we investigated the role of PTBP1 in stabilization of authentic viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Most importantly, the population of mRNAs that were both significantly down-regulated by siPTBP1 treatment and rescued by co-depletion of PTBP1 and UPF1 exhibited an even greater median length of 1843 nt. Together, these data suggest that protection of human mRNAs containing long 3’UTRs by PTBP1 is widely exploited to minimize the impact of NMD on the transcriptome.</p><p>To verify the response of endogenous transcripts to depletion of PTBP1 and UPF1 alone and in combination, we selected a panel of transcripts for follow-up analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). These experiments confirmed that several mRNAs identified in RNA-seq analyses were down-regulated by PTBP1 depletion and fully or partially rescued by co-depletion of PTBP1 and UPF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Importantly, PTBP1 mRNA levels were equal in the PTBP1 and PTBP1/UPF1 double knockdown conditions. Incomplete rescue of PTBP1-dependent mRNAs via UPF1 depletion could either be due to PTBP1 antagonizing multiple RNA decay pathways or due to insufficient UPF1 knockdown for complete abrogation of NMD activity. As alterations in RNA stability could be caused by changes in PTBP1-dependent alternative splicing events, we also examined the RNAseq data for evidence of altered splicing.

In line with a role for PTBP1 in protecting potential NMD substrates, transcripts with PTBP1 CLIP peaks centered within the first 200 nt of the TC had longer 3’UTRs than those lacking peaks near the TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As a control, mRNAs with PTBP1 CLIP peaks centered between 200 and 500 nt from the TC exhibited no tendency to contain longer 3’UTRs than normal. Most importantly, mRNAs with PTBP1 peak centers within 200 nt of the TC were significantly less likely to be up-regulated upon UPF1 knockdown than mRNAs without TC-proximal peaks, indicating that this population of PTBP1-bound mRNAs is insensitive to NMD under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). To avoid potential confounding effects of differences in 3’UTR lengths among distinct transcript classes, we used mRNAs with 3’UTRs falling between the 25th and 75th percentile of all 3’UTR lengths for these analyses (mRNAs with 3’UTRS from 484–2251 nt). Providing further evidence of the importance of PTBP1 binding position relative to the terminating ribosome, mRNAs with PTBP1 CLIP peaks centered from 200 to 500 nt from the TC showed no significant trend toward protection from NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We further corroborated this analysis by examining the effect of UPF1 depletion on transcripts containing high-affinity PTBP1 binding sites near the TC. Using this approach, we found evidence that PTBP1 hexamer binding sites located in the immediate vicinity of the terminating ribosome are particularly important in determining protection from UPF1-mediated degradation. Specifically, transcripts containing PTBP1 hexamers within 50 nt of the TC were significantly less likely to be up-regulated upon UPF1 depletion than transcripts lacking putative binding sites in this interval, while transcripts with hexamers located 50–100 from the TC showed no apparent protection from NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that human mRNAs have evolved to avoid recognition and degradation by the NMD machinery by recruiting PTBP1 to the vicinity of TCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through a combination of functional and biochemical assays, we have shown that the RSE functions through PTBP1 to inhibit NMD. This activity is associated with a reduction in UPF1 binding to transcripts containing long 3’UTRs, an early event in the process of NMD. In our model, the RSE and PTBP1 effectively mask the true length of the downstream 3’UTR from UPF1, allowing the mRNA to elude surveillance. The ability of PTBP1 to antagonize UPF1 binding depends on its location on the mRNA; PTBP1 binding at the beginning of the 3’UTR causes a loss of UPF1 binding, while relocation to distal sites reduces this function. This position-dependence has the advantage of allowing stabilization in response to translation termination at the proper stop codon while preserving the ability of NMD to detect premature TCs. In contrast, a position-insensitive mechanism would prevent NMD from accurately detecting de novo nonsense mutations, reducing the scope of quality control.</p><p>In its role as a splicing regulator, PTBP1 functions in a partially redundant manner with its close paralogs, PTBP2 and PTBP3/ROD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>). In many human cell types, including those used for this study, depletion of PTBP1 leads to induction of PTBP2, which compensates for a subset of PTBP1 functions. As it possesses highly similar biochemical activities, PTBP2 may also stabilize a subset of mRNAs usually protected by PTBP1, meaning that the population of mRNAs identified here as protected from NMD is likely to underestimate the role of PTB paralogs in NMD inhibition. In addition, we expect that marking genuine TCs with PTBP1 is just one strategy employed by long 3’UTRs to evade NMD. Supporting the existence of diverse solutions to the problem, yeast Pub1p was found to stabilize certain NMD targets by means that remain undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruiz-Echevarria and Peltz, 2000</xref>), and manipulation of 3’UTR structure to bring the poly-A tail in spatial proximity to the TC has been shown to stabilize reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberle et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Extensive work on the role of PTB proteins in mediating exon exclusion in pre-mRNA splicing provides a template for a proposed mechanism for PTBP1’s anti-UPF1 activity. PTBP1 contains four RRMs, each with affinity for CU-containing sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oberstrass et al., 2005</xref>). Of these, RRM3 and RRM4 are oriented back-to-back, resulting in RNA loops of 15 nt or more between sites of PTBP1 contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamichhane et al., 2010</xref>). These short-range looping events may also be accompanied by capture of distant CU-rich sequences by individual RRMs forming larger looped RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clerte and Hall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kafasla et al., 2009</xref>). It has been suggested that long-range interactions involving multiple PTBP1 molcules bound to a single RNA may be responsible for excluding binding of splicing factors, resulting in splicing repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamichhane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, PTBP1 may interact with proteins such as MATRIN 3 to promote the assembly of higher-order repressive complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>). By direct analogy to its role in splicing, PTBP1 assembled on multiple TC-proximal CU-rich sequences could thus result in a zone of UPF1 exclusion, preventing the initial assembly of UPF1 into mRNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition to preventing initial UPF1 association with 3’UTRs, PTBP1 could affect UPF1 already bound to an mRNA. In this scenario, PTBP1 may, as has been recently described for cytoplasmic poly-A binding protein, stimulate ATPase-dependent dissociation of UPF1 from the mRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11155.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for NMD inhibition by PTBP1.</title><p>In the absence of the RSE or other sequences capable of recruiting PTBP1, UPF1 binds 3’UTRs in a length-dependent manner, potentiating NMD (top). PTBP1 can bind the RSE at multiple sites throughout the 400 nt sequence. This establishes an mRNP structure in the vicinity of the stop codon that is refractory to UPF1 binding, possibly by (1) blocking 5’-3’ translocation of UPF1 or (2) preventing initial binding of UPF1 to the mRNA. The NMD pathway thus judges the 3’UTR to be short and fails to degrade the mRNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11155.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11155.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11155-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>The PTB family of proteins is a pioneering example of the coupling of alternative splicing regulation with NMD. A series of studies has elucidated a complex regulatory network in which PTBP1 and PTBP2 auto- and cross-regulate each other to favor production of PTC-containing transcripts that are efficiently degraded by NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markovtsov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Romanelli et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rahman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wollerton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Spellman et al., 2007</xref>). In most tissues, PTBP1 regulates the alternative splicing of PTBP2 to favor production of PTC-containing transcripts that are efficiently degraded by NMD. In the brain and testes, PTBP1 is down-regulated, allowing increased expression of PTBP2 and execution of tissue-specific splicing programs. As in their roles in alternative splicing, we expect that PTBP1 and PTBP2 may stabilize partially overlapping sets of potential NMD substrates in distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and Oligonucleotides</title><p>Wild-type RSE, RSE mutants, anti-sense RSE, and SMG5-397 sequences were amplified by PCR from the E/S wild-type RSV vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Withers and Beemon, 2011</xref>), pcTET2-βwt-SMG5 (Jens Lykke-Andersen, UCSD) or synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and inserted into reporter mRNAs at the <italic>Not</italic>I site of pcTET2-βwt-SMG5, pcTET2-βwt-GAPDH, or pcTET2-βwt-GAPDH-AdML or the <italic>Bam</italic>HI (5’) or <italic>Pme</italic>I (3’) sites of pcDNATPEGFP-GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hogg and Goff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singh et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the Hogg lab reports a role for the hnRNP protein, PTBP1, in binding to long 3'UTRs of target mRNAs leading to the exclusion of UPF1 and resulting in protection from the NMD response. This is an original and well-written manuscript that tests an interesting hypothesis and identifies PTBP1 as an NMD suppressor. The referees asked for the following experiments to more strongly support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The effects are relatively weak. One way to strengthen the conclusions will be to insert PTBP1 binding sites downstream of nonsense codons in well characterized NMD reporters (e.g., β-globin or TCR-β), that are efficiently degraded by NMD or to tether PTBP1 downstream of a stop codon.</p><p>2) The evidence for the competition for mRNA binding model relies on the RNA-IP data. However, no X-linking was involved in the protocol and the authors cannot rule out about post-lysis rearrangements possibly confounding the results (as described by Mili and Steitz). The authors should perform control experiments to test the extent of such rearrangements in their assays.</p><p>3) To use the GFP-bGH construct for normalization seems inadequate, since the authors mention that this binds very little UPF1. Thus, there is the risk that one normalizes against essentially unspecific background signal. The authors should use instead a construct for normalization that is known to associate abundantly with UPF1.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The data for UPF3b is not convincing. In panel A, the increase in RNA abundance between NT and siUPF1 is about the same as the difference between siPTBP1 and siPTBP1/siUPF1, suggesting that the UPF1-induced increase is independent of PTBP1.

One way to strengthen the conclusions will be to insert PTBP1 binding sites downstream of nonsense codons in well characterized NMD reporters (e.g., β-globin or TCR-β), that are efficiently degraded by NMD or to tether PTBP1 downstream of a stop codon.</italic> In the revised manuscript, we further bolster the evidence that PTBP1 is a potent inhibitor of NMD in two ways. First, we show that the RSE is able to abrogate NMD stimulated by the exon junction complex, using an established NMD reporter undergoing efficient decay due to a spliced intron downstream of the termination codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; GAPDH-AdML reporter from Singh et al. 2008). We employed this reporter after initial attempts to incorporate PTBP1 binding sites downstream of the classic “β-globin 39” premature termination codon led to aberrant splicing. As both the β-globin 39 and GAPDH-AdML reporters undergo NMD stimulated by a single downstream intron, these reporters are functionally similar. Second, we demonstrate that PTBP1 recruited via the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein stabilizes NMD target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Further, it is important to note that we show that the RSE/PTBP1 can completely protect two well-studied, physiologically important NMD targets (SMG5 and the Rous sarcoma virus unspliced mRNAs) from decay.</p><p><italic>2) The evidence for the competition for mRNA binding model relies on the RNA-IP data. However, no X-linking was involved in the protocol and the authors cannot rule out about post-lysis rearrangements possibly confounding the results (as described by Mili and Steitz). The authors should perform control experiments to test the extent of such rearrangements in their assays.</italic> To address the possibility that the observed ability of PTBP1 to inhibit UPF1 binding to mRNAs was due to RNA-protein interactions formed in cell extracts, we performed experiments in which extracts containing tagged UPF1 were mixed with extracts produced from cells expressing exogenous reporter mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Whereas affinity purification of tagged UPF1 efficiently recovered co-expressed mRNAs, we observed no co-purification of UPF1 with mRNAs expressed in distinct cells. These data suggest that the interactions assayed by immunoprecipitation reflect genuine cellular interactions and are not the result of post-lysis re-assortment.</p><p><italic>3) To use the GFP-bGH construct for normalization seems inadequate, since the authors mention that this binds very little UPF1. Thus, there is the risk that one normalizes against essentially unspecific background signal. The authors should use instead a construct for normalization that is known to associate abundantly with UPF1.</italic> </p><p>For the post-lysis mixing experiments described in 2), we also used mRNAs containing a longer, NMD-sensitive artificial GAPDH 3’UTR as the basis for calculating relative recovery of mRNAs in the presence and absence of PTBP1 binding sites. This approach resulted in quantification of relative recovery of RSE variant mRNAs relative to each other and to the unmodified GAPDH 3’UTR indistinguishable from that observed in experiments using the shorter bGH-derived 3’UTR. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that using the GFP-bGH mRNAs as recovery controls gives results that are highly consistent with the orthogonal approach of tagged mRNA affinity purification (see Hogg and Goff, 2010).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The data for UPF3b is not convincing. In panel A, the increase in RNA abundance between NT and siUPF1 is about the same as the difference between siPTBP1 and siPTBP1/siUPF1, suggesting that the UPF1-induced increase is independent of PTBP1. Furthermore, panel B should be completed with a determining the half-lives of these two constructs under PTB and UPF1 knockdown.</italic></p><p>Due to the relatively small effects of deleting putative PTBP1 binding sites from the UPF3B 3’UTR and the technical difficulty of mRNA decay assays incorporating RNAi-mediated protein depletion, we were unable to use this approach to conclusively demonstrate that the observed differences in mRNA stability were due to protection from NMD. As this point is not central to the manuscript, we have removed the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> pending further study.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
