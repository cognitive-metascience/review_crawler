only the human-specific L1HS-Ta subfamily acts as an endogenous mutagen in modern humans, reshaping both somatic and germline genomes. Due to their high levels of sequence identity and the existence of many polymorphic insertions absent from the reference genome, the transcriptional activation of individual genomic L1HS-Ta copies remains poorly understood. Here we comprehensively mapped fixed and polymorphic L1HS-Ta copies in 12 commonly-used somatic cell lines, and identified transcriptional and epigenetic signatures allowing the unambiguous identification of active L1HS-Ta copies in their genomic context. Strikingly, only a very restricted subset of L1HS-Ta loci - some being polymorphic among individuals - significantly contributes to the bulk of L1 expression, and these loci are differentially regulated among distinct cell lines. Thus, our data support a local model of L1 transcriptional activation in somatic cells, governed by individual-, locus-, and cell-type-specific determinants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13926.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13926.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13926.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Retrotransposons, also known as jumping genes, have invaded the genomes of most living organisms. These fragments of DNA have the ability to move or copy themselves from one location of a chromosome to another. Depending on where they insert themselves, retrotransposons can modify the sequence of nearby genes, which can alter or even abolish their activity. Although these genetic modifications have contributed significantly to the evolution of different species, retrotransposons can also have detrimental effects; for example, by causing new cases of genetic diseases.</p><p>Adult human cells have a number of mechanisms that work to keep the activity of retrotransposons at a very low level. However, in many types of cancers retrotransposons escape these defense mechanisms and ‘jump’ actively. This is thought to contribute to the development and spread of cancerous tumors.</p><p>To understand how jumping genes are mobilized, a fundamental question must be answered: is the high jumping gene activity observed in some cell types a result of activating many copies of the retrotransposons, or only a few of them? This question has been difficult to address because there are more than one hundred copies of retrotransposons that could potentially move in humans, many of which have not even been referenced in the human genome map. Furthermore, each copy is almost identical to another one, making it difficult to discriminate between them.</p><p>Philippe et al. have now developed an approach that can map where individual retrotransposons are located in the genome of normal and cancerous cells and measure how active these jumping genes are. This revealed that only a very restricted number of them are active in any given cell type. Moreover, different subsets of jumping genes are active in different cell types, and their locations in the genome often do not overlap.</p><p>Thus, whether jumping genes are activated depends on the cell type and their position in the genome. These results are in contrast to the prevalent view that retrotransposons are activated in a more widespread manner across the genome, at least in cancerous cells. Overall, Philippe et al.’s findings pave the way towards characterizing the chromosome regions in which retrotransposons are frequently activated and understanding how they contribute to cancer and other diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13926.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13926.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

dispersed sequences called retrotransposons, a class of mobile genetic elements which proliferate via an RNA-mediated copy-and-paste mechanism termed retrotransposition (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns and Boeke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hancks and Kazazian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richardson et al., 2015</xref>] for recent reviews). Since most copies have accumulated mutations or are truncated, they are unable to initiate new cycles of retrotransposition and could be considered as molecular fossils (although in some cases they might nevertheless still be transcriptionally active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Macia et al., 2011</xref>]). In contrast, the youngest and human-specific L1 subfamily, 'transcribed L1, subset a' or L1HS-Ta, continues to retrotranspose and to accumulate in modern human genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boissinot et al., 2000</xref>). Hence, each individual has hundreds of additional copies not present in the reference genome, referred to as 'non-reference' L1HS-Ta, which contribute to our genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xing et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cordaux and Batzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ewing and Kazazian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iskow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kidd et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lupski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ewing and Kazazian, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ray and Batzer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mir et al., 2015</xref>). Recent advances in deep-sequencing technologies have also led to the discovery that L1HS-Ta are not only able to mobilize in the germline, in the early embryo and in embryonic stem cells - resulting in inheritable genetic variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Hurk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wissing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hancks and Kazazian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Macia et al., 2014</xref>) - but can also retrotranspose in some somatic tissues such as brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faulkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baillie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Evrony et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erwin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Upton et al., 2015</xref>), and in many epithelial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iskow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Solyom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shukla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodić and Burns, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pitkänen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Helman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tubio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ewing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rodić et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doucet-O'Hare et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paterson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The overall ability of L1 elements to retrotranspose presumably results from the balance between the activities of the L1 sequences themselves, and the effects of restricting cellular pathways. The first step required to initiate retrotransposition of a particular L1 instance is its transcriptional activation: this is primarily driven by an internal promoter located within the L1 5' UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Swergold, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Minakami et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tchénio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athanikar et al., 2004</xref>), but can be repressed by CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yoder et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourc'his and Bestor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muotri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wissing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castro-Diaz et al., 2014</xref>). Production of L1 RNA transcripts is essential both for the translation of L1-encoded proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, which are required for retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moran et al., 1996</xref>), and to act as a template for reverse transcription itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). After reverse transcription and genomic integration, the sequences of each L1 element can accumulate genetic alterations (mutations, deletions, insertion of nested transposable elements), and these can alter the intrinsic integrity and biochemical activity of these copies. As a result, only a fraction of L1 elements are retrotransposition-competent, even when cloned in a plasmid and tested in cellular assays, with their expression driven by a strong constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>). These so-called 'hot' L1 elements are highly enriched among the youngest L1HS-Ta insertions, which are polymorphic among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lupski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, additional cellular pathways and restriction factors can limit L1 activities at multiple other stages of the L1 retrotransposition cycle (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richardson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pizarro and Cristofari, 2016</xref>] for reviews).</p><p>Our understanding of L1 transcriptional activation, particularly in the context of different cell types, remains extremely limited. Indeed, studying this process is complicated by the extent of L1 insertional polymorphisms in individual genomes and the extreme level of sequence identity between the copies of the youngest (and most-active) L1HS-Ta subfamily and with older copies of retrotransposition-incompetent subfamilies. Theoretically, the high L1 activity observed in particular cell types could result from global unleashing of most L1HS-Ta copies. Alternatively, it could derive from a few deregulated L1HS-Ta instances. To resolve these competing models, we mapped the location of each L1HS-Ta element dispersed in the genome of a panel of normal and transformed human cells, identified a genomic signature for the transcriptionally active copies and investigated the contribution of each of them to the bulk of L1HS-Ta transcripts. We found that individual L1 instances exhibit both locus- and cell-type-specific activation, implying that L1 mutagenic activity originates from 'hot L1' inserted in permissive loci and suggesting an unforeseen new layer of cell-type specific regulation to control endogenous retrotransposons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global expression of recent L1 elements is variable in human cells</title><p>Human L1-derived RNA-transcripts and proteins, required for L1 retrotransposition, are detected in embryonic stem cells, in embryonal carcinoma cells, and other transformed cells or tumors, as well as in neuronal progenitor cells, but not in most primary cells, such as fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faulkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coufal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belancio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wissing et al., 2012</xref>).

These included 10 cell lines which have been characterized in depth as part of the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>), together with two others – the commonly used embryonic lung fibroblast line MRC-5, and the embryonic carcinoma cell line 2102Ep, which is known to express high levels of endogenous L1HS-Ta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leibold et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>As a first estimate of L1 activity, we quantified and compared the endogenous levels of the L1-encoded ORF1p protein in distinct cell-lines.

As expected, no ORF1p was detected in primary fibroblasts. ORF1p associates with the L1 mRNA, and L1 ORF2p, to form a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP), which mediates the retrotransposition reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kulpa and Moran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>). To ensure the highest sensitivity and to enrich for functional ORF1p (at least able to bind RNA), we prepared L1 RNPs by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and probed ORF1p by immunoblot. We observed similar results as in whole cell extracts, except that ORF1p was faintly detected in two additional transformed cell lines (HeLa S3, Hep G2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In a complementary approach, we estimated the proportion of L1 transcripts originating from the L1HS-Ta subfamily by counting RNA-seq reads mapped on the L1HS consensus sequence, which encompass subfamily-diagnostic SNPs in the L1 3' UTR sequence (ACA for L1HS-Ta, ACG for L1HS-PreTa and GAG for L1PA2 and older) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boissinot et al., 2000</xref>). For this analysis, publicly available data from the hESC line H1 were also included (no stranded polyA+ RNA-seq data were available for MRC-5 and HEK-293 cells). Consistent with L1 RNP quantification, MCF7 and 2102Ep cells exhibit the highest levels of L1HS-Ta RNA-seq tags.

As a first step, we mapped the genomic location of all L1HS-Ta elements in each cell line of our panel. To achieve this task, we adapted for deep sequencing an existing method termed ATLAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badge et al., 2003</xref>). In brief, ATLAS-seq relies on the random mechanical fragmentation of the genomic DNA to ensure high-coverage, ligation of adapter sequences, suppression PCR-amplification of L1HS-Ta element junctions, and Ion Torrent sequencing using single-end 400 bp read chemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>, see also Materials and methods section). A notable aspect of ATLAS-seq is that we combine amplification and mapping of L1 downstream flanking sequence as well as the L1 upstream flanking sequence of full length elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). This allows the unambiguous identification of full-length and potentially retrotransposition-competent genomic instances. In total, ATLAS-seq identified 7823 high-confidence L1HS-Ta insertions in the 12 cell lines analyzed, corresponding to 1633 distinct loci and including 358 full length elements (22%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">3</xref>). The human reference genome hg19 contains 485 L1HS-Ta insertions with a detectable 3' end. On average (± s.d.), each cell line contains 652 (±68) L1HS-Ta copies, including 178 (±12) full-length elements. Among them 393 (±10) are reference insertions, 179 (±18) are non-reference L1HS-Ta previously identified as L1 insertion polymorphisms and catalogued in euL1db (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mir et al., 2015</xref>), and 80 (±60) are novel insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). ATLAS-seq recovers 98% of the L1HS-Ta elements previously described as fixed in the human population (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), showing that this mapping approach is close to being comprehensive. To further validate the L1HS-Ta elements mapped by ATLAS-seq, we randomly selected and tested by PCR 72 non-reference insertions identified in HEK-293T cells with a broad range of supporting ATLAS-seq reads. Primers could be designed for 70/72 loci. We validated 66/70 of the tested L1HS-Ta, giving a true positive rate of 94% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). One fifth of the L1 loci are present in all tested cell lines and approximately 40% of them are present in only one of the cell lines.

Similarly, the L1 antisense promoter activity generates antisense transcripts extending into the upstream genomic region flanking the L1 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Speek, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cruickshanks and Tufarelli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rangwala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denli et al., 2015</xref>).

The first one is a reference L1HS-Ta element integrated in the <italic>TTC28</italic> gene (22q12.1). Uniquely mapped RNA-seq tags are detected both in the body of the L1 sequence and in the immediate downstream genomic region. However, read mapping is performed against the reference human genome; thus, reads mapping within the L1 body could originate either from this particular reference L1 copy or from a non-reference L1 copy integrated somewhere else in the genome, and are therefore not informative. The second example is a non-reference L1HS-Ta element inserted in the <italic>NEDD4</italic> gene (15q21.3) in opposite orientation. Again, a downstream RNA-seq peak immediately follows the insertion point. Interestingly, in both cases, we do not detect upstream antisense RNA-seq tags at the vicinity of these full-length L1HS-Ta copies, suggesting that sense and antisense L1 promoter activities - or the stability of their respective transcripts - are not necessarily coupled in a chromosomal environment, in agreement with previous results obtained from plasmid borne reporter assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macia et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence confirmed that the downstream RNA-seq peaks emanate from these L1 copies and not from other overlapping genic or non-genic transcripts, or from distinct L1 copies carrying a 3' transduction (see below). First, we observed H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks immediately upstream and adjacent to these L1 copies, a histone mark reflecting active or poised promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernstein et al., 2012</xref>). Although the H3K4me3 signal is expected to be centered on the internal promoter within each L1 copy, a region that is either non-uniquely mappable or not included in the reference genome sequence, the ChIP-seq signal can be readily detected in the flanking genomic sequence. Second, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of all L1HS-Ta transcripts, targeting the ORF1 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Two different ORF1 shRNAs greatly reduced the downstream RNA-seq signal when compared to a scrambled shRNA or to unmanipulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Together, these data indicate that downstream RNA-seq tags originate from the same transcriptional unit as the considered L1. Retrotransposition of L1 transcripts which include downstream genomic sequences can result in duplication of these sequences at the new insertion site, a phenomenon termed 3’-transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holmes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moran et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, it is possible, in principle, that downstream RNA-seq tags mapping to a particular L1HS-Ta copy could in fact emanate instead from a daughter copy with a 3' transduction, located elsewhere in the genome. However, the concomitant presence of an upstream H3K4me3 mark at many transcriptionally active L1 copies renders this situation very unlikely in most cases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>L1HS-Ta transcription originates from a small number of cell-type-specific loci</title><p>To obtain a comprehensive view of the transcriptional activities of individual L1 copies, we applied this integrative approach to all the full-length L1HS-Ta elements identified by ATLAS-seq in MCF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Strikingly, only 5 L1HS-Ta copies show relatively high expression, and approximately 15 more copies exhibit low but detectable levels of expression. In addition, only 4 L1HS-Ta loci show evidence of L1 antisense promoter activity, including instances that are distinct from the few copies expressing high levels of L1 sense transcripts, suggesting uncoupling and differential regulation between these two L1 promoter activities. Consistent with the examples described at the <italic>TTC28</italic> and <italic>NEDD4</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), transcribed L1HS-Ta loci at the genome-wide level have a dual fingerprint with upstream active chromatin marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) and Pol-II and downstream RNA-seq signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>); the latter being reduced upon shRNA-mediated L1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

Approximately 1/3 of all full-length L1HS-Ta copies were inserted in genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Although the proportion of expressed L1s in genes was slightly higher than that of non-expressed copies, the difference was not significant.

However, this proportion was not significantly different between expressed and non-expressed copies. Independently of their orientation relative to genes, we found that genes containing expressed L1 are often more expressed than those containing non-expressed L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), suggesting that highly expressed gene loci might represent a favorable genomic environment for L1 reactivation. Finally, it is conceivable that expressed L1 could be located in larger chromosomal regions having undergone massive amplification. To address this possibility, we looked whether L1 insertions were located in genomic regions showing copy number variations (CNVs). The majority of L1 copies were inserted in normal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>), whether they were expressed or not, and expressed L1 copies were not significantly enriched in amplified regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Many transcribed L1HS-Ta are retrotransposition-competent</title><p>Finally, we determined whether the top expressed L1HS-Ta elements identified as expressed in the panel of cell lines have the ability to achieve complete retrotransposition cycles and to generate new copies. To answer this question, we combined complementary strategies. First, we collated published data of retrotransposition assays in cultured cells obtained for different L1 instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>), and combined them with our own experimental results obtained with an additional newly-identified L1 copy following the same protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Second, we compared our set of highly-expressed L1HS-Ta copies with those which have been identified in earlier studies as mobilization-competent based on the detection of daughter copies with matching 3’-transduced sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tubio et al., 2014</xref>). Third, and most directly, we specifically searched for evidence of 3' transduction in our 3' ATLAS-seq data using split reads partly mapping downstream of two distinct L1HS-Ta copies (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We found that 5 out of the 20 most highly-expressed L1HS-Ta copies across all cell lines fulfill at least two of these criteria strongly supporting their ability to retrotranspose and 6 additional ones could be identified as progenitors of other, daughter copies. The remaining nine elements could also be retrotransposition-competent, but have not been tested in cultured assays, nor could daughter L1 copies be unambiguously identified.

This model is consistent with previous observations made on few L1 instances suggesting that the transcriptional activity of the L1 promoter might be influenced by its immediate upstream genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lavie et al., 2004</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13926.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic model showing the highly locus-specific and variable expression of L1HS-Ta elements among different somatic cell types and individuals.</title><p>The colored boxes correspond to L1HS-Ta copies, some being polymorphic (pink).

Hence, understanding the means by which L1s can escape regulation in particular cancers is vital in order to improve their rational use as biomarkers or to predict their possible effects on disease progression. Strikingly, our results indicate that – in the cancer cell-lines studied – the general cellular regulation of most L1 instances is unimpaired, even in cells exhibiting high L1 activity. Thus, it appears that shut-off of global L1-regulatory pathways is not a prerequisite for L1 activation in cancer. Instead, we find that only a very limited set of L1 copies, at specific genomic loci, become activated in cancer cells. We note that the presence or absence of polymorphic L1s at these permissive loci, and their degree of transcriptional activation, may represent risk factors for particular cancer types, and more specific biomarkers than global L1 expression or methylation status.</p><p>Furthermore, we provide here a unique resource consisting of near-complete maps of L1HS-Ta elements present in widely used normal and transformed model cell lines, for which the availability of genomic datasets is regularly increasing (including several tier-1 &amp; tier-2 cell-lines of the ENCODE project). These maps will be of broad utility in the future to address the impact and regulation of transposable elements in the human genome. Indeed, isolated RNA-seq and ChIP-seq signals resulting from the presence of non-reference L1 copies can only be correctly interpreted if such maps are available. Thus they can act as a platform to fully interpret and profit from the many expanding public datasets generated using the same cell lines.</p><p>Recently, whole genome sequencing of human tumors has revealed recurrent retrotransposition events stemming from a handful of source elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tubio et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the notion that only a fraction of all full-length L1 elements is actually capable of retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we have identified highly heterogeneous expression of individual L1HS-Ta copies, implicating L1 transcriptional activation as a key regulatory process which limits the mutagenic potential of L1 elements independently of their respective intrinsic biochemical activity. Therefore, we extend the concept of retrotransposition-competent L1 copies, previously described as 'hot L1s' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brouha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>), to the transcriptional regulation of each individual locus and cell type. We conclude that L1-mediated mutagenesis results from the reactivation of a small subset of permissive loci, only a fraction of which contains retrotransposition-competent elements, combined with a favorable cellular environment (<italic>i.e.</italic> diminished restriction factor and/or increased cofactor activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pizarro and Cristofari, 2016</xref>]). Several of these regulated loci are polymorphic with regards to the presence or absence of an L1 element among the human population, highlighting the role of genetic determinants in the global L1 mutagenic potential in a given individual. Overall, our data suggest that activation of L1 transcription in somatic cells is governed by individual-, locus-, and cell-type-specific determinants and provide a framework to study how distinct L1HS-Ta copies may be regulated by environmental, physiological and pathological triggers. Future work will determine the factors and cellular signaling pathways that contribute to the transcriptional reactivation of the different L1HS-Ta copies in somatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The cell lines used in this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Then we treated differently reads produced in 5’- and 3’-ATLAS-seq experiments.</p><p>For 3’-ATLAS reads, we first trimmed barcode sequence at the 5’ end, allowing only perfect matches using cutadapt (-e 0 -m 25 options) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin, 2011</xref>). Reads without detectable barcode or shorter than 25 bp after trimming were discarded. Second, we trimmed the suppression PCR linker from the 5’ end, allowing 5 errors maximum (-e 0.12 -m 25 options). Reads without detectable linker or shorter than 25 bp after trimming were discarded. Third, we removed low quality sequence at the read 3' end (Q&lt;12) and iteratively searched and trimmed at the read 3’ end: (i) the RB3PA1 primer, (ii) the L1 3’ end sequence, and (iii) a polyA sequence, using cutadapt (-e 0.12 -m 25 -q 12 -O 8 options). For each read, we recorded whether it was trimmed and which feature was trimmed. However, reads without detectable feature were not discarded since they most often corresponded to reads that did not reach the L1 junction.</p><p>For 5’-ATLAS-seq reads, since sequencing was initiated from the internal part of L1, we performed an initial size selection to remove reads that did not reach the junction (&lt;133 bp). Then, we iteratively searched and trimmed at the 5’ end: (i) the RB5PA2 primer, and (ii) the L1 5’ end sequence, followed by the ATLAS linker sequence at the 3’ end, using cutadapt (-e 0.12 -m 25 -q 12 options). Reads missing one of these features were discarded. Finally, we reverse complemented read sequence using the FASTX-Toolkit. The later step ensured that both 5’- and 3’-ATLAS reads started from the linker position, information necessary to remove PCR duplicates (see below). Hence, at the end of read preprocessing, all reads were oriented in a convergent manner toward the L1 element (from flanking sequence to L1 body).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Reads mapping and clustering</title><p>Trimmed reads were mapped to the hg19 human reference genome using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) program with the ‘mem’ algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>) (-t 4 -M options). Mapped reads were filtered to remove secondary alignment and ambiguously mapped reads (MAPQ≤20) using SAMtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2009</xref>) (samtools view with -q 20 -F 260 options). Then, PCR duplicate reads were removed with Picard tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>, MarkDuplicates function), keeping only the longest read as a representative. Reads were considered redundant if they started from the same linker position, which corresponds to the initial genomic DNA break during library preparation. However, it should be underlined that this procedure tends to underestimate the number of independent reads, particularly for clusters with an abundant number of reads. We next merged reads with the same orientation which overlapped or were separated by less than 100 bp into clusters using BEDtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) (bedtools merge with -s -d 100 options). In a given cluster, the vast majority of the reads ended or started at the same position (depending on the orientation of the insertion), which corresponded to the actual insertion site. The position of the putative L1 insertion was defined:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>for insertions in the sense orientation: as the most upstream 5' coordinate for 3' ATLAS clusters and the most downstream 3' coordinate for 5' ATLAS clusters.</p></list-item><list-item><p>for insertions in the antisense orientation: as the most downstream 3' coordinate for 3' ATLAS clusters and the most upstream 5' coordinate for 5' ATLAS clusters.</p></list-item></list><p>At the end of the clustering step, each putative insertion was characterized by a series of features: the genomic coordinates of its 3’ end, its orientation, a unique cluster ID, the number of non-redundant reads supporting the insertion, the number of supporting non-redundant reads for which the RB3PA1, L1 and/or polyA sequences were trimmed, the total number of reads supporting the insertion. We also calculated normalized versions of the counts (RPM, read per million of mapped reads for redundant reads; TPM, tags per million of mapped reads for non-redundant reads only).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Annotating putative insertions with 5’ATLAS clusters, with known L1 insertions and relation with genes</title><p>We annotated each putative insertion with a number of features using BEDtools 'closest' function, with a feature-specific window. To identify putative full-length elements, we matched 5'-ATLAS cluster to each putative insertion site in a 7 kb window upstream of the 3’ integration site and in the proper orientation. As expected, the distribution of the distances between the 5' and 3’ L1 ends was bimodal: either close to 6 kb (L1 element present in the reference genome sequence) or close to 0 (L1 element absent in the reference genome sequence). The position of each putative L1 insertion was also compared to potential spurious RB3PA1 genomic binding sites, to reference L1HS and L1 (UCSC RepeatMasker track, Smit AFA, Hubley R, Green P. <italic>RepeatMasker Open-3.0</italic>. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>. 1996–2010 and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>]), to fixed L1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>), to known polymorphic L1HS (euL1db, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mir et al., 2015</xref>]), or to Refseq gene positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujita et al., 2011</xref>).

First, we found that spurious RB3PA1 (partial) match in a non-L1 sequence is a significant source of false positive. These events were characterized by: (i) the presence of an RB3PA1 partial sequence outside of a reference L1 element; and (ii) 3’ ATLAS-seq reads containing the RB3PA1 sequence immediately preceded by the flanking genomic sequence (without L1 or polyA sequence). To filter out these events, we established a map of RB3PA1 partial matches in the human reference genome. We iteratively aligned to the human genome RB3PA1 derivatives, deleted one base after the other from their 5’ end, down to 8 nucleotides, keeping only perfect matches. We also aligned the full RB3PA1 primer (22 nt in length) allowing up to 2 mismatches. Then for each genomic position, if several forms of the primer could match, we kept the longest one. Mapping was achieved with BWA using the ‘samse’ algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>) and allowing up to 10<sup>9</sup> possible occurrences (-n 1000000000 option). Putative L1 insertions are considered as false positive - and filtered out - if they combine the following criteria: (i) they are not reference insertions, (ii) they contain a potential partial RB3PA1 primer match and, (iii) their supporting reads contain genomic flanking sequence immediately followed by the RB3PA1 primer sequence (without L1 or polyA sequence). Finally, we observed that L1HS-PreTa copies can sometimes be amplified, but the corresponding clusters are generally supported by 10 times less reads than reference L1HS-Ta. Insertions corresponding to these older elements were also filtered out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>In silico estimate of the discovery rate</title><p>Because reference L1HS-Ta elements are not present in all individuals, they cannot be used to evaluate the overall discovery rate of the ATLAS-seq procedure. Instead, we constructed a reference set of 123 L1HS-Ta copies fixed in the human population. It contains the L1HS-Ta elements previously described as fixed in an early analysis of the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myers et al., 2002</xref>), from which we removed a subset of elements, which have been later shown as polymorphic in the frame of the 1000 Genome Project (annotated as 'deleted' as compared to the reference genome, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>]), as well as Y chromosome insertions. Irrespective of the cell line and of the in silico filters described in the previous paragraph, we consistently found ≥98% of the fixed insertions (120 to 122 depending on the cell line). We cannot exclude that some of the missing insertions result from overlapping large structural variants, such as the loss of large chromosomal regions, particularly in transformed cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-6"><title>PCR validation and estimation of the true positive rate</title><p>To evaluate the rate of true positive insertion calls in the overall ATLAS-seq procedure, we selected 72 putative non-reference insertions found in HEK-293T cells with a broad range of supporting read numbers (from 2 to 326, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This includes 50 previously described polymorphic insertions and 22 totally unknown. We batch designed PCR primers in the 5’ and 3’ flanking sequence spanning a 200 bp region starting 50 nucleotides from the putative insertion site with PrimerQuest online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eu.idtdna.com/primerquest/home/index">http://eu.idtdna.com/primerquest/home/index</ext-link>) and we verified that each pair generates only one product using the UCSC In-Silico PCR tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kent et al., 2002</xref>). The primer sequences, based on the hg19 human reference genome sequence, are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>. For each tested locus, we performed two PCR reactions with distinct primer pairs. The first one amplified the entire locus using a primer on each side of the putative L1 insertion site. This reaction can result in the amplification of the empty locus and/or the filled locus depending on the size of the L1 insertion and on the zygosity of the filled allele. The second reaction amplified the 3' L1-genomic junction using a primer in the flank (identical to one of those used to amplify the full locus) and another one anchored in the L1 3' end (RB3PA1). Finally, a similar reaction was also performed for the 5' junction for putative full-length insertions using the RB5PA1 primer anchored in the L1 5' end. PCR amplification was performed in 50-µL reactions containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, 1X PCR Buffer, 0.2 μM of primers, 0.2 μM dNTPs, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies). Amplification was performed with an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler (Life Technologies) under the following cycling conditions: one step at 94°C for 2 min, one step of 35 cycles at 94C for 30 s, 56C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and one final step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were resolved and visualized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5X TBE buffer and ethidium bromide staining (50 ng/mL, Life Technologies). When amplification of the entire locus spanning the L1 insertion site failed (neither empty nor filled locus amplified, or non-specific banding pattern), we interpreted the result as a PCR failure. When the latter gave a specific product, if the 3' flank and/or the 5' flank PCR reaction gave a predominant unique product of the expected size, the insertion was considered as validated, and if not, as non-validated. Overall the rate of true positive was 94%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-7"><title>Detection of 3' transductions in ATLAS-seq sequencing data</title><p>Demultiplexed 3' ATLAS-seq reads, trimmed for the barcode and ATLAS-linker were successively trimmed at their 3' end using cutadapt to remove the RB3PA1 ATLAS primer, the L1 sequence and a polyT stretch. Parameters were identical to regular ATLAS-seq read processing, except for polyT trimming cutadapt options (-a T{100} which ensures only trimming of the most distal poly(T)). We mapped reads using bwa mem (-M -t 4 options), which allows soft clipping, and samtools view with awk scripts to extracts reads with a CIGAR string indicative of 3' end clipping, and to obtain the genomic location and mapping quality of the clipped part of the read (SA tag). At this stage we only kept read for which both split fragments were able to map unambiguously to the reference genome (MAPQ&gt;15). This filtering step is essential since the clipped region, potentially corresponding to a 3' transduced sequence, is often of low complexity. BEDtools window was next used to identify among the split reads, those for which the 5' end mapped next to any L1HS-Ta sequence identified by ATLAS-seq and the 3' end next to a full-length L1HS-Ta instance also identified by ATLAS-seq, but distinct from the first one. Progenies with multiple potential progenitors were eliminated.

Some L1 elements with high retrotransposition activity (‘hot’ L1) belong to well-defined lineages with distinctive 3’ transductions. Three such main lineages have been extensively characterized (AC002980, RP and LRE3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brouha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macfarlane et al., 2013</xref>). We used a computational approach to identify among the full-length insertions found by ATLAS-seq those that belong to these lineages. First, we pooled all ATLAS-seq reads from all cell lines after barcode and linker clipping (but still containing the poly(A), L1 and flanking sequence). Then, for each read, we serially searched lineage-specific tags (see below) using cutadapt (parameters: -e 0.1 -O 16 -m 25 --no-trim --discard-untrimmed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martin, 2011</xref>). The reads containing one of the tags were mapped on the human reference genome using bwa mem (-M option), and filtered for unique mappers and primary alignments using samtools view (-q 15 –F 256 options) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>). Finally, mapped reads intersecting full-length insertions were counted using bedtools intersect (-c option) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). Since all three lineages belong to the most recent L1 subfamily (L1HS-Ta1d), we discarded matches corresponding to reference insertions of older subfamilies, and manually inspected the remaining insertions and their supporting reads. These last steps were necessary to eliminate a number of false positives for the RP lineage, which is characterized by a very low sequence complexity and stretches of homopolymers. At the end of this procedure, L1 copies with reads supporting a particular lineage were annotated as belonging to this lineage. This strategy allowed us to overcome the limitations due to reduced sequence quality within or downstream homopolymers and to identify informative reads spanning putative transductions. The sequences of the lineage-specific tags were as follow: AC002980, GCTTTATTGAGGTGTAACCAGCA; RP, TAAATTTAAAACTTTTTTTTTT; LRE3, CGGAATAGACATTTTGCTTTTCT. They are identical - or shortened - reverse-complemented version of previously published oligonucleotide sequences used to amplify distinctive L1 lineages (TS-ATLAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macfarlane et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To verify the sensitivity of this approach, we compared our list of full length insertions with a published dataset of insertions deriving from the same three lineages (AC002980, RP and LRE3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macfarlane et al., 2013</xref>). Out of 15 full-length insertions previously identified by MacFarlane <italic>et al.</italic>, 8 are present in the cell lines studied here, and all 8 were identified by our computational approach (100% recovery). However, none was highly expressed in any of the cell types of our panel. In addition, we identified 2 additional copies with a 3’ transduction typical from the RP lineage. In total, only 1 element out of 10, inserted in the <italic>NEDD4</italic> gene (EXP_ID_0447), was ranked among the top 20 most highly expressed L1 copies. For this particular copy, we confirmed the presence of the typical RP transduction by Sanger sequencing. Consistent with its affiliation to the ‘hot’ L1 RP lineage, this copy is also retrotransposition-competent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cloning of full length L1-HS</title><p>Cloning of L1 copy EXP_ID_0447 was obtained by nested PCR amplification from 50 ng of MCF7 genomic DNA using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in 50-µL reactions. The first PCR was performed with primers specific to the genomic DNA sequence flanking L1 copy EXP_ID_0447 (LOU1652 and LOU1656) with the following program: 98°C for 3 min, 35 cycles [98°C for 10 s, 54°C for 15 s, 72°C for 3.5 min], and 72°C for 10 min. A ~6 kb PCR product was resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, gel-purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), and resuspended in 50 µL of milli-Q water. The second PCR was performed using 1 µL of the purified PCR product with primers matching the L1HS 5’ UTR (LOU1662) and the downstream flanking genomic DNA sequence of the L1 copy EXP_ID_0447 (LOU1664) with the following program: 98°C for 3 min, 40 cycles [98°C for 10 s, 58°C for 15 s, 72°C for 4 min], and 72°C for 10 min. A PCR product of ~6 kb fragment was gel-purified as described above. Both primers of the second PCR contained homology in their 5’ parts to the CMV promoter and to the retrotransposition reporter cassette contained in the L1 expression vector pAD135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doucet et al., 2010</xref>), allowing SLiCE cloning, a method based on in vitro homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, pAD135 was digested with NotI and BstZ17I to remove the engineered L1.3 element from the expression vector. SLiCE cloning to generate pVan609 plasmids was conducted in a 10-µL reaction by combining 100 ng of the digested and gel-purified vector fragment with the PCR product of L1 EXP_ID_0447 in a 1:3 molar ratio, 1X SLiCE buffer and 1 µL of PPY SLiCE extract for 1 hr at 37C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Sanger sequencing of positive clones confirmed the specific subcloning of the full-length L1 copy EXP_ID_0447 through the identification of the 3’ flanking region of genomic DNA. The flanking genomic DNA sequence was then removed by digestion of pVan609 clones with BstZ17I, an enzyme that cuts in the 3’ UTR of the subcloned L1 and just upstream of the retrotransposition reporter in the vector. This strategy allows, after re-ligation of the vector to itself to generate pVan610 clones, containing a full length L1 copy with an engineered 3’ UTR containing a retrotransposition reporter. Four independent pVan610 clones (pVan610-1 to -4) were generated to rule out mutations that could have occurred through the second round of PCR amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cellular retrotransposition assay</title><p>L1 retrotransposition assay was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moran et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wei et al., 2000</xref>) with minor modifications.

The quality of raw reads was verified for each lane per RNA-seq sample, using the FASTQC (v0.11.2) tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). Reads were trimmed using sliding-window mode from Trimmomatic (v0.32) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). The minimum quality and read length allowed were 20 and 25, respectively, as they showed the best mapping rates in several tests trying different values of these parameters. The rest of the Trimmomatic parameters were set as recommended for paired-end (PE) reads in the Trimmomatic tool manual.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA-seq mapping</title><p>PE trimmed reads were aligned per lane to both the hg19 reference transcriptome and genome obtained from UCSC, using TopHat2 v2.0.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). For a better accuracy, the parameter --read-realign-edit-dist was set to 0 (specifying alignment of all reads at each step, returning the best alignment for each read). The –r (insert size) and --mate-std-dev (insert size standard deviation) parameters were estimated using the tool CollectInsertSizeMetrics from Picardtools v1.128 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>), after mapping a subset of the RNA-seq samples. The other mapping parameters were set to their default values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Comparison of global L1HS-Ta RNA levels between cell lines</title><p>This section is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. Reads were mapped against the consensus L1HS sequence from RepBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2015</xref>) using the end-to-end mode from bowtie2 (v2.2.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). The total end-to-end mismatches (specified by -score-min) were -0.6 + 0.6*L, so -45.6 for 75 bp reads (or no more than 7 high-quality mismatches) or -90.6 for 150 bp reads (or no more than 15 high-quality mismatches). These options allow two mismatches per seed, needed to allow the SNPs that distinguish each L1HS subfamilies. Reads that mapped to a diagnostic tri-nucleotide (5927–5929) within the L1 sequence were extracted using samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2009</xref>), and the occurrences of each tri-nucleotide at this position was counted. These counts of tri-nucleotide-containing reads per library were normalized by the total number of reads mapped to the hg19 reference genome. Reads with an ACA diagnostic tri-nucleotide were counted as derived from L1HS-Ta elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Transcriptional analysis of individual L1HS copies</title><p>This section is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Stranded coverage file (wig files) were generated from the alignments with the tool 'count' from igvtools (v2.3.43) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv">http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv</ext-link>). Only the strand of first mates and with a MAPQ of 20 were taken into account, ensuring that only one read per fragment was counted and only pairs uniquely mapped were retained for downstream analyses. The window size was set to 10 and the window function used was the median. Coverage wig files from all libraries were normalized according to the total number of mapped mates 1 of each library. After normalization, wig files were converted to bigWig files using the command wigToBigWig (v4) from UCSC bioinformatics utilities. The bigWig files were used to identify transcriptional signals from the possibly full-length L1HS individual copies: RNA-seq signals upstream or downstream individual L1HS copies were used as a proxy to identify potential transcriptional signature of specific individual L1HS copies, as these genomic flanking sequences are more-often uniquely mappable. To obtain a global view of the transcription levels detectable at each LINE-1 locus, the computeMatrix command from deeptools (v1.5.9.1) was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramírez et al., 2014</xref>). For each RNA-seq strand and L1HS strand, the scores associated at the 5’ and 3’ of the L1HS copies in a 1 kb window size, upstream and downstream respectively, were computed separately and averaged between biological replicates. The window size was selected according to previous studies and to avoid overlapping of transcription signals from other genomic features. Annotated exons within the 1 kb window were masked. Heatmaps were produced with the R package heatmap.2, and lines were sorted according to the total transcription signal at the downstream flanking region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Analysis of ChIP-seq datasets</title><p>This section is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>. Mapped ChIP-seq data were retrieved from ENCODE. The replicates of each experiment were pooled together and read duplicates were removed from the merged bam files. The merged bam files were converted into wig files using 'count' from igvtools, with a window of 10 bp and the median function, and, then, converted into bigWig file with tool wigToBigWig from the UCSC tools. ChIP-seq signals were obtained using the ‘reference-point’ mode of computeMatrix from deeptools, specifying 1 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of the TSS &amp; TES, which were defined as the extremities of each L1HS copy, and with a window of 50bp and mean function. Using a threshold of 0.05 on the FPKM L1HS expression values, the L1HS copies were divided in two groups: expressed and non-expressed copies. The mean of each group of ChIP-seq signals was extracted and plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Effect of ORF1 shRNA on the expression of individual L1 copy</title><p>This section is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. Separate annotation files (.gtf) were created for each cell line by appending the coordinates of 1 kb downstream of each L1HS copy to the hg19 annotation file. To count the number of reads associated with genomic features (exons and flanking L1 sequences), HTSeq v0.6.1p1 was employed in the union mode, and a MAPQ threshold of 50 was used to take only unambiguously mapped reads into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Other parameters were assigned to their default value. In order to determine whether RNA-seq tags mapping within the 1 kb downstream of each L1HS actually reflect L1HS-derived transcripts, a differential expression analysis (DEA) was performed using HTSeq counts as inputs. Since reads mapping within the downstream 1 kb sequence flanking L1HS instances are often non-abundant, several DEA tools were tested for their ability to discriminate properly differential expression with low number of counts: from this test, DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2014</xref>) gave the best performance (data not shown) and was used for the rest of the analysis. Data corresponding to each L1 shRNA was compared against control data corresponding to a scrambled shRNA, and default parameters were used for the entire analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Clustering of individual L1-HSTa loci according to their transcriptional activity</title><p>This section is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. The transcriptional activity of each L1-HSTa instance was estimated independently for each cell-line in which it is detected by the number of RNA-seq fragments which non-redundantly align to the downstream adjacent 1 kb of genomic sequence, and normalized to the number of non-redundantly aligned reads in the entire RNA-seq dataset (FPKM). For this purpose, mates 1 stranded-specific counting was performed at 1 kb downstream L1HS copies with a dedicated script. Only mates with a MAPQ&gt;= 20 were taken into account. The FPKM for each copy was calculated according to the total number of mapped mates 1 in each library. Clusters of cell-lines with similar patterns of detectable expression of distinct L1 copies were clustered using the R hclust function (distance measure=’euclidean’, clustering method=’ward’). To identify groups of L1s which exhibit similar behaviour across cell-types, L1 expression was compared between cell-types using the reciprocal of the mean product of FPKMs as a distance measure. L1s with no detectable expression in any cell-type were excluded, and pairs of L1s which are not present in any common cell-types were assigned a neutral distance equal to the mean of all calculable pairwise distances. Clustering was performed using R hclust (clustering method=’ward’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>RT-PCR validation of L1 chimeric transcripts</title><p>First-strand complementary DNAs (cDNA) were obtained from the RNA samples using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 µg of DNase-treated RNA samples were combined in a 13-µL reaction including 1 µL of a 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 µL of a 50 µM RACE primer and milli-Q water. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 65C and placed on ice for 1 min. The reactions were then supplemented with a 7-µL cDNA Synthesis Mix containing 4 µL of 5X First-Strand buffer, 1 µL of 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL of 40 U/µL RNaseOUT and 1 µL of 200 U/µL of SuperScript III RT. For each sample, a control condition was prepared without reverse transcriptase. The tubes were incubated for 50 min at 55°C and then for 15 min at 70°C. PCR amplification of the cDNA was obtained using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 µL of cDNA sample was combined in a 50-µL reaction with 1X PCR Buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.2 µM of forward primer (RB3PA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badge et al., 2003</xref>]), 0.2 µM of reverse primer (specific to the 3’ flanking genomic DNA sequence of L1 copies, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> for details). Amplification was performed with an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler (Life Technologies) with the following program: one step at 94°C for 2 min, one step of 32 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, and one final step at 72°C for 5 min. The detection of GAPDH transcripts was performed similarly, with only 30 cycles of PCR amplification, using primers LOU0639 and LOU0576. PCR products were resolved and visualized by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5X TBE buffer and ethidium bromide staining (50 ng/mL, Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Relationship of expressed copies with genes and copy number variants</title><p>This section is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. Raw RNA-seq data retrieved from ENCODE were processed as described above to obtain an FPKM value for each gene. We used the UCSC gene set (hg19 version) obtained from iGenomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html">https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html</ext-link>). When an L1 copy was inserted in a region corresponding to several overlapping genes oriented in the same direction, we considered the most expressed gene. Ploidy at each L1 insertion locus and for each cell line analyzed was determined using the copy number variation (CNV) tracks obtained from ENCODE (see ‘Data’ section). They were deduced from Illumina Human 1M-Duo Infinium HD BeadChip assays and circular binary segmentation (CBS), which segments the genome into amplified, normal, heterozygous deletion, homozygous deletion or uncovered regions. As expected, no L1 were inserted in region annotated as homozygous deletion. Uncovered regions were excluded from the analysis. The list of full-length L1 insertions provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref> was divided in two groups, expressed and non-expressed copies, using a threshold of 0.05 on the FPKM L1HS expression values.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Activation of individual L1 retrotransposon instances is restricted to cell-type dependent 'hot loci'&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor, who acted as one of the reviewers, and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agree that your manuscript provides an important contribution to the field and will be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers. They also recommend some revisions as outlined below.</p><p>The manuscript addresses a long-standing question in our field: Namely, how many and which of the many genomic LINE-1 loci contribute to expression at the RNA level. The authors do a very nice job of integrating different types of data: RNA-seq, epigenetic studies, and LINE-1 mapping with ATLAS, to reach conclusions about this. They take into account sense/antisense orientations and leverage that information in order to 'see' reads that span the L1 3' and 5' junctions with the adjacent genomic DNA. The attention to detail is high, and I think their conclusion – that a restricted subset of L1HS-Ta loci, a subset of which is polymorphic among individual cell lines, is responsible for the bulk of L1 expression – is sound.</p><p>The following major points need to be addressed in a revision, before the paper can be accepted:</p><p>More information should be provided on the positions of these active LINE-1 / contrast them to inactive loci. What are the surrounding genes and the relationship between the gene loci and the LINE-1? What is the ploidy/copy-number at these sites?</p><p>More discussion is required on how the authors think their shRNA to ORF1 works. Their language (&quot;Impact of shRNA-mediated ORF1 knockdown on the transcription of all L1HS genomic instances&quot;) suggests they believe a shRNA silencing effect at the level of the genome is at work. One would think that shRNA is just causing degradation of the mRNA, which is what accounts for reductions in the reads.</p><p>'Hot' is a colloquialism for retrotransposition active LINE-1. We would suggest the authors think of different terms, for example, expressed LINE-1 in place of hot LINE-1 when RNA levels are described, permissive loci in place of hot loci when considering epigenetic context. Keeping the narrow definition of 'hot' may avoid confusion in the literature.</p><p>You should consider utilising the identification of daughter elements from their shared 3' transductions with putative progenitors as evidence of retrotransposition capability (where this was not assessed directly by cell culture assays). However you do not comment on the relationship between these transduction lineages and previously identified highly active pedigrees of elements. It is well established that common, highly active polymorphic L1 insertions, while showing significant allelic variation in retrotransposition activity, nevertheless frequently belong to lineages with distinctive 3' transductions. It would be valuable to know what proportion of the highly expressed elements analysed for their retrotransposition capability (either directly or by implication from ATLAS-seq reads) belong to previously identified lineages. It may be that the apparent dominance of small cohorts of elements is modulated by intrinsic features of these subsets of L1 elements.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13926.068</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>More information should be provided on the positions of these active LINE-1 / contrast them to inactive loci.

This was changed into ‘permissive loci’ in the title and throughout the manuscript, as appropriately proposed. Thus, the revised title is now: “Activation of individual L1 retrotransposon instances is restricted to cell-type dependent permissive loci”. (Please see answer 9. on the choice of ‘instances’ instead of ‘insertions’ and answer 6. on the revised Discussion).</p><p><italic>You should consider utilising the identification of daughter elements from their shared 3' transductions with putative progenitors as evidence of retrotransposition capability (where this was not assessed directly by cell culture assays). However you do not comment on the relationship between these transduction lineages and previously identified highly active pedigrees of elements.

It may be that the apparent dominance of small cohorts of elements is modulated by intrinsic features of these subsets of L1 elements.</italic> </p><p>We addressed this question in two different ways:</p><p>i) First, we compared the list of full-length insertions, independently of their level of expression, with a published dataset of insertions deriving from the 3 main L1 lineages (RP, LRE3 and AC002980) (MacFarlane et al. 2013). Eight out of 15 full-length and lineage-specific insertions found by MacFarlane et al. are present in the studied cell lines, but none of them belong to the top 20 highly expressed L1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>ii) Second, we screened ATLAS-seq reads before poly(A) and L1 sequence trimming for the presence of lineage-specific sequence tags. This allowed us to identify the full-length L1 copies in our dataset belonging to these transduction lineages. Through this computational approach, we identified all 8 insertions previously found in the MacFarlane et al. dataset, as well as 2 additional insertions belonging to the RP lineage. One of these two insertions was ranked in the top 20 highly expressed L1s across all cell lines (L1N<italic><sub>EDD4</sub></italic>). Its affiliation to the RP lineage was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and its retrotransposition activity had already been tested by cellular retrotransposition in the initial version of the manuscript (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, although our set of L1 insertions contains members of well-known transduction lineages, only one of them was ranked among the 20 top expressed L1 elements.</p><p>These results have now been incorporated as two additional columns in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>, where they can be compared side-by-side with the expression levels and retrotransposition-capacity of each individual L1 insertion. In the main text, the results are described at the end of the paragraph entitled “Many transcribed L1HS-Ta are retrotransposition-competent”:</p><p>“Some L1 elements with high retrotransposition activity (‘hot’ L1) belong to well-defined lineages with distinctive 3’ transductions. […]Thus, these findings suggest that the observed high level of expression of a small cohort of L1 insertions is not an intrinsic feature of any previously identified lineage.”</p><p>Moreover, a new paragraph entitled “L1 lineage identification” has been added in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
