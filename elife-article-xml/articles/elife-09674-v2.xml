signals transmitted by peripheral neurons to the CNS is an area of intense study. Several studies indicate that transduction mechanisms are intrinsic to cutaneous neurons and that epidermal keratinocytes only modulate this transduction. Using mice expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in keratinocytes we show that blue light activation of the epidermis alone can produce action potentials (APs) in multiple types of cutaneous sensory neurons including SA1, A-HTMR, CM, CH, CMC, CMH and CMHC fiber types. In loss of function studies, yellow light stimulation of keratinocytes that express halorhodopsin reduced AP generation in response to naturalistic stimuli. These findings support the idea that intrinsic sensory transduction mechanisms in epidermal keratinocytes can directly elicit AP firing in nociceptive as well as tactile sensory afferents and suggest a significantly expanded role for the epidermis in sensory processing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09674.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09674.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09674.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a person touches a hot saucepan, nerve cells in the skin send a message to the brain that causes the person to pull away quickly.

But it is difficult to distinguish the respective roles of skin cells and nerve cells in experiments because these cells often appear to react at the same time. Researchers have discovered that a technique called optogenetics, which originally developed to study the brain, can help. Optogenetics uses genetic engineering to create skin cells that respond to light instead of touch.</p><p>Baumbauer, DeBerry, Adelman et al. genetically engineered mice to express a light-sensitive protein in their skin cells. When these skin cells were exposed to light, the mice pulled away just like they would if they were responding to painful contact. This behavior coincided with electrical signals in the nerve cells even though the nerve cells themselves were not light sensitive. In further experiments, mice were genetically engineered to express another protein in their skin cells that prevents the neurons from being able to generate electrical signals. When these skin cells were exposed to light, the surrounding nerve cells produced fewer electrical signals.</p><p>Together, the experiments show that skin cells are able to directly trigger electrical signals in nerve cells. Baumbauer, DeBerry, Adelman et al.'s findings may help researchers to understand why some patients with particular inflammatory conditions are in pain due to overactive nerve

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous primary sensory afferents are the first in a chain of neurons that convert environmental stimuli into recognizable sensations of touch, heat, cold and pain. Sensory neurons are diverse in nature and exhibit unique chemical, morphological and electrophysiological properties that allow specific responses to applied stimuli. In response to stimuli, the skin produces neuroactive substances that are postulated to directly and indirectly modulate the activity of sensory fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Groneberg et al., 2005</xref>). These substances include glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nordlind et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2009</xref>), ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook and McCleskey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dussor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2013</xref>), acetylcholine (ACh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grando et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wessler et al., 1998</xref>), epinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khasar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pullar et al., 2006</xref>), CGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hou et al., 2011</xref>), neurotrophic growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Truzzi et al., 2011</xref>) and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). The skin also expresses ligand-gated (glutamate, ATP, nicotinic, muscarinic, 5-hydroxytryptamine, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric) and voltage-gated (sodium, calcium, transient receptor potential [TRP], potassium and cyclic nucleotide) ion channels and growth factor and cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olah et al., 2012</xref>). The expression of neuroactivators and voltage and ion-gated channels indicates that complex autocrine and paracrine signaling between epithelial and neural tissues underlie sensory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conti-Fine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atoyan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dussor et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that non-neuronal cells of the skin, specifically keratinocytes, contribute to the initial transduction process through regulated release of neuroactive substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dussor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mandadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2013</xref>). Testing this in an intact system has been difficult because the complexity in skin-nerve interactions prohibits isolation of the skin and neuronal output (a behavioral reflex or the pattern of axonal firing) since any natural stimulation (e.g., mechanical or thermal) simultaneously affects both keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To address this problem, mice with targeted expression of light-activated channelrhodopsin (ChR2) can be used to determine the contribution of each cell type to cutaneous associated behavior (withdrawal reflex) and generation of afferent APs. For example, Ji and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ji et al., 2012</xref>) showed that blue light stimulation of the skin of transgenic rats that expressed ChR2 in primary afferents under the Thy-1.2 promoter exhibited nocifensive type responses. Similarly, Daou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daou et al., 2013</xref>) showed light-induced behavioral sensitivity in mice in which the Nav1.8 promoter drove expression of ChR2 in a subset of primary afferents. In another optogenetic model, Maksimovic and colleagues directed ChR2 expression to the non-neuronal Merkel cells of the epidermis. Using an ex vivo electrophysiologic preparation they showed that blue light stimulation of the isolated skin elicited AP trains in slowly adapting type 1 (SA1) afferents, thus confirming the essential transducer role of Merkel cells in transmission of mechanical stimuli by SA1 tactile afferents.</p><p>To further examine how the epidermis and cutaneous afferents communicate we analyzed mice in which ChR2 was targeted to either sensory neurons or keratinocytes to determine the contribution of each cell type to cutaneous associated behavior (withdrawal reflex) and generation of afferent APs. Similar to Daou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daou et al., 2013</xref>), we found that light stimulation of the skin and activation of ChR2 in sensory afferents elicits robust nocifensive behaviors in mice. Remarkably, for mice that only express ChR2 in skin keratinocytes, light stimulation was also sufficient to generate nocifensive behaviors and regulate firing properties and evoke APs in specific subsets of cutaneous afferents, several which are known to activate in response to painful stimuli. In addition, expression of the chloride pump NpHR3.0 in keratinocytes significantly reduced AP firing in cutaneous afferents. These data indicate that Merkel cells are not unique in their ability to directly generate action potentials in sensory neurons and that light-mediated activation of keratinocytes is sufficient to engage an endogenous mechanism that can directly regulate cutaneous afferent firing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Summary of afferent properties measured using ex vivo intracellular and fiber teasing recordings</title><p>In these electrophysiological experiments we have recorded from 200 characterized cutaneous afferents (86 C-fibers, 37 Aδ, 77 Aβ) from the three different mouse genotypes (49 Prph-ChR2, 80 KRT-ChR2, 71 KRT-NpHR). The response properties to natural stimuli (pressure, heat, cold) for the different fiber types can be summarized as follows: Aβ-LTMRs had mechanical thresholds from 5 to 10 mN (mean 5.5 mN), while Aδ-LTMRs thresholds ranged from 1 to 5mN, with a mean of 2.3 mN. For A-HTMRs, Aβ-HTMRs had mechanical thresholds ranging from 10 to 25 mN, with a mean of 17.5 mN; Aδ-HTMRs thresholds were 5–100 mN, with a mean of 26.7 mN. Cutaneous C-fibers showed a range of response properties, with mechanical thresholds from 5 to 50 mN (mean 23 mN), heat thresholds of 37–50°C (mean 44°C), and cold thresholds of 1–18°C (mean 11°C). No significant differences in these values were observed between genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation of ChR2 in primary afferents produces nocifensive behaviors and action potentials in multiple types of primary afferents</title><p>We first determined the extent to which ChR2 activation in sensory neurons mimicked natural stimulation.

A Prph-ChR2 Aδ-HTMR (A-delta-high threshold mechanoreceptor) exhibited a tonic response to mechanical stimulation whereas blue light evoked a phasic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In a CMHC nociceptor (C-fiber responding to mechanical, noxious heat and cold stimuli), suprathreshold light stimulation produced tonic firing whereas suprathreshold mechanical stimulation evoked a more phasic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Latency to first response to mechanical and light stimulation was similar. Peak instantaneous frequencies (IF) were significantly higher for suprathreshold mechanical stimulation, averaging 33.9 Hz for mechanical vs 8.6 Hz for light stimulation (@ 39.7 mW) for all mechanically responsive C-fibers. Interestingly, the average peak IF seen with laser light was similar to that seen in polymodal nociceptors (the majority of cutaneous afferents) in response to noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McIlwrath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lawson et al., 2008</xref>). This raised the possibility that afferent-expressed ChR2 activation can evoke a ‘baseline’ response of putative nociceptors that reflects the intrinsic properties of these cells and that more naturalistic responses require collaboration of surrounding cells, including keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Activation of ChR2 in keratinocytes produces nocifensive behaviors and action potentials in multiple types of primary afferents</title><p>To determine if keratinocytes contribute to afferent activation, mice that express ChR2-YFP (ChR2) specifically in keratinocytes were generated by crossing Ai32 mice with <italic>Krt14</italic> keratin Cre mice (KRT14-Cre).

Testing was done in a blinded manner and all KRT-ChR2 mice responded at least one time out of 10 trials with laser stimulation restricted to a 30 s maximum. Measures on human skin using a thermistor showed a slight laser-induced increase in surface temperature (from 27.5°C to 30.5°C) over the 30 s stimulation period, indicating that KRT-ChR2 mouse responses were not due to laser heating of the skin.

Electrophysiological recordings were obtained from 80 cells isolated from 16 KRT-ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Laser activation induced APs in 6 out of 24 unmyelinated nociceptive fiber neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) and in 4 out of 14 myelinated high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) (not shown). These responses in heat-sensitive neurons are not due to laser-generated heat, as measures using a thermistor show minimal rise (∼1 °C) in temperature over the 5 s recording interval. In addition, 3 myelinated HTMR fibers exhibited apparent summation when the laser was presented with natural stimuli. An example of this summation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. This myelinated HTMR fiber had a mechanical threshold of 10 mN and neither a 5 mN mechanical stimulus nor the maximal intensity of blue light evoked a response. However, simultaneous application of 5 mN mechanical stimulation and light stimulation was sufficient to elicit APs. Recordings from 18 C-fiber nociceptors were maintained long enough to make multiple presentations of natural, laser and combined laser and natural stimuli. In 12 of these fibers, combined laser and natural stimulation evoked significantly more APs than natural stimuli alone (p &lt; 0.01 paired T-test, n = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Halorhodopsin is a yellow-to-red light-activated chloride pump that when expressed in neurons generates hyperpolarization, inhibits AP firing and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raimondo et al., 2012</xref>).

For some neuron subtypes, light activation of keratinocytes induces action potential firing similar to that evoked in response to natural stimuli. For other afferents, keratinocyte activation produced sub-threshold effects that potentiated the response to natural stimulation. For example, we recorded from afferents where light activation of keratinocytes alone did not elicit action potentials, but when combined with sub-threshold mechanical stimuli, produced multiple action potentials. These results suggest that keratinocytes are not only intimately involved in the generation of sensory neuron activity, but that the nature of this interaction is heterogeneous, differing for the many subtypes of sensory neurons that innervate the skin. Contributing to this heterogeneity may be the type or relative level of neuroactivator compound released by keratinocytes in response to mechanical, thermal or noxious stimulation or interactions with other cell types or structures in the skin, for example, immune cells or vascular structures.</p><p>Our electrophysiologic findings indicate that activation of Aδ and C fiber nociceptors likely underlies the behavioral sensitivity evoked by light in KRT-ChR2 mice. In addition, light stimulation of ChR2 expressed by Merkel cells likely transduces a signal that directly activates SA1 low threshold mechanoreceptors, as shown by Maksimovic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>). That ChR2 in epidermal cells other than Merkel cells can activate numerous neuronal subtypes that are known to transmit thermal, mechanical and painful stimuli significantly expands the role of the epidermis in sensory processing.</p><p>The ability of keratinocytes to signal to sensory afferents and transmit pain is also supported by recent findings of Pang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pang et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies TRPV1 global knockout mice were genetically engineered to ectopically express TRPV1 selectively in keratinocytes. In these mice capsaicin could evoke nocifensive behaviors and c-fos expression in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. As capsaicin application should only have activated keratinocyte-expressed TRPV1, it was concluded that these responses, which require activation of nociceptors, were initiated by keratinocytes, which in turn induced firing in primary afferents.</p><p>Afferents that fire APs in response to light stimulation of keratinocytes were either polymodal, responding to mechanical and thermal stimuli, or unimodal, responding only to mechanical or thermal stimuli. For example, over half of the C-heat (CH) fibers, which only signal noxious heat and express TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jankowski et al., 2012</xref>), responded to keratinocyte activation. This suggests that keratinocytes have the ability to communicate directly with neurons that express TRPV1, an ion channel that transmits noxious heat and is required for inflammatory pain signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Woodbury et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumbauer et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, LTMRs afferents, which form lanceolate endings around hair follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), were not activated by illumination of the skin in either Prph-ChR2 mice or KRT-ChR2 mice. A possible reason for this may be that these nerve fibers and/or the associated keratinocytes were not effectively illuminated due to the depth of the skin. However, in ongoing studies using Advillin-cre- and trkB-Cre<sup>ER</sup>-ChR2 mice, action potentials can be evoked in Aβ and Aδ LTMRs using the same light stimulus (not shown). Thus, it is possible that in Prph-ChR2 mice, an insufficient level of ChR2 for activation of LTMRs may exist. Another possibility is that the peripherin promoter only targets C-LTMR afferents. Unfortunately, the only cells we recorded from with lanceolate endings in these prreparations were myelinated RA-LTMRs.</p><p>In addition to the afferent stimulation, afferent activity could also be repressed by optogenetic stimulation of epidermal cells expressing NpHR. Light stimulation of NpHR and the predicted intracellular directed Cl flux led to significant reduction in many C-fiber, Aδ and SA1 afferent responses to mechanical and/or heat stimulation of the skin. Although the physiological and cellular mechanisms underlying this chloride-mediated change in keratinocyte signaling are yet to be resolved, the reduction in AP activity suggests a possible role for Cl<sup>−</sup> in mediating neural-keratinocyte communication. Keratinocytes are known to exhibit chloride conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rugolo et al., 1992</xref>), and Cl<sup>−</sup> has been shown to contribute to changes in resting potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wohlrab et al., 2000</xref>) and keratinocyte hyperpolarization in response to mechanical stimuli evoked by hypotonic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonczi et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies, to determine if KRT-NpHR mice exhibit reduced behavioral responses in response to noxious stimuli, will require a system in which dual presentation of the stimulus, for example, heat and yellow light, are delivered.</p><p>The afferent responses evoked by keratinocyte stimulation were not at the same level evoked by natural stimuli, but this was not expected. It is most likely that keratinocyte activation is one contributor to natural stimuli-evoked sensory signaling (at least for some cells) and, in addition to neuronal activation, is a critical component of sensory transmission. Evidence for this is the clear activation of primary afferents by blue light stimulation of keratinocytes and the observed summation of AP firing in afferents exposed to light and mechanical or thermal stimuli. Importantly, physiological relevance is also indicated by the in vivo nocifensive behavior and clear withdrawal response elicited by light stimulation of KRT-ChR2 mice. These responses were much slower compared to behavioral response times measured in Prph-ChR2 mice, which express the ChR2 ion channel in the primary afferent. This difference may reflect the time needed for release by keratinocytes of neuroactivator compound(s) to a level sufficient to evoke an AP as well as the heterogeneity of fiber types innervating the epidermis. Further study of the types of neuroactivator compounds released by light stimulated ChR2 keratinocytes and the effect of these activators on specific types of primary afferents will address these issues.</p><p>Disturbances in epidermal-neuronal signaling in inflamed or damaged skin result in abnormal sensory transmission that underlies associated pain, itch and paresthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Urashima and Mihara, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kinkelin et al., 2000</xref>). The present findings support the idea that keratinocytes, as activators of cutaneous neurons, have a central role in the onset and maintenance of such abnormal transmission. These findings also suggest that altered release of keratinocyte expressed neuromodulators (e.g., ATP, CGRP), neurotransmitters (e.g., ACh) or activity of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels could drive changes in transmission and importantly, may do so in a neuron subtype specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male and female mice ages 6–10 wks were used.

The preparation was prepared in the same manner as the skin/nerve/DRG preparation, except the saphenous nerve was cut slightly proximal to the junction with the femoral nerve. Recordings were performed using a bipolar platinum electrode, and stimuli were administered to the epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Culture of primary mouse keratinocytes</title><p>Adult mouse keratinocytes were cultured following the procedure of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Redvers and Kaur, 2005</xref>). Tail skin was digested in dispase II (8 mg/ml dissolved in HBBS containing 1% pen/strep) overnight at 4°C. The epidermal sheet was removed, digested in trypsin-ethylenediamine acid solution (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA) and the dissociated cells plated onto 12 mm glass coverslips coated with type 4 collagen at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/coverslip. Cells were cultured in Keratinocyte Serum Free Medium (K-SFM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.1% pen/strep, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 0.1 nM cholera toxin.

Keratinocytes on coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber that was continuously perfused with extracellular bath solution containing (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl 5.4, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.0, HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid) 10.0 and D-glucose 11.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Cells were visualized using a microscope with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics (Olympus, Pittsburgh, PA, BX-51WI). Patch pipettes made from borosilicate thin walled glass capillaries (Warner Instruments, G150F-6) using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) had a tip resistance of 10–15 MΩ. The composition of pipette solution was (in mM); 135 potassium gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 5 Hepes, 5 ATP-Mg, 0.025 Alexa 555, pH 7.2. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (19°C). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The currents were clamped at −50 mV and a one second blue light pulse was delivered from a xenon light source (Lambda DG-4, Sutter Instrument Company) using a 40x water immersion objective and GFP filter set. Data were digitized using a Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices) and stored and analyzed using pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants T32 NS073548 to KMB and RHM, DK063922 to JJD, NIH AR063772 to SER, NIH NS075760 and NS050758 to BMD, NIH NS023725 to HRK and NIH NS033730 and AR066371 to KMA.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>KMB, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>JJDB, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>PCA, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>RHM, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>JH, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>KHL, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>SER, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>HRK, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>BMD, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>KMA, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), and three reviewers, one of whom, David Ginty, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that uses optogenetics to investigate the role of keratinocytes in modulating sensory neuron firing and subsequent behavioural responses. The paper is important from two angles, firstly at the technical level because it shows that light application to keratinocytes can indirectly activate sensory neurons, and secondly at a conceptual level showing that keratinocyte signalling may have a role in modulating sensory perception. The ChR2 experiments clearly show that optogenetic activation of keratinocytes can evoke activity in several classes of primary afferent neuron. While this had previously been shown for communication between Merkel cells and SA1 afferents, this paper demonstrates that it is also the case for many types of neuron such as A-HTMRs and heat responsive C-fibers, albeit at lower firing frequencies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> contain most of the relevant findings in the study and it would be useful if these were further expanded. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, responses to natural stimuli (mechanical and/or heat stimuli) should be included for fibres in C and D. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, the number of responsive neurons should be subdivided into those where a direct activation was observed or where the effect of blue light was modulatory. Are the A-HTMR fibres Aβ or Aδ units? This should be indicated. A summary table of afferent properties (conduction velocity, sensory thresholds, etc.) would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2) It is possible that afferents that form lanceolate endings (R-LTMRs and C-LTMRs) were not activated because they innervate hair follicles whose keratinocytes were not effectively illuminated due to their depth in skin. Does (<italic>Prph</italic>)-cre label these neurons (labeling of lanceolate endings alone does not address this, because C-LTMRs form lanceolate endings)? This is a potential limitation of the approach that warrants discussion.</p><p>3) Quantification needs improvement. For example, average values for the blue light and yellow light evoked responses in dissociated keratinocytes should be shown. Related to this, with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, the manuscript presents representative electrophysiological traces without providing summary data to illustrate the range of responses observed. Including a clear summary of the data will provide important information for other scientists who wish to build on the foundation presented here. This is particularly important for the data sets analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>4) Controls for genotype are provided for the behavior, but genetic line controls for the physiology experiments are not. We are concerned that three of the neurons that show robust responses are heat-sensitive; is heat from the laser activating these neurons? We would like to see a Cre- or Ai32- control showing that both <italic>K14Cre</italic> and <italic>Ai32</italic> alleles are necessary for the light-evoked response.</p><p>5) Behavioral experiments are also performed demonstrating that in some animals blue light activation of keratinocytes evokes nocifensive responses. These responses are often of long latency (mean 15 seconds) and only occur in 25% of mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is therefore somewhat misleading as it shows latencies as a percent of responsive mice. It would be more accurate to present this as a percent of all mice for each genotype, thereby demonstrating that this is not a strong effect.</p><p>6) To explore whether keratinocytes have a role in the detection of natural stimuli, the authors have performed loss of function experiments using K14-NpHR. These are important experiments but are currently rather preliminary. For example, n numbers are low for some fibre types (CM and CC) or absent (CH, CMC, CMHC). Moreover it is not indicated what the threshold is for responsiveness in these experiments. The samples sizes and thresholds should be noted for these experiments, and additional experiments are needed in some cases to reach the appropriate numbers.</p><p>7) The authors have presented data using a single light pulse applied for durations of around 4 seconds. While analysis of the stimulus intensity versus firing rate is presented, it would also be important to show how stimulus duration and the frequency of light pulses can initiate activity. For example what is the minimum duration and number of pulses that can evoke neuronal activity when comparing direct neuronal stimulation versus keratinocyte stimulation? If such data are currently available, they would be a valuable addition to the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09674.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref> <italic>contain most of the relevant findings in the study and it would be useful if these were further expanded.

Rather we suspect that the labeled lanceolate endings in the (<italic>Prph</italic>)-cre/ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are C-LTMR fibers. Unfortunately we did not record from any C-LTMR fibers in those experiments. It is also possible that in the (<italic>Prph</italic>)-cre/ChR2 mice the level of ChR2 expression is not sufficient to activate APs in these endings.

The output of a thermistor in contact with skin exposed to laser shows that skin temperature increases 1°C from the baseline of 30°C. In the recording experiments the lowest heat threshold of the afferent recorded was 37°C. Thus, it is not possible that the fibers were responding to heat generated by the application of the laser light.</p><p><italic>5) Behavioral experiments are also performed demonstrating that in some animals blue light activation of keratinocytes evokes nocifensive responses.

It would be more accurate to present this as a percent of all mice for each genotype, thereby demonstrating that this is not a strong effect</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for this confusion. All K14-ChR2 mice were responders. Each mouse responded at least one time out of 10 trials with laser stimulation restricted to a 30s maximum (as done in Hargreave’s testing). The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is to illustrate the distribution of the latencies, e.g., 20% of the responders did so between 0-5 seconds, 10% of responders did so between 6-10 seconds, etc. We have modified the text in the Results section to clarify these outcomes.</p><p><italic>6) To explore whether keratinocytes have a role in the detection of natural stimuli, the authors have performed loss of function experiments using K14-NpHR.

To further strengthen the K14-NpHR analysis we have performed more experiments. This data has been incorporated into the revised text and added to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Some fiber types represent a small proportion of fibers in the skin and thus it is difficult to acquire large numbers without performing many more experiments.</p><p><italic>7) The authors have presented data using a single light pulse applied for durations of around 4 seconds.
