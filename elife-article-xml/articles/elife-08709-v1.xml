How these immune receptors detect effectors remains poorly understood. Here we describe the structural basis for direct recognition of AVR-Pik, an effector from the rice blast pathogen, by the rice intracellular NLR immune receptor Pik. AVR-PikD binds a dimer of the Pikp-1 HMA integrated domain with nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex enabled design of mutations to alter protein interaction in yeast and in vitro, and perturb effector-mediated response both in a rice cultivar containing Pikp and upon expression of AVR-PikD and Pikp in the model plant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. These data reveal the molecular details of a recognition event, mediated by a novel integrated domain in an NLR, which initiates a plant immune response and resistance to rice blast disease. Such studies underpin novel opportunities for engineering disease resistance to plant pathogens in staple food crops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08709.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08709.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08709.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant diseases reduce harvests of the world's most important food crops including wheat, rice, potato, and corn. These diseases are important for both global food security and local subsistence farming. To fight these diseases, crops (like all plants) have an immune system that can detect the telltale molecules produced by disease-causing microbes (also known as pathogens) and mount a defence response to protect the plant.</p><p>Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (or NLRs for short) are plant proteins that survey the inside of plant cells looking for these telltale molecules. These receptors have played a central role in efforts to breed disease resistance into crop plants for decades, but little is known about how they work.</p><p>Maqbool, Saitoh et al. have now used a range of biochemical, structural biology and activity-based assays to study how one NLR from rice directly interacts with a molecule from the rice blast fungus. This fungus causes the most important disease of rice (called rice blast), and the fungal molecule in question is also known as an ‘effector’ protein. A technique called X-ray crystallography was used to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the effector bound to part of the NLR called the ‘integrated HMA domain’. Biochemical techniques were then used to measure how strongly the effector (and other related effectors) interacted with this domain of the NLR.</p><p>These results, combined with a close examination of the three-dimensional structure, allowed a set of changes to be made to the effector that stopped it interacting with the NLR protein domain in the laboratory. Maqbool, Saitoh et al. then performed experiments in rice plants and showed that changes to the effector that stopped it interacting with the NLR domain also stopped the effector from triggering a defence response in plants. Similar results were also obtained in experiments that used the model plant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>.</p><p>In the middle of the 20th century, an American plant pathologist called Harold Henry Flor proposed that the outcomes of interactions between plants and disease-causing microbes were based on interactions between specific biological molecules. The findings of Maqbool, Saitoh et al. provide a new structural basis for this model. A detailed picture of these molecular interactions will allow researchers to engineer tailored NLRs that detect a wider range of pathogen molecules. In the future such an approach could contribute to efforts to protect the world's most important crops from plant diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08709.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08709.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>rice blast disease</kwd><kwd>plant disease resistance</kwd><kwd>effector protein</kwd><kwd>integrated sensor domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J00453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maqbool</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Franceschetti</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>CEM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M02198X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franceschetti</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004034</institution-id><institution>John Innes Foundation (JIF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maqbool</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Franceschetti</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>CEM</given-names></name><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24248004, 26292027, 15H05779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saitoh</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Uemura</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanzaki</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Terauchi</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Proposal NGRB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maqbool</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure/function studies of a plant pathogen effector in complex with a host disease resistance protein domain reveal the molecular basis for recognition and underpin future engineering of immunity in crops.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant diseases are a continuous threat to crop production and a major constraint on achieving food security. Rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, is the biggest pre-harvest biotic threat to global rice production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pennisi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). This disease can cause the loss of enough rice to feed 212–742 million people annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>), and result in up to 100% yield loss in infected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The sustainability of rice production is critical, it is a staple food crop for greater than half the world's population.</p><p>Approaches to controlling blast disease have mainly been via the deployment of rice resistance (<italic>R</italic>) genes, which encode intracellular immune receptors known as NLRs (Nucleotide-binding, Leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) Receptors). NLRs are a conserved component of plants' innate immune systems and survey the host environment for perturbations caused by invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dangl and Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chisholm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Hoorn and Kamoun, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</xref>). Most NLRs respond to the presence or activities of translocated pathogen effectors, proteins delivered by adapted pathogens to affect the physiology of the host to benefit the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Win et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wirthmueller et al., 2013</xref>). The recognition event often results in a robust immune response and localised cell death, which limits disease caused by biotrophic pathogens on their hosts. Most NLRs comprise a multi-domain architecture with central nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC) and C-terminal LRR regions. They also usually contain N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or TOLL/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takken and Goverse, 2012</xref>). In at least some cases, NLRs function in pairs to deliver disease resistance, and these pairs can be tightly linked genetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eitas and Dangl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Roux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarris et al., 2015</xref>). The protein:protein interactions that underlie NLR pair function are starting to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), but many unknowns remain.</p><p>Interestingly, most NLR pairs studied to date use one of the NLRs to detect the presence of specific effectors by direct binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cesari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>). One mechanism by which this can be achieved is via unconventional integrated domains in the NLRs (known as integrated decoy or sensor domains) that show evolutionary relationships to putative virulence targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Such domains can be integrated at different positions either before, in-between or after the standard NLR regions and are increasingly identified in NLRs of both model and crop plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>). How these unusual integrated domains function in the direct molecular recognition of effectors, and how this results in initiation of immune signalling, are emerging as fundamental questions in plant NLR biology.</p><p>To date, ∼100 NLRs in rice have been described to confer resistance to strains of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, and 23 of these have been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Identification of the pathogen effectors (also known as AVRs [avirulence proteins]) that are recognised by these NLRs has lagged behind and only six have been cloned to date, AVR-Pia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), AVR-Pita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orbach et al., 2000</xref>), AVR-Pik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), AVR-Pii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), AVR-Piz-t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and AVR1-CO39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ribot et al., 2013</xref>). AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 are recognised by the RGA4/RGA5 NLR pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okuyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cesari et al., 2013</xref>) through direct binding to a Heavy-Metal Associated domain (HMA, also known as RATX1) integrated into RGA5 after the LRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cesari et al., 2013</xref>). RGA4/RGA5 physically interact to prevent cell death mediated by RGA4 in the absence of AVR-Pia; the presence of the effector relieves this suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, the NLR pair Pik-1/Pik-2, which recognises AVR-Pik (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), also binds the effector via an HMA domain but this domain is integrated between the CC and NB-ARC regions of Pik-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The integrated HMA domains of RGA5 and Pik-1 appear to have evolved from a family of rice proteins that only contain the HMA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cesari et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the rice protein Pi21, a disease susceptibility factor, contains an HMA domain that is not part of an NLR protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukuoka et al., 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08709.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representations of (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> AVR-Pik effector alleles with position of polymorphic residues shown, the effector domain is shown in green with the signal peptide (SP) in grey (amino acids are denoted by their single letter codes), (<bold>B</bold>) Rice Pik resistance proteins, highlighting the position of integrated HMA domain in the classical plant NLR architecture of Pik-1 (CC = coiled coil, HMA—Heavy Metal Associated domain, NB-ARC = Nucleotide-binding Apaf-1, R-protein, CED4-shared domain, LRR = Leucine Rich Repeat domain), domain boundaries are numbered, based on the Pikp sequences.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08709.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08709.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08709-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Both AVR-Pik (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the HMA region of Pik-1 exhibit nucleotide polymorphisms between pathogen isolates and rice cultivars that result in changes at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhai et al., 2014</xref>). These changes are most likely associated with co-evolutionary dynamics between <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and rice, predicted to play out at the molecular level via direct protein:protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>). The interaction of AVR-Pik allele AVR-PikD with the Pik-1 NLR Pikp-1 is thought to be the oldest in co-evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>). Cultivars of rice containing the Pikp allele are resistant to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> isolates expressing AVR-PikD, but are susceptible to pathogen isolates expressing other AVR-Pik alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While the structural basis of function and recognition of plant pathogen effectors has advanced in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wirthmueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), only a few studies have focused on the <italic>M. oryzae</italic>/rice system. For example, the only structure known for a <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effector is that of AVR-Piz-t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), which adopts a six-stranded β-sandwich structure and contains a single disulphide bond. To date, there is no available structural information on domains from rice NLRs, and no structural data from any system showing how plant pathogen effectors are directly recognised at the molecular level by an NLR.</p><p>To better understand the mechanisms of direct recognition of effectors by NLRs, we have investigated the interaction between the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effector AVR-Pik and the rice NLR Pikp-1. We determined the affinity of interaction of AVR-PikD to the HMA domain of the rice NLR Pikp-1 (Pikp-HMA) in vitro, and compared the relative binding of AVR-Pik alleles AVR-PikE, AVR-PikA and AVR-PikC to this HMA. The crystal structure of AVR-PikD bound to Pikp-HMA was determined and this guided mutagenesis of the effector, targeting residues at the interface with Pikp-HMA. The binding of these mutants to the Pikp-HMA was tested in yeast and in vitro. We also used a combination of AVR-Pik alleles and AVR-PikD mutants in both the host rice and heterologous <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> systems to probe the degree to which AVR-NLR interactions mediate immunity-related readouts.

The purified effector, with a non-cleavable 6xHis tag at the C-terminus, was immobilised on a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA chip; Pikp-HMA was used as the analyte. Using a multi-cycle kinetics approach, we found that Pikp-HMA bound to immobilised AVR-PikD with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 31 ± 2 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Optimisation of one of these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) produced crystals diffracting X-rays to 1.6 Å resolution. The structure of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex was solved using molecular replacement to position a Pikp-HMA dimer (see below) in the asymmetric unit, followed by automated rebuilding with the sequence of both proteins supplied.

The closest structural homologue of Pikp-HMA (defined by PDBeFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>]) is the HMA domain of yeast protein Ccc2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banci et al., 2001</xref>), overlaying with an r.m.s.d. of 1.58 Å over 72 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Typically, HMA domains bind heavy metals, or lighter cations such as Cu<sup>1+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, via two conserved Cys residues and are involved in metal transport or detoxification pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bull and Cox, 1994</xref>). Interestingly, these Cys residues are not conserved in Pik-1 HMA domains, including Pikp-1. Hence, the Pikp-HMA structure does not contain a metal ion, and the loop between β<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>1</sub>, which usually contains the metal-chelating Cys residues, is disordered. Further, this loop is positioned away from the interface with the effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and does not contribute to complex formation.</p><p>We were also able to obtain the crystal structure of Pikp-HMA in the absence of AVR-PikD (see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1, 2A</xref>). The structure of the Pikp-HMA dimer in isolation is essentially identical to that found in the complex (r.m.s.d. 0.67 Å over 69 residues, for the monomer bound to AVR-PikD), with the exceptions of a minor shift in the loop spanning residues Val222—Lys228 and the N-terminal four residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structure of AVR-PikD in the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex</title><p>AVR-PikD adopts a six-stranded β-sandwich structure, stabilised by a di-sulphide bond between Cys54 and Cys70. The effector contains an N-terminal extension, comprising residues Arg31 to Pro52, prior to the start of this fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>). The extension is anchored to the β-sandwich at each end via a salt–bridge interaction involving the side chains of Asp45 and Arg110 and hydrogen bonds between both the main chain carbonyl of Arg39 and Glu38<sup>Oε1</sup> and Arg64<sup>Nη1</sup>.</p><p>Database searches using PDBeFold reveals that a close structural homologue of AVR-PikD is AVR-Piz-t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), another <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effector protein, despite there being essentially no sequence identity between these proteins (r.m.s.d. = 2.33 Å over 58 aligned residues, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that sequence divergent translocated effectors of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> may share a conserved structural scaffold, despite very different sequences, which has striking parallels to RXLR-type effectors of plant pathogenic oomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutemy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Win et al., 2012</xref>).

In each case, the identified structural homology only extends to the β-sandwich fold and the N-terminal extension of AVR-PikD appears to be unique. This raises the interesting possibility that candidate effectors from distant fungi could be identified by structure-guided sequence similarity searches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Binding interfaces in the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex</title><p>Three primary sites of interaction are apparent between Pikp-HMA and AVR-PikD. The first is dominated by main-chain hydrogen bonding between the C-terminal β-stand of Pikp-HMA and β<sub>3</sub> of AVR-PikD, which results in formation of a continuous antiparallel β-sheet comprising the four β-strands of Pikp-HMA and β<sub>3–5</sub> of AVR-PikD. The second involves the side chain of Pikp-HMA<sup>Asp224</sup>, which forms a salt–bridge interaction with the side chain of AVR-PikD<sup>Arg64</sup>, and is also held in place by a hydrogen bond of its main chain NH group to the side chain of AVR-PikD<sup>Asp66</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The third interaction site centres on AVR-PikD<sup>His46</sup>, although has contributions from residues Asn42—Ile49.

Despite being &gt;20 years since cloning of the first plant NLRs, this is still lacking. While single NLRs can be sufficient to mediate recognition and initiate signalling by either direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</xref>) or indirect binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dangl and Jones, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Hoorn and Kamoun, 2008</xref>), the role of paired NLRs is emerging as a new paradigm for regulating immune responses in plants and mammals. In such cases, one NLR acts as a pathogen ‘sensor’, and can contain a specific domain that mediates this activity, the second acts as an inducer of signalling. Recent studies have addressed the importance of molecular interactions between classical domains in plant NLR pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2014</xref>).

One member of the pair can constitutively activate an HR-like cell death on expression in plants (RGA4 and RPS4), and this activity is suppressed by the second (RGA5 and RRS1) through the formation of hetero-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). This suppression is relieved by co-expression of the cognate effectors and can result in signalling-competent NLR homo-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>). In mammals, members of the NAIP (NLR) family act as sensors of pathogen signatures and associate with NLRC4 following perception to trigger signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kofoed and Vance, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Although it seems unlikely that assemblies of homo- and hetero-NLR complexes in their suppressed and activated states are universally conserved in mammals and plants, it appears that oligomerisation plays a key role in modulating activity.</p><p>In contrast to RGA4 and RPS4, expression of Pikp-2 does not constitutively activate cell death in <italic>Nicotiana.</italic> In our assays, the HR-like response requires co-expression of Pikp-1 and AVR-PikD with Pikp-2, suggesting assembly of an active signalling complex requires all three proteins. Although the limits of our assays preclude a conclusive interpretation of this signalling complex, they do suggest that not all paired plant NLRs function within the confines of existing models. At present it is unknown whether or not Pikp-2 forms a heteromeric complex with Pikp-1 in an effector-dependent manner. Future work is required to dissect the underlying molecular interactions that promote signalling by the Pik NLRs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Polymorphic residue AVR-Pik<sup>46</sup> maps to the direct binding interface between Pikp-HMA and AVR-PikD</title><p>Phylogenetics suggests AVR-PikD is the ancestral AVR-Pik allele, and it is the only natural variant with a His at position 46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>). In the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex, the AVR-PikD<sup>His46</sup> side chain is buried within a pocket on the Pikp-HMA surface that contributes hydrogen bonds/salt bridge interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Interestingly, the only natural variant found at this position is a somewhat conservative His to Asn change (giving rise to AVR-PikE). Conceptually, this residue could be accommodated at the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface without generating significant steric clashes, but the interactions formed at this site (e.g., hydrogen bonding pattern) will be fundamentally different. This single amino acid polymorphism is sufficient to prevent AVR-Pik-dependent cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, limit resistance in rice, and reduce the affinity of interaction with Pikp-HMA in vitro by an order of magnitude. This suggests a binding threshold is required to elicit a response in plants and the observed 10-fold reduced affinity of AVR-PikE for Pikp-HMA in vitro is sufficient for this. While this may be enough to explain why the conservative His46Asn mutation is the only one found in nature, it remains possible that other mutations would not be tolerated due to a trade-off with the effector's virulence activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mutation in other AVR-PikD interfacing residues also prevents Pikp-HMA binding</title><p>Of the other amino acid mutations explicitly designed to disrupt the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interaction, AVR-PikD<sup>Arg64Ala</sup> and AVR-PikD<sup>Asp66Arg</sup> prevented interaction in SPR and yeast, and responses <italic>in planta</italic>.

Close inspection of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface reveals how a Glu could be accommodated at this position. Of note is that AVR-PikD<sup>Ile49</sup> is close to the N-terminus of the Pikp-HMA domain and a repositioning of Pikp-HMA<sup>Gly186</sup>, for example in the context of the full-length protein, could create space for a Glu residue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional naturally occurring AVR-Pik polymorphisms also perturb binding to Pikp-HMA</title><p>AVR-PikA and AVR-PikC combine the AVR-PikD<sup>His46Asn</sup> polymorphism with a Pro47Ala/Gly48Asp substitution and an Ala67Asp substitution respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consistent with this, the AVR-PikD<sup>Pro47Ala/Gly48Asp</sup> mutant showed only slightly reduced affinity for Pikp-HMA in vitro (2.7-fold), interacted with Pikp-HMA in yeast, and elicited responses <italic>in planta</italic>. This data suggests that AVR-PikD<sup>Pro47Ala/Gly48Asp</sup> mutations may provide a minor additive benefit, but AVR-PikD<sup>His46Asn</sup> is the dominant mutation contributing to the evasion of Pikp recognition. It is also plausible that these mutations contribute to the virulence activity of the effector in the context of an Asn at position 46, rather than quantitatively contributing to the evasion of Pik recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Understanding Pik-HMA specificity for AVR-Pik</title><p>Almost all amino acid variation between Pik-1 alleles lies within the HMA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Mapping the variation in Pik-HMAs at the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface suggests a ‘hot-spot’ centred on recognition of AVR-Pik<sup>46</sup>. Pikp-1<sup>Glu230</sup> (Pikp numbering), that directly co-ordinates AVR-PikD<sup>His46</sup>, is a Val in both Pikm-1 and Pik*-1. Residue Pikp-1<sup>Val222</sup>, whose side-chain extends towards Pikp-1<sup>Glu230</sup>, is an Ala in Pikm-1 and Pik*-1. In the absence of specific binding data, none of these mutations in their own right, or when combined, would be predicted to preclude interaction with AVR-PikD (as has been observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>]), but would also not be predicted to explicitly enhance the binding of an Asn at position 46 (as found in AVR-PikE, AVR-PikA and AVR-PikC, which are all recognised by Pikm).</p><p>Three other Pik variable residues map at or close to the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface. Pikp-1<sup>Asp217</sup> is adjacent to the invariant Ser218 (which with Pikp-1<sup>Glu230</sup> co-ordinates AVR-PikD<sup>His46</sup>) and extends towards residue 48 of AVR-PikD. It is conceivable that a His residue at position 217, as found in Pikm-1 and Pik*-1, may interact with residues in this region to extend recognition of AVR-Pik alleles, in particular Asp48 as found in AVR-PikA. Pikp-1<sup>Lys228</sup>, a Glu in Pik*-1 and a Gln in Pikm-1, and Pikp-1<sup>Glu253</sup>, a Met in Pikm-1, form hydrogen bonds with AVR-PikD<sup>Asp66</sup> and AVR-PikD<sup>Lys79</sup> respectively. Interestingly, position 228 is one of two residues that have been suggested as diagnostic markers for Pik breeding in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costanzo and Jia, 2010</xref>). Despite the variation in these Pik residues, as Asp66 and Lys79 are invariant in AVR-Pik alleles, it is difficult to appreciate how they contribute to recognition specificity.</p><p>Teasing apart these seemingly fine-tuned recognition specificities between Pik-HMA and AVR-Pik alleles, and how these are balanced against the virulence-associated activity of the effectors, awaits further study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>A model for activation of rice NLRs containing HMA domains</title><p>Recognition of AVR-Pik by Pik, and AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by RGA5/RGA4, is by direct binding to the HMA domains of Pik-1 and RGA5. The position of the HMA domain, between the CC and NB-ARC region of Pik-1 and after the LRR in RGA5, is one of the most striking differences between these functionally-related proteins. Interestingly, the integrated domain in the Arabidopsis NLR RRS1, a domain with sequence similarity to WRKY transcription factors, is also positioned after the LRR. Cognate effectors AvrRps4 and PopP2 directly interact with this WRKY domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Roux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarris et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these proteins reveal that functional integrated domains can occupy different positions in NLRs.</p><p>How does the binding of effectors to HMA domains trigger immunity-related signalling? The absence of obvious enzymatic activity in the effectors, and a lack of large conformation changes in Pikp-HMA in the AVR-PikD-bound and unbound states, supports the hypothesis that effector binding promotes domain re-arrangements in NLR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>). This could be by (1) direct competition for a shared binding surface on the HMA between the effectors and either an intra- or inter-molecular contact with another NLR domain, (2) the effectors may ‘bridge’ contacts between HMAs and other NLR domains to stabilise interactions, (3) effector binding disrupts or promotes interaction of NLRs with other, as yet unknown, molecules, (4) subtle changes within the HMAs, in the context of the full length proteins, promotes NLR domain rearrangements. Any of these scenarios could break existing and/or promote new interactions within NLR complexes. They could also promote presentation of new molecular surfaces that could interact with downstream components to initiate immunity-related signalling.</p><p>Due to the different positions of the Pik-1 and RGA5 HMA domains, the conformational changes underlying transduction of direct effector binding to immunity-related signalling are likely to be different, but the intra- and/or inter-molecular complexes mediating output maybe conserved. In the future, transferring unconventional integrated domains to the different positions within and between NLRs will determine the importance of domain location, and whether these positions can accommodate novel integrated domains with the potential to deliver new-to-nature resistance capabilities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene cloning: heterologous protein production, Y2H, fungal transformation and <italic>in planta</italic> expression</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>For protein production in insect cells and <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>DNA encoding the Pikp-HMA domain (residues Gly186 to Ser258, codon optimized for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>) was synthesized and supplied in the pOPINF vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berrow et al., 2007</xref>) by Genscript (Pistcataway, NJ, United States).

For interaction studies proteins were prepared in buffer E (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) and all the measurements were recorded using buffer E at a flow rate of 30 µl/min. All experiments were performed using an NTA sensor chip (GE Healthcare). A multi-cycle kinetics approach was used to study interaction between Pikp-HMA and four alleles of effector protein. For each cycle the chip was activated by injecting 30 µl of 0.5 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> over flow cell 2 and His-tagged protein (AVR-Pik) was immobilised on flow cell 2 until a response level of 250 ± 10 was acheived. Different concentrations of Pikp-HMA (ranging from 1 to 1200 nM) and buffer only controls were injected over flow cells 1 and 2 (flow cell 1 was used as reference) for 120 s and dissociation was recorded for another 300 s. Binding responses were recorded at each concentration of Pikp-HMA just before the end of injection and these were then fitted to a steady state affinity model assuming 1:1 binding. The inclusion of buffer-only controls enabled the use of double referencing whereby for each analyte measurement, in addition to subtracting the response in FC 1 from the response in FC 2, a further buffer-only subtraction was made to correct for bulk refractive index changes or machine effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Myszka, 1999</xref>). Interaction studies of Pikp-HMA and AVR-PikD mutants were performed using a single cycle kinetics method. The chip was activated by injecting 30 µl of 0.5 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub> over FC 2 and was used to immobilize His-tagged protein (AVR-PikD mutants) on flow cell 2 to a response level of 250 ± 10. Increasing concentrations of Pikp-HMA (1, 10, 20, 60 and 120 nM) were injected over flow cell 1 and 2 for 120 s. After the final injection the dissociation was recorded for 300 s. Two startup cycles were run where the chip was activated and effector proteins immobilised in the same manner, but buffer only was injected. This was subtracted to account for any dissociation of AVR-PikD mutants from the sensor chip. For both types of kinetic experiments the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 30 µl of 0.35M EDTA. All the data were analyzed using Biacore T200 BiaEvaluation software (GE Healthcare). The raw data was exported and plotted using Microsoft Excel.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Thorsten Nürnberger, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agree that you provide an excellent and very thorough paper that adds significantly to our understanding of how plant NLR receptors recognize pathogen effector proteins in the first step of their activation. NLR activation, still poorly understood at the mechanistic level, leads to successful plant immune response and thus halts pathogen growth. This topic is timely, important and therefore suitable for the <italic>eLife</italic> readership. In particular, the following findings make this work a valuable contribution to the field of plant immunobiology:</p><p>a) The demonstration of physical interaction of a fungal effector with an NLR receptor subunit.</p><p>b) The quantitative analysis of this interaction, which provides evidence that affinities of effectors to NLR immune receptors are in the same range as ligand affinities of AvrPto to Pto and microbial patterns to their cognate plant PRRs.</p><p>c) Comparative mutational analyses that allow to pinpoint high-affinity interactions to individual amino acid residues and thus to deduce a molecular mechanism for immune receptor activation.</p><p>There are, however, a number of concerns you might want to address in a revised submission:</p><p>1) One concern deals with the stoichiometry of the receptor–ligand complex that was determined as 2:1. You state however that it is mostly a 1:1 ratio between the NLR and the effector that is required for biological function. Is there any steric limitation that doesn't allow a second AVR-PikD to interact with the other HMA monomer thereby yielding a heterotetrameric α<sub>2</sub>ß<sub>2</sub> complex?</p><p>2) Another concern is that the authors did not make sufficiently clear what the role of Pikp-2 in AvrPikD-mediated immune activation is and whether or not they could exclude heteromeric complex formation with Pikp-1 in an effector-mediated manner. That could be tested by using recombinant Pikp1 and Pikp2 in the presence and absence of effector in vitro.</p><p>3) As discussed in the manuscript, N46 in AVR-PikE is a polar residue and in principle can form hydrogen bonds with S218 and E230 of HMA. Please provide an explanation for why AVR-PikE has a much weaker affinity with HMA than AVR-PikD.</p><p>4) The 'integrated sensor' vs 'integrated decoy' domain nomenclature does no one outside the field any good in trying to understand how these systems works. To keep using two opposed terms, decoy and sensor, is problematic, especially since the NLR field already has 'sensor' and 'helper' NLRs and that this binary is specifically mapped onto NLR pairs, such as those described here. In this case, the NLR with the newly discovered 'integrated' domain is on the 'sensor NLR', which the paired NLR uses to activate disease resistance. It seems by the authors' terminology that the 'sensor NLR' is a 'sensor integrated domain-containing sensor NLR'. Here, clarification is needed.</p><p>While the arguments that attended the start of this discussion among the experts in this particular field are appreciated, it needs to be demonstrated that, in this particular case, the HMA fusion domain is not a decoy. In fact, as noted, the HMA fusion domain lacks metal binding capabilities required for intrinsic HMA function and is thus most likely a decoy domain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08709.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One concern deals with the stoichiometry of the receptor-ligand complex that was determined as 2:1.

Inspection of the 2:1 complex structure determined here reveals a second AVR-Pik molecule cannot interact with the other HMA domain in the dimer (with the same interaction surface) due to a significant steric clash. This clash predominantly involves AVR-Pik residues 42–48, but also the C-terminus of the effector. It is not possible for a heterotetrameric α<sub>2</sub>ß<sub>2</sub> complex to form.</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the manuscript to clarify this point: “Further, due to steric clash that would occur, it is not possible for an AVR-PikD/Pikp-HMA heterotetramer (2:2 complex) to assemble”.</p><p><italic>2) Another concern is that the authors did not make sufficiently clear what the role of Pikp-2 in AvrPikD-mediated immune activation is and whether or not they could exclude heteromeric complex formation with Pikp-1 in an effector-mediated manner. That could be tested by using recombinant Pikp1 and Pikp2 in the presence and absence of effector</italic> in vitro<italic>.</italic></p><p>In this manuscript we focus on dissecting the direct interaction event between effector and NLR in the AVR-Pik/Pik system (effector binding to the HMA domain of Pik-1). Our in planta experiments show that Pikp-1, Pikp-2 and AVR-PikD together are required for cell death. At this time we do not know the precise role of Pikp-2 in effector-mediated immune activation and can only speculate on this. As we state in the manuscript, we have yet to dissect the pre- and post-activation complexes in the AVR-Pik/Pik system and we cannot confirm or exclude heteromeric complex formation between Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 in the presence or absence of effectors. To further emphasise these points, we have added the following sentence: “At present it is unknown whether or not Pikp-2 forms a heteromeric complex with Pikp-1 in an effector-dependent manner.”</p><p>Producing recombinant full-length NLR proteins, derived from animals or plants, for use in in vitro experiments is very challenging and we have yet to attempt this with Pikp-1 or Pikp-2. We will work towards this in the future.</p><p><italic>3) As discussed in the manuscript, N46 in AVR-PikE is a polar residue and in principle</italic> can <italic>form hydrogen bonds with S218 and E230 of HMA. Please provide an explanation for why AVR-PikE has a much weaker affinity with HMA than AVR-PikD</italic>.</p><p>In the original manuscript we stated: “Conceptually, this residue could be accommodated at the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface without disruption to the interaction. However, this single amino acid…”. With hindsight, this sentence does not fully convey our intent in describing the impact of this variant. In our revision, we now state: “Conceptually, this residue could be accommodated at the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD interface without generating significant steric clashes, but the interactions formed at this site (e.g. hydrogen bonding pattern) will be fundamentally different. This single amino acid…”</p><p>There are many subtleties at interfaces that will dictate overall binding affinities between proteins. As yet, there are not any reliable computational approaches to predict the precise effects of mutations on protein:protein interactions. Inspection of the Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikD complex, with the His-to-Asn mutated in silico, confirms a very different predicted hydrogen-bonding pattern between the proteins. Further, shape complementarity in the binding pocket appears less ideal with Asn. Therefore, in the absence of a Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikE structure, we cannot precisely correlate the experimentally determined reduction in binding affinity of AVR-PikE to Pikp-HMA, compared to AVR-PikD, with specific individual molecular interactions at the interface at this time.</p><p><italic>4) The 'integrated sensor' versus 'integrated decoy' domain nomenclature does no one outside the field any good in trying to understand how these systems works. To keep using two opposed terms, decoy and sensor, is problematic, especially since the NLR field already has 'sensor' and 'helper' NLRs and that this binary is specifically mapped onto NLR pairs, such as those described here. In this case, the NLR with the newly discovered 'integrated' domain is on the 'sensor NLR', which the paired NLR uses to activate disease resistance. It seems by the authors' terminology that the 'sensor NLR' is a 'sensor integrated domain-containing sensor NLR'.

In fact, as noted, the HMA fusion domain lacks metal binding capabilities required for intrinsic HMA function and is thus most likely a decoy domain.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the comment of the reviewers. It is true that the available evidence would suggest that the integrated HMA domain in Pikp-1 is a decoy. However, the experiment suggested by Wu et al<italic>.</italic> (Frontiers in Plant Science 6: 134, 2015), a genetic test to inform whether an integrated domain in an NLR has retained a biochemical activity independent of perception of an avirulence effector, has yet to be performed. Therefore, in this revised manuscript we have used the agnostic term ‘integrated domain’ throughout, except in one place where we state that “…integrated domains in the NLRs (known as decoy or sensor domains) that…”. We hope that this is a satisfactory use of terminology and reflects the views of all experts in the field.</p></body></sub-article></article>
