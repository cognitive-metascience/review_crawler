for successful viral replication. Host cyclophilins (Cyps) have been implicated in viral evasion of host antiviral responses, although the mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we show that hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-opts the host protein CypA to aid evasion of antiviral responses dependent on the effector protein kinase R (PKR). Pharmacological inhibition of CypA rescues PKR from antagonism by HCV NS5A, leading to activation of an interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1)-driven cell intrinsic antiviral program that inhibits viral replication. These findings further the understanding of the complexity of Cyp-virus interactions, provide mechanistic insight into the remarkably broad antiviral spectrum of Cyp inhibitors, and uncover novel aspects of PKR activity and regulation. Collectively, our study identifies a novel antiviral mechanism that harnesses cellular antiviral immunity to suppress viral replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>virus-host interactions</kwd><kwd>innate antiviral immunity</kwd><kwd>viral evasion</kwd><kwd>hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>cyclophilin A</kwd><kwd>protein kinase R</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201411MFE-338606-245517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colpitts</surname><given-names>Che C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome Trust Senior Biomedical Research Fellowship 108183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Research Council 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC (Grant HIVInnate 339223)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>272983813 - TRR 179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartenschlager</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006127</institution-id><institution>Faculty of Health Sciences, Queen's University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Initiation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colpitts</surname><given-names>Che C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CanHepC - Canadian Network on Hepatitis C</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colpitts</surname><given-names>Che C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hepatitis C virus evades IRF1-dependent intrinsic antiviral immunity by exploiting cyclophilin A and its regulation of PKR.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses encounter a remarkable array of intracellular antiviral defences that they must suppress or evade in order to replicate. The cyclophilin (Cyp) family of host proteins have emerged as key players at the virus-host interface. Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a cofactor for a variety of established and emerging viruses, including <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) and dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qing et al., 2009</xref>), as well as <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> such as SARS coronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pfefferle et al., 2011</xref>). Like other Cyps, CypA has peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, which is thought to induce conformational changes in bound target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Heitman, 2005</xref>). Importantly, recruitment of CypA also affects protein complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 1991</xref>). The role of CypA as a viral cofactor is best understood for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), where CypA binds to the viral capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luban et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thali et al., 1994</xref>) to regulate interactions with downstream cofactors and protect the capsid and encapsidated viral genome from cellular innate immune sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which CypA contributes to other viral infections are less well understood.</p><p>Cyps have been implicated in the regulation of viral innate immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>) and innate immune signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Obata et al., 2005</xref>). In the case of HCV, clinical trials demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of CypA suppressed HCV replication and led to elevated type one interferon (IFN) in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopkins et al., 2012</xref>). Given the links between CypA and HCV innate immune evasion, we sought to understand the potential roles of CypA in viral innate immune evasion using HCV as a model. Both CypA binding and resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors (CypI) map to the HCV NS5A protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanoulle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), which has essential roles in HCV replication and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross-Thriepland and Harris, 2015</xref>) and crucially also contributes to immune evasion by several key mechanisms. For example, NS5A is necessary for formation of the membranous replication organelle (RO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romero-Brey et al., 2012</xref>) that cloaks viral RNA replication from cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neufeldt et al., 2016</xref>), preventing innate immune activation. Notably, CypA plays a role in the formation of the RO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Madan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterji et al., 2015</xref>). NS5A also inhibits activation of the key antiviral effector protein kinase R (PKR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gale et al., 1997</xref>) and subsequent PKR-dependent activation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1)-driven antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pflugheber et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here we have used a panel of novel CypI alongside genetics approaches to discover that CypA regulates HCV evasion of PKR and IRF1 antiviral responses, and that diverse CypI overcome this evasion strategy leading to suppression of virus replication. Our findings advance understanding of CypA-HCV interactions and PKR mechanisms, and open perspectives for the development of novel CypA-targeted therapies that harness host intrinsic antiviral responses to combat infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CypA is critical for HCV replication in Huh7 cells, but not in Huh7.5 cells</title><p>To characterise the role of CypA in HCV innate immune evasion, we took advantage of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 and its derivative Huh7.5. Huh7.5 cells were selected for enhanced ability to support HCV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blight et al., 2002</xref>) and spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koutsoudakis et al., 2007</xref>), and also have defective innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumpter et al., 2005</xref>). We silenced CypA and CypB expression in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells by stably expressing specific shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and subsequently evaluated HCV replication using the subgenomic replicon (SGR) model. Silencing of CypB expression inhibited HCV replication by ~100 fold in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with its previously described role in viral RNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watashi et al., 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, silencing of CypA abrogated HCV replication in Huh7 cells but had minimal effect in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed the same inhibition profile when the data were normalised to the input luciferase signal at 4 hr post-electroporation (hpe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that this observation was not due to differences in electroporation efficiency between cell lines. The differential effect of CypA depletion was mirrored by treatment with the classical CypI cyclosporine A (CsA). CsA abrogated HCV replication in Huh7 cells, but only partially inhibited replication in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). CsA also inhibited HCV replication in Huh7.5 cells silenced for CypA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), with similar antiviral potency regardless of CypA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the observed inhibition in Huh7.5 cells may result from inhibition of CypB, which is also a CsA target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2010</xref>). This observation explains the controversy of whether CypA or CypB are HCV cofactors, by demonstrating that both have roles, and suggests differential cofactor requirements between Huh7 and more permissive Huh7.5 cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CypA is critical for HCV replication in Huh7 cells, but not in Huh7.5 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot detecting CypA (<bold>A</bold>) or CypB (<bold>B</bold>) expression in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells transduced with Cyp specific shRNA-expressing lentiviruses as shown.

Silencing of CypA expression, or addition of CsA, completely inhibited HCVcc infection in Huh7 cells, but only weakly inhibited infection in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), which may reflect a role for CypA in HCV assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nag et al., 2012</xref>). To further probe this differential requirement for CypA, we evaluated replication of the CypA-independent NS5A D316E/Y317N (DEYN) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), which was selected by CypI treatment in highly permissive HCV replicating cell lines. HCV DEYN replicated at wild type levels in Huh7.5 cells, but exhibited a 5-fold replication defect in innate immune competent Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The replication defect in Huh7 cells was partially rescued by addition of CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This observation mirrors similar observations for HIV-1 mutants selected to replicate in the presence of CsA in that they too become somewhat dependent on CsA for maximal replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ylinen et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these results confirm that CypA is crucial for HCV replication in innate sensing competent Huh7 cells, but significantly less important for replication in more permissive Huh7.5 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structurally distinct CypI are more potent against HCV replication in Huh7 cells than in Huh7.5 cells</title><p>CsA binds to the cyclophilin active site and forms a ternary inhibitory complex with phosphatase calcineurin, which inhibits T cell proliferation leading to immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 1991</xref>). To confirm that the phenotype we observed with CsA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was due to cyclophilin binding, and not off-target complex formation, and to generate chemical probes suitable for further mechanistic analyses, we synthesized a panel of novel CypI with distinct structures acting by distinct mechanisms. These included novel CsA analogues and synthetic small molecules based on sanglifehrin chemistry termed depsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We also designed and synthesized a CsA-derived proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC; CsA-Prtc1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is expected to recruit the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase to CsA targets, leading to their proteasomal degradation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structures and properties of distinct novel CypI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of CypI used in this study; their effects on viral replication and cell viability are shown in Figure supplement 1.

inhibited HCV more potently in innate immune competent Huh7 cells, we hypothesized that the increased potency might be due to induction of effective innate antiviral responses in parental Huh7 that were lacking in the more permissive Huh7.5 cells. To test this, we evaluated expression of IFN-β mRNA by qPCR after treating HCV-replicating or HCVcc-infected Huh7 or Huh7.5 cells with CsA. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed induction of IFN-β expression in Huh7 cells but not in more permissive Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Intriguingly, CsA-like molecules and structurally unrelated depsins, but not CsA-Prtc1 (which degrades CypA rather than simply binding CypA and affecting complex formation), were capable of inducing IFN-β expression in HCV-replicating Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). One possibility is that activation of IFN-β expression requires the presence of CypA, which is consistent with previous studies suggesting CypA is a necessary co-factor for innate immune sensors, including RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daito et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CypI induce expression of IFN-β and antiviral genes in Huh7, but not Huh7.5, cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Cells electroporated with HCV replicon RNA (<bold>A, C</bold>) or infected with HCVcc (<bold>B</bold>) were treated with 5 μM CsA (<bold>A, B</bold>) or CypI (<bold>C</bold>) 4 hr later.

Electroporation with either wild-type or replication-defective replicon RNA similarly resulted in translation of luciferase from the input RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and induction of IFN-β expression at 4 hr post electroporation (hpe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), reflecting initial transfection of RNA into the cytoplasm. By 24–48 hpe, however, no luciferase activity or IFN-β mRNA expression above the background level could be detected in cells electroporated with the replication-defective replicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Addition of exogenous IFN-β inhibited HCV replication in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), confirming that Huh7 cells are capable of responding to IFN. Although pharmacological inhibition of the Jak/STAT pathway by ruxolitinib treatment rescued HCV replication from inhibition by IFN-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), ruxolitinib treatment had no effect on viral replication in the absence of exogenous IFN-β. Furthermore, ruxolitinib did not affect the potency of CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) or other CypI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) against HCV replication in Huh7 cells, suggesting that the antiviral effect is independent of IFN signalling. The notion that IFN was not required for maximal CypI activity was also supported by an experiment using anti-human interferon alpha/beta receptor chain two antibody (IFNAR) to inhibit IFN activity through receptor blockade. Anti-IFNAR treatment did not affect the potency of CsA against HCV but effectively rescued HCV replication from inhibition by IFN-β in a control experiment. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). The lack of a requirement for IFN in the effect of CypI is likely explained by direct induction of antiviral genes with inhibitory activity against HCV, here exemplified by viperin (<italic>RSAD2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helbig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), in Huh7 but not Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, we propose that in these experiments, CypI induces IFN-independent, cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. However, in vivo, IFN induction would be expected to influence HCV replication and adaptive immune responses and thus the antiviral activity of CypI in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CypI disrupt formation of the HCV replication organelle</title><p>We next sought to identify the mechanisms underlying the observed activation of antiviral genes. CypA has previously been implicated in formation of the HCV RO. Silencing of CypA expression by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterji et al., 2015</xref>) or treatment with a CsA analogue (cyclosporine D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Madan et al., 2014</xref>) inhibited formation of the double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that comprise the HCV RO, thus inhibiting HCV replication. We hypothesised a model in which ‘uncloaking’ of viral RNA, aided by disruption of the RO, and subsequent sensing of exposed cytosolic viral RNA, leads to IFN production in Huh7 cells. To test this model, we first evaluated whether our novel CypI inhibited formation of HCV-induced DMVs. As described previously, we used an NS3-5B expression construct to specifically evaluate DMV formation independently of viral RNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Madan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romero-Brey et al., 2012</xref>). Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells were transfected with the pTM-NS3-5B expression construct and treated with CypI 4 hr later. At 24 hr post-transfection, we evaluated NS5A expression and DMV formation. CypI treatment did not affect expression of NS5A as measured by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, treatment with CsA, depsin or CsA-Prtc1 caused a significant reduction in the number and size of DMVs observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>), suggesting incomplete and impaired formation of the RO.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Antiviral CypI disrupt formation of the HCV replication organelle.</title><p>(<bold>A-E</bold>) Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells were transfected with pTM_NS3-5B and treated with CypI (5X EC90) at 4 hours post-transfection.

We therefore sought to determine which sensors might contribute to detection of viral RNA in the presence of CypI. Huh7 cells are capable of responding to cytosolic RNA and initiating antiviral signalling through RIG-I, MAVS and IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumpter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binder et al., 2007</xref>). However, Huh7.5 cells are less responsive, which may reflect a defect in RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumpter et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the active RIG-I pathway in Huh7 cells contributes to the antiviral signalling induced by CypI. We first evaluated the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and Mda5. We tested the activity of CypI against HCV replication in Huh7.5 cells stably expressing functional RIG-I, Mda5, or both RIG-I and Mda5. These reconstituted cell lines have been described previously and have restored RNA sensing of HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiet et al., 2015</xref>). However, stable expression of RIG-I or Mda5 (or both) had little, if any, effect on HCV replication at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and, more importantly, did not affect the antiviral potency of the CypI in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

We evaluated HCV replication and CypI potency in MAVS KO Huh7 cells compared to control cells generated in the same manner with a non-targeting guide RNA. The loss of MAVS did not affect HCV replication evaluated compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, exogenous expression of WT or HCV protease-resistant MAVS mutant C508R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2005</xref>) into MAVS KO Huh7 cells decreased viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), likely due to induction of interferon responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender et al., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the importance of MAVS and its cleavage by HCV protease in HCV replication. Crucially, the antiviral potency of CypI was unaffected by the absence of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and transfection of the C508R protease-resistant MAVS into MAVS KO Huh7 cells also had no effect on CypI activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, CypI still induced expression of IFN-β mRNA in HCV-replicating MAVS KO Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), indicating that CypI induction of IFN-β expression is not dependant on the RLR/MAVS pathway. It is worth noting that treatment with daclatasvir, an inhibitor that similarly blocks formation of the HCV RO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2014</xref>) and targets domain I of NS5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2010</xref>), inhibits HCV replication without inducing IFN-β expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Therefore, sensing of viral RNA in the presence of CypI is likely not the result of simply ‘uncloaking’ by disruption of the RO but rather through a more complex CypA-dependent mechanism. Notably, NS5A domain II (where CypA binds) is dispensable for RO formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Romero-Brey et al., 2015</xref>) but is required to suppress IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hiet et al., 2015</xref>) and control PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gale et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PKR modulates the antiviral potency of CypI against HCV</title><p>Given the documented role of the CypA target NS5A in binding and inhibiting PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gale et al., 1997</xref>) and the proposed role of CypA in regulating PKR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daito et al., 2014</xref>), we next evaluated a role for PKR in determining CypI potency against HCV. We first compared PKR expression and activation in HCV replicating Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Importantly, PKR was more abundant in Huh7 cells, and, strikingly PKR T446 autophosphorylation (a marker of PKR activation) was observed in Huh7 but decreased in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We hypothesised that PKR may be impaired in sensing HCV RNA in Huh7.5 cells relative to the parental Huh7 cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated Huh7 PKR KO cell lines by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and evaluated the sensitivity of HCV to CypI inhibition in these cells. The antiviral potency of the CypI against HCV replication and HCVcc infection was markedly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>).

One intriguing possibility is that viruses recruit CypA to evade host antiviral responses, evidenced by recent studies implicating CypA in viral innate immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>) and in regulation of innate immune signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, CypA is an exciting target for broadly-acting antiviral intervention based on disrupting viral evasion and harnessing host intrinsic antiviral responses to combat infection. Given that CypA was linked with HCV immune evasion in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopkins et al., 2012</xref>), we sought to understand the potential mechanisms in the context of HCV infection. We found that CypA is crucial for HCV evasion of PKR-dependent, but not RLR/MAVS-dependent, antiviral responses. Furthermore, our results suggest that a deficiency in PKR-dependent responses, as well as defective RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumpter et al., 2005</xref>), may contribute to Huh7.5 cell permissivity for HCV replication, which is consistent with previous observations showing that RIG-I does not play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binder et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, differences in permissivity between Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells are likely governed by a combination of factors, including RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sumpter et al., 2005</xref>) and CD81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koutsoudakis et al., 2007</xref>), among others. Overall, our findings: (a) clarify the role of Cyps in HCV replication, (b) provide mechanistic insight into PKR activity and regulation, and (c) contribute to understanding the broad exploitation of CypA by viruses, opening perspectives for broadly acting antiviral therapies based on disrupting CypA-mediated viral evasion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Clarifying the roles of Cyps in HCV replication</title><p>While Cyps are clearly involved in HCV replication, the respective roles of Cyp family members have been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).

CypI, which target both CypA and CypB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2010</xref>), directly inhibit HCV replication in both Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells by targeting CypB, and they disrupt the CypA-NS5A interaction, thus rendering them more efficacious in Huh7 cells because there they relieve NS5A inhibition of PKR and restore PKR-dependent antiviral responses.

We propose that the ability of HCV to inhibit PKR and evade downstream IRF1 responses depends critically on the CypA-NS5A interaction, and that disruption of this interaction by CypI leads to activation of PKR and engages IRF1-dependent antiviral responses.</p><p>CypA has been proposed as a regulator of PKR activity in the context of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daito et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest that CypA is required for regulation of PKR in a broader context, including activation of IRF1, since targeting CypA for proteolytic degradation by PROTAC (e.g. CsA-Prtc1) blocked the activation of IFN-β or IRF1 target gene expression that we observed with CsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to CsA-Prtc1, CsA disrupts CypA interactions and therefore affects complex formation, but does not cause CypA degradation. Given that CypA regulates protein complexes and that CypA, NS5A and PKR have all been shown to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanoulle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gale et al., 1998</xref>), CypA-NS5A-PKR complex formation likely regulates PKR activation in HCV-replicating cells.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Pietschmann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Colpitts et al. provide a broad and molecularly deep study analyzing the role of cyclophilins in hepatitis C virus replication and infection. They used cyclophilin inhibitors to provide evidence that hepatitis C virus co-opts cyclophilin A in order to evade an antiviral restriction pathway dominated by a PKR-IRF1 pathway. They provide additional data indicating that the observed phenotype is independent of RLH/MAVS-induced interferon pathways. The impact of this study is a deeper understanding of how cyclophilins function as co-factors during viral replication, and how Cyp inhibitors can confer antiviral effects through a new mechanism involving a cell intrinsic antiviral pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Below are compiled comments from the three reviewers, each one numbered by general topic. The reviewers have requested that additional experiments be performed to address #1-3, and possibly #4, whereas point #5 can likely be addressed without new experimentation.</p><p>1) Studies related to further characterizing PKR KO phenotype:</p><p>a) (Reviewer #1) The Huh7 PKR KO phenotype with respect to viral replication is quite modest. If PKR is a major contributor to the permissivity differences between Huh7 and Huh7.5, then KO of PKR in Huh7.5 cells should have little effect on virus. This would be a good control to include. Along these lines, what is the impact of PKR KO on virus production? A concern is that these modest effects on HCV-luciferase RLU are not likely to have a major effect on virus production. Lastly, can the PKR KO effect be re-constituted with CRISPR-resistant PKR? Does ectopic expression of PKR in Huh7.5 cells make them more Huh7-like?</p><p>b) (Reviewer #2) The strongest and most direct piece of evidence supporting the conclusion that HCV uses CypA to evade PKR-dependent antiviral defences rests on Figure 6 and the use of two PKR knock out clones. The presented data show that HCV replication in the two PKR knock out clones is somewhat more resistant to inhibition by CypIs. Concomitantly, the authors show that mRNA induction of IFN-β by HCV is blunted in the PKR KO clones. In the same figure the authors show that a PKR inhibitor decreases the potency of a CypI in parental Huh7 cells but not so much in Huh-7.5 cells (in a previous figure the authors had shown a greater dependence of HCV on CypA in Huh7 compared to Huh-7.5 cells).</p><p>Given the high importance of these data for the main conclusion of the manuscript, in my view the authors should consider cell clonal effects, which potentially could confound this important observation. To this end, the authors could restore PKR expression in the knock out clones. One would expect restoration of HCV sensitivity towards CypIs as well as restoration of antiviral signalling. This would lend further support to the role of CypA in modulation PKR functioning and in turn HCV replication.</p><p>Alternatively/in addition, the authors could over-express PKR in Huh7 cells and explore if this enhances sensitivity to CypIs and also antiviral signalling. Taken together such experiments will extend the foundation of this important conclusion.</p><p>Along similar lines, the experiment displayed in Figure 6G should also include the comparison between Huh7 cells and the Huh7 PKR knock out clones. In support of the model proposed by the authors, one would think that the PKR inhibitor only shifts HCV sensitivity to CypIs in the Huh7 cells expressing functional PKR but not in the knock out clones. Again, this enhances the experimental foundation for the key conclusion of this paper.</p><p>Related to the same Figure 6, the authors should explore if the PKR knock out clones selectively display altered HCV susceptibility to CypIs and not globally to antivirals targeting HCV by different mechanisms (e.g. protease inhibitor, NS5A inhibitor, polymerase inhibitor). While a broad spectrum of different CypIs is already shown in the figure, the authors should consider adding data showing other HCV antivirals.</p><p>2) Studies related to the conclusion that RLR-MAVS-IFN does not contribute to phenotype:</p><p>a) (Reviewer #1) Much of Figure 3 is dedicated to showing that induction of IFN-β correlates to CypI potency in Huh7, but not Huh7.5 cells. In Figure 6, the authors state that IFN-β induction in the presence of CypI is mediated by PKR. Then in Figure 7, the authors make the case that the IFN-β induction is actually not important (based on ruxolitinib experiments), but that antiviral gene expression through a PKR-IRF1 axis is the key pathway.</p><p>The layout of this story was a bit confusing. If IFN-β ends up having no role in the antiviral activity of CypI, why not put this out there up front in Figure 3? This would make the story more clear. That said, the authors should solidify this claim with IFNAR or STAT1 KO cells as genetic proof that IFN-β has no role. Testing IFN-dependent, but IRF1-independent ISG induction would also be a compelling control.

However, based on the data presented here it is unclear how generalizable CypA-targeted therapies that affect host intrinsic antiviral responses to combat other (RNA) virus infections are.

In brief, based on which evidence can the authors conclude that CypA is only needed to evade antiviral defences and not directly in replication? After all, both in the PKR and IRF1 knock out clones CypIs still very powerfully suppress HCV replication (albeit in a somewhat higher dose range). One possibility is that here the role of CypA in supporting RNA replication is blocked, thus causing an antiviral effect. In my view it is very difficult to exclude this in the absence of information as to how specifically the CypIs block CypA versus CypB.</p><p>b) (Reviewer #3) This reviewer is somewhat surprised by the rather marginal effects of CypA KD in Huh7.5 cells on HCV replication. Previous studies e.g. in HCV-adapted Huh7-Lunet (Kaul et al., 2009) or Huh7.5 cells (Gaska et al., 2019 showed) a 100-500 fold decreased in HCV's ability to replicate. How do the authors reconcile these data with their own?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52237.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Below are compiled comments from the three reviewers, each one numbered by general topic. The reviewers have requested that additional experiments be performed to address #1-3, and possibly #4, whereas point #5 can likely be addressed without new experimentation.1) Studies related to further characterizing PKR KO phenotype:</p><p>a) (Reviewer #1) The Huh7 PKR KO phenotype with respect to viral replication is quite modest. If PKR is a major contributor to the permissivity differences between Huh7 and Huh7.5, then KO of PKR in Huh7.5 cells should have little effect on virus. This would be a good control to include. Along these lines, what is the impact of PKR KO on virus production? A concern is that these modest effects on HCV-luciferase RLU are not likely to have a major effect on virus production. Lastly, can the PKR KO effect be re-constituted with CRISPR-resistant PKR? Does ectopic expression of PKR in Huh7.5 cells make them more Huh7-like?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Unfortunately, we did not manage to knock out PKR in Huh7.5 cells before the lab was closed due to COVID-19. As the reviewer suggests, we do not expect this to make a difference to HCV replication but we have not managed to test this. We have therefore not been able to further study the role of PKR in distinguishing HCV permissivity of Huh7 and 7.5. We believe that this omission does not impact the conclusions in the manuscript. We have re-iterated that the differences between Huh7 and 7.5 cells are multifactorial with the following text:</p><p>“Furthermore, our results suggest that a deficiency in PKR-dependent responses, as well as defective RIG-I (Sumpter et al., 2005), may contribute to Huh7.5 cell permissivity for HCV replication, which is consistent with previous observations showing that RIG-I does not play a role (Binder et al., 2007). Indeed, differences in permissivity between Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells are likely governed by a combination of factors, including RIG-I (Sumpter et al., 2005) and CD81 (Koutsoudakis et al., 2007), among others.”</p><p>We did over-express PKR in Huh7.5 cells, which inhibited HCV replication. However, we observed that overexpressed PKR was highly active (autophosphorylated) even in the absence of a stimulus, which does not accurately recapitulate the situation in unmodified cells (e.g. Huh7 cells, Figure 7—figure supplement 2A), where PKR is normally inactive (unphosphorylated) until a stimulus is added. Thus, we have not included these particular data in the manuscript as we believe this would complicate the story, without affecting our conclusions about the CypI mechanism. Moreover, these data are similar to those we obtain in the Huh7 PKR KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), which we have included. We have also discussed the issue of over-expressed PKR being constitutively active as relates to these data.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Huh7 Cells were transduced with lentiviral vector encoding PKR (pSCRPSY-EIF2AK2); transduced cells were selected by addition of puromycin.</title><p>Expression and activation of PKR was evaluated by Western blot.

The presented data show that HCV replication in the two PKR knock out clones is somewhat more resistant to inhibition by CypIs. Concomitantly, the authors show that mRNA induction of IFN-β by HCV is blunted in the PKR KO clones. In the same figure the authors show that a PKR inhibitor decreases the potency of a CypI in parental Huh7 cells but not so much in Huh-7.5 cells (in a previous figure the authors had shown a greater dependence of HCV on CypA in Huh7 compared to Huh-7.5 cells).</p><p>Given the high importance of these data for the main conclusion of the manuscript, in my view the authors should consider cell clonal effects, which potentially could confound this important observation. To this end, the authors could restore PKR expression in the knock out clones. One would expect restoration of HCV sensitivity towards CypIs as well as restoration of antiviral signalling. This would lend further support to the role of CypA in modulation PKR functioning and in turn HCV replication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. The question of re-expression of PKR in the knockout lines is one we had considered. In the original study, we did not test this because we expected that PKR over-expression would induce translation shutdown as has been described previously (e.g. Grolleau et al., 2000), and would confound our results. Nonetheless, we have now stably over-expressed PKR in Huh7 PKR KO cells and evaluated HCV replication and its sensitivity to CsA inhibition. Over-expressed PKR was highly active, as shown by its robust autophosphorylation even in the absence of a stimulus (Western blot in new Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We found that PKR expression had an inhibitory effect on HCV replication, possibly through suppression of host and viral translation (as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of over-expressed PKR). For this reason, this experiment does not strictly recapitulate the situation in Huh7 cells. That is, the over-expressed PKR is already phosphorylated and activated (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2) instead of un-phosphorylated as in Huh7 cells. Therefore, while PKR over-expression reduced HCV replication, it did not affect HCV sensitivity to CsA. We propose that over-expressed PKR cannot enhance CsA sensitivity, because PKR is already activated and suppressing HCV replication independently of CsA-induced antiviral signaling. We had hoped to examine this further, but did not have time before the COVID-19 closure of the lab.</p><p>These data are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, and we have added the following text:</p><p>“We also sought to confirm the role of PKR in CypI activity by over-expressing PKR in Huh7 PKR knockout cells. However, PKR over-expression in itself led to PKR activation, as evidenced by its autophosphorylation (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A). […] This is consistent with previous observations of translation shutdown on PKR overexpression (Grolleau et al., 2000; Barber et al., 1993; Chong et al., 1992; Thomis and Samuel, 1992).”</p><p>In the manuscript (originally Figure 6D, now Figure 7D), we observed highly similar results in two PKR KO clones, which were prepared by single-cell cloning. Furthermore, treatment of cells with a PKR inhibitor (originally Figure 6G, now Figure 7G) led to the same phenotype. We also have more new C16 data supporting a role for PKR (Figure 7G). Thus, while the PKR reconstitution experiment did not yield clear results, we propose that together, these data are sufficiently compelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively/in addition, the authors could over-express PKR in Huh7 cells and explore if this enhances sensitivity to CypIs and also antiviral signalling. Taken together such experiments will extend the foundation of this important conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, PKR over-expression does not accurately recapitulate the situation in naïve cells in that overexpressed PKR is highly active (autophosphorylated) even in the absence of a stimulus. This makes it difficult to evaluate the effect on the sensitivity of HCV to CypI, which we propose relies on more subtle PKR-mediated activation of IRF1, in the absence of translation shutoff. We have instead focused on an alternative approach to provide further evidence for a role for PKR using the PKR inhibitor C16 (Figure 7G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along similar lines, the experiment displayed in Figure 6G should also include the comparison between Huh7 cells and the Huh7 PKR knock out clones. In support of the model proposed by the authors, one would think that the PKR inhibitor only shifts HCV sensitivity to CypIs in the Huh7 cells expressing functional PKR but not in the knock out clones. Again, this enhances the experimental foundation for the key conclusion of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very helpful suggestion. We have now compared the effect of the C16 PKR inhibitor in Huh7 and Huh7 knocked out for PKR. The result was as expected and PKR knockout prevents the effect of C16 on CsA sensitivity.</p><p>These new data are included as Figure 7G. We have added the following to the text:</p><p>“C16 decreased CsA potency in Huh7 cells, but not in Huh7 PKR KO cells (Figure 7G), and only minimally affected CsA potency against HCV in Huh7.5 cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the same Figure 6, the authors should explore if the PKR knock out clones selectively display altered HCV susceptibility to CypIs and not globally to antivirals targeting HCV by different mechanisms (e.g. protease inhibitor, NS5A inhibitor, polymerase inhibitor). While a broad spectrum of different CypIs is already shown in the figure, the authors should consider adding data showing other HCV antivirals.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another important point. We have now evaluated the antiviral activities of daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) and telaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor) in Huh7 and Huh7 PKR KO cells. As expected, the presence or absence of PKR did not affect HCV sensitivity to these other inhibitors. These data are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 3. We have added the following text:</p><p>“We next tested whether the absence of PKR broadly affects the sensitivity of HCV to the antiviral activity of telaprevir (NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) in Huh7 and Huh7 PKR KO cells. […] Collectively, these data are consistent with a specific role for PKR in the enhanced antiviral activity of CypI in Huh7 cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Studies related to the conclusion that RLR-MAVS-IFN does not contribute to phenotype:</p><p>a) (Reviewer #1) Much of Figure 3 is dedicated to showing that induction of IFN-β correlates to CypI potency in Huh7, but not Huh7.5 cells. In Figure 6, the authors state that IFN-β induction in the presence of CypI is mediated by PKR. Then in Figure 7, the authors make the case that the IFN-β induction is actually not important (based on ruxolitinib experiments), but that antiviral gene expression through a PKR-IRF1 axis is the key pathway.</p><p>The layout of this story was a bit confusing. If IFN-β ends up having no role in the antiviral activity of CypI, why not put this out there up front in Figure 3? This would make the story more clear. That said, the authors should solidify this claim with IFNAR or STAT1 KO cells as genetic proof that IFN-β has no role. Testing IFN-dependent, but IRF1-independent ISG induction would also be a compelling control. Further, if IFN-β has no role here, then IFN bioassays (i.e., transferring soups and testing for inhibition of IFN-sensitive virus like VSV) would further bolster the claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now re-structured the manuscript to present the IFN-β/ruxolitinib data earlier, in what is now Figure 4. We have also sought to clarify that the observed phenotype is not dependent on IFN-β signalling and IFN induced gene expression, but is rather a cell-intrinsic response (i.e., gene expression dependent on PKR-IRF1 activation) with IFN-β being one of many antiviral genes induced upon CypI treatment of Huh7, but not Huh7.5 cells. We now show the activation of other antiviral genes, which are predominantly IRF1-dependent, in Figure 4. To confirm that the effect is not mediated by IFN, we performed further experiments using an interferon receptor (IFNAR) blocking antibody. As for ruxolitinib, IFNAR blockade did not affect the CypI potency against HCV, although it did rescue HCV replication from the inhibitory effect of IFN. This data is presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>We have added the following text:</p><p>“The notion that IFN was not required for maximal CypI activity was also supported by an experiment using antihuman interferon alpha/beta receptor chain 2 antibody (IFNAR) to inhibit IFN activity through receptor blockade. […] However, in vivo, IFN induction would be expected to influence HCV replication and adaptive immune responses and thus the antiviral activity of CypI in patients.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) (Reviewer #2) Exclusion that RLR/MAVS-dependent antiviral responses do not play a role is one major conclusion of this study. Therefore, it seems worthwhile to confirm the unresponsiveness of the cells employed here (and published previously) to RLR/MAVS-dependent viral danger signals.</p><p>c) (Reviewer #3) The authors provide data suggesting that CypI induced antiviral signaling is not dependent on RIGI and MAVS. Important controls would be to show that known RLH agonist actually trigger this pathway in their cells, i.e. the cells are signaling competent.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we did not manage to complete this experiment before our qPCR machine was requisitioned for COVID-19 testing outside UCL. Nonetheless, RLR/MAVS-dependent antiviral responses have previously been documented in Huh7 cells and we have now cited these studies more prominently. We have added new text reiterating this point:</p><p>“Huh7 cells are capable of responding to cytosolic RNA and initiating antiviral signalling through RIG-I, MAVS and IRF3 (Sumpter et al., 2005; Binder et al., 2007). […] Therefore, we first hypothesized that the active RIG-I pathway in Huh7 cells contributes to the antiviral signalling induced by CypI.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Studies related to HCV genotype:</p><p>(Reviewer #3) It has been previously been shown that non-JFH1 gts (e.g. Con1) maybe more sensitive to CypA depletion even in Huh7.5 cells. Thus, it would be important to confirm some of the critical data presented here with non-JFH1 based replicons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We attempted to evaluate replication of the Con1 (genotype 1b) replicon (Lohmann et al. 2003 J. Virol. 77: 3007-3019). Despite significant effort, we were unable to get the Con1 replicon to replicate in our Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells. In the past month, we obtained the Huh7-Lunet cell line, which better supports Con1 replication. We were able to observe weak replication in Huh7-Lunet cells, but ran out of time before the COVID-19 lab closure and were unable to evaluate the effect of CypA depletion or CypI treatment in the presence or absence of PKR in the Huh7-Lunet cell line.</p><p>Importantly, Kaul et al., 2009, evaluated replication of the Con1 replicon in CypA-depleted Huh7-Lunet cells and Huh7.5 cells. CypA depletion in Huh7-Lunet cells profoundly inhibited HCV replication by approximately 3 logs at 48 hours, and had a lesser impact in Huh7.5 cells (Kaul et al., 2009, Figure 2B). These data suggest that our findings are relevant for other HCV genotypes and we now cite this study to make this point in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Notably, a differential requirement for CypA in Huh7-Lunet and Huh7.5 cells has also been observed for replication of genotype 1b (Con1) and genotype 2a (JFH-1) replicons (Kaul et al., 2009), suggesting that these mechanisms are consistent across HCV genotypes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Concern about the claim that this mechanism is broadly applicable to other viruses:</p><p>(Reviewer #3) The authors argue that one of the premises of their study was to investigate the role of CypA for other non-HIV viruses.

To address this concern, we have limited our discussion in the current manuscript to HCV, with the exception of where we have cited literature describing other viruses and CypA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Additional major concerns that may be addressable without new experimentation:</p><p>a) (Reviewer #2) I was somewhat confused by the authors Discussion related to the differential relevance of CypB and A for HCV infection (subsection “Clarifying the roles of Cyps in HCV replication”).

This was partly due to a typographical error where we had mixed up CypA and CypB in the original Discussion. This is now fixed in the new text. To further address this point, we have added a new panel showing that CypA depletion does not impact CsA activity over a CsA dose range in Huh7.5 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), rather than just a single dose as we had shown previously (Figure 1E). We have also clarified the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Here, our data support a direct role for CypB in HCV RNA replication (Watashi et al., 2005), which is consistent with it being equally required in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells (Figure 1C). In contrast, the requirement for CypA varies according to cell line and appears to be important for evasion of host antiviral responses in innate sensing competent cells (i.e., Huh7) (Figure 1C).”</p><p>We have referred to the new data as follows:</p><p>“CsA also inhibited HCV replication in Huh7.5 cells silenced for CypA expression (Figure 1E), with similar antiviral potency regardless of CypA expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) (Reviewer #3) This reviewer is somewhat surprised by the rather marginal effects of cypA KD in Huh7.5 cells on HCV replication. Previous studies e.g. in HCV-adapted Huh7-Lunet (Kaul et al., 2009) or Huh7.5 cells (Gaska et al., 2019 showed) a 100-500 fold decreased in HCV's ability to replicate. How do the authors reconcile these data with their own?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight in neglecting to include this in our Discussion. Gaska et al., 2019, evaluated the effect of CypA knockdown using HCVcc infection models. CypA has been suggested to be involved in additional steps of HCV infection, such as assembly, which would not have an effect in our replicon assay. In our HCVcc assays, CypA depletion in Huh7.5 cells decreased HCVcc infection by 1-2 logs (Figure 1F), which is consistent with what has been observed in the literature. We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion to reconcile this data with our own:</p><p>“CypA has been proposed to have a role in HCV assembly (Nag et al., 2012; Anderson et al., 2011), which is likely reflected by our observation that CypA depletion in Huh7.5 cells decreased HCVcc infection (Figure 1F), but not replication of the HCV replicon (Figure 1C). This is consistent with previous studies showing a large decrease in HCVcc infection in Huh7.5 cells silenced for CypA expression (Gaska et al., 2019).”</p><p>With regards to the study by Kaul et al., 2009), only a small decrease in HCV replication in CypA-depleted Huh7.5 cells was observed at 48 hours (Kaul et al., Figure 2A). This is consistent with our data, in that we do see a ~2-fold decrease in HCV replication in Huh7.5 CypA knockdown cells. We have replotted the data on a linear scale and have shown it in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> to highlight this point. Kaul et al. observed a more pronounced defect in HCV replication at 48 hours in CypA-depleted Huh7-Lunet cells (Kaul et al. Figure 2A), which is consistent with our observations as well. We have added a sentence to our Discussion to support this:</p><p>“Notably, a differential requirement for CypA in Huh7-Lunet and Huh7.5 cells has also been observed for replication of genotype 1b (Con1) replicons and genotype 2a replicons (Kaul et al., 2009), suggesting that these mechanisms are consistent across HCV genotypes.”</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>HCV replication in CypA-depleted Huh7.5 cells.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52237-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
