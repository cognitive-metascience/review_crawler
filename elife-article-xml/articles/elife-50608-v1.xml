for examining the ecological and evolutionary tradeoffs associated with alternative phenotypes. Here, we investigated the genetic cause of the pea aphid (<italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>) male wing dimorphism, wherein males exhibit one of two morphologies that differ in correlated traits that include the presence or absence of wings. We mapped this trait difference to a single genomic region and, using third generation, long-read sequencing, we identified a 120 kb insertion in the wingless allele. This insertion includes a duplicated <italic>follistatin</italic> gene, which is a strong candidate gene in the minimal mapped interval to cause the dimorphism. We found that both alleles were present prior to pea aphid biotype lineage diversification, we estimated that the insertion occurred millions of years ago, and we propose that both alleles have been maintained in the species, likely due to balancing selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic></kwd><kwd>polymorphism</kwd><kwd>dispersal</kwd><kwd>wing dimorphism</kwd><kwd>genetic mapping</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM116867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brisson</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-BSV7-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Jean-Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The application of long-read sequencing to the pea aphid wing dimorphism system reveals genomic structural divergence as a genetic mechanism of adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionary loss of flight ability in insects has long been leveraged to study the patterns and processes of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison, 1980</xref>). The loss of flight has occurred repeatedly across insect orders, such as ants, termites, beetles, crickets, and aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>), with such evolutionary shifts to flightlessness co-occurring with entry into stable or isolated habitats where flight is unnecessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner and Liebherr, 1992</xref>). Loss of flight allows animals to shift resources toward production of offspring instead of flight appendages and fuel. Flight-capable and flight-incapable insects therefore present an evolutionary trade-off between dispersal and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison, 1980</xref>). This tradeoff is sometimes observed within species, where some individuals develop with wings and others are wingless. We focus here on wing dimorphisms that are under genetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roff, 1986</xref>), although some species display phenotypically plastic wing dimorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Wing dimorphisms offer an appealing system for exploring the genetic basis of adaptation because of their relatively simple genetic architectures. In species of weevils, ground beetles, and dung flies, for example, a single locus controls each species’ wing dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roff, 1986</xref>). Other dimorphisms are polygenic, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roff (1986)</xref> found that eight of 22 species exhibited Mendelian inheritance. Transitions between flight-capable and flight-incapable morphs have probably evolved thousands of times in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner and Liebherr, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Whiting et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the importance of alternative winged and wingless morphs in insect adaptation, none of the loci controlling wing dimorphism have yet been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saastamoinen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the genetic basis and evolution of the pea aphid (<italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>) male wing dimorphism. Pea aphid males exhibit distinct winged and wingless adult phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and differ in a set of correlated traits. Winged males have well-developed fore and hind-wings, and direct and indirect flight muscles, while wingless males have a smaller thorax, and lack wings and associated flight musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon and Howard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braendle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogawa et al., 2012</xref>). The males also differ behaviorally; winged males are more active than wingless males and thus may gain more mating opportunities with females in competitive trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sack and Stern, 2007</xref>), while the wingless males do not fly and thus avoid the high mortality associated with flight. Unlike the aphid asexual female polyphenism where environmental cues like high density and low food quality lead to the production of winged versus wingless female morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon, 1973</xref>), the male polymorphism is genetically determined. A single locus with two alleles on the X chromosome called <italic>aphicarus</italic> (‘aphid’ plus ‘Icarus’, <italic>api</italic>) controls male morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braendle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caillaud et al., 2002</xref>). Male aphids carry only a single X chromosome (females are XX, males are XO), so males carry only a single winged or wingless allele. The correlated anatomical and behavioral traits suggest that the causal locus can regulate development, and perhaps physiology, in multiple anatomical domains. We found that a large structural variant, resulting from a duplication event, underlies the winged versus wingless differences. We then explore the evolutionary history of this locus, including the maintenance of the duplication polymorphism and its distribution in present-day populations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Linkage and association mapping of <italic>api</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Winged (top) and wingless (bottom) males.

The locus was previously localized to a 10 cM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braendle et al., 2005</xref>), a large region consisting of hundreds of genes. We took a two-pronged mapping approach to narrow down the <italic>api</italic> region. First, we crossed males and females from the F1 line from the original mapping population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braendle et al., 2005</xref>) to generate additional F2 individuals. We performed multiplexed shotgun genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andolfatto et al., 2011</xref>) to simultaneously identify and score single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 164 of these F2s. QTL analysis of these data using a recently published chromosome-level assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2019</xref>) resulted in a single LOD peak on the X chromosome (LOD 10.8, with a 1% LOD permutation threshold of 3.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Second, we performed genome-wide association mapping using 44 winged and 44 wingless males collected across the U.S. from alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>) fields (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We pooled the 44 winged and wingless males separately and performed Illumina resequencing to high coverage for a total of 68X and 70X coverage, respectively. F<sub>ST</sub> analysis between the winged and wingless sequenced pools revealed a single, large F<sub>ST</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>) close to the LOD peak from the QTL analysis.</p><p>We further refined the <italic>api</italic> region by assaying restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers on a panel of 40 F2 individuals that each carried a recombination event between the previous closest <italic>api</italic> flanking markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braendle et al., 2005</xref>). Two markers displayed perfect association with all 40 F2s, narrowing the <italic>api</italic> interval to a ~ 190 kb region (see the green vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, spanning positions from 62.56M to 62.75M). Hereafter, we will use the term ‘<italic>api</italic> region’ to refer to this genetically defined region.</p><p>We then used an additional set of fully sequenced pea aphid genomes to independently verify the genomic location of <italic>api</italic>. The pea aphid is a species complex with as many as 15 host specialized lineages, called biotypes, that probably began diverging 500,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fazalova and Nevado, 2019</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peccoud et al., 2009b</xref>). Biotypes have limited gene flow between them, and the ones with the least genetic exchange have been described as incipient species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peccoud et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peccoud et al., 2009b</xref>). We used the complete genomes of 23 individual genotypes from nine different biotypes to investigate patterns of association in the <italic>api</italic> region: nine winged allele carrying genotypes from five biotypes, and 14 wingless allele carrying genotypes from six biotypes (two biotypes, pea and alfalfa, had individuals of both allele classes; we sequenced males of these individuals to separately sequence the two X chromosomes). SNPs across the <italic>api</italic> region segregated perfectly with the male winged or wingless phenotype across these biotype samples. Thus, data from linkage mapping, and the association study within and between biotypes, all confirm the same genomic location of the causative <italic>api</italic> locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome sequencing reveals a structural variant that differentiates the two alleles</title><p>Given the lack of a contiguous reference sequence in the <italic>api</italic> region in the previous assembly of the reference genome (v2.0), we separately sequenced the genomes of an F2 female homozygous for the winged (W) allele to 28x coverage and an F2 female homozygous for the wingless (WL) allele to 11x coverage using Nanopore long-read sequencing. For each allele, we assembled contiguous sequences that spanned the entire <italic>api</italic> region (WL scaffold ID = utg000342l; W scaffold ID = tig00159082l). We identified a ~ 120 kb insertion in the WL scaffold relative to the W scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left axis). The SNPs that originally identified this genomic region in the linkage and association mapping are adjacent to, and thus linked to, this insertion. The pool-seq reads from wingless males (generated for the association mapping discussed above) generated the same level of coverage across this insertion (including reads that cross the insertion boundaries) as the surrounding sequence, while the winged male pool-seq reads did not map to this inserted region, confirming the absence of this sequence in winged male genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This 120 kb insertion is not assembled correctly in the original pea aphid genome published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">International Aphid Genomics Consortium (2010)</xref>, which is homozygous for the wingless allele, so a portion of this region is present in that assembly as a separate contig. In the more recent, near-chromosome length assembly of the pea aphid genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2019</xref>), the authors reported linkage of an approximately 50 kb insertion to the <italic>api</italic> locus. However, we found that the <italic>api</italic> region is incompletely assembled in this new assembly as well. We therefore use our new, wingless assembly for the remainder of this work.</p><p>To determine whether this indel represents an insertion in the wingless allele or a deletion in the winged allele, we aligned the winged and wingless <italic>api</italic> scaffolds against homologous genomic scaffolds from three other aphid species, the peach-potato aphid (<italic>Myzus persicae</italic>), an unidentified species from the <italic>Carolinaia</italic> genus (<italic>Carolinaia spp</italic>.), and the Russian wheat aphid (<italic>Diuraphis noxia</italic>) (other available aphid genomes were not used because they did not have scaffolds that spanned this region). The peach-potato aphid produces only winged males and the Russian wheat aphid produces only wingless males. We do not know the male phenotype of the <italic>Carolinaia</italic> species. We observed that the pea aphid wingless scaffold contained ~120 kb of sequence not present in other species, while the pea aphid winged scaffold exhibited nearly complete synteny across the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right axis, for comparison to the <italic>Carolinaia spp.</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for comparison to all three aphid species). Thus, the ~120 kb sequence in the wingless allele is an evolutionarily derived insertion that occurred in the lineage that led to pea aphids. The majority of the species closely related to the pea aphid produce only winged males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), so the wingless phenotype is likely the derived phenotype. Thus, both the wingless male phenotype and the insertion appear to be derived characteristics of pea aphids.</p><p>To investigate the source of this inserted sequence, we used a BLASTn analysis of the ~120 kb wingless-specific region against our newly reconstructed pea aphid genome. This analysis revealed that approximately half of the inserted sequence showed similarity to another region of the reference genome (scaffold utg000238I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), which is on an autosome. Thus, most of the inserted sequence at <italic>api</italic> is derived from a duplication of an autosomal region. The remainder of the insertion is largely composed of complex repeats which are likely the result of mobile element insertions that occurred after the duplication event.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A candidate <italic>follistatin</italic> gene in the inserted sequence</title><p>Annotation software (Augustus v.3.3.1) predicted 12 open reading frames (ORFs) in the wingless <italic>api</italic> insertion.

A search of four other published aphid genomes revealed only a single <italic>fs</italic> copy in each species. The other aphid genomes are significantly diverged from the pea aphid; the most closely related genome to the pea aphid is that of the peach-potato aphid, which diverged from the pea aphid over 40 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore used the Illumina technology to sequence the genome of the rose aphid, <italic>Macrosiphum rosae,</italic> which diverged from the pea aphid more recently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hardy et al., 2015</xref>), although the exact divergence time is unknown. We examined the relationships among the <italic>fs</italic> homologs relative to the species tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). <italic>fs-1</italic> has a slower rate of evolutionary change compared to the <italic>fs-2</italic>/<italic>fs-3</italic> lineage, suggesting that <italic>fs-1</italic> likely retains the ancestral <italic>follistatin</italic> function.</p><p>The <italic>fs</italic> gene tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) shows that there have been two <italic>fs</italic> duplication events. The first duplication created <italic>fs-1</italic> and <italic>fs-2/3</italic>. It occurred around the time that the Macrosiphini aphids represented here (the peach-potato, <italic>Carolinaia spp</italic>., rose, and pea aphid) diverged from one another about 42 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). The rate of synonymous substitution (dS) between <italic>fs-1</italic> and the <italic>fs-2</italic>/<italic>fs-3</italic> lineage is consistent with this divergence time: the average dS between the peach-potato aphid and the pea aphid is 0.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2016</xref>), while dS between <italic>fs-1</italic> and <italic>fs-2</italic> or <italic>fs-3</italic> are very similar at 0.28 and 0.29, respectively.</p><p>Despite this ancient duplication, of the species examined here, we found <italic>fs-2</italic> and <italic>fs-3</italic> only in the pea aphid genome (and not the rose aphid or the <italic>Carolinaia spp</italic>. aphid). More recently, <italic>fs-2/3</italic> duplicated to produce <italic>fs-2</italic> (the autosomal, <italic>api</italic>-source copy) and <italic>fs-3</italic> (the copy found solely in the pea aphid wingless allele). The most parsimonious explanation for these patterns is that the initial duplication that gave rise to the <italic>fs-2/3</italic> lineage arose after the split of the pea aphid and the peach-potato aphid, and this duplicate copy was subsequently lost in the rose aphid lineage. The ambiguity of the timing, and the limited taxon sampling, however, do not preclude other evolutionary scenarios. Future sequencing of more aphid genomes would provide insight into the timing of the emergence of these paralogs.</p><p>All pairwise dN/dS comparisons using <italic>fs</italic> copies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> resulted in values less than one (range of 0.03–0.21, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), indicating purifying selection acting on all copies. Thus, all three <italic>fs</italic> paralogs seem to be functional genes. Although all three <italic>fs</italic> genes appear to be functional, <italic>fs-3</italic> is only present in the WL insertion, which is not found in winged males. Therefore, <italic>fs-3</italic> is not required for aphid survival, although it appears to provide a benefit to individuals that carry it.</p><p>To examine if <italic>fs-3</italic> is expressed in wingless males, we performed RT-PCR on cDNA collected from winged and wingless males across three developmental stages (late stage embryos, 1<sup>st</sup> instar nymphs, and 2<sup>nd</sup> instar nymphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We did not perform RT-qPCR for this gene because our experimental design was aimed at confirming that the gene was indeed expressed, and not to perform an analysis of comparative expression levels. The winged allele lacks <italic>fs-3</italic> and thus winged males show no expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the wingless males expressed <italic>fs-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Female samples are also shown for comparison. Winged and wingless males are morphologically distinct by the second nymphal instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ogawa et al., 2012</xref>), so the developmental timepoint of morph determination must occur before this stage. In the phenotypically plastic pea aphid females, wing morph determination occurs embryonically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutherland, 1969</xref>). We reasoned that the action of <italic>api,</italic> and thus morph determination, likely begins at the embryonic stage and possibly persists throughout development. <italic>fs-3</italic> gene expression present at these early developmental stages is consistent with this expectation. <italic>fs-3</italic> is a strong candidate gene for causing the wingless phenotype, but other genes within or flanking the WL insertion cannot be ruled out as contributing to, or causing, male winglessness. For example, there is high sequence divergence between the winged and wingless alleles in the flanking sequence. In the 10 kb to the right of the insertion we observe ~6% divergence in the alignable portion of the sequence, plus indels that range from 1 to 920 bp. Many SNPs in the flanking region are strongly associated with the male phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We examined whether gene expression patterns for other genes in this region are consistent with their potential role in causing male winglessness. There are five genes present in the pea aphid genome annotation that are outside of the insertion, but inside or partially inside the minimal <italic>api</italic> region (pea aphid genome annotation v3.0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We provided names to these five genes as follows: two aphid-specific genes (<italic>as1</italic>, <italic>as2</italic>; neither gene contains conserved domains and therefore their possible functions are unknown), a predicted mitochondrial sorting and assembly gene (<italic>sam50)</italic>, a predicted fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate gene (<italic>frs2)</italic>, and a predicted chromodomain-encoding gene (<italic>cdg).</italic> We found no nonsynonymous polymorphisms in these genes that perfectly segregate with the <italic>api</italic> phenotype across the pool-seq and biotype data. Any mutations that contribute to the winged and wingless males would, therefore, likely be regulatory. We therefore measured the expression levels of the five genes (<italic>as1</italic>, <italic>as2</italic>, <italic>sam50</italic>, <italic>frs2</italic>, and <italic>cdg</italic>) using RT-qPCR. We focused on two developmental stages, embryos and first instar nymphs, as the likely critical times as explained above. <italic>as2</italic> is not expressed in males at these stages. Of the four other genes (<italic>as1</italic>, <italic>sam50</italic>, <italic>frs2</italic>, and <italic>cdg)</italic>, none were significantly differentially expressed after multiple comparison correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, although <italic>as1</italic> embryos had an uncorrected t-test p-value=0.013; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). We therefore found no strong evidence that these genes contribute to the male wing dimorphism.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that <italic>fs-3</italic> is the male morph determination gene. <italic>fs-3</italic> is present in all wingless males and absent from winged males. It is not essential for aphid survival because winged males do not have it. Yet, <italic>fs-3</italic> is under purifying selection and its coding sequence has persisted, intact, for thousands of generations. The maintenance of <italic>fs-3</italic> suggests that it provides a selective advantage, but this advantage can be present only in individuals that have <italic>fs-3</italic> (<italic>i.e</italic>., only wingless males or females carrying this allele). Furthermore, <italic>fs-3</italic> is expressed at the relevant time for mediating morph determination. A transgene rescue or mutational knock-out experiment (ideally both) are ultimately required to determine whether <italic>fs-3</italic> causes the male wing polymorphism.</p><p>The function of <italic>fs</italic>, as studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, provides insight into how <italic>fs-3</italic> might function in the pea aphid male wing polymorphism. The sole <italic>Drosophila fs</italic> gene encodes a protein, Fs, that binds activins to affect TGF-β/activin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bickel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pentek et al., 2009</xref>). Overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bickel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pentek et al., 2009</xref>) revealed two potentially relevant Fs roles: regulation of cell proliferation and regulation of ecdysone receptor expression in the brain. For the former, wings were smaller in <italic>fs</italic> overexpression mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bickel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pentek et al., 2009</xref>). In the pea aphid wingless males, expression of an additional <italic>fs</italic> copy could negatively regulate cell proliferation in the wing and wing musculature, resulting in a lack of growth. For the latter, <italic>fs</italic> overexpression caused phenotypes that mimicked disruption of ecdysone signaling; the authors posited that there is a potentially underappreciated interaction between activin signaling and ecdysone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pentek et al., 2009</xref>). This is particularly intriguing because the pea aphid plastic, female wing dimorphism is regulated, at least in part, by ecdysone signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>). Pea aphid <italic>fs-3</italic> might, therefore, directly or indirectly activate ecdysone signaling in a tissue-specific manner during the development of the wingless morph, causing it to display the wingless male phenotype. So, rather than using an environmental cue to activate ecdysone signaling and to ultimately cause winged versus wingless developmental events, as in the pea aphid female polyphenism, the males may begin the process using the <italic>fs-3</italic> gene product. Future work is required to determine whether or not <italic>fs-3</italic> influences TGF-β/activin signaling in the pea aphid and how these changes might alter the male phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Evolution at the <italic>api</italic> locus</title><p>To investigate the evolution of the <italic>api</italic> region within the pea aphid species complex, we used the 23 individually sequenced pea aphid genomes from nine biotypes discussed above.

We first explored the distribution of dS values for all genes between two divergent biotypes, a <italic>Lathyrus pratensis</italic> biotype genome (Lap1 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and a <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> biotype genome (Ms3 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Even between these divergent biotypes, most genes had few differences, with a median dS of 0.0035 (orange distribution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata6">Source data 6</xref>). In contrast, the three expressed genes with exons within the <italic>api</italic>-adjacent region had dS values between winged and wingless alleles that are an order of magnitude higher than the average of all genes: 0.045 (as1), 0.035 (sam50), and 0.036 (frs2) (vertical dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Even more strikingly, dS between <italic>fs-3</italic>, the <italic>follistatin</italic> copy in the WL insertion, and <italic>fs-2</italic>, the <italic>follistatin</italic> copy at the autosomal origin, was 0.068 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, vertical dashed line). These high dS values also support the hypothesis that the <italic>api</italic> WL insertion is considerably older than the biotype diversification.</p><p>We next estimated the age of the insertion relative to the divergence between the pea aphid and the rose aphid (<italic>Macrosiphum rosae</italic>). The pea aphid and rose aphid display an average dS of 0.08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Assuming a molecular clock, and an estimated dS and divergence time between the pea aphid and the peach-potato aphid (<italic>Myzus persicae</italic>) of 0.25 and approximately 42 million years, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2016</xref>), we estimate that the pea aphid and rose aphid diverged approximately 13 million years ago. We therefore conclude that the <italic>api</italic> WL insertion occurred approximately 10 millions years ago. Given the age of this insertion, the region is likely not unique to pea aphids, but rather could be responsible for the wingless male phenotype observed in other, related species as well. For example, a species not examined in the phylogeny shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> is <italic>Acyrthosiphon auctum</italic>, which is purportedly within the same genus as the pea aphid, but this species only produces wingless males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackman and Eastop, 2000</xref>). It will be interesting to interrogate other, closely related wingless and dimorphic species to determine whether or not the insertion is present in them and thus responsible for the wingless phenotype in other species.</p><p>To explore contemporary frequencies of the two alleles, we estimated the winged allele frequency from 12 different pea aphid biotypes. To do this, we focused on a noncoding SNP in the <italic>api</italic> region that segregates perfectly with the male wing phenotype across all 23 sequenced genomes from the nine biotypes, and which is 95% associated with the male phenotype in the alfalfa-biotype-specific, pool-seq data. We examined this SNP from pre-existing pool-seq data collected from each of the 12 biotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guyomar et al., 2018</xref>) to estimate the winged allele frequencies. Each pool contained from 14 to 35 individuals from France, which has high host plant diversity, and each pooled individual had a distinct, multilocus genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guyomar et al., 2018</xref>). The majority (9/12) of the biotype lineages exhibited both alleles, with the ancestral, winged allele frequency ranging from 5% to 94% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the remaining three biotypes (Gs, Mes, and Vc), the derived, wingless allele has gone to fixation in the samples of our dataset. This inter-biotype variation raises the intriguing idea that specialization on distinct legume hosts may influence male wing dimorphism variation.</p><p>The winged and wingless alleles have been maintained within the pea aphid lineage for millions of years. This variation may have been maintained within one or more biotypes as we see in modern-day sampling, or alternatively, the pea aphid species <italic>complex</italic> has maintained both alleles for thousands of years, but the alleles have moved between individual biotype via introgression. Unlike the female pea aphid wing dimorphism, which is well studied in terms of the investment tradeoff in reproduction versus dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zera and Denno, 1997</xref>), it is not as clear what fitness advantage a winged or wingless pea aphid male has over its counterpart. Indeed, the existence of wing dimorphisms in male insects are less well understood generally, especially given their limited energetic investment in offspring relative to females (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langellotto et al., 2000</xref>). Hypotheses would include inbreeding avoidance and reduction of local mate competition driving the increase in abundance of winged males, while the high mortality associated with flight would drive an increase in wingless males. Future studies should, therefore, aim to understand why both morphs have existed for so long in pea aphids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified a derived insertion carrying a duplicated <italic>follistatin</italic> homolog that underlies the differences between winged and wingless males. This study represents an important breakthrough in understanding the molecular evolution of wing dimorphisms, which have evolved repeatedly in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roff, 1986</xref>). Furthermore, this work demonstrates that a dramatic phenotypic difference is due to a relatively old insertion containing a gene duplicate, and thus that mutations of relatively large effect can play an important role in adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Orr and Coyne, 1992</xref>). The discovery of these types of structural variants underlying morphological adaptations have largely gone undetected (at least, compared to SNPs, although notable examples exist e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamichhaney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joron et al., 2006</xref>) to date due to technological limitations. Long-read genome sequencing technologies are likely to uncover additional cases of structural variants underlying morphological evolution in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Linkage mapping</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braendle et al.

Specifically, F1 asexual females (that reproduce through parthenogenesis) were placed on <italic>Vicia faba</italic> plants in an incubator at 16°C and a photoperiod of 12 hr light and 12 hr dark. After two generations of asexual reproduction, these conditions induce the production of sexual females and males. F1 males are both winged and wingless. Females produce males asexually by losing one X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blackman, 1987</xref>). The <italic>api</italic> locus is on the X chromosome, so F1 females produce either winged or wingless males depending on which chromosome they drop. Male siblings are therefore identical on their autosomes, but they carry different X chromosomes. We crossed F1 females to F1 males, collected fertilized eggs, sterilized them in 1% calcium propionate on Whatman paper, and placed them in an incubator that alternated between 4°C for 12 hr light and 0°C for 12 hr dark. After 90 days, eggs were removed from this incubator and placed in a 19°C incubator that alternated between 16 hr light and 8 hr dark.

The DNA of nymphs (first through fourth instars) was isolated using the Qiagen Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was quantified on a Qubit and a Nanodrop and visualized on a pulse filed gel to verify its large size. For Nanopore sequencing, 2 µg of DNA was used to prepare a 1D sequencing library (SQK-LSK108) according to the manufacturer's instructions (1D gDNA long reads without BluePippin protocol), including the FFPE repair step. 75 μL of the library was immediately loaded onto an R9.4 flow cell prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and run for approximately 48 hr. Basecalling was completed using ONT Albacore Sequencing Pipeline Software version v2.2.6. 14 GB of Nanopore reads were generated for the winged line and 7 GB reads were generated for the wingless line. OntCns, a customized version of MECAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>) was used to assemble the Nanopore reads of the W line. All parameters were kept the same as the example included in the package manual except for the OntCns2Consensus step, in which the coverage cutoff (-c) was set to 5. Minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2018</xref>) and Miniasm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li, 2016</xref>) was used for genome assembly of the WL genome. An additional 36 GB of WL/WL Pacbio reads were combined with the 7 GB of Nanopore reads. Preset parameters (-x ava-pb) were used in the Minimap step. Assembly polishing was performed slightly differently for the two assemblies. First, 4 rounds of RACON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vaser et al., 2016</xref>) (two rounds of Nanopore and two rounds of Pacbio) were performed to improve the WL assembly since there is no consensus step in the Miniasm assembler (there is a consensus step in the MECAT assembler). We aligned the Nanopore reads and Pacbio reads using Minimap2 with preset parameters (-x ava-ont and -x ava-pb) respectively. Next, 10 rounds of Pilon were used to further polish the WL assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walker et al., 2014</xref>).

sequences. This paper offers compelling evidence that a classic winged/wingless polymorphism in male pea aphids maps instead to a large, X-linked insertion that duplicated over 10 million years ago. The discovery of a single strong candidate gene carried on the insertion highlights the importance of radical structural rearrangements in adaptive evolution.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A large genomic insertion containing a duplicated <italic>follistatin</italic> gene is linked to the pea aphid male wing dimorphism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nancy Moran (Reviewer #2); Leif Andersson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note, however, that the requested changes are significant and the suitability for <italic>eLife</italic> following review of a revised version is thus more uncertain than usual. <italic>eLife</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Li et al. report their comprehensive effort to identify the genetic basis of a wing presence/absence polymorphism in the pea aphid. The authors introduce the topic well, highlighting the pervasiveness of wing loss over insect evolution and the power of within species polymorphism to map the genetic basis of wing loss. Unlike many genotype-phenotype studies published over the past decade that map to a cis-regulatory element or a nonsynonymous site, the authors report a structural variant that determines winglessness. Importantly, single- molecule sequencing was required to make this discovery, highlighting the manuscript's timeliness.</p><p>The authors validate and narrow a previously reported X-linked region controlling the wing polymorphism. They use three different methods – QTL on an F2 population, Fst analysis of US-wide populations of the pea aphid, and then an association study on so-called biotypes that are deeply diverged lineages within the species complex. Assembly of long-reads revealed a 120kb insertion only in the wingless morph. The authors go on to show that the insertion onto the X from an autosomal region is quite old. Using an additional aphid species genomes, including a previously unsequenced species, the authors infer that the insertion is unique to the pea aphid, at least among this set of species. To define a single candidate gene, the authors use several approaches to narrow the 12 genes encoded on the insertion plus those flanking the insertion. The authors identify a <italic>follistatin</italic> gene duplicate as the likely candidate and provide some evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> that this gene may in fact mediate wing development.</p><p>All three reviewers found the broad question compelling and the mapping to a structural variant convincing and significant. The three reviewers also determined that additional data was needed to support <italic>follistatin-3</italic> as the likely causal locus. Suggested experiments and additional analyses below would offer either more robust support for <italic>follistatin</italic> or instead support of another gene encoded on the insertion or possibly a gene in linkage with the insertion. Additionally, interpretation of the <italic>follistatin</italic> gene tree warrants more caution and alternative methods are required to detect purifying/negative selection on the candidate causal locus. Please find specific questions/suggestions related to these two points as well as other essential comments below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors failed to evaluate sufficiently the 11 genes encoded on the insertion and <italic>as1</italic> outside the insertion. Addressing the questions below with additional analyses and/or experiments is necessary to identify a convincing candidate gene.</p><p>a) Do these 11 gene (in males) as well as <italic>fs-2</italic> (in males and females) show a developmental pattern of expression different from <italic>fs-3</italic>, consistent with <italic>fs-3</italic> winglessness-specificity? Additional RT-PCR (or better, RT-qPCR) would address these important questions. Note that the current RT-PCR data are missing a loading control and one reviewer noted the absence of a genomic DNA contamination control.</p><p>b) Do these 11 genes evolve at a faster rate than <italic>fs-3</italic>, consistent with lack of functional constraint? Are the open reading frames intact? Molecular evolution analyses would address this point. Given the ancient origins of the insertion. there has been ample time to accumulate mutations at non-functional genes.</p><p>c) The <italic>as1</italic> expression data deserve more discussion – the differential expression data are actually compelling.</p><p>d) A more convincing approach to support <italic>fs-3</italic> as the causal locus would be RNA FISH on the relevant developing tissue, though is not required if additional supporting data for <italic>follistatin-3</italic> emerge from the above experiments.</p><p>e) Please acknowledge explicitly that a transgene rescue experiment is ultimately required to demonstrate causality.</p><p>2) The <italic>fs</italic> paralog tree interpretation is problematic. The support value for the <italic>fs-2/fs-3</italic> clade is extremely low, suggesting that the topology should collapse into a polytomy. The ambiguity undermines the inference that an ancestral <italic>fs-2</italic> was lost. Please clarify. Moreover, if the authors find additional support for the presented topology, could it be instead that the ancient <italic>fs-3</italic> duplication represented an origin of male wing polymorphism, and that <italic>Carolinaia</italic> and <italic>M. rosae</italic> lost wingless males, as did some of the <italic>A. pisum</italic> biotypes? Please address this alternative interpretation.</p><p>3) I am not familiar with methods that allow inference of purifying selection from paralog comparisons (rather than ortholog comparisons). I don't have a great suggestion here for inferring purifying selection on a young gene duplicate (except, possibly, comparing to other genes in the insertion that may be evolving under no constraint and so have degenerated-see 1b).</p><p>4) There are weaknesses with Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and the argument that wingless males are rare in general in related aphid species (and so the wingless gene and phenotype is derived in <italic>A. pisum</italic>). I agree that this example of the wingless state is most likely derived, resulting from this insertion. However, the insertion may not be unique to <italic>A. pisum</italic> alone given the apparent age of the event. Importantly, the phylogeny in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 (from Hardy et al.) is not well-supported. It was based on an alignment of 4800 nucleotide sites but most of the taxa have missing data and no confidence metrics were included (What are units in the scale bar of Figure 1—figure supplement 3? What is '20.0')? I suggest summarizing winged/wingless males on the well-established Macrosiphini tree.</p><p>5) The last paragraph of the Introduction says that the majority of species in this group have winged males. Possibly the proportion is indeed more than half, but if you look in Blackman and Eastop (Aphids on the world's plants), one or more species in almost all of the genera of Figure 1—figure supplement 3 are known to have wingless males. By chance it seems there are fewer in the set represented in the Figure 1—figure supplement 3 tree – numerous of these are host plant-alternating species and therefore must have winged males. (Of course, if other species descend from host alternating species, then winged males have to be ancestral…). The idea that wingless males are derived seems almost certainly correct, but this point needs to be clarified in the context of the species presented to establish this point.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A large genomic insertion containing a duplicated <italic>follistatin</italic> gene is linked to the pea aphid male wing dimorphism&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The Supplementary file 1, which includes the annotation of the predicted ORFs both inside and outside the insertion, does not sufficiently address the reviewers' concerns (#1). There are no data in this file supporting the statement that all &quot;g&quot; ORFs represent repetitive sequences in the genome. If indeed all ORFs occur many times, additional data demonstrating this point should appear in this file or instead as a distinct supplementary file/figure. For those ORFs that are unique (if any), data on their expression in wingless males is important for supporting the ultimate focus on <italic>fs-3</italic>. It appears that the ORFs have predicted splice junctions, which could be used to support or reject the presence of a transcript. Addressing this concern is imperative given the inability to conduct knockout or transgene experiments.</p><p>2) The new RT-PCR data are certainly promising but the quality of the gel image is poor. It is difficult to discern that &quot;…wingless males 266 expressed <italic>fs-3</italic> increasingly across development.&quot; Either additional product should be run to make clearer the result or, as suggested in the first Decision Letter, RT-qPCR should be performed (particularly given the use of the term &quot;increasingly&quot;). It is surprising that the authors chose to run RT-qPCR for some of the data (i.e., the genes outside the insertion) but RT-PCR for the more important focal gene, <italic>fs-3</italic>.</p><p>3) The rejection of <italic>as1</italic> may be warranted based on statistical criteria but given the RT-qPCR data and that it has a gene name, it would be helpful to at least know its function to further support the decision to reject it as a candidate gene.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50608.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors failed to evaluate sufficiently the 11 genes encoded on the insertion and as1 outside the insertion.

We collected a different range of stages this time: instead of collecting all stages of development, we focused specifically on embryos, 1<sup>st</sup> instar nymphs, and 2<sup>nd</sup> instar nymphs. Our rationale for this choice was twofold. First, these are likely the most relevant stages of expression, as noted in the paper. Second, this makes the results more consistent with the RTqPCR presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>The results are presented in the updated Figure 2. Recall that our purpose for the RT-PCR of <italic>fs-2</italic> was to show that it is expressed. Figure 2D shows that wingless males exhibit expression of <italic>fs-3</italic> and winged males do not (because they do not have the insertion and thus do not have the <italic>fs-3</italic> gene). Figure 2D also shows a positive control (G3PDH) for these same samples. This positive control also works as a negative control for genomic DNA contamination of the cDNA, since it has an amplicon size difference between genomic DNA and cDNA.</p><p>The <italic>fs-2</italic> gene also appears to be expressed in some samples (please Figure 2D), though not in the same pattern at <italic>fs-3</italic>.</p><p>We hope this addresses the reviewers’ concerns about the <italic>fs</italic> genes.

In retrospect it was probably inappropriate to describe them as genes. These are predicted ORFs using automated annotation. All 11 ORFs have strong similarity to sequences that are present many times in the pea aphid genome. Thus, the 11 ORFs are highly repetitive sequences and thus are likely non-functional and unlikely to play a role in the <italic>api</italic> phenotype. We have now revised the paragraph describing the 11 genes:</p><p>“Annotation software (Augustus v.3.3.1) predicted 12 open reading frames (ORFs) in the wingless <italic>api</italic> insertion (Figure 2A), only one of which has homologous sequence in the insertion’s autosomal source location. The other 11 ORFs are each composed of sequences that are highly repetitive across the genome, with many apparently derived from transposable elements (Supplementary file 1).”</p><p>Also as noted in this added text, none of these ORFs have homologous copies present in the original, autosomal location. Therefore, we cannot do any molecular evolution analyses among paralogs as we do with the <italic>follistatin</italic> genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The as1 expression data deserve more discussion – the differential expression data are actually compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>After the appropriate multiple comparison correction the p-value is 0.10, so given that we tested multiple genes, this difference does not meet statistical significance, is likely due to chance, and is not compelling evidence. We pointed out in the text that the uncorrected p-value was 0.013, and then followed that by stating “We therefore found no strong evidence that these genes contribute to the male wing dimorphism.” We are therefore trying to be as transparent as possible about this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) A more convincing approach to support fs-3 as the causal locus would be RNA FISH on the relevant developing tissue, though is not required if additional supporting data for follistatin-3 emerge from the above experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and hope to eventually do this experiment. Unfortunately, there are many candidate stages and tissues and this experiment is outside the scope of this paper. We feel the qPCR supports our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Please acknowledge explicitly that a transgene rescue experiment is ultimately required to demonstrate causality.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We added this sentence:</p><p>“A transgene rescue or mutational knock-out experiment (ideally both) are ultimately required to determine whether <italic>fs-3</italic> causes the male wing polymorphism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The fs paralog tree interpretation is problematic. The support value for the fs-2/fs-3 clade is extremely low, suggesting that the topology should collapse into a polytomy. The ambiguity undermines the inference that an ancestral fs-2 was lost. Please clarify. Moreover, if the authors find additional support for the presented topology, could it be instead that the ancient fs-3 duplication represented an origin of male wing polymorphism, and that Carolinaia and M. rosae lost wingless males, as did some of the A. pisum biotypes? Please address this alternative interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is not well supported. We have now collapsed the topology, as suggested. We collapsed two branches and now the presentation is one of a polytomy. The relevant portion of the paragraph, now reads:</p><p>“The most parsimonious explanation for these patterns is that the initial duplication that gave rise to the <italic>fs-2/3</italic> lineage arose after the split of the pea aphid and the peach-potato aphid, and this duplicate copy was subsequently lost in the rose aphid lineage. […] Future sequencing of more aphid genomes would provide insight into the timing of the emergence of these paralogs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I am not familiar with methods that allow inference of purifying selection from paralog comparisons (rather than ortholog comparisons). I don't have a great suggestion here for inferring purifying selection on a young gene duplicate (except, possibly, comparing to other genes in the insertion that may be evolving under no constraint and so have degenerated-see 1b).</p></disp-quote><p>As far as we know, this is the best tool we have available. Whole genome duplication studies frequently use dN/dS of paralogs for similar reasons (e.g., Berthelot et al. 2014 Nat Comm paper on trout genome whole-genome duplication). We would be happy to do further work to address this if an appropriate analysis can be recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are weaknesses with Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and the argument that wingless males are rare in general in related aphid species (and so the wingless gene and phenotype is derived in A. pisum).

And we agree that the insertion is likely not unique to the pea aphid given the likely age of the insertion event. We see that the text, as it was written, implied this, even though we never meant to imply this. We have thus added these sentences:</p><p>“Given the age of this insertion, the region is likely not unique to pea aphids, but rather could be responsible for the wingless male phenotype observed in other, related species as well. […] It will be interesting to interrogate other, closely related wingless and dimorphic species to determine whether or not the insertion is present in them and thus responsible for the wingless phenotype in other species.”</p><p>To the broader point – we think there have been many transitions between winged and wingless males across the aphid phylogeny. This is an idea we are actively pursuing with further work. For now, we have revised the text to say: “The majority of the species closely related to the pea aphid produce only winged males (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), so the wingless phenotype is likely the derived phenotype.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The Supplementary file 1, which includes the annotation of the predicted ORFs both inside and outside the insertion, does not sufficiently address the reviewers' concerns (#1).

It appears that the ORFs have predicted splice junctions, which could be used to support or reject the presence of a transcript. Addressing this concern is imperative given the inability to conduct knockout or transgene experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a series of changes that we hope will help address this issue.</p><p>– As part of the pea aphid genome release in 2010, a database of pea aphid transposable element consensus sequences was created. We have used blastn to query this database and have reported the results in this supplementary table. All but two of the ORFs from the insertion hit this repeat database. One of the ORFs is our focal gene, the <italic>follistatin</italic> copy (<italic>fs-3</italic>). The other is g6. This ORF has a conserved DDE_Tnp4 domain, part of the DDE superfamily of endonucleases that are likely transposases. Although a blastn of the nucleotide sequence does not hit the pea aphid TE database, a tblastn using the g6 predicted protein sequence reveals that similar sequences are present over 100 times in the pea aphid genome. This is consistent with g6 being a low copy number variant of an extremely common superfamily of TEs present in the pea aphid genome. We have updated the text to say: “Annotation software (Augustus v.3.3.1) predicted 12 open reading frames (ORFs) in the wingless <italic>api</italic> insertion. […] The remaining ORF, <italic>fs-3</italic>, is not repetitive and, importantly, is the only ORF that has homologous sequence in the insertion’s autosomal source location.”</p><p>– We have changed the descriptions of these genes in the supplementary file. Rather than using an aggregation of blast hits, we have made the information more systematic. Now the annotations are restricted to conserved domains and their evalues. We have also added a column of information that summarized the other columns.</p><p>– We have reduced the number of genes listed in the supplementary file. Specifically, we have deleted two of the gene models (g12 and g14) that were outside of the insertion. Our previous Figure 2A showed annotations of genes from the genome annotation version 2.1b. A new annotation came out later last year and these two genes are <italic>not</italic> in that annotation. Our edits make the manuscript more consistent because we are using v3.0 for the genomic sequence elsewhere in the manuscript. We have also removed reference to these genes in the text. We have also changed out all ACYPI IDs (version 2.1b reference IDs) in the text to the new, v3.0 names of genes except in Supplementary file 1 where we have listed both names.</p><p>– In case it was previously unclear, the gene models within the insertion are our own annotations, not genome v3.0 annotations. This is because much of the insertion sequence is not found in this version of the genome. We could, therefore, not use it. We have now stated this clearly in the text and in the legend for Figure 2.</p><p>Our intention with these changes was to make the data on all the ORFs/genes more systematic and to reflect the latest official build and annotation of the genome as much as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The new RT-PCR data are certainly promising but the quality of the gel image is poor. It is difficult to discern that &quot;…wingless males 266 expressed fs-3 increasingly across development.&quot; Either additional product should be run to make clearer the result or, as suggested in the first Decision Letter, RT-qPCR should be performed (particularly given the use of the term &quot;increasingly&quot;). It is surprising that the authors chose to run RT-qPCR for some of the data (i.e., the genes outside the insertion) but RT-PCR for the more important focal gene, fs-3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-run the PCRs to present better gel images. And, importantly, we have removed reference to any sort of relative expression in the text because we should not have used terms like “increasingly”.</p><p>We ran RT-qPCR for the genes outside of the insertion because we thought it would be relevant to know the expression in the winged relative to the wingless morph. Our rationale was that a difference between the morphs could be driven by a regulatory change at one of these genes. We therefore presented RT-qPCR data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. For the focal gene (<italic>fs-3</italic>), which is inside the insertion, this comparison is not possible; the gene is not present in the winged morph, so we cannot look at relative expression in the winged relative to the wingless morph. Any RT-qPCR, and thus any relative expression, would only be comparing expression across developmental stages. This type of RT-qPCR would be useful for beginning to unravel the functioning of this gene, but that is not the subject of this manuscript. Instead, the purpose here is to establish that this gene is expressed in the wingless males. RT-PCR establishes that it is expressed. We have added text in the manuscript about this rationale. We hope that this clearly addresses why we have performed RT-qPCR for some genes and RT-PCR for the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rejection of as1 may be warranted based on statistical criteria but given the RT-qPCR data and that it has a gene name, it would be helpful to at least know its function to further support the decision to reject it as a candidate gene.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be great to know the function, but it is unknown. There are no functional domains, and all blast hits are to other aphid genes. We have now made it clear in the text that <italic>we</italic> named this gene <italic>as1</italic>. We have also now stated in the text that this gene has no known function and no conserved domains.</p></body></sub-article></article>
