formation have been suggested. To test some of these theories, we re-analyzed data from Bonnevie et al., 2013, in which the hippocampus was inactivated and grid cells were recorded in the rat MEC. We investigated whether the firing associations of grid cells depend on hippocampal inputs. Specifically, we examined temporal and spatial correlations in the firing times of simultaneously recorded grid cells before and during hippocampal inactivation. Our analysis revealed evidence of network coherence in grid cells even in the absence of hippocampal input to the MEC, both in regular grid cells and in those that became head-direction cells after hippocampal inactivation. This favors models, which suggest that phase relations between grid cells in the MEC are dependent on intrinsic connectivity within the MEC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>grid cells</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>attractor networks</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>head-direction cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>955/13,2344/16,2655/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derdikman</surname><given-names>Dori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rappaport Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derdikman</surname><given-names>Dori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Allen and Jewel Prince Center for Neurodegenerative Disorders of the Brain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derdikman</surname><given-names>Dori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Adelis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Technion-Weizmann collaboration grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Derdikman</surname><given-names>Dori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Grid cells lose their hexagonality during hippocampal inactivation, but maintain temporal and spatial synchrony between pairs of cells, implying that hippocampus does not determine phase relations between grid cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanism responsible for the emergence of grid cell periodicity is arguably one of the best-tested and best-established mechanisms, across neural circuits in the mammalian central nervous system, thanks to extensive testing and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Derdikman and Knierim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rowland et al., 2016</xref>).

While the runs of pre- and post-inactivation were analyzed in their entirety, for runs during inactivation we used only the time period starting at 15 minutes or later, up to 45 minutes, during which the most data were available across all recordings.

Consequently, we examined spike time correlations and spatial firing correlations between simultaneously recorded cells whose gridness was high under normal conditions, but deteriorated during hippocampal inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). To select only cells with significant gridness before inactivation and minimal gridness during inactivation, we used a minimum grid score threshold of 0.5 pre-inactivation, and a maximum of 0.2 during inactivation. Doing the same analysis with different thresholds, ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 pre-inactivation, and 0 to 0.4 during inactivation, did not change the central finding of the analysis, showing persistence of temporal correlations between cell pairs during hippocampal inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The mean grid score of the selected cells was 0.92 ± 0.24 pre-inactivation and −0.30 ± 0.24 during inactivation. Additionally, to ensure that the same cell was not recorded on different electrodes, we removed any cells from a single recording session whose individual spike times overlapped within a 1 millisecond window more than 5% of the time (this mostly removed cases with very large overlap that were suspected as originating from the same cell on different tetrodes). The mean spike overlap after exclusion was 0.57% ± 0.65 of the total spike strain. In total, 63 of 301 cells from 17 of 41 recording sessions met our criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), producing 107 pairs of simultaneously recorded cells, on which the results of this study are based. In our cohort, firing rates decreased by 50.0% during inactivation, and returned to 90.5% of original levels post-inactivation (pre 2.21 Hz ± 1.39, during 1.11 Hz ± 0.90, and post 2.00 Hz ±1.16).

Cells within our cohort showed a bi-modal distribution of Rayleigh head-direction tuning scores during inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This enabled selecting the cells that became head-direction cells, defined as having a Rayleigh score smaller than 0.4 pre-, and greater than 0.4 during inactivation (15 of the 63 cells in our cohort, from 3 of the 17 recording sessions in two rats; 37 pairs out of the 107 pairs) and those which did not, defined as staying below 0.4 both pre- and during inactivation (39 of the 63 cells in our cohort, from 13 of the 17 recording sessions in six rats; 46 pairs out of the 107 pairs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D and E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> depicts an example of these grid-turned head direction cells from the same recording session. Examining these two clusters separately, looking at temporal correlations pre- and during inactivation, non-head direction pairs were more correlated at r = 0.71, than the head direction pairs at r = 0.52, though both were correlations were significant (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For spatial correlations, pre-inactivation compared to during inactivation, had a correlation coefficient of r = 0.46 (p&lt;0.001) in the non-head directional cluster, and r = 0.22 in the head direction cluster, though this latter correlation was not significant with p=0.19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In conclusion, while spatial correlations were probably less persistent in grid-turned head direction cells, temporal correlations persisted similarly in both regular and grid-turned head direction cells, during hippocampal inactivation. There did seem to be a bias in the tuning angle for the grid turned head direction cells whose average was 37.0° ± 3.5 during inactivation, which was also seen in the rest of the cells in the population, whose Rayleigh score was also above the same threshold of 0.4 pre- and during inactivation. Their averages were 26.5° ± 6.1, and 38.7° ± 4.5 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). This bias is consistent with the fact that all the grid-turned head direction cells were recorded in the same room (room 3), as were the majority of the rest of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47147.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Simultaneously recorded grid cells that became head directional during hippocampal inactivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A sample group of 5 simultaneously recorded grid cells, one cell per column.

(2013)</xref>, in which hippocampal input to the MEC was inactivated. The aim was to examine possible evidence of local grid cell coordination. We found that despite the disappearance of the grid pattern of these cells during hippocampal inactivation, temporal correlations between grid cells remained, at least partially, as did local spatial correlations, although to a lesser, yet still statistically significant degree. A time-windowed version of the spatial correlations suggests a window of about 1 s in which spatial structure remained.</p><p>First, these findings assert that hippocampal input does not completely account for spatially and temporally correlated activity between grid cells. Second, the slow decay of the correlations at a timescale in the order of magnitude of 1 s indicates that this effect is not due solely to direct synaptic connectivity, but to recurrent network activity of dense networks in behavioral timescales. Last, some grid cells became head-direction cells during hippocampal inactivation, and their spatial correlations were less dominant; nonetheless, temporal correlations persisted. Taken together, this paper is adding another piece of evidence to a line of results that support continuous attractor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuhs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giocomo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Trettel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 2019</xref>) while being less supportive of feedforward models creating grid cells through summation of information from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dordek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kropff and Treves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>). We cannot preclude, though, the possibility that grid cells are formed through a different feedforward process, not involving the hippocampus, or that they are generated through a recurrent loop involving information from both the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donato et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A network model for grid cell firing pattern at least strongly predicts, if not implicitly requires, a significant level of synchronicity in temporal firing between two connected grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moser et al., 2014</xref>). The attractor manifold model for grid pattern generation predicts that even when the network is deprived of spatial input, in this case from the hippocampus, the activity pattern that is maintained (though no longer anchored to physical space) would cause nearby cells in the manifold to fire with high correlation, and more distant cells not to fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuhs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tocker et al., 2015</xref>). This aligns with our observations of both correlated and anticorrelated activity during inactivation.</p><p>In addition to the evidence of network coordination, we found that the distinct subset of cells that became head direction-tuned during inactivation, maintained temporal but not spatial correlations during hippocampal inactivation. Interestingly, the head-direction selectivity of these cells was very biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The large overlap in Rayleigh angle between these cells enabled the temporal correlations to remain significant despite the transformation to head-direction cells. This subset of grid-turned head direction cells is likely defined by strong input from the retrosplenial cortex, or the pre- or para- subiculum, which also project into the MEC, and which dominate these cells’ spatial tuning and firing time synchronization in the absence of input from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark and Taube, 2012</xref>). Because the grid-turned head-direction cells originated from recordings that did not contain grid cells that did not turn into head-direction cells we did not observe direct evidence of a temporal correlation between grid cells that became head-direction cells and those that did not. Notably, both groups were similar in their temporal correlation values before and during inactivation, regardless of their differences in spatial correlations. This suggests that despite receiving additional spatial input, the grid cells that became head-direction cells were part of the grid-cell network.</p><p>Several other experiments have investigated grid cell activity when spatial input was curtailed, specifically following removal of visual input. In their original paper that described grid cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hafting et al. (2005)</xref> observed rat grid cells in darkness, and found that the grid pattern did not deteriorate. More recently, two studies, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pérez-Escobar et al. (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al. (2016)</xref> that examined mouse grid cells in darkness reported that the grid pattern deteriorated without visual input. Furthermore, both studies found that significant temporal correlations were maintained during impaired spatial input to the entorhinal cortex, in accordance with our findings. Similarly, two new studies have demonstrated that grid cell temporal correlations remain during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Trettel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The steady synchronicity in our study suggests an underlying network structure in the MEC that is responsible for grid cell formation.

(2013)</xref> was performed with eight male, 3–5 month old Long-Evans rats, with water available ad libitum. The rats were kept on a 12 hour light, 12 hour dark schedule and tested in the dark phase. Rats were implanted with a microdrive connected to four tetrodes of twisted 17 μm platinum-iridium wire; one bundle was implanted in the MEC in all rats, anteroposterior 0.4–0.5 mm in front of the transverse sinus, mediolateral 4.5–4.6 mm from the midline, and dorsoventral 1.4–1.8 mm below the dura. Tetrodes were angled 10° in the sagittal plane. For hippocampal inactivation, cannulae were implanted at a 30° angle in the posterior direction towards the dorsal hippocampus; 0.24–0.30 μl of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol (5-aminomethyl-3-hydroxyisoxazole) diluted in PBS was used to inactivate the hippocampus.</p><p>Rats were run in an open-field 100 cm, 150 cm, or 170 cm square arena, size depending on which of the three recording rooms were used (rooms 3, 9 and 10), polarized by a single white que card in an otherwise black environment for a 20 minute period, after which muscimol was infused. Subsequently, the firing rate of all principal cells recorded in the dorsal CA1 region decreased rapidly,~2.2 mm posterior and lateral to the infusion site (82 cells, all of which were place cells), with firing rates dropping to 1% of the baseline rate in 79% of the recorded cells within 20 minutes. Inactivation of the hippocampus had only minimal impact on the behavior of the rats. Rats then ran for an average of 160 minutes in the open field. After 6–24 hours, the rats were run for 20 minutes to check for cell recovery and grid stability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Quantifying gridness and head direction selectivity</title><p>For this analysis, we were interested in specifically examining grid cells whose spatial firing pattern was significantly degraded. To quantify this, we used the generally accepted measure of grid score, which essentially measures the extent the cell’s firing pattern repeats itself at 60<sup>o</sup> intervals on a two-dimensional (2D) plane (how hexagonal the firing pattern is). The procedure undertaken to achieve this calculation is as follows (based on the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tocker et al., 2015</xref>):</p><p>The arenas were divided into 50x50 equally sized square bins. First, a 2D map of neuron spiking was generated by creating a matrix where the index [i, j] represents the location in the arena, and the value represents the number of spikes in that location. The equivalent matrix for time spent at each location was also created. These two matrices were divided by each other element-wise, creating a matrix of firing rates at each location bin.</p><p>Next, a 2D normalized spatial autocorrelation was performed on the rate map matrix accounting for non-existent values in the rate map, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tocker et al. (2015)</xref>. Firing fields were identified using a method that treated the smoothed (2D Gaussian smoothing with σ = 2) autocorrelation matrix as an image, and identified distinct regions bounded by a given pixel value of <italic>x</italic> in all eight directions whose external values are all less than <italic>x</italic>. Typical grid cell autocorrelations have at least six firing fields, at approximately 60° intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). Typical grid cell activity was manifested as equidistant firing fields at 60° intervals from each other.</p><p>The final step in calculating the grid score was to create a ring around the center of the smoothed autocorrelation (2D Gaussian smoothing with σ = 2), with an inner radius small enough to contain the innermost firing field, and the outer radius large enough to contain the outermost edge of the sixth closest field. Next, the ring was rotated 60° and correlated to the original (using a normalized correlation, accounting for empty matrix values as described above). This value was then subtracted by the value of the ring correlated at a 30° rotation. Since both correlations have values in the range of [−1,1], the range of grid scores is [−2, 2]. Cells whose autocorrelation did not create six distinct firing fields for calculating the annulus using the above method were set to a default grid score of 0.</p><p>A Rayleigh score from 0 to 1 was used to quantify head directionality of cells, similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tocker et al. (2015)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell pair correlations</title><p>To quantify temporal correlations between cells, we calculated the Pearson correlation of their spike trains (lag = 0 ms). For spatial correlations, a 2D Pearson correlation of the rate maps (see Quantifying gridness) was performed and compared at [0,0]. Spatial cross correlations were done following the Pearson moment formula accounting for missing values in the rate map as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tocker et al. (2015)</xref>. Smoothing was done on the spike trains prior to both temporal and spatial correlations using a moving average window of 25 ms. Varying the smoothing windows from 1 ms to 1000 ms had little or no impact on the correlation results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Shuffling to measure significance</title><p>To measure the statistical significance of the correlations, we employed a shuffling method in which spike train times were shifted cyclically n times by total_spike_train_time/n to create pseudo random spike trains (n = 1000 unless stated otherwise) and their correlations recalculated. Correlations were considered significant if they were in the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile when compared to the shuffled correlations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Time-windowed spatial correlation analysis</title><p>In order to measure spatial correlations at a smaller time-scale during inactivation, we analyzed spike to spike locations relative to the first cell in a cell pair within a given time window. For a given cell pair, each spike was treated as the origin in two dimensional space [0,0], and a 2D binned rate map (see above) consisting of all spikes in a given time window [±1s; ±2s; ±3s; ±5s or ±10s], was constructed. This collection of rate maps for a given cell pair was aggregated into a single rate map by adding up the values at a given bin location in the rate map. This procedure was done for each recording session [pre- during post-inactivation]. These cell pair maps were then spatially correlated against each other by session [pre- vs. during inactivation; pre- vs. post-inactivation], where [pre- vs. post-inactivation] represented the control in which we expected to see stable maps for cell pairs between pre -and post- and therefore high correlations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Cindy Cohen for proofreading.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;During hippocampal inactivation, grid cells maintain their synchrony, even when the grid pattern is lost&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ila R. Fiete (Reviewer #1); Kevin Allen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The individual reviews are included in their entirety toward the end of this decision letter for your information, but your rebuttal letter only needs to address the &quot;Essential Revisions&quot; listed below (i.e., you do not need to repeat your responses to individual reviewers' major comments).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that patterns of correlation among grid cells observed prior to hippocampal inactivation persist during hippocampal inactivation. These findings are consistent with predictions of continuous attractor models, in which grid cell responses are predicted to be formed through intrinsic interactions within the grid cell network. The present paper demonstrates that the structure of correlated activity within the grid cell network, which has been reported in other papers, is not inherited from the hippocampus.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper should appropriately credit other previous works that have subsequently tested and found support for the continuous attractor hypothesis, as well as the key idea that the examination of cell relationships and their preservation across conditions where the inputs are modified is a key test of intrinsic pattern formation dynamics within the circuit.</p><p>2) Computing the correlations with different smoothing windows is unnecessary (Figure 2B). In this particular example, it is clear that correlation decays within more or less 1second, and that it is the only relevant timescale. This correlation can thus be captured by any choice of binning smaller than 0.5 seconds and the right filtering parameters (as in any sampling procedure). In addition, it cannot be concluded that this is consistent across time scales (as stated in the Discussion section). See the studies of HD/grid cell correlation during sleep for related analyses.</p><p>3) An additional analysis should be performed to address the question of which underlying spatial processes are preserved. One analysis that could be informative is to determine whether other pairwise spatial properties are maintained, e.g. the direction of the nearest peak in the spatial cross-correlograms.</p><p>4) The authors should investigate whether the grid scores of the cross-correlograms are higher when shorter bouts of exploration are analyzed. One possibility is that mutual grid patterns are preserved while individual grid cells lose their periodic structure because absolute phase drifts over time (see reviewer #2's comment below for specific analysis suggestions).</p><p>5) The study is presented as if it tested whether grid cells depend on local MEC circuits or external inputs (Abstract, Introduction and Discussion section). Because there are still many intact inputs to the MEC during hippocampal inactivation, this question can't be directly addressed with the current experiment. The authors should focus more on whether the firing associations of grid cells depend on hippocampal inputs.</p><p>6) In Figure 3A, the slope of the regression line appears to be less than 1. Was this significant or did one outlier cell pair only drive it? Is there a significant difference between the distribution of time correlations from &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;during&quot; (Wilcoxon signed-rank test)?</p><p>7) Figure 3B, there appear to be fewer significant cell pairs during inactivation (46% vs. 72%)? The authors should determine if this difference is significant. Since the recording time was longer during inactivation than for pre or post, one may have expected the opposite. Could this suggest that the grid cell correlation structure was not entirely stable during hippocampal inactivation?</p><p>8) A more thorough analysis of &quot;grid cells turned HD&quot; cells was requested. See reviewer #3's comment below for specific analysis suggestions. Also, the question of whether grid cells turned HD cells and pure grid cells were recorded in the same animals and whether grid cells turned HD cells were recorded in several animals.</p><p>9) It is not clear at which time the inactivation period starts. Is it immediately after injection or at the time of CA1 inactivation? Since 45 minutes of data is available, would it be possible to compare the firing associations during two non-overlapping periods (early vs. late inactivation)? This analysis would ensure that the correlations with the &quot;pre&quot; are maintained throughout the inactivation period.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this short, sweet, clear paper, Derdikman and colleagues examine the relationships between comodular grid cells before and during hippocampal (HPC) inactivation. They show that patterns of correlation among grid cells observed during spatial firing pre-inactivation persist during HPC inactivation, even in cells that lost most spatial tuning and turned into HD-like cells (at least temporal correlations are preserved for the HD-turned cells, while temporal and spatial correlations are preserved for the rest), consistent with the predictions of continuous attractor models in which cell responses are predicted to be largely formed through intrinsic interactions within the grid cell network rather than being inherited from another source like HPC input. This finding is at odds with the predictions of alternative models proposed by Treves, Derdikman, and others, in which the grid cell patterning is based on place cell input. It is definitely fit for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, as it establishes a quantitative result, helps eliminate hypotheses, and contributes by further adding to accumulating support to the dominant hypothesis for the generation of grid cell responses. I also don't see any technical issues with the analyses, including the choice of cell selection criteria.</p><p>I do, however, have a suggestion that is closely related to my positive comments above, and is not unique to this paper, but is one that I would hope that this paper and subsequent ones by other authors following the example will follow. That is, it is unfortunately endemic to our field to start out papers by posing the question under study as one that has long been &quot;mysterious&quot; and &quot;unanswered&quot;, and to pose the current work as the answer to this question. In this vein, the paper starts with &quot;The means by which grid cells form regular, hexagonal spatial firing patterns has been an enigma since their discovery in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC).&quot; and &quot;Since their discovery in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (Hafting et al., 2005) the location and means by which grid cells form their eponymous hexagonal spatial firing patterns has been elusive.&quot; The current situation is not exactly this, however (though it once was!), as by now the grid cell mechanism is arguably one of the best-tested and best-established mechanisms, across neural circuits in the mammalian CNS, thanks to extensive testing and analysis. The current paper appropriately cites models that propose various grid cell mechanisms, but could do a much better job of appropriately crediting works that have subsequently tested and found support for the continuous attractor hypothesis, as well as the key idea that the examination of cell relationships and their preservation across conditions where the inputs are modified is a key test of intrinsic pattern formation dynamics within the circuit.</p><p>In sum, it will not diminish the paper's own results, and will rather greatly enhance the fidelity with which it represents our current understanding of grid cells, to state clearly in the Abstract and Introduction that this paper is adding another piece of evidence to a line of results that support continuous attractor dynamics, and citing these results. It's great that this is how the scientific edifice is built, and this work is a lovely contribution in that direction!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Almog and collaborators have reanalyzed MEC recordings from Bonnevie et al., (2013) during which the hippocampus was transiently inactivated. While observing as in the original study a clear decrease in grid scores, the authors show that temporal and spatial coordination are maintained. They conclude that these observations support attractor (or at least local connectivity-based) models of grid cells. Overall, the idea and the results are interesting. The analyses could be improved a bit to strengthen the message.</p><p>Computing the correlations with different smoothing windows is unnecessary (Figure 2B). In this particular example, it is clear that correlation decays within more or less 1s, and that it is the only relevant timescale. This correlation can thus be captured by any choice of binning smaller than 0.5 seconds and the right filtering parameters (as in any sampling procedure). In addition, it cannot be concluded that this is consistent across time scales (as stated in the discussion). See the studies of HD/grid cell correlation during sleep for related analyses.</p><p>The fact that spatial correlations are maintained above chance level begs the question of which underlying spatial processes are preserved. One analysis that could be informative is to determine whether other pairwise spatial properties are maintained, e.g. the direction of the nearest peak in the spatial cross-correlograms.</p><p>Along the same lines, are the grid scores of the cross-correlograms higher when shorter bouts of exploration are analyzed? One possibility is that mutual grid patterns are preserved while individual grid cells lose their periodic structure because absolute phase drifts over time. One can also imagine to compute a time-limited spatial cross-correlogram: the idea would be to populate a 2D histogram of animal's positions at times of a neuron A spikes relative to the positions at times of neuron B spikes and within a window of +/- 1 second. This would correspond to a 2D histogram of all the pairs (xA-xB,yA-yB) for |tB-tA|&lt;1s, with 'xi,yi' the position of the animal at times 'ti' of neuron 'i' spikes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study by Almog and colleagues tests whether the correlation structure of grid cells is maintained after inactivation of the hippocampus with local muscimol injections. As previously reported (Bonnevie et al., 2013), grid cell periodicity and spatial selectivity are strongly reduced during hippocampal inactivation. In the current manuscript, the authors report that the firing associations between simultaneously recorded grid cells are maintained during inactivation.</p><p>This manuscript comes at the right time as two important studies addressing the stability of the grid cell correlation structure during sleep were just published. The results of the current manuscript provide convincing evidence that the firing associations between grid cells do not depend on hippocampal inputs.</p><p>One concern I have with the manuscript is that the study is presented as if it tested whether grid cells depends on local MEC circuits or external inputs (Abstract, Introduction and Discussion section). Because there are still many intact inputs to the MEC during hippocampal inactivation, this question can't be directly addressed with the current experiment. Perhaps the authors should focus more on whether the firing associations of grid cells depend on hippocampal inputs.</p><p>In Figure 3A, the slope of the regression line appears to be less than 1. Was this significant or did one outlier cell pair only drive it? Is there a significant difference between the distribution of time correlations from &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;during&quot; (Wilcoxon signed-rank test)?</p><p>Figure 3B, there appear to be fewer significant cell pairs during inactivation (46% vs. 72%)? Is this difference significant? Since the recording time was longer during inactivation than for pre or post, I would have expected the opposite. Could this suggest that the grid cell correlation structure was not entirely stable during hippocampal inactivation?</p><p>I find the results with &quot;grid cells turned HD&quot; cells interesting, but I am not sure how to interpret the findings. More analysis could be helpful here. For example, one could perform cross-correlations between the HD tuning curves during inactivation. Is map similarity during &quot;pre&quot; correlated with similarity in preferred HD during inactivation? In Figure 4A, the HD tuning curves during inactivation all look relatively similar (last row) despite the cells often having non-overlapping firing fields (top row). Theoretically, if grid cells are organized as a lattice with fixed connectivity, how can they become HD cells without modifying their firing associations with other grid cells? Would it be like trying to reorganize the grid cell lattice as a ring (typical HD attractor network)? Or do all grid cells turned HD cells inherit the same preferred direction during inactivation but fire at different times?</p><p>It is not clear at which time the inactivation period starts. Is it immediately after injection or at the time of CA1 inactivation? Since 45 minutes of data is available, would it be possible to compare the firing associations during two non-overlapping periods (early vs. late inactivation)? This analysis would ensure that the correlations with the &quot;pre&quot; are maintained throughout the inactivation period.</p><p>Were grid cells turned HD cells and pure grid cells recorded in the same animals? It would also be informative to know whether grid cells turned HD cells were recorded in several animals.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;During hippocampal inactivation, grid cells maintain their synchrony, even when the grid pattern is lost&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.
