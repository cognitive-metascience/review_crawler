However, growing evidence suggests that a core endogenous role is to promote flexible adaptation to changes in the causal structure of the environment, through behavioral inhibition and enhanced plasticity. We used long-term photometric recordings in mice to study a population of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, whose activity we could link to normal reversal learning using pharmacogenetics. We found that these neurons are activated by both positive and negative prediction errors, and thus report signals similar to those proposed to promote learning in conditions of uncertainty. Furthermore, by comparing the cue responses of serotonin and dopamine neurons, we found differences in learning rates that could explain the importance of serotonin in inhibiting perseverative responding. Our findings show how the activity patterns of serotonin neurons support a role in cognitive flexibility, and suggest a revised model of dopamine–serotonin opponency with potential clinical implications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20552.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20552.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20552.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Serotonin is a molecule that plays various roles in the human body. In the brain, it is involved in regulating mood and emotions. Growing evidence suggests that serotonin also helps animals – including humans – adapt their behavior to changes in their environment. To allow for such behavioral flexibility, serotonin might promote changes in the underlying brain structures and activity.</p><p>In a type of learning known as ‘reversal learning’, for instance, it is necessary to adapt to a sudden change in a previously familiar environment. For example, if there were a road closure on a person’s way to work, they might want to learn to stop following their usual route and learn a new and better one. Previous research has shown that when serotonin signaling is reduced, people persevere. That is, they will keep following the old route even if it is no longer the best choice. How this process works is still largely unknown.</p><p>To start unraveling these mechanisms, Matias et al. trained mice in a reversal learning task while manipulating and recording the activity of the neurons that produce serotonin. The results showed that when the activity in serotonin neurons was experimentally blocked, the mice tended to keep looking for a reward that was no longer available. Then, by recording the activity of serotonin neurons, Matias et al. found that it was the surprise of discovering a change in a previously familiar environment that activates serotonin neurons. It did not matter whether the change was better or worse than expected. The findings suggest that together with dopamine, another molecule involved in learning from rewards, serotonin could play an important role during reversal learning.</p><p>One next step will be to determine if serotonin mainly stops perseverance in its tracks, or whether it works by helping to unlearn the old behavior, or a combination of both. In the future, this could further our understanding of depression, which can be viewed as a disorder characterized by patients being unable to adapt to adverse situations, leaving them trapped to repeat behaviors and thoughts that are not beneficial. Future studies could also build on these findings to guide the development of new treatments for depression that involve serotonin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20552.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20552.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Serotonin</kwd><kwd>reversal learning</kwd><kwd>perseveration</kwd><kwd>Surprise</kwd><kwd>Serotonin-dopamine opponency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/43072/2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matias</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT00088/011L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lottem</surname><given-names>Eran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>250334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainen</surname><given-names>Zachary F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Champalimaud Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainen</surname><given-names>Zachary F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>671251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainen</surname><given-names>Zachary F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Recordings from serotonin-producing neurons in the brain reveal that these neurons are highly activated by sudden changes in previously familiar environments, potentially explaining why serotonin is important for learning to adapt to such changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Serotonin (5-HT) is classically known to be implicated in mood and affective disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dayan and Huys, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cools et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2012</xref>), but it also plays a fundamental role when organisms need to adapt to sudden changes in the causal structure of an environment, such as during extinction and reversal learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulougouris and Robbins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brigman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2014</xref>). These studies have shown that 5-HT depletion, particularly in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of primates, causes perseverative errors, that is, difficulties in stopping responses to previously rewarded stimuli which are no longer reinforced, without affecting learning of new associations or retention of learned associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>). Such results seem to stem from two functions of endogenous 5-HT activation: inhibiting learned responses that are not currently adaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soubrié, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>) and driving plasticity to reconfigure them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jitsuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2015</xref>). These mirror dual functions of dopamine (DA) in invigorating reward-related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Niv et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>) and promoting plasticity that reinforces new ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). However, while DA neurons are known to be activated by reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with theories of reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), the reported firing patterns of 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2016</xref>) do not accord with any existing theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cools et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakamura, 2013</xref>). Indeed, 5-HT neurons have been proposed to signal worse-than-expected outcomes by being activated by negative reward prediction errors in the reinforcement learning framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>), but there is little experimental evidence for such a signal in 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and 5-HT activation does not appear to drive aversive learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dugué et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McDevitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>) the way DA drives appetitive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how 5-HT neurons could be involved in cognitive and behavioral flexibility in changing environments, we recorded their activity over several days in mice engaged in a reversal learning task in which the associations between neutral odor cues and different positive and negative outcomes are first well-learned and then suddenly changed.

Thus, 5-HT and DA neurons are both sensitive to violations of expectation that occur during an abrupt reversal, with the two systems responding in the same way to better-than-expected outcomes but in opposite ways to worse-than-expected outcomes.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20552.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Responses of 5-HT and DA neurons to outcomes are differentially modulated by expectations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean (± s.e.m.) response of 5-HT neurons, across mice, to the four USs before (day −1, filled bars) and right after (day 0, open bars) reversal (n = 8 mice, two-way ANOVA with factors mouse and day, the main effect of day F<sub>1,764</sub> = 84.36, p&lt;0.001 for large reward, F<sub>1,748</sub> = 3.49, p=0.062 for small reward, F<sub>1,756</sub> = 38.17, p&lt;0.001 for neutral, F<sub>1,766</sub> = 2.79, p=0.095 for air puff).

During a positive reversal, because the adaptation of 5-HT cue responses is much slower than that of DA cue responses, the net signal will be transiently biased towards the effects of DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, right). Conversely, during a negative reversal, because 5-HT cue responses persist longer than those of DA, the difference will be biased towards the effects of 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, left). This suggests a novel mechanism by which 5-HT can contribute to preventing perseverative responding during negative reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>), by directly inhibiting behavioral responses to CSs that have undergone decreases in associated outcome values.</p><p>The DREADD inactivation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) supported the contribution of 5-HT to negative reversal learning, but did not distinguish whether the relevant activity occurs during the CS or the US. To test for a contribution of the CS-related activity, we asked whether there was a correlation in the animal-to-animal variability in the time constant of behavioral adaptation (anticipatory licking) and neural adaptation (CS magnitude). Remarkably, we observed a significant correlation between the time constant of DRN 5-HT CS response and the time constant of CS-related licking for the negative reversals but not the positive one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), suggesting that these responses could be involved in adapting to negative reversals. Moreover, during such negative reversals the time constant of DRN 5-HT responses was slower than that of anticipatory licking for all animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> for DA). We note that, while we expected that the adaptation of 5-HT CS responses to the reversal should be at least as slow as that of anticipatory licking for the two to be causally related, the fact that it was much slower (around eight times as slow) requires an explanation. One possibility is that our behavioral readout (that is, tongue protrusions long enough to be detected by our sensor) is just a ‘tip-of-the-iceberg’ of motor responses to appetitive cues, and that other, covert, movements also need to be suppressed by 5-HT during relearning, and thus 5-HT neurons need to be active until all motor responses to appetitive cues have disappeared. Alternatively, it may be the case that 5-HT CS responses could serve more than a mere motor suppression function during reversal learning, and contribute to the longer-lasting learning processes required for reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2015</xref>), such as those that prevent spontaneous recovery following extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karpova et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20552.023</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The correlation between the speed of DRN 5-HT cue learning and anticipatory licking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation between time constants of 5-HT CS responses and anticipatory licking for the negative reversal.

These observations suggest two possible complementary contributions of 5-HT to behavioral flexibility: (1) to facilitate the learning of new associations and (2) to directly inhibit responses which are no longer appropriate. To elucidate how the dynamics of endogenous neural activity could support these functions, we used fiber photometry to monitor 5-HT and DA during reversal learning. This revealed two important findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DRN 5-HT neurons are activated by both positive and negative reward prediction errors</title><p>First, we found that 5-HT US responses were strongly sensitive to changes in cue–outcome contingency after the reversal. Remarkably, 5-HT neurons responded with a similar transient excitation to violations of expectation that were either better-than-expected or worse-than-expected reward outcomes. Midbrain DA neurons, on the other hand, responded oppositely to better-than-expected and worse-than-expected outcomes. Thus, whereas DA neurons could be described as reporting a signed RPE, 5-HT neurons appeared to report, in part, an unsigned RPE (but see below for discussion of responses to aversive events). That is, 5-HT neurons were sensitive not to the direction of error but to its magnitude. These responses could also be described as a type of ‘surprise’ signal (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courville et al., 2006</xref>). Supporting this idea, we found that 5-HT neurons were also sensitive to substitution of one neutral cue for a cue of another modality (sound for odor). It remains to be determined whether these responses were dictated entirely by small differences in reward value, or whether they reflect sensory as well as value prediction errors.</p><p>Unsigned prediction error signals have been proposed on theoretical grounds to be ideal for regulating learning and attention based on uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courville et al., 2006</xref>). By reporting such signals, 5-HT US responses would be suitable to drive plasticity and re-learning during reversal of contingencies. The strong excitatory response of the 5-HT system to negative RPEs, caused by reward omissions, provides a possible explanation for why inhibiting this system impairs negative reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bari et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). That is, during negative reversals or extinction learning, the 5-HT system, either directly or through an interaction with the DA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>), could facilitate trial-by-trial undoing of DA-dependent learning. Since 5-HT neurons also respond during positive prediction errors, such as during positive reversal or initial learning, such activation might compete with co-occurring DA signals, slowing positive learning, as has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fletcher et al., 1999</xref>). The preferential involvement of 5-HT in ‘unlearning’ responses could be explained by the relative effects of 5-HT release on downstream targets, where 5-HT may favor long-term depression (LTD) and DA long term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Response to aversive events by DRN 5-HT neurons</title><p>5-HT US responses contained one notable divergence from an idealized prediction error: air puff USs continued to evoke responses, even after extensive training, and showed only minor sensitivity to the presence of a predictive cue — observations consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). One possible explanation is that mice failed to learn the predictive relationship between the CS and the air puff. Indeed, mice showed air puff–triggered blink responses, but failed to learn <italic>anticipatory</italic> blinking responses despite extensive training. This result likely depends on the relatively long duration of the CS–US trace period, here 2 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reynolds, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boneau, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caro-Martín et al., 2015</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that mice did not learn the CS–air puff association. If mice formed no CS-dependent predictions about the air puff, then they might have experienced each air puff as ‘unpredicted’, whether before or after reversal. In this case, the presence of robust air puff US responses would be consistent with an unsigned value prediction error. However, since we have no explanation for how mice could succeed in learning a CS–reward association while failing to learn the CS–air puff association, other explanations should also be considered.</p><p>A second possible line of explanation for the observation that the air puff did not elicit an increased response after the reversal is that 5-HT neurons report at least two qualitatively distinct signals: one relating to the processing of rewards and the other to the processing of aversive stimuli. In principle, following a reversal from large reward to air puff, one would have expected a contribution of the reward omission response to the US response, as seen in the small reward to neutral reversal. The lack of such a response could indicate either simple saturation or a suppressive influence of the air puff on the reward omission signal. A distinction between the encoding of rewarding vs. aversive events by the DA system has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fiorillo, 2013</xref>). The presence of dual signals might reflect the inclusion of multiple 5-HT neuronal populations within our photometric recordings. In future experiments, these could be distinguished using a pathway-specific labeling, as has been done in the DA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; see further discussion below). On the other hand, VTA DA neurons have been reported to integrate reward and aversive outcome values, but with aversive responses being strongly modulated by the rate of reward available in the current context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>). In future experiments, it will be important to understand how individual 5-HT neurons integrate information from combinations of outcomes, and in different reward contexts.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that the pattern of 5-HT US responses could be understood together as a variation on a prediction error signal. Whereas mice can control the consumption of available water, they cannot control the delivery of air puffs; they are afforded no means to escape in the head-fixed configuration. It is therefore interesting to consider the possibility that 5-HT neurons might report errors of <italic>control</italic> rather than errors of prediction. Under this hypothesis, an aversive outcome such as the air puff continues to generate a response in 5-HT neurons because the organism has not managed to control this aspect of its environment. If the mouse were offered a means to escape, we would expect to see the air puff response diminish. Conversely, because the 5-HT US response is also sensitive to errors of a positive nature, we would also expect to see continued responses to a non-controllable reward, for example, direct oral infusion of sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Such ‘unsigned control errors’ could provide the organism with a signal of the magnitude of cognitive or behavioral effort required to adapt to a given situation, a signal that could be read out for the purpose of energizing or deenergizing actions.</p><p>Consistent with the control error hypothesis, predictable but uncontrollable shocks robustly activate the immediate early gene <italic>Fos</italic> in DRN 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takase et al., 2004</xref>), and this activation is lowered by controllability signals from the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amat et al., 2005</xref>). This proposal also finds support in a recent study showing that DRN 5-HT activity mediates short-term sensorimotor adaptation in zebrafish, by reporting the difference between the expected and actual sensory consequences of motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawashima et al., 2016</xref>). However, further experiments will clearly be necessary to test these ideas as explanations of the present data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>5-HT CS responses could be responsible for inhibiting perseverative responding</title><p>5-HT could thus contribute to cognitive flexibility not only through learning and plasticity, but also by directly suppressing activity in systems responsible for violated predictions. Indeed, 5-HT has been strongly associated with suppressing both impulsive and perseverative responses through ‘behavioral inhibition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cools et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to US signals that could explain the contribution of 5-HT to uncertainty-driven learning, we also found CS or cue responses that could explain a direct and immediate contribution to behavioral control during environmental change. We found that 5-HT CS responses, like DA CS responses, were strongly positively correlated with CS value, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, 5-HT and DA CS signals were qualitatively extremely similar, both after initial training and after relearning. Given that 5-HT and DA are thought to drive opposing processes of behavioral inhibition and invigoration, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cools et al., 2011</xref>), this would suggest that the two systems effectively cancel one another out. However, surprisingly, we found that the CS responses of 5-HT neurons were not only much slower than DA neurons to adapt to new associations after the reversal, but were also maintained throughout the extinction of the maladaptive perseverative response, as would be needed to prevent interference of the old appetitive response. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation across animals in the post-reversal learning rates of trial-by-trial 5-HT activity and that of anticipatory licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>This difference in rates of adaptation between the two systems, which to our knowledge was not previously reported in any neuromodulatory system, implies that the net balance between DA and 5-HT will undergo specific dynamics during learning that resemble the classical proposal concerning opponent processes by Solomon &amp; Corbit (1974). Specifically, because DA cue responses are quicker to establish, cues undergoing positive changes in outcome value will temporarily favor DA signals. Conversely, because DA cue responses are also quicker to withdraw, cues undergoing negative changes in outcome value will temporarily favor 5-HT signals. Thus, positive changes will favor DA and behavioral invigoration, and negative changes will favor 5-HT and behavioral suppression. This may explain why 5-HT is specifically critical in preventing responses to cues that were previously rewarding, which is observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2007</xref>). The origins of the differences in 5-HT and DA learning dynamics will be important to uncover, and might arise from differences in the systems feeding into the two neuromodulators. Interestingly, neural responses in the caudate nucleus, a major recipient of DA projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>), adapt faster during reversal learning, while the PFC, a major target of 5-HT projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>), adapts more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications of neuronal heterogeneity and other complexities of the 5-HT system</title><p>The technique of fiber photometry of genetically-encoded calcium indicators provides excellent genetic specificity and stable long-term recordings, but does not allow the resolution of single-neuron responses. It is therefore possible that differential activity patterns within specific subpopulations of DRN 5-HT neurons exist that could not be resolved by this recording method. In fact, several studies point to a heterogeneity among DRN neurons, both in terms of physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</xref>) and in terms of projection targets of DRN cell groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>) and single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gagnon and Parent, 2014</xref>). This would suggest that the different signals we observed—for example, CS vs. US or rewarding vs. aversive USs—could have different origins and functions.</p><p>Even if this is the case to some extent, and given the consistency of our optical fiber targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we believe that such heterogeneity probably will not substantially impact our conclusions for several reasons. First, importantly, we established that the population from which we are recording contributes to reversal learning, and it is therefore a relevant population. Second, activity patterns were consistent across mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>), despite inevitable small variations in infections and fiber placements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the findings are robust to the precise population monitored. Third, single-unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>) show that rewarding and aversive events activate the same individual DRN neurons (including identified 5-HT neurons), and are therefore not generated by distinct populations. Finally, because individual 5-HT neurons have broad projection fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>) and transmit primarily by volume conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dankoski and Wightman, 2013</xref>), heterogeneity will tend to be averaged out through pooling by downstream targets.</p><p>Another limitation of our study relates to the pharmacogenetic approach to inhibiting 5-HT neurons. While it has good genetic specificity, its spatial resolution is limited by the spread of the viral particles containing the hM4Di receptor in the DRN, and its temporal resolution is on the order of dozens of minutes. Additionally, although we know this approach should inhibit 5-HT neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teissier et al., 2015</xref>), we did not test the efficacy of this inhibition in our animals. The limited temporal resolution of this approach makes it impossible to distinguish the contribution of CS and US 5-HT signals to behavioral flexibility. Still, we have an indication that CS responses might play a role in behavioral inhibition of perseverative responding. This could potentially be resolved in future experiments using optogenetic inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for the DA–5-HT opponency theory</title><p>Our results support, in a general sense, the long-standing notion of DA–5-HT opponency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>), but call for a refinement of this view. Rather than carrying the positive and negative sides of a single-signed prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cools et al., 2011</xref>), DA–5-HT opponency seems to be more complex and subtle. As has been classically described, the activity of DA neurons which we recorded closely resembled a so-called signed RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). The US-related 5-HT signals, on the other hand, resemble in important respects, but don’t perfectly match, the concept of an ‘unsigned RPE’ signal. Thus, 5-HT neurons responded not to an opposing class of events, but to an overlapping and broader range of events compared to DA. In this respect, they might be acting as a kind of inhibitory ‘surround’ to DA’s excitatory ‘center’, helping to sharpen the focus of behavioral attention. Nevertheless, just as DA signaling is increasingly acknowledged to be more complex than classically described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wise, 2004</xref>), attributing a single function to 5-HT neurons is also clearly an oversimplification.</p><p>With respect to CS responses, 5-HT neurons showed a remarkably similar pattern of activity to that of DA neurons, scaling closely with the value of the stimuli. A possible explanation for this observation is that 5-HT CS responses could be learned by the same DA-dependent process that generates DA CS responses. If this were the entire story, then 5-HT and DA CS responses might simply balance and nullify one another. However, the fact that 5-HT CS responses evolved much more slowly than did DA CS responses means that such a balance will not hold in dynamic environments. This dynamic balance between positive and negative forces resembles the balance of excitation and inhibition in the cortex (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>), albeit on a much slower time scale. Such a temporal asymmetry between opponent processes endows the joint system with novel and potentially important dynamics, which may be an important substrate in the dynamics of learning, as previously proposed (Solomon and Corbit, 1974). CS and US responses of a similar nature to those observed in 5-HT and DA neurons also appear to be observed in other neuromodulatory systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu and Dayan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sara and Bouret, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that, contrary to the notion that each neuromodulator reports a completely distinct signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Daw et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doya, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dayan, 2012</xref>), they have highly overlapping signals, presumably derived from partly overlapping inputs, but with more subtle differences through which their joint actions are orchestrated.</p><p>This description of the dynamics of 5-HT neurons during reversal learning provides novel insights into how this system can contribute to cognitive flexibility. Moreover, the results also suggest the need for a refinement in conventional conceptions of 5-HT’s function in the regulation of mood, with implications for understanding its role in depression and other psychiatric disorders. More than reporting the affective value of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boureau and Dayan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Luo et al., 2016</xref>), we suggest that 5-HT facilitates the ability of an organism to adapt flexibly to dynamic environments through plasticity and behavioral control. The clinical benefits of an enhancement of 5-HT function would therefore stem not from directly biasing affective states toward the positive, but by preventing the negative consequences of maladaptive world views and facilitating adaptive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branchi, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and performed in accordance with the European Union Directive 2010/63/EU and the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown Ethics Committee guidelines, and approved by the Portuguese Veterinary General Board (Direcção Geral de Veterinária, approvals 0420/000/000/2011 and 0421/000/000/2016).

During water deprivation each mouse’s weight was maintained above 80% of its original value. Following infection and implantation surgery, mice were habituated to the head-fixed setup by receiving water every 4 s (6 µl drops) for three days, after which training in the odor-guided task started. A mouse nose poke (007120.0002, Island Motion Corporation) using an IR photoemitter-photodetector was adapted to measure licking as IR beam breaks. To deliver air puffs, a pulse of air was delivered through a tube to the right eye of the mouse. Sounds signaling the beginning of the trial and the outcomes were amplified (PCA1, PYLE Audio Inc.) and presented through speakers (Neo3 PDRW W/BC, Bohlender-Graebener). Water valves (LHDA1233115H, The Lee Company) were calibrated and a custom made olfactometer designed by Z.F.M. (Island Motion) was used for odor delivery. The behavioral control system (Bcontrol) was developed by Carlos Brody (Princeton University) in collaboration with Calin Culianu, Tony Zador (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and Z.F.M. Odors were diluted in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:10 and 25 µl of each diluted odor was placed inside a syringe filter (2.7 µm pore size, 6823–1327, GE Healthcare) to be used in two sessions (~100 trials for each odor). Odorized air was delivered at 1000 ml/min. Odors used were carvone (R)-(-), 2-octanol (S)-(+), amyl acetate and cuminaldehyde. For the behavioral task used in the hM4D experiment, these odors were associated with reward, reward, nothing and nothing, respectively. For the behavioral task used in the GCaMP6s experiment, they were associated with a large reward (4 µl water drop), small reward (2 µl water drop), neutral (no outcome) and punishment (air puff to the eye) before reversal, and with punishment, neutral, small reward and large reward after the reversal of the cue–outcome associations, respectively. In each trial, white noise was played to signal the beginning of the trial and to mask odor valve sounds. A randomly selected odor was presented for 1 s. Following a 2 s trace period, the corresponding outcome was available. Mice completed one session per day. For hM4D experiments, odors were introduced in pairs. For photometry experiments, training started by presenting only the large and small reward trials to the mice, followed by the introduction of the neutral type of trial in the next session, and finally the punishment trial in the following one. Punishment trials were presented gradually until all four types of trials had the same probability of occurrence and each session consisted of 140–346 trials (minimum to maximum, 223 ± 30, mean ± SD). Time to odor (foreperiod), trace period and inter-trial interval (ITI) were also gradually increased during training until mice could do the task with their final values: foreperiod was 3 to 4 s, taken from a uniform distribution, trace was fixed at 2 s, ITI was 4 to 8 s taken from a uniform distribution.</p><p>hM4D experiments were run in two batches: the experiment was run first on the WT animals and then on the SERT-Cre animals (with some overlapping days). Photometry experiments were run in five batches in the following sequence: 3 (SERT-Cre, experimental)+3 (SERT-Cre, experimental and YFP controls)+2 (SERT-Cre YFP controls)+6 (SERT-Cre, experimental)+4 (TH-Cre, experimental).</p><p>For the hM4D experiments, mice received a daily injection of vehicle (saline 0.9% and DMSO 0.25%) 40 min. before session start. The volume of these daily injections of vehicle was determined according to each mouse’s weight, and it required an adjustment of the water drop size for each mouse to keep them motivated to do 150 trials per session. On the reversal day and the two following days, for experimental mice, CNO was diluted in the vehicle solution and delivered at a concentration of 3 mg/kg. In both reversal learning tasks used, we ensured that mice could correctly perform the task on at least three consecutive days before reversing the odor–outcome contingency for the first time. On the reversal day, mice started the session as before and the contingencies were reversed at trial 50 in the hM4D experiment, and between the 32th and the 100th trial (73 ± 12, mean ± SD) in the GCaMP6s experiments. One SERT-Cre mouse was excluded from the hM4D analysis for not showing a differential lick rate within 1.5 s of US delivery, between odors 1 and 2 (rewards) and odors 3 and 4 (nothing). Two mice were excluded from the GCaMP6s data analysis for bad fiber placement assessed after histology analysis (more than 400 µm away from the infection area): one SERT-Cre and one TH-Cre mouse. Additionally, another SERT-Cre mouse was discarded from the reversal data analysis because of experimental problems with the fiber during the reversal session. In four SERT-Cre mice and in all TH-Cre mice, at five to six days after the reversal, we introduced uncued US trials during the task. These trials represented approximately 20% of the total number of trials in a session during which no odor cue was presented; the typical white noise of the foreperiod was immediately followed by one of the four possible outcomes, randomly selected (11 ± 4 uncued vs 44 ± 8 cued trials per session, mean ± SD). To analyze these data, four sessions with cued and uncued outcomes were pooled together for each mouse. All GCaMP6s experiments were performed within the limit of one month from the viral injection date, to avoid cell death due to over-expression of GCaMP6s in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fiber photometry setup</title><p>The dual-color fiber photometry acquisition setup consists of a three-stage tabletop black case containing optical components (filters, dichroic mirrors, collimator), two light sources for excitation and two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for acquisition of fluorescence of a green (GCaMP6s) and of a red (tdTomato) fluorophore.</p><p>We used a 473 nm (maximum power: 30 mW) and a 561 nm (maximum power: 100 mW) diode-pumped solid-state laser (both from Crystalaser) for excitation of GCaMP6s and of tdTomato, respectively. Beamsplitters (BS007, Thorlabs) and photodiodes (SM1PD1A, Thorlabs) were used to monitor the output of each laser. The laser beams were attenuated with absorptive neutral density filters (Thorlabs), and each was aligned to one of the two entrances of the three-stage tabletop black case (Doric Lenses). At the corresponding entrances the excitation filters used were 473 nm (LD01-473/10-25 Semrock) and 561 nm (LL02-561-25 Semrock). Inside the black case three interchangeable/stackable cubes (Doric Lenses) with dichroic mirrors were used: one to separate the 473 nm excitation light from longer wavelengths (Chroma T495LP), one to collect the emission light of GCaMP6s (FF552-Di02−25 × 36 Semrock), and one to separate the 561 nm excitation light from tdTomato’s fluorescence (Di01-R561−25 × 36). A collimator (F = 12 mm, NA = 0.50, Doric Lenses) focused the laser beams in a single multimode silica optical fiber with 300 µm core and 0.22 NA (MFP_300/330/900–0.22_2.5m-FC_CM3, Doric Lenses), which was used for transmission of all excitation and emission wavelengths. The three-stage tabletop black case had two exits, one for each fluorophore emission, at which we placed the corresponding emission filters (Chroma ET525/50m for GCaMP6s and Semrock LP02-568RS-25 for tdTomato), and convergent lenses (F = 40 mm and F = 50 mm, Thorlabs) before the photodetectors (photomultiplier tube module H7422-02, Hamamatsu Photonics).

For the behavioral experiments, lick rate was acquired at 1 KHz and smoothed using convolution with a Gaussian filter of 50 ms standard deviation. Mean anticipatory licking was calculated for each trial as the mean lick rate in the period of 500–2800 ms after odor onset, after subtracting the mean lick rate over a baseline period of −500 to 500 ms around odor onset. To evaluate the aversiveness of the air puff delivered to the mice in the photometry experiment, we used a CCD camera (Point Grey) to record the right eye of six mice during several sessions at 60 Hz. To quantify blinking in video data, we manually selected the eye area in each session and calculated the mean pixel value for that area; then, for each frame, we subtracted this value from the previous frame to obtain a measure of movement. The start and end of blinking created a sudden increase and decrease, respectively, in the difference between the mean pixel value of consecutive video frames. In the time course analysis of the licking behavior in the hM4D experiment, trials of sessions around reversal were concatenated and smoothing over three trials was performed along the trials. For each reversed odor and each mouse, the last 50 trials before reversal were fit by a constant function of the form (A+B); the first 200 trials after the reversal were fit by an exponential function of the form (A+B*exp(-t/τ)) using <italic>fminsearch</italic> in MATLAB. The conditions for this fitting to be done were: the last 100 trials before reversal had to be statistically different from trials 100–200 after the reversal (<italic>t</italic>-test), the change in licking pattern had to follow the correct trend of the reversal (increase in licking for positive reversals and decrease in licking for negative ones), and the time constant obtained had to be larger than 1. Mouse–odor pairs that did not fulfill this condition were excluded (that is, odor 4 of mice M#4 and M#5). Time constants were grouped according to the type of reversal and genotype with drug treatment, and compared using one-way ANOVA. Then, for each SERT-Cre mouse, the time constant of the reversal with the vehicle was subtracted from the reversal with CNO. The same was done for WT mice, but subtracting the time constant of reversal two from that of reversal 1 (since CNO was delivered in both). <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine whether these differences had means significantly different from zero.</p><p>Fluorescence data were downsampled to 1 kHz and smoothed using convolution with a Gaussian filter of 100 ms standard deviation. For each trial, the relative change in fluorescence, ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = (F-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, was calculated by taking F<sub>0</sub> to be the mean fluorescence during a 1 s period before the odor presentation for both the red and the green channels ([ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>] <sub>GREEN</sub> and [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>] <sub>RED</sub>). For each session and each mouse, the distribution of green and red values of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was fitted by the sum of two Gaussians along the red channel, and the crossing point between these two Gaussians was used as a boundary (excluding the first and last 1000 ms of each trial because of filtering artifacts). All values of [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>]<sub>RED</sub> below this boundary were used, together with the corresponding [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>]<sub>GREEN</sub>, to fit a linear regression line. Then, for each trial we corrected the green ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values using the parameters (<italic>a</italic> - slope; <italic>b</italic> - offset) obtained with the regression model of that mouse in that session: [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>]<sub>GREEN_corr</sub> = [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>] <sub>GREEN</sub> - <italic>a</italic>*[ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>] <sub>RED</sub> - <italic>b</italic>.</p><p>Behavioral data were organized as a function of US type and divided into CS and US responses. [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>]<sub>GREEN_corr</sub> US responses were normalized by subtracting the mean [ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>]<sub>GREEN_corr</sub> over the 1 s interval before US onset. The CS or US response was considered the mean of the signal during the 1.5 s period after CS or US onset, respectively. For each mouse, all CS and US responses were z-scored in the expert phase, so that the amplitudes of responses to the different events could be compared. Analysis of US responses across days was performed by z-scoring all US responses of each mouse across days for each US type. Statistical analysis was done by comparing each day with pre-reversal days −1 and −2. For each mouse, mean amplitude of response to each US on the reversal day was also compared to the day before the reversal. For analysis of uncued US trials, four days of each mouse were pooled together due to the small number of uncued trials of each US type in each session.</p><p>For the analysis of CS response time courses during a reversal, each mean amplitude change across trials was fitted by an exponential function with maximum time constant of 225 trials (minimum number of trials after the reversal for any US type of any mouse). The same criteria and parameters used for the hM4D experiments were used here. Time constants for mouse–odor pairs were pooled together in pairs (odors 1 and 2, and odors 3 and 4) which correspond to the negative and positive reversals, respectively.</p><p>The data are available from the Dryad Digital Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.649nk">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.649nk</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matias, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry and anatomical verification</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (Eutasil, CEVA Sante Animale), exsanguinated transcardially with cold saline and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (P6148, Sigma-Aldrich).

Images for DAPI, GFP and Alexa Fluor 592 were acquired, and cells expressing GCaMP6s and cells stained with 5-HT antibody were quantified in a 200 × 200 µm window in the center of the DRN. The same was done for quantification of specificity in DA neurons of TH-Cre mice, but acquiring Alexa Fluor 647 instead of 592, and taking the 200 × 200 µm window on the infection side. To evaluate fiber location in relation to infection, images for DAPI, YFP or GFP and tdTomato were acquired with an upright fluorescence scanning microscope (Axio Imager M2, Zeiss) equipped with a digital CCD camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss) with a 10X objective. The location of the fiber tip was determined by the most anterior brain damage made by the optical fiber subtracted by its radius. The center of infection was estimated through visual inspection of slices as the location where there were most infected cells. The distance between the fiber tip location and center of infection was calculated as an anterior–posterior distance, which was estimated by comparing each corresponding location in the mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). To determine the overlap between cells expressing YFP or GCaMP6s and tdTomato in SERT-Cre mice, we used a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710, Zeiss) with a 20X objective (optical slice thickness of 1.8 µm) to image three slices around the center of infection (slices −1, 0 and 1, relative to it).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jeremiah Y Cohen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Mainen and colleagues examines the role of 5HT in reversal learning. They use a combination of techniques, including inactivation, imaging, and behavior in rodents, to show that dorsal raphe 5HT neurons encode both positive and negative prediction errors and may play a role in modulating perseverative behaviors. A particularly noteworthy feature of this study is that they compared response properties of 5HT and DA neurons, showing that they share many similarities but some key differences that help to distinguish their specific computational roles in adaptive behavior.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the experiments are well done, the analyses sound, and the paper well written. The reviewers also commended the novel idea of how different time courses of learning could cause 5-HT to regulate behavior during certain forms of reversal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that &quot;5-HT US responses resemble closely an unsigned prediction error&quot; seems like an over-simplification, given the data. Several complications to this interpretation should be addressed more directly, including:</p><p>The very next paragraph in the Discussion notes the &quot;one notable divergence&quot; from this idea, involving the response to the air puff. The argument that this difference involves a difference in control is interesting, but not tested directly. Also, what about blinks, which presumably could reduce the aversiveness of the air puffs. And what is the evidence that rodents learned to predict the air puffs as well as the positive rewards? Moreover, consider the reversals between the large reward and air puff. In theory, both unexpected outcomes should generate equal unsigned prediction errors. However, only the response to the large reward is higher when unpredicted. Response to the air puff is unchanged, with a trend to being lower. Even if animals failed to respond to air puffs appropriately (as the authors suggest in the Discussion), they should still detect that on unexpected air puff trials there is an omission of big reward. We know they have detected this omission and learned from it because they rapidly reduced licking to the CS. This should entail a large unsigned prediction error to omission of big reward at least as large as the clear response to omission of small reward. Indeed, DA had similar inhibitory responses to unexpected neutral and air puff USs. However 5-HT's air puff expectation effect was non-significant and the response actually trended to be larger for expected air puff, which is the opposite effect from what it should have. It seems like the most parsimonious account is that 5-HT reports unsigned prediction error except when an air puff is present, in which case it ignores the unsigned prediction error and has a stereotyped excitation. This would be a very interesting wrinkle on the conclusions, because the authors argue throughout the paper that 5-HT is important for learning, so there should be a big difference in reward learning when air puff is present versus absent. However, the present experiments don't provide evidence of this.</p><p>The statement that &quot;5-HT neurons showed little or no response to expected water rewards before reversal, but responded robustly to the same rewards when they were unexpected, after reversal&quot; seems problematic. Specifically, unexpected small reward did not seem to have a robust response that was affected by expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). If 5-HT reported unsigned prediction error this response should be significant as it was in DA neurons.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>-HT was activated by unexpected neutral tone but DA did not respond (at least as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> seems to show mild inhibition for unexpected neutral and air puff, so the absence of effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> may be an issue with the analysis windows). According to the logic of the paper, either 5-HT does not signal unsigned prediction error, or it is based on a different concept of prediction error than DA.</p><p>If 5-HT reports unsigned prediction error, &quot;surprise&quot;, or &quot;uncertainty&quot;, why is it activated by CSs in proportion to their value? If it reported unsigned prediction error then it should be more activated by CSs with extreme values than ones with intermediate values because those evoke the biggest unsigned prediction errors. If it reported surprise then it should be excited similarly by all CSs because all four CSs are equally probable. If it reported uncertainty then it should be more activated by all CSs shortly after reversal when their CS-US associations became more uncertain.</p><p>2) The statement that &quot;rather than reporting the affective value of the environment…, we suggest that 5-HT facilitates the ability of an organism to flexibly adapt to dynamic environments through plasticity and behavioural control&quot; is a very intriguing suggestion made throughout the paper. However, it is not tested directly, but perhaps could be with the existing data. Were correlations between 5-HT activity and behavioral flexibility? 5-HT responds more to positive than negative CSs but animals seem to learn about both with similar speed (at least in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). 5-HT responds more to unexpected neutral than unexpected small reward, and more to unexpected large reward than unexpected air puff, so if the authors were correct animals should learn at different rates from those outcomes. This could be tested. Also, the authors measure learning rates for CS but not US responses. Are their learning rates consistent? This seems highly relevant to their interpretations. For instance 5-HT CS responses are slow to learn but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> makes US learning seem very fast. Does this mean that the US &quot;surprise&quot; response and CS &quot;value&quot; response are based on different expectations? If so this would be further evidence that the 5-HT responses obey different rules, and may not be explained by a single umbrella concept like &quot;surprise&quot; or &quot;unsigned prediction error&quot;.</p><p>3) Given that we don't know the underlying distribution of single-5-HT-neuron calcium dynamics, it is difficult to interpret the point estimate of that distribution (population calcium dynamics measured here). This is especially salient in the context of electrophysiological recordings of individual DR neurons (including work from the senior author's lab [Ranade and Mainen, 2009]), that show a high degree of heterogeneity of individual DR (and identified 5-HT) neuronal responses. This is treated in the Discussion, but the limitations need to be more clearly defined. Indeed, Muzerelle et al., cited here to support the idea of diffuse projection targets of individual 5-HT neurons, actually shows quite a bit of target specificity, and agrees with work from Gagnon and Parent (PLoS ONE, 2014). Also, I strongly suggest changing the title, as firing patterns were not measured in this study.</p><p>4) The argument that previous studies did not find prediction-error-like responses due to weak prediction errors could be more clearly explained. Why is reversal a &quot;stronger&quot; prediction error than unexpected rewards or omissions? If anything, it seems that reversals as presented here are relatively weak in driving behavioral changes, because it took mice a couple of hundred trials to achieve asymptotic behavior. Could the different timescales of reversals compared to momentary deviations from predicted outcomes be the more relevant discrepancy? How is prediction error strength quantified here?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it appears that there may be a small difference in the time constant fit to reversals from negative to positive. Is this true for particular mice? Specifically, were any of the effects of inactivation on the time constant of positive reversal significant? Showing mouse-by-mouse data would be useful.</p><p>6) The authors should consider rearranging their figures for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, which allows more than 4 figures. The figures are all very dense and are associated with up to 9(!) supplemental figures. Also, the critical comparison between 5-HT and DA is hard to understand because no DA CS or US traces are shown in the main figures. At the very least, the authors should present a direct comparison of the traces of 5-HT and DA responses before, during, and after reversal, which is the key result of the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Activity patterns of serotonin neurons underlying cognitive flexibility&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>: presumably the y labels should be &quot;Anticp. licking (norm. fit)&quot;, not &quot;Time constant (trials),&quot; correct?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: how is &quot;eye movement or blinking&quot; measured? What are the units that allowed those two measures to be combined (and then why is it listed as &quot;a.u.&quot; in the figure)?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>: panels A and B are a bit hard to parse and could use some more explanation; e.g., these are (presumably) ordered by duration of the lick bout; they (presumably) show a fixed time before the onset of, and after the offset of, the lick bout; etc. Why do the trials at the bottom not appear to have &quot;bouts&quot;?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>: This analysis is an interesting and welcome addition, but perhaps a bit more and nuanced interpretation of these results would be useful. There seems to be an order of magnitude (at least) difference in how much longer the 5HT response versus the behavior persisted for a negative reversal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20552.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The claim that &quot;5-HT US responses resemble closely an unsigned prediction error&quot; seems like an over-simplification, given the data.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we had presented a simplified interpretation.

The argument that this difference involves a difference in control is interesting, but not tested directly.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the main point of divergence between the US data and the idealized prediction error signal is with respect to responses to aversive events. We have reduced the strength of this claim throughout the manuscript. We now directly consider the proposal that US responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli may reflect two independent sources of information as well as the “control” hypothesis in the Discussion subsection “Response to aversive events by DRN 5- HT neurons”.</p><p><italic>Also, what about blinks, which presumably could reduce the aversiveness of the air puffs. And what is the evidence that rodents learned to predict the air puffs as well as the positive rewards?</italic> </p><p>Mice did not show anticipatory blinking to air puffs, despite extensive training. They did show air puff triggered blinking that was present before training. Therefore, one potential explanation for the continued presence of air puff responses after training and the relative insensitivity of the air puff response to reversals is that the air puff US was never predictable. Indeed, there is evidence other previous studies that with a 2 s trace period mice do not learn predictive eye blink responses (Reynolds 1945; Boneau 1958; Cohen et al., 2012, 2015). However, it does seem puzzling that mice would learn CS-US relationships with the same trace period for rewards but not for air puffs. We now discuss this issue explicitly in the Discussion (subsection “Response to aversive events by DRN 5-HT neurons”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Moreover, consider the reversals between the large reward and air puff. In theory, both unexpected outcomes should generate equal unsigned prediction errors. However, only the response to the large reward is higher when unpredicted. Response to the air puff is unchanged, with a trend to being lower. Even if animals failed to respond to air puffs appropriately (as the authors suggest in the Discussion), they should still detect that on unexpected air puff trials there is an omission of big reward. We know they have detected this omission and learned from it because they rapidly reduced licking to the CS. This should entail a large unsigned prediction error to omission of big reward at least as large as the clear response to omission of small reward. Indeed, DA had similar inhibitory responses to unexpected neutral and air puff USs. However 5-HT's air puff expectation effect was non-significant and the response actually trended to be larger for expected air puff, which is the opposite effect from what it should have. It seems like the most parsimonious account is that 5-HT reports unsigned prediction error except when an air puff is present, in which case it ignores the unsigned prediction error and has a stereotyped excitation.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point. After the reversal from large reward to air puff the air puff US represents not only an aversive stimulus, but also the omission of an expected reward. Even if the air puff is equally unexpected before and after reversal, the presence of the additional reward omission should generate a positive US response, just as the omission of the small US response did.</p><p>We admit that we do not have a full explanation for this phenomenon. We agree that one possibility is that the air puff has an inhibitory modulatory effect on the reward omission response. This is reminiscent of the interactions recently reported by Matsumoto et al. (2016). Another possibility is simply that the air puff response alone is already at a level close to saturation and the absence of significant additional effect reflects a ceiling effect. We now discuss these issues in the Discussion (subsection “Response to aversive events by DRN 5-HT neurons”).</p><p><italic>This would be a very interesting wrinkle on the conclusions, because the authors argue throughout the paper that 5-HT is important for learning, so there should be a big difference in reward learning when air puff is present versus absent. However, the present experiments don't provide evidence of this.</italic> </p><p>We do not wish to claim and are careful not to state that the 5-HT system is solely responsible for reversal learning (see point 2 below). Therefore, the idea that the speed of learning of specific CS-US associations will depend directly on the magnitude of 5-HT US responses is not a strong implication of our interpretation of the data. We expect other systems to contribute to reversal learning and their contributions may dominate or warp these relationships. It will certainly be interesting but is beyond the scope of this paper to examine directly the difference between reversal learning with and without aversive stimuli. We do note that the time constants in the DREADD experiments, in which no air puffs were used, are a bit slower than those in the GCaMP experiments.</p><p><italic>The statement that &quot;5-HT neurons showed little or no response to expected water rewards before reversal, but responded robustly to the same rewards when they were unexpected, after reversal&quot; seems problematic. Specifically, unexpected small reward did not seem to have a robust response that was affected by expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). If 5-HT reported unsigned prediction error this response should be significant as it was in DA neurons.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct that the response was not significant when comparing only days -1 and day 0 (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, when running an ANOVA across days (previous Figure 2—figure supplement 7, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) comparing each day post reversal with the 2 days before reversal there is a significant increase in the reversal day for the population. We substituted the example mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> to make this point clearer.</p><p>Nevertheless, the size of the small reward error response was probably diminished by the failure of the small water responses to disappear even after training. We added a note to this effect in the Results section: “The response to small reward was also modulated by reward expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), although to a lesser degree, perhaps due to the presence of a small response even after extensive training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>-HT was activated by unexpected neutral tone but DA did not respond (at least as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> seems to show mild inhibition for unexpected neutral and air puff, so the absence of effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> may be an issue with the analysis windows). According to the logic of the paper, either 5-HT does not signal unsigned prediction error, or it is based on a different concept of prediction error than DA.</italic> </p><p>As described above, we have reduced the strength of our conclusions regarding the idea that 5- HT signals a pure unsigned reward prediction error. We agree with the reviewer that the absence of significant inhibition in DA neurons to neutral and air puff US’s in this experiment (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">figure 7C</xref>), is likely due to the analysis window used to calculate the response. Because the detailed analysis and interpretation of DA responses to neutral and aversive stimuli is not the focus of our manuscript and is a topic of debate among DA experts (Matsumoto &amp; Hikosaka 2009, Lammel et al. 2012, Fiorillo 2013; Lerner et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2016, Matsumoto et al., 2016), we chose to keep the analysis window constant throughout the paper/analysis (1.5 s from outcome onset). We acknowledge that further work will be important to address these issues.</p><p><italic>If 5-HT reports unsigned prediction error, &quot;surprise&quot;, or &quot;uncertainty&quot;, why is it activated by CSs in proportion to their value? If it reported unsigned prediction error then it should be more activated by CSs with extreme values than ones with intermediate values because those evoke the biggest unsigned prediction errors. If it reported surprise then it should be excited similarly by all CSs because all four CSs are equally probable. If it reported uncertainty then it should be more activated by all CSs shortly after reversal when their CS-US associations became more uncertain.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the pattern of CS and US responses does not neatly fit into a highly specific pattern of “surprise”. We have made every effort to be explicit about this in our revised Results and Discussion, as discussed above.</p><p>Still, we do not believe the distinction between the terms “unsigned prediction error”, “surprise”, and “uncertainty” is as clear in the literature as proposed in the reviewers’ comment. Therefore, we do not fully understand the specific predictions being suggested.</p><p>For example, according to Courville et al., 2006, “surprise” is a term used in associative learning approaches to name non-predicted reinforcers. According to these authors, surprise signals “change”, which leads to uncertainty about one’s model of the world in a Bayesian approach. In such an approach, surprising events that are non-reinforcers can also increase uncertainty and thus increase learning. Thus, “prediction error”, “surprise” and “uncertainty” are used more or less interchangeably in previous work.</p><p>In order to try to better avoid possible confusion, we decided to avoid as much as possible using the words “surprise” and “uncertainty” except where we discuss explicitly the meaning and relationship between these terms (Discussion).</p><p><italic>2) The statement that &quot;rather than reporting the affective value of the environment…, we suggest that 5-HT facilitates the ability of an organism to flexibly adapt to dynamic environments through plasticity and behavioural control&quot; is a very intriguing suggestion made throughout the paper. However, it is not tested directly, but perhaps could be with the existing data.</italic> </p><p>We believe that the DREADD inhibition experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) does provide direct evidence for the role for DRN 5-HT in flexible adaptation of this sort, adding to the previous work cited (Clarke 2004; Clarke et al. 2007; Boulougouris &amp; Robbins 2010; Bari et al. 2010; Brigman et al. 2010; Berg et al. 2014).</p><p><italic>Were correlations between 5-HT activity and behavioral flexibility? 5-HT responds more to positive than negative CSs but animals seem to learn about both with similar speed (at least in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). 5-HT responds more to unexpected neutral than unexpected small reward, and more to unexpected large reward than unexpected air puff, so if the authors were correct animals should learn at different rates from those outcomes. This could be tested.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion of examining more carefully the relationship between the time constants of 5-HT and behavioral changes.</p><p>We never intended to claim that 5-HT is the <italic>only</italic> mechanism underlying reversal learning – we use the phrase “contributes to” cognitive flexibility deliberately for that reason (subsection “5-HT CS responses could be responsible for inhibiting perseverative responding”, first paragraph, subsection “5-HT CS responses could be responsible for inhibiting perseverative responding”, last paragraph). Therefore, we don’t expect that behavioral learning rates will have a 1:1 correspondence with the magnitude of 5-HT signals, since other signals (e.g. other neuromodulators) whose time constants are unknown are likely also contributing. Moreover, for these analyses, to improve signal-to-noise we needed to group positive and negative odour data (i.e. CS1 &amp; 2 together and CS3 &amp; 4 together), which prevents the suggested single-CS analysis.</p><p>However, we were motivated by this suggestion to explore other potential correlations in the data, such as the relationship between the time constant of behavioral adaptation and the 5-HT CS and US responses before or after reversal.</p><p>In the process of these analyses we found a small error in the previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), namely that we were not using the background-subtracted licking rate. After reversal some mice show an overall increase in lick rate along the entire trial, including in the period before they smell the odour. Subtracting the period just before the odour onset therefore improves the detection of odor-specific differences in anticipatory lick rate. It is then easier to see the faster adaptation to the negative reversals (stopping anticipatory licking) than to the positive reversals (starting anticipatory licking).</p><p>We found two interesting results. First, we found a significant correlation between the time constant of behavior for stopping anticipatory licking and the corresponding time constant for the 5-HT CS signal during a negative reversal. There was no such correlation during positive reversals. This supports the result of the DREADD experiment and suggests that 5-HT seems to act at least partly through its CS-mediated effects. Second, for all animals the time constant of change in 5-HT CS activity for negative reversals is slower than change in anticipatory licking, as would be needed for 5-HT to continue to suppress this response by direct behavioral inhibition.</p><p>We believe these analyses provide important new support for the involvement of 5-HT in the process of behavioral adaptation. We have included them as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and Results (last paragraph) and Discussion (subsection “5-HT CS responses could be responsible for inhibiting perseverative responding”, first paragraph). We again thank the reviewers for suggesting this approach.</p><p><italic>Also, the authors measure learning rates for CS but not US responses. Are their learning rates consistent? This seems highly relevant to their interpretations. For instance 5-HT CS responses are slow to learn but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> makes US learning seem very fast. Does this mean that the US &quot;surprise&quot; response and CS &quot;value&quot; response are based on different expectations? If so this would be further evidence that the 5-HT responses obey different rules, and may not be explained by a single umbrella concept like &quot;surprise&quot; or &quot;unsigned prediction error&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that analysis of the time course of US responses would be very interesting. Unfortunately, the US responses are somewhat smaller and less consistent than the CS responses. For example, US responses tend to decrease over a session and then increase again in the beginning of the next session. Hence, although we attempted to, we were not able to get reasonable fits to the time course of the US’s. We now mention this point in the Results (subsection “CS responses of 5-HT neurons have slower kinetics after reversal than DA’s”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Given that we don't know the underlying distribution of single-5-HT-neuron calcium dynamics, it is difficult to interpret the point estimate of that distribution (population calcium dynamics measured here). This is especially salient in the context of electrophysiological recordings of individual DR neurons (including work from the senior author's lab [Ranade and Mainen, 2009]), that show a high degree of heterogeneity of individual DR (and identified 5-HT) neuronal responses. This is treated in the Discussion, but the limitations need to be more clearly defined. Indeed, Muzerelle et al., cited here to support the idea of diffuse projection targets of individual 5-HT neurons, actually shows quite a bit of target specificity, and agrees with work from Gagnon and Parent (PLoS ONE, 2014). Also, I strongly suggest changing the title, as firing patterns were not measured in this study.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the suggestion of the reviewers to change the title of the manuscript to avoid referring to firing patterns. The new title is: “Activity patterns of serotonin neurons underlying cognitive flexibility”.</p><p>In addition, we fleshed out this section of the Discussion, “Implications of neuronal heterogeneity and other complexities of the 5-HT system”. We now more explicitly discuss the limitations of fiber photometry with respect to possible heterogeneity. We now cite Muzerelle et al. 2014 and Gagnon &amp; Parent (2014) for the specificity of projections.</p><p><italic>4) The argument that previous studies did not find prediction-error-like responses due to weak prediction errors could be more clearly explained. Why is reversal a &quot;stronger&quot; prediction error than unexpected rewards or omissions? If anything, it seems that reversals as presented here are relatively weak in driving behavioral changes, because it took mice a couple of hundred trials to achieve asymptotic behavior. Could the different timescales of reversals compared to momentary deviations from predicted outcomes be the more relevant discrepancy? How is prediction error strength quantified here?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this point could have been more clear in our manuscript. We agree that the discrepancy in timescales is a very relevant point. This issue has been previously discussed in terms of expected and unexpected uncertainty by, e.g. Yu and Dayan (2002; 2005). In omission trials, which are randomly interleaved and averaged over hundreds of trials, omissions become “expected uncertainty” or variability in the outcome. In contrast, in a reversal task, the sudden change that occurs after many days of stable conditions constitutes “unexpected uncertainty” and indeed leads to a change in behaviour. We now include a similar discussion in the last paragraph of the Introduction).</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, it appears that there may be a small difference in the time constant fit to reversals from negative to positive. Is this true for particular mice? Specifically, were any of the effects of inactivation on the time constant of positive reversal significant? Showing mouse-by-mouse data would be useful.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it appears that there is a small difference here, but it was not statistically significant. We have added the normalized fittings for individual mice-odour pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. It can be seen from those plots that in the positive reversal there is a lot of variability in the three groups of mice. Because we have only one fit for each odour of each animal, we need several mice to perform statistics. This is what we did in the manuscript and we could not reach significance (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend): 1-way ANOVA, F2,16 = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.715 for positive reversal.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should consider rearranging their figures for publication in eLife, which allows more than 4 figures. The figures are all very dense and are associated with up to 9(!) supplemental figures. Also, the critical comparison between 5-HT and DA is hard to understand because no DA CS or US traces are shown in the main figures. At the very least, the authors should present a direct comparison of the traces of 5-HT and DA responses before, during, and after reversal, which is the key result of the paper.</italic> </p><p>We took this suggestion and reworked both the figures and associated text. The figures have been rearranged and DA traces included in the main figures for comparison with 5-HT:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was not changed;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> now shows only the behavior of the animals to the reversal task used for fiber photometry;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the experimental approach and pre-reversal data for 5-HT and DA;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows 5-HT and DA US responses to large reward during reversal;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows 5-HT and DA US responses to neutral outcome during reversal;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> summarizes the comparison of mean US responses to the four outcomes on the reversal day with that on the day before reversal;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows the mean US responses of 5-HT and DA to surprising and predicted outcomes;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> compares mean CS responses before reversal and 3 days after it for both 5-HT and DA;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows the time course analysis of the change in CS responses for 5- HT and DA as well as our proposed model of DA-5-HT interaction during reversal;</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> shows the relationship between time constant of adaptation of 5-HT CS responses versus the time constants of behavioral adaptation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>: presumably the y labels should be &quot;Anticp. licking (norm. fit)&quot;, not &quot;Time constant (trials),&quot; correct?</italic> </p><p>Yes, thank you for pointing it out. We have corrected the <italic>y</italic> label in the figure.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: how is &quot;eye movement or blinking&quot; measured? What are the units that allowed those two measures to be combined (and then why is it listed as &quot;a.u.&quot; in the figure)?</italic> </p><p>We have now restricted ourselves to the use of “blinking” in the figure and in the text. The way we measured it is described in the Materials and methods section and we expanded this description in this version of the manuscript: “To quantify blinking in video data, we manually selected the eye area in each session and calculated the mean pixel value for that area; then, for each frame, we subtracted this value from the previous frame to obtain a measure of movement. The start and end of blinking created a sudden increase and decrease, respectively, in the difference between the mean pixel value of consecutive video frames.”</p><p>Because this difference between consecutive frames is the mean pixel value of the eye area, we quantify it in arbitrary units (a.u.) in the figure.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>: panels A and B are a bit hard to parse and could use some more explanation; e.g., these are (presumably) ordered by duration of the lick bout; they (presumably) show a fixed time before the onset of, and after the offset of, the lick bout; etc. Why do the trials at the bottom not appear to have &quot;bouts&quot;?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out important clarifications needed in the figure legend. We have included an additional panel as an inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> A to show the distribution of inter-lick intervals, which is used to define the bouts. The figure legend has been made more explicit: “(A), (B) Surface plots showing raw GCaMP6s (A) and tdTomato (B) fluorescence signals aligned on the onsets of lick bouts during an example session of a SERT-Cre mouse infected with the corresponding fluorophore. Gray dots represent single licks. Inset in (A, right) shows the distribution of inter-lick intervals for this session: lick bouts were defined as sequences of licks separated by no more than 315 ms. The surface plots are aligned from longer lick bouts at the top to shorter ones at the bottom (the last ones are single licks that do not belong to any bout). Fluorescence data is shown from 2 s before to 2 s after the duration of the bouts.”</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>: This analysis is an interesting and welcome addition, but perhaps a bit more and nuanced interpretation of these results would be useful. There seems to be an order of magnitude (at least) difference in how much longer the 5HT response versus the behavior persisted for a negative reversal.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now added the following paragraph at the end of the Results section to provide further interpretation:</p><p>“We note that while we expected that the adaptation of 5-HT CS responses to the reversal should be at least as slow as that of anticipatory licking for the two to be causally related, the fact that it was much slower (around 8 times as slow) requires explanation. […] Alternatively, it may be the case that 5-HT CS responses could serve more than a mere motor suppression function during reversal learning, and contribute to the longer-lasting learning processes required for reversal learning (He et al. 2015), such as those that prevent spontaneous recovery following extinction training (Karpova et al., 2011).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
