Here, we reconstituted an autophagy-regulated secretion of mature IL-1β (m-IL-1β) in non-macrophage cells. We found that cytoplasmic IL-1β associates with the autophagosome and m-IL-1β enters into the lumen of a vesicle intermediate but not into the cytoplasmic interior formed by engulfment of the autophagic membrane. In advance of secretion, m-IL-1β appears to be translocated across a membrane in an event that may require m-IL-1β to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible and is dependent on two KFERQ-like motifs essential for the association of IL-1β with HSP90. A vesicle, possibly a precursor of the phagophore, contains translocated m-IL-1β and later turns into an autophagosome in which m-IL-1β resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure. Completion of IL-1β secretion requires Golgi reassembly and stacking proteins (GRASPs) and multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11205.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11205.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11205.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells release a large number of proteins to the extracellular space. The majority of these ‘secreted’ proteins first pass through two structures inside cells called the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. However, a growing number of proteins have been identified that are released by an unconventional mechanism that bypasses the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi.</p><p>Autophagy is a process that destroys damaged proteins and other unwanted material in cells. It gets triggered when cells are starved of nutrients, leading them to digest their own materials and recycle the resources into new molecules. During autophagy, a cup-like structure with a double layer of membrane forms around the material that is to be digested. This structure then elongates and eventually engulfs the material to form a bubble-like compartment called the autophagosome. Recent evidence has suggested that autophagosomes are involved in the unconventional secretion of a protein called interleukin-1β; this protein is crucial for the body’s immune response against infection. However, it was not clear how these proteins entered the autophagosomes.</p><p>Zhang et al. have now explored the link between interleukin-1β and autophagy in more detail. The experiments showed that when autophagy was triggered by starvation, the secretion of interleukin-1β was enhanced. Conversely, when autophagy was inhibited, interleukin-1β accumulated inside the cells and could not be secreted.</p><p>Further experiments then revealed unexpectedly that interleukin-1β was not engulfed by the cup-like structure (as is the case for material that is destined to be removed). Instead, interleukin-1β was found to enter into smaller bubble-like packages (called vesicles) that turn into the autophagosome.</p><p>Zhang et al. also found that a protein called HSP90 binds to interleukin-1β and enables it to cross the membrane (or translocate) into the vesicles, and that this means that interleukin-1β actually resides in the space between the outer and inner membranes of the autophagosome. How many other proteins share this unusual route out of the cell and what membrane channel is used for this translocation event remain open questions for the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11205.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11205.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>unconventional secretion</kwd><kwd>interleukin-1β</kwd><kwd>HSP90</kwd><kwd>autophagosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenny</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Ke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K99GM114397-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCCF Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009220</institution-id><institution>UC Berkeley College of Chemistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Ke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007247</institution-id><institution>Adolph C. and Mary Sprague Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, University of California Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reconstitution of interleukin-1β secretion in non-macrophage cells implicates how this pro-inflammatory cytokine enters into the unconventional pathway of secretion through autophagy.</meta-value> </custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most eukaryotic secretory proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide are delivered through the classical secretion pathway involving an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi apparatus itinerary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schatz and Dobberstein, 1996</xref>). However, a substantial number of secretory proteins lack a classical signal peptide, called leaderless cargoes, and are released by unconventional means of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nickel and Rabouille, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nickel and Seedorf, 2008</xref>). The range of unconventional secretory cargoes encompasses angiogenic growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix components etc. most of which play essential roles for development, immune surveillance and tissue organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nickel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rabouille et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike a unified route for classical protein secretion, leaderless cargoes undergoing unconventional secretion employ multiple means of protein delivery, the details of which are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nickel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rabouille et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Schekman, 2013</xref>).</p><p>IL-1β is one of the most intensely investigated cargoes of unconventional secretion. A biologically inactive 31 kDa precursor, pro-IL-1β, is made following initiation of the NF-κB signaling cascade. Pro-IL-1β is subsequently converted into the active form, the 17 kDa mature IL-1β, by the pro-inflammatory protease caspase-1 which is activated, in response to extracellular stimuli, after its recruitment to a multi-protein complex called the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cerretti et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rathinam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thornberry et al., 1992</xref>). Interpretation of the mechanism of unconventional secretion of IL-1β is complicated by the fact that one of the physiologic reservoirs of this cytokine, macrophages, undergoes pyroptotic death and cell lysis under conditions of inflammasome activation of caspase-1. Indeed, many reports including two recent publications make the case for cell lysis as a means of release of mature IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shirasaki et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, other reports demonstrate proper secretion of mature IL-1β without cell lysis in, for example, neutrophils, which are nonetheless dependent on the inflammasome response to activate caspase-1 and secrete mature IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Quite aside from the possible complication of cell lysis, another body of work has suggested an unconventional pathway for the proper secretion of IL-1β. Pro-IL-1β lacks a typical signal peptide and the propeptide is processed in the cytosol rather than the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rubartelli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singer et al., 1988</xref>). Although mature IL-1β appears to be incorporated into a vesicular transport system, secretion is not blocked by Brefeldin A, a drug that blocks the traffic of standard secretory proteins form the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rubartelli et al., 1990</xref>). Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in the unconventional secretion of IL-1β, including autophagy, secretory lysosomes, multi-vesicular body (MVB) formation and micro-vesicle shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrei et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brough et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lopez-Castejon and Brough, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacKenzie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verhoef et al., 2003</xref>). However, a clear demonstration of the mechanism for the entry of IL-1β into a vesicular carrier, e.g. the autophagosome, is lacking.</p><p>Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a fundamental mechanism for bulk turnover of intracellular components in response to stresses such as starvation, oxidative stress and pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizushima and Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</xref>). The process is characterized by the formation of a double-membrane vesicle, called the autophagosome, through the elongation and closure of a cup-shaped membrane precursor, termed the phagophore, to engulf cytoplasmic cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>). Completion of autophagosome formation requires a sophisticated protein-vesicle network organized by autophagic factors, such as autophagy-related (ATG) proteins, and target membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). Besides the degradative function, autophagy or ATG proteins have recently been implicated in multiple secretory pathways including the delivery of leaderless cargoes undergoing unconventional secretion, such as the mammalian pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, the nuclear factor HMGB1, and the yeast acyl coenzyme A-binding protein Acb1, to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manjithaya and Subramani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeffer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Subramani and Malhotra, 2013</xref>). The Golgi reassembly and stacking protein(s) GRASP(s) (GRASP55 and GRASP65 in mammals, dGRASP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, GrpA in Dictyostelium and Grh1 in yeast) are required for autophagy-regulated unconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giuliani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kinseth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levi and Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manjithaya et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupont et al., 2011</xref> documented a role for autophagy in the secretion of mature IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>), but how a protein sequestered within an autophagosome could be exported as a soluble protein was unexplained. Here, we sought to understand how conditions of starvation-induced autophagy could localize IL-1β into an autophagosomal membrane. We reconstituted the autophagy-regulated secretion of IL-1β in cultured cell lines and detected a vesicle intermediate, possibly an autophagosome precursor, containing mature IL-1β. Three-dimensional (3D) Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) demonstrated that, after entering into the autophagosome, IL-1β colocalizes with LC3 on the autophagosomal membrane, which, together with an antibody accessibility assay and observations from biochemical assays, implies a topological distribution in the intermembrane space of the autophagosome. This distribution of IL-1β explains the mechanism accounting for its secretion as a soluble protein through either a direct fusion of autophagosome with the plasma membrane or via the MVB pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of autophagy-regulated IL-1β secretion</title><p>A dual effect of autophagy has been proposed on the secretion of IL-1β in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deretic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). On one hand, induction of autophagy directly promotes IL-1β secretion after inflammasome activation by incorporating it into the autophagosomal carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, autophagy indirectly dampens IL-1β secretion by degrading components of the inflammasome as well as reducing endogenous triggers for inflammasome assembly, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damaged components, which are required for the activation of caspase-1 and the production of active IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakahira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To focus our study specifically on the role of autophagy in IL-1β secretion, we reconstituted a stage of IL-1β secretion downstream of inflammasome activation by co-expressing pro-IL-1β (p-IL-1β) and pro-caspase-1 (p-caspase-1) in non-macrophage cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the generation and secretion (~5%) of mature IL-1β (m-IL-1β) was achieved by co-expression of p-IL-1β and p-caspase-1 in HEK293T cells. Mature IL-1β was not produced or secreted without p-caspase-1, whereas a low level of secreted p-IL-1β (~0.2%) was detected with or without the expression of p-caspase-1. Furthermore, little cell lysis occurred during the treatment we used to induce IL-1β secretion: Much less precursor than mature IL-1β and little cytoplasmic tubulin was detected released into the cell supernatant during the 2 hr incubation in starvation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Starvation, a condition that stimulates autophagy, enhanced IL-1β secretion (~3 fold) and reduced the level of IL-1β in the cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Inhibition of autophagy by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or wortmannin (Wtm) blocked IL-1β secretion activated by starvation and caused the accumulation of mature IL-1β in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Likewise, in an autophagy-deficient cell line, Atg5 knockout (KO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizushima et al., 2001</xref>), IL-1β secretion was reduced and failed to respond to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, IL-1β secretion was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of an ATG4B mutant (C74A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>), or after the depletion of ATG2A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Velikkakath et al., 2012</xref>), or FIP200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hara et al., 2008</xref>), which block autophagosome biogenesis at different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Therefore, the reconstituted system recapitulates the autophagy-regulated secretion of IL-1β.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11205.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of autophagy-regulated IL-1β secretion in cultured cells.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Reconstitution of starvation-induced IL-1β secretion in HEK293T cells.

One possibility is engulfment through the closure of the phagophore membrane during autophagosome maturation as in the capture of autophagic cargo. In this scenario, closure of the phagophore to complete autophagosome formation would be required to sequester IL-1β away from the cytoplasm. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that IL-1β may be translocated through a membrane into the lumen of the phagophore envelope and be sequestered from the cytoplasm even before the mature autophagosome is sealed. To test this possibility, we performed proteinase K protection experiments with the membranes from ATG2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In control cells, p62 (an autophagic cargo) and a fraction of LC3-II (which was encapsulated after autophagosome completion), as well as mature IL-1β, were largely resistant to proteinase K digestion similar to the ER luminal protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). In contrast, SEC22B, a membrane anchored SNARE protein exposed to the cytoplasm, was sensitive to proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Triton X-100 treatment permeabilized the membrane and rendered all proteins tested sensitive to proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This demonstrated that the majority of membrane localized IL-1β was sequestered within an organelle, likely the autophagosome, as demonstrated by the fractionation results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. However, the result did not pinpoint where within the autophagosome IL-1β was housed. In ATG2-depleted cells, p62 and LC3-II remained sensitive to proteinase K digestion, consistent with the hypothesis that ATG2 is essential for maturation and closure of the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, in the same samples the majority of IL-1β resisted degradation by proteinase K treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), except on addition of Triton X-100 to permeabilize membranes. Although the precursor form of IL-1β remained associated with isolated autophagosome and phagophore membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the protein was degraded when membranes from normal and ATG2-depleted cells were treated with protease in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (data not shown).

These data indicate that the entry of IL-1β into the vesicle carrier is not dependent on the formation of the autophagosome.

As protein unfolding is usually required for protein translocation, we adopted an approach used in many other circumstances wherein a targeted protein is fused to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme whose three-dimensional structure is stabilized by the folate derivative aminopterin, hence providing a chemical ligand to impede the unfolding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backhaus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eilers and Schatz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wienhues et al., 1991</xref>). We first determined the secretion of the DHFR-fused IL-1β. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, secretion of a mature IL-1β-DHFR fusion protein was enhanced by starvation similar to the untagged counterpart. Importantly, IL-1β-DHFR secretion was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of aminopterin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Of notice, treatment of aminopterin did not completely abolish IL-1β secretion perhaps due to a cell death-induced release of IL-1β at high concentrations of aminopterin, as indicated by the release of a low level of tubulin into the medium fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As a control, aminopterin did not reduce the secretion of untagged IL-1β, confirming its specific effect on DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fractionation of cells incubated with aminopterin showed a reduced level of IL-1β in the membrane fraction with a corresponding increase in the cytosol fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The residual DHFR-tagged IL-1β associated with membranes from aminopterin-treated cells was sensitive to proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that this pool of membrane-associated IL-1β did not translocate into the lumen of the vesicle.

We devised a further visual test of this conclusion using selective permeabilization of cell surface and intracellular membranes with digitonin and saponin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). We compared antibody accessibility to IL-1β and DFCP1, a marker located on the cytosolic surface of the omegasome (a harbor for the phagophore) in both WT and Atg5 KO cells. Consistent with a cytosolic surface localization, DFCP1 was readily labeled in cells treated with digitonin alone (selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane) in both WT and Atg5 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A–E</xref>). In contrast, IL-1β was accessible to the antibody only after treatment with digitonin and saponin (gently permeabilizes the endomembrane) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A,B and F</xref>) in WT cells. This by itself would not distinguish localization of IL-1β to the intermembrane space vs the cytoplasmic enclosed space of a mature autophagosome. However, in Atg5 KO cells where the phagophore precursor envelope remains open and exposed to the cytosol, saponin treatment was necessary to expose IL-1β to antibody and roughly half of the labeled structures coincided with the phagophore marker DFCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5C,D and F</xref>). This visual assay further confirms the intermembrane localization of IL-1β in the phagophore and autophagosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Two KFERQ-like motifs are required for the entry of IL-1β into the vesicle carrier</title><p>In chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), cargoes are recognized by a KFERQ sequence motif for transport into the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dice et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2012</xref>).

The 130-131AA mutant did not affect secretion of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Knockdown of Hsp90, but not of Hsp70 or Hsc70 substantially reduced IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As a control, knockdown of Hsc70 compromised CMA as indicated by the stabilization of a CMA cargo, GAPDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, secretion of mature IL-1β was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by an HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In both experiments, mature IL-1β accumulated in the cytosol fraction at the expense of secretion. Knockdown of Hsp90 also rendered IL-1β accessible to proteinase K digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), consistent with a role for HSP90 in the translocation of IL-1β as opposed to some later secretion event. Furthermore, in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, HSP90 associated with m-IL-1β but not the translocation-deficient mutants Q132K133 and Q198L199 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Although p-IL-1β also formed a complex with HSP90, the efficiency appeared lower than for m-IL-1β. These results suggest that HSP90 binds to a region of the mature IL-1β, including the essential residues Q132K133 and Q198L199, to promote the translocation event.

In addition, knockdown of Lamp2A compromised CMA but did not affect the secretion of IL-1β, and disruption of the lysosome did not result in the release of IL-1β from the membrane carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).

We performed an HSP90 co-immunoprecipitation experiment with cytosol prepared from cells grown in nutrient-rich or starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Starvation led to a ~2.5 fold increase of the association of HSP90 and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This increase was likely not due to starvation-stimulated processing of p-IL-1β because starvation had no effect on the cleavage of mutant forms of IL-1β unable to bind HSP90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Starvation led to a ~ 2 fold increase in the membrane localization and cytosolic depletion of mature IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Cytosolic IL-1β associates with HSP90 which facilitates the translocation of IL-1β into the lumen of a vesicle carrier which later either turns into a phagophore and an autophagosome or fuses with them. IL-1β localizes between the outer and inner membrane after the double membrane autophagosome forms. The topological distribution ensures the secretion of IL-1β in a soluble form. The IL-1β-containing autophagosome may directly fuse with the plasma membrane or further fuse with a MVB followed by fusion with the plasma membrane.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11205.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11205.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11205-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genetic and cell biological studies have implicated autophagy in the transport of several leaderless cargoes to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manjithaya et al., 2010</xref>). Unconventional secretory cargoes, such as IL-1β and Acb1, have been shown to have overlapping requirements with formation of the autophagosome or its precursor suggesting that the autophagosome may physically convey these cargo proteins to the cell surface. A key question is if and how these cargoes engage the autophagosome and how this structure exports soluble cargo molecules. In this study, we probed the organelle association and molecular requirements for the secretion of one such unconventional cargo protein, IL-1β. Using surrogate cell lines rather than macrophages to reconstitute autophagy-mediated secretion of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we find mature IL-1β localized to the lumen of the membrane in early intermediates and mature autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This surprising location may help to explain how mature IL-1β is secreted in a soluble form to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). However, localization to the lumen between the two membranes of the autophagosome would require that IL-1β is translocated from the cytoplasm across the membrane precursor of a phagophore, rather than being engulfed as the phagophore membrane matures by closure into an autophagosome. Our evidence suggests that IL-1β must unfold or be held in an unfolded state to promote membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and that a complex sorting signal in the mature portion of IL-1β interacts with HSP90 to deliver the chaperone and its cargo to a site on a phagophore precursor membrane where the mature species is translocated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>).</p><p>The unconventional secretory cargo fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) has been shown to directly translocate across the plasma membrane as a folded protein without the apparent aid of chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backhaus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steringer et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike FGF2, the entry of IL-1β into the autophagosomal carrier appears to be dependent on protein unfolding in a conformational state that may be fostered by the association of HSP90 with two KFERQ-like sequences within the mature portion of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). This translocation mechanism appears superficially similar to another delivery process termed HSC70-dependent CMA in which autophagic cargoes bearing KFERQ targeting motifs are directed into the lysosome for degradation. Indeed, using a cell-free approach to study the import of CMA cargo into isolated lysosomes, Salvador et al. (2000) reported that DHFR fused to a CMA cargo is blocked in translocation by addition of methotrexate, a drug that stabilizes DHFR to unfolding, just as we have shown that IL-1β fused to DHFR is blocked in cells treated with a cell permeable folate analog, aminopterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). In our fractionation study, IL-1β distributed in LC3-positive autophagosomal carriers that were separated from the lysosome marker LAMP2, the proposed receptor or channel for uptake of CMA cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation, together with the involvement of a different chaperone i.e. HSP90, suggests distinct routes for IL-1β and cargoes of the CMA pathway.</p><p>The target membrane for IL-1β translocation may be a vesicle that could fuse with or form the autophagosome. We find that mature IL-1β can be detected within protease inaccessible membranes in cells blocked early in the autophagic pathway (e.g. ATG5 null cells and cells depleted of FIP200, both of which block at a stage prior to the lipidation of LC3). The identity of the vesicle carrier is unknown and could be any one of those reported to supply membrane to the formation of the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ge et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>). Although we have ruled out the involvement of LAMP2A IL-1β translocation, it is likely that a membrane receptor locating on the membrane of the vesicle carrier, perhaps a functional equivalent of LAMP2A, recruits the protein complex of HSP90 and IL-1β, therefore designating the correct membrane targeting of IL-1β. In addition, a protein conducting channel may be involved in the translocation of IL-1β into the membrane. It seems unlikely that a standard translocation channel, such as SEC61, is involved in this import process, but no current evidence bears on this point.</p><p>The exact route by which the autophagosome delivers mature IL-1β to the cell surface as well as how it avoids fusion with degradative lysosome remains obscure, possibly involving interaction with the multi-vesicular body or some form of lysosome as a prelude to fusion at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), and this process may require selective recruitment of membrane sorting and targeting factors such as Rabs and SNAREs. Fusion of the autophagosome directly with the plasma membrane would lead to the release of soluble IL-1β available to trigger an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissue. If mature IL-1β were engulfed within the cytoplasmic interior of the autophagosome, fusion of this organelle at the cell surface might release an intact vesicle corresponding to the inner membrane-enclosed cytoplasmic compartment of the autophagosome. We found mature IL-1β secreted by macrophages or in our surrogate cell system to be completely soluble, thus inconsistent with the engulfment model (data not shown). An alternative possibility may be that the autophagosome fuses with another intracellular organelle such as the MVB or the lysosome under conditions where the inner membrane of the autophagosome is degraded. If so, mature IL-1β would be available for secretion if the combined organelle (amphisome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) fused with the plasma membrane. However, for this model to be viable, the mature IL-1β released on dissolution of the autophagosome inner membrane would have to withstand proteolytic attack such as may be encountered in an amphisome or lysosome. Because mature IL-1β is clearly sensitive to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), thus any compartment engaged in presenting autophagosomal content to the cell surface must be depleted of proteases. The nature of the organelle that delivers autophagosome content to the plasma membrane may be probed by selective ablation of different Rab proteins, e.g. Rab11, Rab27 and Rab35, which appear to be required for fusion of the MVB with the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostrowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Savina et al., 2002</xref>), or Rab27a and Rab38, implicated in the fusion of lysosomes at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blott and Griffiths, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jager et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and siRNA oligos</title><p>The plasmid encoding p-IL-1β was kindly provided by Russell Vance lab (University of California, Berkeley).

Coverslips were sealed using Cytoseal 60. STORM imaging was performed on a homebuilt setup based on a modified Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted fluorescence microscope using a Nikon CFI Plan Apo λ 100x oil immersion objective (NA 1.45). Dye molecules were photoswitched to the dark state and imaged using either 647- or 560-nm lasers (MPB Communications); these lasers were passed through an acousto-optic tunable filter and introduced through an optical fiber into the back focal plane of the microscope and onto the sample at intensities of ~2 kW cm<sup>-2</sup>. A translation stage was used to shift the laser beams towards the edge of the objective so that light reached the sample at incident angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass-water interface. A 405-nm laser was used concurrently with either the 647- or 560-nm lasers to reactivate fluorophores into the emitting state. The power of the 405-nm laser (typical range 0–1 W cm<sup>-2</sup>) was adjusted during image acquisition so that at any given instant, only a small, optically resolvable fraction of the fluorophores in the sample were in the emitting state. Emission was recorded with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EM-CCD camera at a framerate of 110 Hz, for a total of ~80,000 frames per image. Multicolor imaging was performed by imaging each color channel separately and sequentially using separate emission filters and excitation lasers. For 3D STORM imaging, a cylindrical lens was inserted into the imaging path so that images of single molecules were elongated in opposite directions for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2008</xref>).

Your submission has in principle been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Noboru Mizushima, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission; please note that there are some critical concerns that you will need to address to satisfy the reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a novel mechanism of unconventional secretion, in which IL-1β is first transported into the lumen of the phagophore (i.e., the space between the autophagosomal inner and outer membranes) and then secreted out by an unknown mechanism involving GRASP and some MVB proteins. This translocation depends on two KFERQ-like motifs, typically required for protein translocation across the lysosomal membrane via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and is also dependent of Hsp90, but not Hsc70. Although how IL-1β is secreted rather than being delivered to lysosomes and how GRASP and MVB proteins actually work in IL-1β secretion remains unclear, the present study focuses on the sequestration step. However, there are several major concerns outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The site of membrane translocation of IL-1β is important. The authors show that m-IL-1β is protease-protective in several autophagy mutants. The data of Atg2 KD and Atg5 KO could be reasonable because some intermediate structures can be generated in these cells. In contrast, phagophores are not generated in FIP200 KO cells. However, a significant amount of m-IL-1β is still resistant to proteinase K treatment in FIP200 cells. It suggests that IL-1β is sequestered in some membranous structures other than phagophores, which exist in a large amount comparable to that of phagophores in control cells. Although it is possible that these may be phagophore precursors, what is the assurance that this is phagophore-related?</p><p>An alternative mechanism, which should be ruled out, is that IL-1β is a CMA/MVB substrate that is first transported into the lysosomal/endosomal membrane and then injected into the inter-membrane space of the autophagosome upon fusion. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, there are multiple fractions that contain LC3 and m-IL-1β. It is hard to draw conclusions from this about localization of IL-1β in autophagosome. LC3 is also known to be associated with other membranes, particularly a transfected LC3. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, there is some p- and m-IL-1β associated with lysosomes (Lamp2). How can they eliminate the possibility that some m-IL-1β might be generated by CMA? CMA depends on KFERQ-like sequences, as well as Hsc70 and Hsp90. Here, m-IL-1β production was dependent on Hsp90 depletion using shRNA or inhibition using a drug, but apparently not by Hsc70 depletion. There is an experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) using shRNA to hsc70, but this experiment needs a control for CMA itself making it hard to judge whether CMA was fully inhibited, but m-IL-1β production was not. Otherwise, it cannot be concluded that CMA is not involved in m-IL-1β production.</p><p>2) Although the present study includes many biochemical data, the morphological evidence showing that IL-1β is indeed present in the inter-membrane space is very limited. The fluorescence microscopy data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are suggestive, but not conclusive. It is unclear how representative these ring-shaped structures are.

For example, it is not clear how much protein were in the 3K fractions.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, it appears that m-IL-1β is mostly in the 3K fraction, particularly at the siControl panel, in contrast to what shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. This raises concern about the validity of this technique. These data need to be more carefully described.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: The assertion that p62, LC3 and IL-1β were resistant to proteinase K digestion is not correct.

Our data demonstrates a relationship of secretion of IL-1β to autophagy and the transition of IL-1β through an autophagosome carrier by showing that 1) the secretion of IL-1β is compromised in the absence of several essential autophagy genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); 2) IL-1β resides in LC3-positive compartments during secretion as demonstrated by fractionation, immunoisolation and imaging approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>); and 3) IL-1β may also localize to phagophore structures before the completion of double-membrane autophagosome as shown by the co-fractionation of IL-1β with LC3 in Atg2 RNAi cells where the LC3-positive vesicles are still in the state of phagophore or small closed double-membrane structures. To further confirm the relationship of IL-1β with phagophore, we have now performed immunofluorescence experiments by analyzing the localization of IL-1β and DFCP1, an omegasome marker that decorates the phagophore, in WT U2OS cells and Atg5 KO MEFs. In both cell lines, more than half of IL-1β colocalized with DFCP1 confirming a relationship of IL-1β with the phagophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref>). Even though we demonstrate a transition of IL-1β through phagophore and autophagosome during secretion, it is possible that the site of IL-1β translocation may be neither one of them, as a deficiency of FIP200 did not compromise the entry of IL-1β into the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As indicated in the Discussion of our manuscript, the site of IL-1β translocation could be a vesicle that could become a phagophore, especially in the absence of FIP200. However, we could not completely rule out the possibility that the site of IL-1β translocation is a combination of phagophore, autophagosome and a vesicle other than in WT cells. We agree with the reviewers that to pinpoint the site of membrane translocation of IL-1β is important. However, to completely define the targeting membrane for IL-1β translocation, it is important to identify the translocon, or an equivalent, directly responsible for IL-1β translocation, as well as to reconstitute the translocation process in vitro. This will take at least 1-2 years’ effort. Therefore, we think that these objectives should be our future work and beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We hope that the reviewers agree with our opinion. We have further discussed these points in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>An alternative mechanism, which should be ruled out, is that IL-1β is a CMA/MVB substrate that is first transported into the lysosomal/endosomal membrane and then injected into the inter-membrane space of the autophagosome upon fusion. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, there are multiple fractions that contain LC3 and m-IL-1β. It is hard to draw conclusions from this about localization of IL-1β in autophagosome.

Here, m-IL-1β production was dependent on Hsp90 depletion using shRNA or inhibition using a drug, but apparently not by Hsc70 depletion. There is an experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) using shRNA to hsc70, but this experiment needs a control for CMA itself making it hard to judge whether CMA was fully inhibited, but m-IL-1β production was not. Otherwise, it cannot be concluded that CMA is not involved in m-IL-1β production.</italic></p><p>This is a reasonable concern that we have now addressed. To rule out CMA, we analyzed CMA in the absence and presence of the shRNA against Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>). GAPDH, a CMA substrate, was decreased 2-fold after serum starvation and inhibition of protein synthesis, and this degradation was compromised by knockdown of Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, in this condition, the secretion and membrane entry of IL-1β were not affected indicating that this key chaperone for CMA is not involved in the secretion of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). To further rule out the possibility of CMA, we knocked down Lamp2A, the lysosomal receptor required for CMA, which again blocked the reduction in CMA-induced degradation of GAPDH but did not affect the secretion of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). In addition, we did co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found that IL-1β associates with HSP90 but not HSC70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1B</xref>). HSC70 and HSP90 plays different roles in CMA, HSC70 binds CMA substrates and is involved to deliver substrates to the lysosome. HSP90 is required for LAMP2A oligomerization and stability on the lysosomal membrane, which is essential for substrate translocation. However, in the case of IL-1β secretion, HSP90 acts as a functional equivalent of HSC70 for CMA. We also used glycyl-L-phenylalanine-2-naphthylamide (GPN), a lysosome-disrupting cathepsin C substrate, to disrupt the lysosome, which led to a dramatic decrease of cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1E</xref>), a lysosome luminal hydrolase, in the membrane fraction. However, the level of IL-1β in the membrane fraction was not affected by lysosome disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1E</xref>) indicating the majority of IL-1β is not in the lysosome, or at least the digestive lysosome, during secretion. In summary, all those data indicate that the translocation of IL-1β is mechanistically different from CMA.</p><p>It is unlikely that IL-1β is taken up by the MVB because 1) it should lead to the secretion of IL-1β in the form of exosomes but IL-1β is secreted from cells as a soluble protein; 2) it will not result in the topological distribution of IL-1β in the intermembrane of the autophagosome; 3) enclosure within an intralumenal vesicle should not depend on membrane translocation. However, we could not rule out the possibility that IL-1β could be directly translocated into an MVB. To examine the exact membrane target for translocation of IL-1β, our plan is to devise a cell-free reaction that reproduces this step, and this clearly extends beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Although the present study includes many biochemical data, the morphological evidence showing that IL-1β is indeed present in the inter-membrane space is very limited. The fluorescence microscopy data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are suggestive, but not conclusive. It is unclear how representative these ring-shaped structures are. As this is the main argument of this study, it is recommended to try immune-electron microscopy to detect IL-1β in the inter-membrane space of the autophagosome.</italic></p><p>We agree that immune-EM would further strengthen our conclusion. However, such experiments would require extensive preparatory work and involve a double-immunogold labeling protocol that we currently do not have access to in our lab. As a compromise, we performed selective permeabilization of cell membranes by two detergents, digitonin and saponin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref>). The former one selectively permeabilizes plasma membrane at low temperature and the later one mildly permeabilizes the endomembrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref>, after digitonin treatment, DFCP1 could be labeled by antibodies, as it decorates the cytosolic surface of omegasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5B and D</xref>, green and blue). Interestingly, IL-1β puncta could not be labeled after digitonin treatment, but they appeared after saponin treatment in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5B</xref>, red). As two of the three possibilities of IL-1β localization illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref> panel A, IL-1β puncta should be protected by membrane (either on the inner membrane surface or intermembrane space according to the ring structure obtained from STORM). To discern the two possibilities, we performed the experiment in Atg5 KO cells where the phagophore is not closed. Similarly, the IL-1β puncta could be labeled only after saponin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5D</xref>, red). According to the illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref> panel C, the probability is that IL-1β localizes to the intermembrane space. In addition to these experiments, we also quantified the number of ring structures of IL-1β obtained from the STORM. On average, there are ~18 ring structures in each cell that consists of ~5% of the total IL-1β signal. These ring structures appear representative of the localization of IL-1β in the autophagosome as we have found many of these structures in different cells from independent experiments.</p><p><italic>Minor points:1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: It is not clear what &quot;enriched&quot; means as there are no controls for the amount of proteins. For example, it is not clear how much protein were in the 3K fractions.</italic></p><p>This is a valid point as we neglected to state how the sample sizes were normalized to membrane. For this we employed our previous protocols on membrane fractionation. Each membrane fraction was normalized with an abundant phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. We have added the explanations in the Materials and methods and within the figure legend.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, it appears that m-IL-1β is mostly in the 3K fraction, particularly at the siControl panel, in contrast to what shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. This raises concern about the validity of this technique. These data need to be more carefully described.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this concern. Indeed, the results appear inconsistent with our other repetitions of this experiment therefore we have reprobed the IL-1β samples for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and present the new results on the same samples as were used for the rest of this experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: The assertion that p62, LC3 and IL-1β were resistant to proteinase K digestion is not correct. They are all partially degraded by proteinase K, albeit less than SEC22B.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We have changed the description in the new manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>: The expression of the mutants seem to be much less than WT, which could have been a confounding factor in the interpretation of the data. How much of what seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> lack of secretion vs lack of detection due to low expression of the mutants, although they seem to be expressed well in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> but not in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> raising questions about reproducibility.</italic></p><p>The expression level of WT and mutants are equal. As indicated in the manuscript, there is less mutant protein associated with the membrane fraction because of reduced translocation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, the mutants are lower because we used the membrane fraction for the proteinase K protection assay. To address the concern of unequal level in the membrane, we quantified the percentage of proteinase K protection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, ~45% of WT IL-1β was protected from digestion compared with less than 10% of the mutants.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>: This study is unable to distinguish whether it is transported across the membrane of a vesicular compartment distinct from the phagophore or not. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> should be altered to reflect this.</italic></p><p>We did not highlight the idea of phagophore in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> in the initial version of the manuscript as the structure we drew is not cup-shaped. We have added more explanations in this Figure and the figure legend.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>: What would divert the autophagosome with m-IL-1β in the intermembrane space from fusing with lysosomes, which would dump the IL-1β into the lumen of lysosomes? This may be discussed.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We have discussed this point in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>7) Some references such as Liu et al., 2014 and Shirasaki et al., 2014 are mentioned in the text but not included in References. Please check them carefully.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this. We have added the references.</p></body></sub-article></article>
