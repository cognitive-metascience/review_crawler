Here we identify two linked refining mutations within ISX that interact epistatically to increase binding affinity to the dosage compensation complex. Selection has increased the frequency of this derived haplotype in the population, which is fixed at 30% of ISX insertions and polymorphic among another 41%. Sharing of this haplotype indicates that high levels of gene conversion among ISX elements allow them to ‘crowd-source’ refining mutations, and a refining mutation that occurs at any single ISX element can spread in two dimensions: horizontally across insertion sites by non-allelic gene conversion, and vertically through the population by natural selection. These results describe a novel route by which fully functional regulatory elements can arise rapidly from TEs and implicate non-allelic gene conversion as having an important role in accelerating the evolutionary fine-tuning of regulatory networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05899.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05899.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05899.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mutations change genes and provide the raw material for evolution. Genes are sections of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins or other molecules, and so determine the physical characteristics of each organism. Genetic mutations that increase an organism's number of offspring and chances of survival are more likely to be passed on to future generations. Changes to when or where a gene is switched on (so-called regulatory mutations) can also provide fitness benefits and can therefore be selected for during evolution.</p><p>Transposable elements are sequences of DNA that are also called ‘jumping genes’ because they can make copies of themselves and these copies of the transposable element can move to other locations in the genome. Some transposable elements contain sequences that switch on nearby genes. If different copies of a transposable element that contains such a regulatory sequence insert themselves in more than one place, it can result in a network of genes that can all be controlled in the same way. The regulatory sequences contained within transposable elements are not always optimal, but they can be fine-tuned through evolution.</p><p>A fruit fly called <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic> has a transposable element called ISX that has, over time, placed up to 77 regulatory sequences around one of this species' sex chromosomes. Just as in humans, female flies are XX and males are XY; but having only one copy of the X chromosome means that male flies need to increase the expression of certain genes to produce a full-dose of the molecules made by the genes. This process is called dosage compensation and in 2013 the 77 ISX regulatory sequences on the fruit fly's X chromosome were shown to help recruit the molecular machinery that carries out dosage compensation to nearby genes, albeit inefficiently. Now Ellison and Bachtrog—who also conducted the 2013 study—report how these transposable elements have been fine-tuned to make them more effective for dosage compensation.</p><p>Ellison and Bachtrog uncovered two mutations that make the ISX transposable element better at recruiting the dosage compensation molecular machinery. ISX spread around different locations along the fly's X chromosome before these mutations arose; this means that initially none of the 77 insertions carried the two mutations, but now 30% of the 77 elements have the mutations in all flies, and 41% have them in only some flies.</p><p>The same mutations have spread between the different ISX elements because transposable elements with the mutations have been used to directly convert other ISX elements without them. These mutations have also become more common in the fruit fly population by being passed on to offspring and increasing their survival. These two routes have accelerated the fine-tuning of these transposable elements for use in gene regulation. This implies that regulatory sequences derived from transposable elements evolve in a way that is fundamentally different from those that arise by other means, as the direct conversion between these insertions allows fine-tuning mutations to spread more rapidly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05899.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05899.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Drosophila miranda</kwd><kwd>transposable element</kwd><kwd>non-allelic gene conversion</kwd><kwd>regulatory network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM076007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachtrog</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM093182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachtrog</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32GM103186-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellison</surname><given-names>Christopher E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fully functional regulatory elements can arise rapidly from transposable elements via a novel route where non-allelic gene conversion can act to speed up the evolutionary fine-tuning of regulatory elements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A substantial portion of animal genomes is composed of repetitive sequences, including gene duplicates, satellite DNA, and transposable elements. Gene conversion is a major force shaping the evolution of repetitive regions, and interlocus or non-allelic gene conversion between sequence duplicates has been studied extensively for its role in concerted evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ohta, 2010</xref>). Non-allelic gene conversion also affects selection operating in gene families. Compared to single-copy genes, a family of gene duplicates presents a larger mutational target, and a mutation arising in any gene copy can be spread among copies by non-allelic gene conversion, thereby increasing the efficiency of both positive and purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mano and Innan, 2008</xref>). Non-allelic gene conversion homogenizes the arrays of ribosomal DNA gene copies present in the genomes of most organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eickbush and Eickbush, 2007</xref>), has generated allelic diversity within the human leukocyte antigen gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zangenberg et al., 1995</xref>), and has allowed palindromic genes on the human Y chromosome to escape degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rozen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Transposable elements give rise to families of duplicate sequences. A propensity for some TEs to carry regulatory motifs and to insert adjacent to coding sequence gives them the potential for being potent modulators of gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feschotte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowley and Oakey, 2013</xref>). The regulatory elements provided by these TEs, however, may be suboptimal in function, and subject to subsequent fine-tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Polavarapu et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike regulatory elements where short binding motifs (10 basepairs on average for transcription factors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>) evolve de novo via point mutation or microsatellite expansion, binding sites that evolve from TEs are initially almost identical in sequence and are nested within a larger repeat unit (hundreds or thousands of basepairs in size), and may thus be subject to non-allelic gene conversion. Re-wiring of the dosage compensation network in <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic> was driven by TE-mediated amplification of a functional but suboptimal binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>). Here we show that non-allelic gene conversion is catalyzing the rapid fine-tuning of these suboptimal motifs by allowing sequence variants that optimize binding affinity to spread among elements.</p><p>Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by a male-specific ribonucleoprotein complex (the male-specific lethal or MSL complex) that binds to a GA-rich sequence motif (the MSL recognition motif) at a number of chromatin entry sites on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseyenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Straub et al., 2008</xref>). We previously studied the acquisition of novel chromatin entry sites on newly formed X chromosomes in <italic>D. miranda</italic>, a species where two independent sex chromosome/autosome fusions resulted in a karyotype composed of three X chromosome arms, each of a different age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alekseyenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). XL is homologous to the X chromosome of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and has been a sex chromosome for at least 60 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Richards et al., 2005</xref>); chromosome XR formed roughly 15 million years ago when an autosome (Muller element D) fused to XL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho and Clark, 2005</xref>), and the neo-X/neo-Y chromosome pair originated around 1.5 million years ago when the Y fused to another autosome (Muller element C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachtrog and Charlesworth, 2002</xref>). Dosage compensation evolved on both XR and the neo-X shortly after their emergence, through acquisition of novel chromatin entry sites and co-option of the MSL regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bone and Kuroda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marin et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, we discovered that the acquisition of dosage compensation on both XR and the neo-X chromosome was in part mediated by the independent domestication of helitron transposable elements that contained MSL recognition motifs, which we have termed ISXR and ISX, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>).</p><p>ISX is highly enriched on the neo-X chromosome of <italic>D. miranda</italic> and is derived from the abundant ISY element. Compared to ISY, ISX contains a 10 basepair deletion that creates a MSL recognition motif, thereby allowing it to act as a chromatin entry site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>). Our previous study showed that while amplification of ISX about 1 million years ago provided dozens of functional chromatin entry sites on the neo-X chromosome of <italic>D. miranda</italic>, the motif dispersed by ISX is distinct from the canonical motif that is enriched within chromatin entry sites on XL and XR, and shows significantly lower affinity to the MSL complex compared to motifs on XL and XR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>). For these reasons, we postulated that the ISX binding motif is suboptimal, and predicted that refining mutations should accumulate within each MSL recognition motif until the neo-X chromosome becomes fully dosage compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Variation at MSL recognition motifs among ISX insertions in <italic>D. miranda</italic> strain MSH22</title><p>To identify potential refining mutations that optimize MSL-binding at chromatin entry sites derived from the ISX element, we characterized sequence variation within the MSL recognition motifs and flanking sequence regions for all 77 insertions of the ISX element on the neo-X chromosome in the sequenced reference strain MSH22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The multiple sequence alignment of these 77 sequence regions (arranged from top-to-bottom in the order in which they are found on the chromosome) shows that there is sequence variation among elements both within and adjacent to the 21 basepair MRE motif. Each variant has been classified as ancestral or derived based on its frequency in the ISX progenitor element, ISY. The derived allele frequency for each variant in this region is shown for ISX as well as 139 ISY elements from the neo-X chromosome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for ISY alignment).

Rather, five additional allelic combinations are present at low frequencies in this location among ISY, but not ISX elements.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05899.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05899.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05899-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05899.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Alignment of ISY elements from the <italic>D. miranda</italic> MSH22 genome assembly.</title><p>139 ISY elements from the MSH22 neo-X chromosome were identified and 200 basepairs from their 5′ flanks were aligned.

The haplotype consists of two mutations (G → T and A → T), separated by two basepairs, which are in perfect linkage disequilibrium among ISX but not ISY elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We used this same system to dissect the relationship between the TT alleles and MSL complex binding affinity. Starting with a cloned ISX element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>), we used site-directed mutagenesis to create variants of this element that differ only with respect to the TT haplotype. Each of the four possible haplotypes (GA, GT, TA, and TT) was engineered and inserted onto <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> chromosome 2L at cytosite 38F1 using recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2006</xref>).

These results suggest that there is sign epistasis between the two alleles and that the high frequency TT haplotype represents a refining/fine-tuning adaptation, since recruitment of MSL complex to the adjacent MSL recognition motif is increased.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Non-allelic gene conversion is spreading the TT haplotype among ISX insertions</title><p>It is unlikely that the TT haplotype arose multiple times by parallel mutation, and there are two possibilities that could explain its prevalence among MSH22 ISX insertions. First, this double mutation may have occurred early during the process of ISX amplification, thus giving rise to two lineages of ISX: one that carries the ancestral GA haplotype, and the other with the TT haplotype. The TT-harboring elements in MSH22 would then all be descendants from the latter ISX lineage. Alternatively, this mutation may have occurred only after the GA-containing ISX element was fixed in the population at all 77 neo-X insertion sites, at which point it was spread among independent ISX elements via non-allelic gene conversion.</p><p>We can distinguish between these possibilities by examining patterns of sequence polymorphism for each ISX insertion across multiple strains of <italic>D. miranda</italic>. A canonical signature of non-allelic gene conversion is the presence of shared polymorphisms across sequence duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arguello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mansai and Innan, 2010</xref>). If gene conversion is spreading the TT haplotype among ISX insertions, we expect it to be polymorphic among individuals at several ISX insertion sites, whereas we do not expect the TT haplotype to be polymorphic at individual ISX insertions under the alternative scenario.</p><p>To genotype multiple wild-derived individuals at each of the MSH22 ISX insertions, we used paired-end Illumina genomic resequencing data from 23 inbred lines of <italic>D. miranda</italic>, including MSH22. We aligned all reads to the MSH22 reference genome and identified mate-pairs where one mate was anchored in unique sequence flanking an ISX insertion. We then assembled these reads to generate a contig spanning the 5′ flank of the ISX element insertion, which contains the MSL recognition motif, for each inbred line. Using this approach we generated population data for 66 insertions out of the 77 total ISX insertions present in the MSH22 reference genome assembly. Uneven sequence coverage between insertions and individuals meant that not all insertions could be assembled for each individual. However, the majority of individuals are represented in the majority of datasets: each insertion dataset contained ∼20 lines on average (see Dataset S1 in Dryad: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2015</xref>). Almost all ISX insertions are fixed among strains (65 of 66) and insertion sites are identical between lines, suggesting that independent parallel insertions are unlikely to be present within our dataset. We performed PCR and Sanger sequencing on a subset of these regions and estimate the base-calling error rate of our Illumina contigs to be ∼0.1%.</p><p>Consistent with non-allelic gene conversion spreading the TT haplotype, we observe a strong signal of allele-sharing within the sequence region flanking the MSL recognition motif among ISX insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). On average, 68.9% of polymorphisms observed within a given insertion are shared among other insertions (though most polymorphisms are shared only between a few elements). The TT haplotype is especially striking in this regard as it is polymorphic in 41% of insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). If population subdivision contributes to this excess of allele sharing, we would expect individuals to cluster by allele state at the TT locus, across all polymorphic ISX insertions. Instead, we find that different individuals contribute to the TT polymorphism at each of these ISX insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that abundant non-allelic gene conversion is the most likely explanation for this observation. Interestingly, the population frequency of the TT haplotype is similar among insertions that are near each other on the chromosome (permutation test p = 0.018; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is consistent with higher gene conversion rates between more closely linked ISX elements generating correlated population frequencies among adjacent elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05899.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ISX variation among wild lines of <italic>D. miranda.</italic></title><p>For each ISX insertion identified within the <italic>D. miranda</italic> MSH22 reference genome assembly (alignment shown at left, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we characterized sequence variation across <italic>D. miranda</italic> individuals.

Their high transposition rate and ability to supply ready-to use regulatory elements across the genome implies that they may rapidly wire new genes into regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feschotte, 2008</xref>). We recently showed that domesticated TEs contribute to rewiring of the dosage compensation network in <italic>D. miranda</italic>, but appear to supply only suboptimal binding sites for the MSL complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellison and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>). Here, we identify a derived haplotype with two mutations that interact epistatically to increase binding affinity for the MSL complex. We show that these fine-tuning mutations spread among independent ISX insertions by non-allelic gene conversion, and through the population by natural selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Relative to regulatory elements that evolve in isolation, a family of regulatory motifs dispersed by TEs presents a larger mutational target, and a mutation arising in any element contained within a larger repeat unit (the TE) can spread among copies by non-allelic gene conversion. Consequently, the rate of evolutionary fine-tuning at such regulatory elements can be greatly accelerated by increasing their effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mano and Innan, 2008</xref>). Thus, transposable elements can ‘crowd-source’ beneficial mutations to rapidly fine-tune regulatory networks.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05899.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Non-allelic gene conversion spreads refining mutations among TE-derived MSL recognition motifs.</title><p>Shared polymorphism of the TT haplotype among ISX insertions suggests a model where a mutation that refines regulatory activity arose once at a single TE-derived regulatory element, and spread across elements via non-allelic gene conversion. Over evolutionary time, such a mutation spreads in two dimensions: horizontally among TE-derived regulatory elements and vertically through the population, until it is fixed across elements and across individuals. The TT haplotype is at the midpoint of this process. Across ISX insertions, it is fixed, absent, and polymorphic, in approximately equal proportions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05899.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05899.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05899-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Our transgenic experiments show that each individual T allele actually decreases the binding affinity for the MSL complex relative to the ancestral GA haplotype. Thus, TA or GT haplotypes should be selected against in the population if present on a functional ISX element. Consistent with the deleterious effect of individual T alleles, the TA and GT haplotypes are present on some ISY elements but completely absent from ISX, that is, we find the two T mutations to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium among ISX elements but not ISY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While most ISY elements carry the ancestral GA haplotype, a small fraction (0.7% of neo-X ISY insertions) instead carry the derived TT haplotype. It is therefore possible that the TT haplotype was introduced onto the ISX background by non-allelic gene conversion from ISY. Under this scenario, the large family of ISY elements in the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome could be acting as a reservoir of natural variation, where complex mutations can accumulate in the absence of epistasis. Non-allelic gene conversion could then transfer these haplotypes to related repetitive elements (such as ISX). While many of these haplotypes are likely to be neutral or deleterious, some may be beneficial, as in the case of the TT haplotype. Such a scenario avoids the waiting time for a double mutation, as well as the fitness valley that would have to be traversed if the two mutations were to occur sequentially on the ISX background.</p><p>To conclude, our findings suggest that TE-dispersed binding motifs follow an evolutionary trajectory that is fundamentally different from those that arise by other means. The complementary roles of TEs in dispersing regulatory motifs, and gene conversion in spreading subsequent refining mutations, combine to allow for the rapid rewiring and fine-tuning of gene regulatory networks. This process adds a new layer of complexity onto how TEs influence regulatory innovation, as well as a new context in which gene conversion affects genome evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resequencing of <italic>D. miranda</italic> wild lines</title><p>Isofemale lines were established from individuals collected in Northern California and inbred for several generations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Chris Ponting (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One reviewer, Hideki Innan, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There was general agreement that this is an exciting paper, and a substantial contribution to how our understanding of how regulatory evolution might occur. We also thought you could relatively easily do more to strengthen the case for selection having acted to increase the frequency of the TT haplotype. Simple tests based on the extent of haplotype sharing, the allele frequency distribution, etc., appear not to have been carried out. There is an obvious a priori hypothesis to test here, and multiple loci to test it with.</p><p>There was also general agreement that your title, albeit catchy, is not professional enough.

According to the description in the beginning of the subsection “MRE variation among ISX insertions in <italic>D. miranda</italic> strain MSH22”, it seems that the TT haplotype already existed in the ISY family, and so did the GT and TA haplotypes?

Consistent with models of directional selection, the frequency spectrum of TT-carrying haplotypes shows an excess of high frequency derived alleles, compared to the GA-carrying ISX elements, and nucleotide diversity is reduced at ISX elements where the TT haplotype is fixed, relative to GA-containing insertion sites. The results of the three statistical tests of selection are now presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We have also modified our title as suggested.</p><p>Reviewer #2 minor comments:</p><p><italic>1) It is a bit unclear on the origin of the TT holpotype.

We cannot distinguish between these possibilities, but add some discussion on its origin in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) I found an interesting (but not very emphasized) observation that the two sites are in strong LD in ISX, but not in ISY.

Non-allelic gene conversion can certainly reduce variation among insertions. However, while non-allelic gene conversion may decrease variation within the TT haplotype, it should equally decrease variation within the GA haplotype (assuming that they are subject to similar levels of gene conversion). The test of selection we employed shows that given its frequency, the TT haplotype harbors significantly less variation than the GA haplotype (a test that is similar in spirit to the haplotype test of selection introduced by Hudson et al, Genetics 1994). We now also show that the frequency spectrum of TT-carrying haplotypes shows an excess of high frequency derived alleles, compared to the GA-carrying ISX elements (Figure 4–figure supplement 3), which further strengthens the case that selection is operating on the TT haplotype.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: The top-to-bottom orientation of the sequence in this figure to me is kind of counter intuitive, and is different from the more usual left-to-right orientation in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>.
