acquisition. Hilar-perforant-path-associated interneurons (HIPP cells) have been considered to be synonymous for DG-SOMIs. Deviating from this assumption, we show two functionally contrasting DG-SOMI-types. The classical feedback-inhibitory HIPPs distribute axon fibers in the molecular layer. They are engaged by converging GC-inputs and provide dendritic inhibition to the DG circuitry. In contrast, SOMIs with axon in the hilus, termed hilar interneurons (HILs), provide perisomatic inhibition onto GABAergic cells in the DG and project to the medial septum. Repetitive activation of glutamatergic inputs onto HIPP cells induces long-lasting-depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission but long-term-potentiation (LTP) of synaptic signals in HIL cells. Thus, LTD in HIPPs may assist flow of spatial information from the entorhinal cortex to the DG, whereas LTP in HILs may facilitate the temporal coordination of GCs with activity patterns governed by the medial septum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21105.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21105.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>somatostatin</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>medial septum</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR2143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartos</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lichtenberg Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartos</surname><given-names>Marlene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Somatostatin-expressing interneurons of the rodent dentate gyrus fall into at least two functionally distinct interneuron types with different synaptic integrations into the local dentate gyrus and the more distant medial septum neuronal network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DG is situated between the entorhinal cortex and the CA3 area of the hippocampus, forming the first stage of the classical trisynaptic circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersen et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eichenbaum, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lisman, 1999</xref>). Together with the hippocampus, it plays an indispensable role in the formation of new memories and memory associations in various species including humans, nonhuman primates and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bakker et al., 2008</xref>). It receives a rich multimodal input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path which carries information on various modalities of external cues and translates the rich input stream into sparse segregated (‘orthogonalized’) representations, a process called pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Treves and Rolls, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>). By separating the rich input stream into non-overlapping memories, the DG allows a high resolution of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marr, 1971</xref>). Consistent with this theory, GC activity is sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>) and governed by strong GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nitz and McNaughton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pernía-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Which interneuron types may contribute to the sparse activity in the DG circuitry? Synaptic inhibition is provided by two main interneuron types in the hippocampus, parvalbumin-expressing perisoma-inhibiting fast-spiking interneurons (PVIs) and somatostatin-expressing dendrite-inhibiting cells (SOMIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). Their functional role in the DG markedly depends on their morphological properties and the location of their output synapses. PVIs receive convergent excitatory inputs from the perforant path at their apical dendrites and from local GCs via their mossy fiber synapses at their basal dendrites and provide powerful feedforward and feedback inhibition to large populations of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sambandan et al., 2010</xref>). Rapid and powerful synaptic inhibition plays an important role in the timing of GC discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jonas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sambandan et al., 2010</xref>). Precise spike timing has been proposed to be of particular importance for the encoding of information as well as the generation of fast synchronous network oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cobb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>). Much less information is available on the functional integration and computational role of DG-SOMIs. HIPP cells have so far been considered to be synonymous for DG-SOMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mott et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, immunohistochemical investigations showed that SOM-positive axon fibers predominantly project in the outer half of the molecular layer, co-aligned with the perforant path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halasy and Somogyi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mott et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Savanthrapadian et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, electron microscopical studies revealed SOM-expressing terminals at apical dendrites of GCs and very likely interneurons in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leranth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Peng et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, HIPP cells are in the optimal position to control information flow from the entorhinal cortex via the DG to the CA3 area by potentially influencing dendritic computation and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Miles et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maccaferri, 2005</xref>). PVIs and SOMIs are therefore ideally suited to control information processing in neuronal networks in a complementary manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Méndez and Bacci, 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, very little is known on how SOMIs are functionally integrated in the DG neuronal network. Moreover, how can the apparent paradox of HIPP morphology and dense hilar SOM-expressing axon projections be reconciled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leranth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Peng et al., 2013</xref>)? Here, we addressed these fundamental questions by applying single and paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of SOMIs in acute slice preparations of the rodent DG in combination with intracellular labeling and their optogenetic recruitment. We first provide evidence that DG-SOMIs fall in at least two contrasting types with distinct morphological and functional properties. We show that HIPP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halasy and Somogyi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mott et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>) are classical feedback inhibitory interneurons providing weak and slow dendritic-inhibition onto GCs and local interneurons. We identified a new DG-SOMI type, hilus-associated interneurons (HILs), with axon collaterals in the hilus. They exert strong perisomatic inhibition onto local GABAergic inhibitory cells. Moreover, HIL but not HIPP cells form long-range connections to the medial septum. The functional integration of DG-SOMIs into local and long-distance neuronal networks places these cells in an ideal position to regulate sparse coding of spatial information forwarded by the entorhinal cortex to the DG, and to synchronize this circuit computation with theta activity patterns driven by the medial septum. Such coordination would be of particular importance during navigation when spatial information processing must be temporally coordinated with running velocity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Layer-specific axon distributions define two contrasting DG-SOMI types</title><p>To examine the morphological and physiological characteristics of DG-SOMIs, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of single GFP-expressing cells in acute hippocampal slice preparations of SOM-GFP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oliva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Light-microscopy of 39 examined cells revealed that cell bodies and the majority of the dendrites of DG-SOMIs were located in the hilus. However, the largest proportion of labelled cells had axon fibers either dispersed in the molecular layer (8 out of 39 cells) or in the hilus (24 out of 39 cells). The remaining SOMIs (7 out of 39) were morphologically variable and showed neither preference for axon distributions in the hilus nor in the outer molecular layer ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and were therefore not further examined in this study. Detailed morphological reconstructions of a subset of labeled cells confirmed our initial observation. One group of DG-SOMIs had HIPP morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halasy and Somogyi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Savanthrapadian et al., 2014</xref>) with axon fibers distributed in the molecular layer with highest proportion in the outer molecular layer (74.7 ± 2.1%; six reconstructed cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some axon fibres projected in the hilus (1.7 ± 1.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>) consistent with our recent observation that HIPPs are interconnected by perisomatic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Savanthrapadian et al., 2014</xref>). In marked contrast, the second group of recorded SOMIs projected almost exclusively in the hilus (91.0 ± 1.7% of the total axonal length; six reconstructed cells) and were therefore termed hilus-associated interneurons (HILs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both cell types largely avoided the granule cell layer (HIPP 3.9 ± 0.6%, HIL 2.1 ± 0.8% of the total axonal length; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Despite the marked layer-specific axonal dispersion, the total dendritic and axonal length in the DG was similar among both types (dendrite: HIPP 2500.4 ± 333.0 µm, HIL 2547.3 ± 427.8 µm, p=0.935, <italic>t-</italic>test; axon: HIPP 26.8 ± 4.0 mm, HIL 20.7 ± 2.5 mm, p=0.205, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Antibody labelling revealed that the majority of identified HIPP and HIL cells in this study fulfilled the criterion of SOM-expression (33 out of 35 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, inset). Finally, both neuron types were morphologically and physiologically identified in SOM-tdT mice (SOM-Cre x Ai9-RCL-tdT; Materials and methods) confirming their strain-independent occurrence (seven light-microscopically identified HIPP and 7 HIL cells). Thus, the DG contains at least two morphologically contrasting SOMI types, HIPP cells with axon fibers dispersing predominantly in the outer molecular layer and HIL cells, with axon largely located in the hilus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DG-SOMI types have different intrinsic membrane properties</title><p>Next, we examined the passive and active membrane properties of the two DG-SOMI types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–J</xref>; see Materials and methods). Consistent with their comparable dendritic and axonal length in the DG, we observed no difference in the membrane capacitance (HIPP 47.8 ± 6.3 pF, 7 cells; HIL 50.5 ± 2.4 pF, 22 cells; p=0.63). The membrane resting potential was also similar (HIPP −54.2 ± 1.0 mV, 14 cells; HIL −57.1 ± 1.1 mV, 22 cells; p=0.079, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, HIPPs had a ~ 1.5 times slower membrane time constant (τ<sub>m</sub>) and a ~1.7 times higher input resistance than HILs (τ<sub>m</sub>: HIPP 14.3 ± 1.4 ms, HIL 9.3 ± 0.6 ms; p&lt;0.001; input resistance: HIPP 317.9 ± 34.0 MΩ, 8 cells; HIL 186.7 ± 12.1 MΩ, 24 cells; p&lt;0.001; <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Moreover, the half-duration of single action potentials was longer for HIPP than for HIL cells (0.86 ± 0.08 ms <italic>vs</italic> 0.62 ± 0.03 ms; p&lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The narrower spike width in HILs was correlated with a larger slope in the decay of single action potentials (HIPP 122.0 ± 10.9 mV ms<sup>−1</sup>, HIL 183.3 ± 9.8 mV ms<sup>−1</sup>; p=0.003, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, left) suggesting a different expression profile of voltage-gated channels in the two SOMI types. Furthermore, disparities were observed in activity patterns evoked by long-lasting positive current injections with step-wise increasing amplitudes. The maximal discharge frequency was lower for HIPP than for HIL cells (111.4 ± 10.2 Hz <italic>vs</italic> 141.5 ± 5.7 Hz; p=0.015, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, right). Moreover, the ratio between the last and the first inter-spike-intervals at maximal discharge frequency was higher for HIPPs (2.1 ± 0.09) indicating a stronger adaptation of spike trains than for HIL cells (1.6 ± 0.12; p=0.004, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). Thus, DG-SOMIs show differences in their membrane characteristics favoring slow signaling in HIPP and rapid signaling in HIL cells.</p><p>To further test whether DG-SOMIs can be classified into independent types, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis on the basis of morphological variables obtained from the fully reconstructed interneurons and their passive and active membrane characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>; depicted as triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–J</xref>; Materials and methods). We found that interneurons fell into two classes separated by an Euclidian linkage distance of 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The first cluster was formed by slow signaling HIPP cells with axon collaterals largely located in the outer molecular layer, whereas the second cluster was formed by fast-spiking HIL cells with axon collaterals largely constrained to the hilus. Thus, the combination of morphological and physiological parameters allows the classification of DG-SOMIs into two distinct types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HIL but not HIPP cells form long-range connections to the medial septum</title><p>Previous tracing studies proposed that DG-SOMIs project to the medial septum (DG-septal cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jinno and Kosaka, 2002</xref>).

Labeled axons in the MSvDB showed some variability in their appearance. They were either thick with few varicosities or thin with several boutons of different morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, inset). To identify the nature of DG-septal projecting SOMIs, we retrogradely labeled them by injecting a red fluorescent retrograde tracer (RedRetroBead) into the MSvDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After 3–8 days, we identified numerous red labeled cell bodies located in the hilus as well as in the stratum oriens and radiatum of CA1 and CA3 (26.5 ± 2.4% of SOM-expressing cells were labeled with RedRetroBead, 106 SOM cells; seven slices, two mice), confirming previous data on hippocampal-septal projecting SOMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jinno and Kosaka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gulyás et al., 2003</xref>).

As previously demonstrated, associative activation of mossy fibers and their target PVIs in the DG leads to a long-lasting increase in the efficacy of glutamatergic transmission and enhanced recruitment of DG-PVIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sambandan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hainmüller et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore asked whether glutamatergic inputs onto DG-SOMIs may also undergo plastic changes upon repetitive associative activation. Due to the hilar location, DG-SOMIs may be targeted by synaptic inputs from GCs (mossy fibers) and mossy cells. We therefore first examined the putative nature of input synapses by positioning an extracellular stimulation pipette at the granule cell layer to hilus border area and recorded the evoked EPSCs in the two DG-SOMI types in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker SR95531 (10 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To distinguish mossy fiber and mossy cell inputs, we bath-applied the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist DCG-IV, which selectively blocks synaptic transmission at mossy fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sambandan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hainmüller et al., 2014</xref>). EPSCs recorded in HIPPs could be substantially reduced by DCG-IV (by 51.7 ± 3.9%, 10 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), indicating their mossy fiber-mediated nature. EPSCs recorded in HIL cells were also diminished by DCG-IV, but to a much lesser mean extent (by 32.6 ± 9.4%, 16 cells; p=0.087, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). More importantly, the magnitude of the DCG-IV effect was highly variable in HIL neurons (range −2.4–96.0%), more variable than in HIPP cells (range 34.1–78.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, a substantial proportion of HIL cells showed no or only mild DCG-IV effects (by &lt;20%; 10 out of 16 cells). Thus, our data indicate that both SOMI types are targeted by mossy fibers and HIL cells are preferentially targeted by additional excitatory inputs of different origin, very likely mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Larimer and Strowbridge, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Differential forms of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells</title><p>Next, we applied an associative burst frequency stimulation at 30 Hz (aBFS) to induce plastic changes at glutamatergic SOMI input synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The aBFS consisted in the presynaptic excitation of glutamatergic inputs with an extracellular stimulation pipette positioned at the granule cell layer to hilus border area paired with timed postsynaptic single action potential induction (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hainmüller et al., 2014</xref>).

Both the magnitude of long-lasting depression and the potentiation of synaptic transmission were not correlated with the extent in the blocking effect of DCG-IV on synaptic transmission (Spearman Rank order Correlation, p&gt;0.05 for both comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, right). Moreover, the magnitude of synaptic plasticity was not related to changes in the input resistance of the recorded cells. Indeed, the input resistance was stable throughout the entire recording periods (LTD: baseline 326.3 ± 21.2 MΩ <italic>vs</italic> 15–20 min after LTD expression: 323.0 ± 25.5 MΩ, 7 cells; LTP: 201.5 ± 19.2 MΩ <italic>vs</italic> after LTP expression: 204.8 ± 14.6 MΩ, 9 cells; p&gt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test for both comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity were not related to the peak amplitude of EPSCs obtained during control periods (LTD: baseline EPSC 77.0 ± 19.6 pA 7 cells; LTP: baseline EPSC 74.6 ± 16.4 pA, 12 cells; Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p=0.767; Spearman’s Rank-Order correlation between the amplitude of EPSCs during baseline and 15–20 min after plasticity induction, p&gt;0.05 for both comparisons).</p><p>In summary, long-lasting changes of synaptic transmission are diverse among DG-SOMIs favoring long-lasting depression at HIPP and long-lasting potentiation at HIL cell inputs. These plastic changes seem to neither depend on the intrinsic membrane properties, the initial strength of excitatory input signals nor on the precise origin of the input synapse, but more likely on the nature of the target SOMI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Synaptic plasticity at synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells is presynaptically expressed</title><p>To determine the locus of LTD and LTP expression, we examined possible changes in the percentage of transmission failures and performed a coefficient-of-variation (CV) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Malinow and Tsien, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The probability of failures in synaptic signaling increased by ~99% after LTD (15–20 min after aBFS; from 15.5 ± 5.9% to 30.9 ± 11.3%; 5 HIPP and two non-identified SOMIs; p=0.028, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) but declined by ~74% after LTP induction (from 15.8 ± 6.3% to 7.7 ± 4.2%; 11 HIL cells; p=0.016, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), pointing to its presynaptic origin. Moreover, a plot of the CV<sup>−2</sup> of the mean EPSC amplitude in the LTD and LTP phase, both normalized to baseline values, revealed that the majority of data points were located close or above the identity line for LTP and close to the identity line for LTD (17 cells in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). These data indicate that both forms of plasticity changes are expressed at presynaptic sites.</p><p>Taken together, our data provide first evidence for target cell-specific long-lasting changes in synaptic plasticity at DG-SOMIs. LTD and a high rate of transmission failures at HIPP inputs may reduce their recruitment and therefore dendritic inhibition, whereas LTP and a low rate of transmission failures at HIL input synapses will boost their activation and support inhibitory signaling in the hilar DG and the medial septum.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>DG-SOMIs provide local dendritic and perisomatic inhibition onto target cells</title><p>The apical dendrites of GCs and fast-spiking interneurons, including PVIs, extend in the outer molecular layer, whereas DG-interneurons form also basal dendrites branching in the deep hilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>). This anatomical organization together with the layer-specific distribution of SOM axons suggests that in addition to dendritic inhibition, DG-SOMIs may also provide perisomatic inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we injected Cre-inducible rAAV vectors encoding ChR2-tdT into the ventral DG of SOM-Cre mice and recorded light-induced IPSCs in postsynaptic GCs and interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). 1-Photon laser pulses (0.5 ms, 473 nm) were applied either to the outer molecular layer or close to the soma of the recorded cell to evoke distal vs perisomatic inhibitory signals, respectively (IPSC<sub>oml</sub>; IPSC<sub>psoma</sub>; in total: 12 GCs, four fast-spiking and two regular-spiking interneurons; three simultaneous recordings of an interneuron and a GC in the same slice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). IPSCs recorded in GCs had always a small peak amplitude and slow rise time independent on the light-pulse location (amplitude IPSC<sub>oml</sub>9.6 ± 1.2 pA vs IPSC<sub>psoma</sub>8.7 ± 1.6 pA, p=0.4327; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; rise time IPSC<sub>oml</sub>1.8 ± 0.2 ms vs IPSC<sub>psoma</sub>2.5 ± 0.6 ms; p=0.2094, two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) suggesting their distal dendritic origin. On the contrary, distally induced IPSCs in interneurons, were 6.9-fold smaller than the ones induced close to the soma (IPSC<sub>oml</sub>23.0 ± 6.4 pA vs IPSC<sub>psoma</sub>159.6 ± 72.5 pA, p=0.028, paired Wilcoxon Rank Sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) and had a significantly slower rise time (IPSC<sub>oml</sub>1.8 ± 0.6 ms vs IPSC<sub>psoma</sub>0.7 ± 0.2 ms; p=0.046, paired Wilcoxon Rank Sum test), suggesting that in addition to dendritic inhibition, interneurons receive powerful perisomatic SOMI-mediated synaptic inhibition. Indeed, high-resolution confocal images revealed SOM<sup>+</sup> boutons at the soma of PVIs (13 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, inset). Consistent with the proposed synapse location, somatically evoked IPSCs in interneurons had a 3.4-fold faster rise time and an 18.3-fold larger amplitude than the ones evoked in GCs (p=0.0037 and p=0.00074, respectively, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is further reflected in a ~sixfold higher amplitude ratio between IPSC<sub>psoma</sub> and IPSC<sub>oml</sub> in interneurons than in GCs (5.8 ± 1.3 <italic>vs</italic> 1.0 ± 0.2; p=0.000078, <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Their functional embedding into the DG circuitry allows both SOMI types to contribute to the processing of spatial information transmitted by the entorhinal cortex in a highly cell-type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

HIL cells form a functional link to the medial septum and could thereby be involved in the coordination of local processing of spatial and contextual information provided by the perforant path with theta oscillations driven by the medial septum. This proposal fits to single-cell recordings of hippocampal-septal projecting GABAergic cells which generate action potentials phase locked to theta cycles recorded in the hippocampus and the medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Losonczy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jinno, 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21105.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the dentate gyrus neuronal network with some of the main cellular components.</title><p>Schematic illustration of the synaptic integration of DG-SOMIs in the local dentate gyrus (DG) and the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MSvDB) circuitry. The perforant path (PP) transmits information from the entorhinal cortex to the DG by targeting distal dendrites of granule cells (GCs) and GABAergic cells including PVIs (orange). DG-SOMIs consist of at least two contrasting types. HIPP (blue) and HIL (red) cells are recruited by GC inputs via mossy fiber (MF) synapses (black lines with bars) and glutamatergic inputs from mossy cells (MCs) which show target preference for HIL cells (grey lines with bars). Repetitive associative activation of glutamatergic inputs induces long-lasting depression of synaptic transmission onto HIPP cells but long-lasting potentiation onto HIL neurons. HIPPs provide weak and slow dendritic inhibition onto local GCs and interneurons, including PVIs. HILs provide perisomatic inhibition onto local DG-interneurons including PVIs and additionally form extra-DG long-range projections to the medial septum to strongly inhibit cluster-firing putative glutamatergic cells and to mildly inhibit fast-spiking PVIs and slow-discharging cholinergic cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21105.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21105.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21105-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Functional interaction of the DG with other brain areas via SOMI projections</title><p>The DG, similar to other cortical regions, shows a distinct laminar structure with layer-specific distribution of afferent pathways and local axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ramón, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaral and Witter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Förster et al., 2006</xref>). The main extra-hippocampal afferent projection to the hippocampus, the perforant path, originates in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex and terminates on the distal apical dendrites of GCs and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ramón, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaral and Witter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Witter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This pathway provides a rich multimodal stream to the DG, including processed sensory information from neocortical areas.

Local GC axons project to the hilus of the DG and to the CA3 and target with their mossy fiber synapses the dendrites of CA3 principal cells. Long-range inhibitory projections also follow these pathways to interconnect the DG with other cortical areas. First, GABAergic long-distance bi-directional inhibitory routes have been morphologically identified between the entorhinal cortex and the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jinno, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caputi et al., 2013</xref>). Second, retrograde tracing in combination with immunohistochemistry revealed that hilar SOMIs project to the contralateral DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leranth et al., 1990</xref>). Third, in vitro intracellular labeling of DG interneurons with cell bodies in the molecular layer showed that axons of these cells target the subiculum by crossing the hippocampal fissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ceranik et al., 1997</xref>).

They are largely formed by SOMIs located in the stratum oriens of CA1 and CA3 and stratum lucidum of CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso and Köhler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tóth and Freund, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jinno and Kosaka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gulyás et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferraguti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takács et al., 2008</xref>).

Hippocampal-septal cells have been shown to form the highest number of morphologically identified terminals onto GABAergic and the lowest on cholinergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tóth et al., 1993</xref>). These observations are in apparent contrast to our electrophysiological data showing that DG-septal cells evoke strong inhibitory signals in putative glutamatergic neurons and weak signals in GABAergic and cholinergic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These differences may be explained by disparities in the convergence of brain-area-specific SOM<sup>+</sup> fibers projecting to the medial septum or different release probabilities of their output synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional relevance of DG-SOMIs in local information processing</title><p>The present results provide an anatomical and physiological solution to the question of how theta oscillations in the DG could be coordinated with the medial septum. In the classical view, cholinergic inputs from the medial septum are critical for the emergence of theta oscillations in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stewart and Fox, 1990</xref>) and the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pabst et al., 2016</xref>). However, a further key component is the rhythmically active septal inhibitory drive as revealed by simultaneous local field potential recordings in CA1 and the medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hangya et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, selective deletion of septal GABAergic cells resulted in a marked reduction of hippocampal theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoder and Pang, 2005</xref>) and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). These GABAergic cells contact exclusively interneurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gulyás et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borhegyi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hangya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hassani et al., 2009</xref>). The major GABAergic route from the medial septum to the hippocampus is mediated by PVIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Köhler et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tóth et al., 1993</xref>). They have been shown to target almost exclusively GABAergic cells in CA1 and CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leranth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). Most of these targets have been demonstrated to be the source of back-projections to the medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tóth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takács et al., 2008</xref>) thereby forming a bi-directional hippocampal-septal interneuron loop. We propose that a bi-directional interneuron loop may also exist between the DG and the medial septum. Indeed, virtually all DG-septal cells are SOMIs and contact all main neuron types in the MSvDB (PVIs, ChATs, putative glutamatergic cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Our unpublished observations suggest that septal PVIs in turn target somata and proximal dendrites of DG-PVIs and –SOMIs (data not shown). In addition to the DG-septal loop proposed here, long-distance interneuron-interneuron interactions have been demonstrated between cortical and subcortical areas in mammals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guitart-Masip et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting that GABAergic loops may be a common principle contributing to the dynamic coupling of brain areas for conjoint processing of information and control of behavior.</p><p>A further important theta-modulated excitatory drive is provided to the DG from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>). Embedded in the DG, local interneurons receive excitatory inputs from the perforant path depending on their dendritic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartos et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the majority of DG-SOMIs are not directly recruited by the perforant path but indirectly by GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). During repetitive activation of the perforant path at theta frequencies, long-lasting plasticity at mossy fiber synapses may add a new level of functional integration of interneurons in the DG circuitry. De-potentiation of mossy fiber inputs onto HIPP cells emerges postsynaptic to GCs which have been repeatedly activated by the perforant path and thus have been themselves subject to potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004</xref>). As a consequence of long-lasting depression of synaptic transmission at mossy fiber terminals, HIPP cells will be less recruited, reduce their dendritic inhibition onto strongly activated GCs and thereby support long-lasting strengthening of perforant path-mediated synaptic signals onto GC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Miles et al., 1996</xref>). On the contrary, the same strongly recruited GC population will strengthen their synaptic inputs onto PVIs. This will enhance their recruitment and thereby will boost perisomatic inhibition onto GC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sambandan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hainmüller et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence, functional associations of few sparsely active GCs and interneurons will emerge. The proposed reduced recruitment of HIPPs might support the flow of information from the entorhinal cortex to the DG, whereas enhanced activation of PVIs will improve the signal-to-noise ratio during cell assembly formation, promote segregation of information and thereby enhance the storage capacity of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strüber et al., 2015</xref>). Potentiation of mossy fiber inputs of the same strongly active GC population and mossy cells onto HIL neurons will boost their recruitment and thereby support the temporal coordination of activity patterns from local cell assemblies with the ones generated in the septum. Consistent with this theory, optogenetic silencing of DG-SOMIs resulted in the loss of GC engrams and spatial context recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stefanelli et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the functional diversity of SOMIs adds a new dimension to the complex functionality of DG neuronal networks. Dendritic-inhibition provided by HIPP cells will control the flow of spatial information from the entorhinal cortex to the DG, whereas perisomatic inhibition mediated by HIL cells will support the temporal coordination of local rhythmic DG activity with the activity patterns governed by the medial septum. Such coordination could be of particular importance during navigation when spatial information processing is temporally coordinated with running speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuhrmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Transverse hippocampal slices (300 µm) were cut with a VT 1200 s vibratome (Leica, Germany) from 18- to 35-days-old transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in SOM-expressing inhibitory interneurons (GIN mice; mice homozygous for the TgN(GadGFP)45704Swn transgene express Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein [EGFP] under the control of the mouse <italic>Gad1</italic> [GAD67] gene promoter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oliva et al., 2000</xref>) or SOM-Cre mice (SOM-IRES-Cre; Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the endogenous <italic>Sst</italic> promoter; Jackson Laboratories, Stock no. 003718) crossed with Ai9-RCL-tdT reporter mice hemizygous for Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato-WPRE (SOM-tdT; Jackson Laboratories, Stock no. 007909).

To compare three data sets for significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on Ranks was performed and in case that the normality test failed we used a Dunn’s one-way analysis on variance. Significance levels are indicated as <italic>p</italic> values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry and morphology</title><p>Biocytin-filled cells slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After washing in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1 M) and then phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, 0.025 M; ph = 7.3) containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS), slices were incubated with primary antibodies against SOM (monoclonal rabbit, 1:500, Peninsula Laboratories, San Francisco, USA) in PBS containing 5% goat-serum and 0.3% triton X-100 for 24 hr at room temperature. For visualization of SOM a secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, UK) was applied. The secondary antibody was administered together with streptavidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500, Invitrogen, USA) in PBS and 0.1–0.3% triton X-100 for 24 hr at room temperature. Some preparations were subsequently incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1000) to stain nuclei. Slices were finally washed in PBS then 0.1 M PB and embedded in Mowiol. Stained neurons were morphologically identified and examined for double-labelling using a LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss; 10 x/20 x objective lenses; N.A. 0.5/0.8, respectively).</p><p>To quantify the identity of the target cells of DG-SOMIs in the medial septum of SOM-Cre mice, we performed in vivo immunohistochemistry 2–4 weeks after rAAV-FLEX-GFP (Penn Vector Labs, Philadelphia, USA) injection with methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sauer et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, mice (P20-60) were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (in 100% O<sub>2</sub>) by inhalation and anaesthesia was continued with intraperitoneal injection of urethane (2 g/kg in 0.1 M PBS). Animals were perfused for 1–2 min with PBS, followed by 13 min PBS containing 4% PFA. Brains were carefully dissected, stored overnight in 4% PFA (4°C) and sliced (50–100 µm) with a DTK-1000 vibratome (Dosaka). After exposure of the slices to 4% NGS and 0.2% TritonX-100 (30 min), primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 2% NGS and 0.1% TritonX-100. We used primary antibodies against SOM (1:500, rabbit, Peninsula Laboratories LLC.; 1:125, mouse, GeneTex, US), parvalbumin (PV, 1:1000, rabbit, SWANT, Switzerland) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, 1:1000, rabbit, Millipore) in combination with antibodies directed against gephyrin (1:1000, mouse, Synaptic Systems). Antibody binding was visualized with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cy3, 1:1000, rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch, UK; Alexa Fluor 647, 1:1000, mouse, Invitrogen, USA). Slices were mounted in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and images were obtained with a LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) using 5x, 20x and 63x oil immersion objectives (N.A. 0.16, 0.8 and 1.4, respectively).</p><p>Pairs of biocytin filled cells were ﬁxed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 1.25% glutaraldehyde and 15% picric acid in 0.1 M PB (12 hr, 4°C). After ﬁxation, slices were treated with hydrogen peroxide (1%, 10 min) and rinsed in PB. After incubation in 10% and 20% sucrose solution, slices were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature. Then, they were transferred to PBS containing 1% avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC; Vector Laboratories, USA) for ~12 hr. Slices were rinsed in PB and developed with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. Finally, they were rinsed several times in PB, embedded in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and identified using a Olympus Fluoview 1000 (63x oil immersion objective).</p><p>In this study, 39 SOMIs were intracellularly labelled and morphologically examined. From this group, 32 cells formed the basis of the here defined two contrasting SOMI types. The remaining 7 cells showed heterogeneous morphologies dissimilar to HIPP and HIL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>) and were excluded from this study. In a subset of 15 labeled interneurons (six HIPP and six HIL cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; one HIL cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; two other types of SOMIs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), detailed reconstructions of the dendrites and axon were performed on the basis of image stacks using Fiji-ImageJ and the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/Simple_Neurite_">http://fiji.sc/Simple_Neurite_</ext-link> Tracer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Longair et al., 2011</xref>). To define axonal distributions for each reconstructed cell, regions of interest (hilus, granule cell layer, inner and outer molecular layer) were defined manually. Reconstructed traces were transformed into a binary line-stack. Axonal and dendritic lengths for the manually defined region were quantified using L-Measure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/">http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/</ext-link>). Non-reconstructed SOMIs were visually identified by confocal-microscopy on the basis of axonal distributions. HIPP cell axons crossed the granule cell layer to arborize in the molecular layer forming a lateral stretch of axons predominantly in the outer molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, HIL cells allocated their axon to the hilus and seemed to avoid the granule cell and molecular layer. SOMIs projecting to the MSvDB and retrogradely labelled were identified based on their axonal distribution first in confocal image stacks and second after reconstruction of their axon using Fiji-ImageJ (13 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The axon was confined to the hilar region (length &gt;2 mm). In two additional SOMIs, the axon was directed to the granule cell layer and visually detected in the inner molecular layer. None of the cells projected in the outer molecular layer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cluster analysis</title><p>Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed for morphological and physiological properties of DG-SOMI cells using SPSS (V24.0; Chicago, Illinois) algorithms (Ward’s method, Euclidian distance). Cluster analysis reveals dissimilarities between cells by calculating the intercellular distance in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to one of the quantified cellular parameters. Cluster tree diagrams group cells into classes with highest similarities. The larger the distance between classes the larger the difference among them. We used the Euclidean distance as dissimilarity measure and the Ward’s minimum variance method as linkage procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dumitriu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hosp et al., 2014</xref>). Cluster analysis on morphological criteria has been performed on the basis of 12 reconstructed cells and on the basis of 6 morphological (total dendritic and axonal length, axonal length in the hilus, granule cell layer, inner and outer molecular layer) as well as six physiological properties (input resistance, C<sub>m</sub>, τ<sub>m</sub>, max. discharge frequency, half-duration of single action potentials, decay of single action potentials depicted as triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Clarity</title><p>To directly demonstrate SOM-expressing axon trajectories originating in the DG and projecting to the medial septum, we injected rAAV-FLEX-GFP into the dorsal DG of 2 SOM-Cre mice as described above. Four weeks after injection mice were perfused with PBS followed with 120 ml 4% PFA. Brains were dissected and used for Clarity following published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, brains were washed in 0.1 M PBS at 4°C for 2–3 hr and incubated in hydrogel monomer solution for 24 hr. Air was replaced with nitrogen to induce the polymerization (37°C, 3–4 hr). Excess hydrogel was carefully removed <italic>via</italic> brief PBS washes. Polymerized brains were transferred into 50 ml conical tubes containing 4% SDS and 200 mM boric acid (in 0.1 M PBS, pH 8.5) and washed at 37°C during shaking for 3–4 weeks (two solution changes over the course of a day). The tissue was kept as whole mount and washed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X in 0.1 M PBS (37°C) for 24 hr. Finally, brains were embedded in refractive index matching (RIMs) imaging media (a custom economical recipe; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) and imaged using a Femto2D 2P-microscope (Zeiss 16x objective: N.A. 0.8). Stitching of individual images was performed using Fiji-ImageJ and XuvStitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emmenlauer et al., 2009</xref>). Images were 3D-reconstructed using Imaris imaging software (Bitplane).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kerstin Semmler and Karin Winterhalter for technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As you will see, both reviewers had a number of comments, some of which will require some additional data but both reviewers were interested in the work and thought you would be able to address these issues within approximately 2 months. Even if you cannot complete every requested experiment, we think this can be a strong paper if you focus your conclusions towards their strongest data sets. A major concern was that the classification parameters are not well described and many conclusions are based on observations in small datasets. The differences in the cell types, which is pitched as the key finding of the paper, seem somewhat overstated without addressing the issues raised. The full comments of the reviewers are below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors show that somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOMs) in the dentate gyrus are comprised of two populations with distinct anatomical and functional properties. Little is known about SOMs in the DG, and they have generally been treated as a homogenous population, so a comprehensive analysis of their connectivity and function addresses an important issue. I find the main conclusion convincing but I have reservations about some of the specific analyses and conclusions.</p><p>1) Subsection “Layer-specific axon distributions define two contrasting DG-SOMI types”: Both cell types shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> appear to have substantially greater dendrite length than the average length reported in the text (~240 micron). Either this is an oversight, or the morphology of both cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not representative. It might be appropriate to include the other reconstructed cells as supplementary material if in fact there is variability in dendrite structure.</p><p>2) One of the most interesting observations is that HIP and HIL cells exhibit different long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the interpretation that MFs generate postsynaptic cell-type specific plasticity not fully convincing because the authors have not shown that all the synaptic input to HIPs and HILs are from MFs. Since mossy cells also innervate interneurons in the hilus (i.e. Larimer and Strowbridge, 2008), an alternative possibility is that there is presynaptic cell-type specificity that dictates the polarity of plasticity. EPSCs in HIP and HIL cells may have different sensitivity to DCG-IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), potentially suggesting a different degree of innervation by MFs and mossy cells. Such a difference in excitatory input would be important for understanding distinct network functions as well as the mechanism underlying plasticity.</p><p>Along the same lines, the authors suggest (in the Methods) that washout of intracellular components could explain a lack of plasticity in 5/11 HIPP cells and 5/13 HIL cells, but this explanation is not satisfying without additional evidence (is plasticity more likely to occur with high resistance pipettes or perforated patch?). An alternative explanation is that some fibers produce LTP and some LTD, such that the net effect depends on the combination of activated inputs.</p><p>3) The idea that SOMs provide both dendritic and perisomatic inhibition seems reasonable based on the axonal targeting of HIPPs and HILs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. But it doesn't make sense to compare IPSPs across cell types (interneurons and GCs) with different passive membrane properties, since the faster time constant of interneurons will assure faster IPSP kinetics regardless of dendritic filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These experiments should be done in voltage clamp.</p><p>4) One important variable that was not specified in regards to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is the timing of the experiments relative to the ChR2 injection, since expression level of ChR2 has a significant impact on the light-evoked recruitment of fibers. In the cluster-firing cell of panel D, the 2-ms light pulse appears to generate two presynaptic spikes (either in the same axon or different axons) since the IPSC has a reliable double peak but this is not seen in the other examples. This could suggest a higher level of ChR2 expression. To assure that presynaptic recruitment is the same across all cell types, the experiments must be performed during the same window of time after the viral injection (the Methods states only that experiments were performed &gt; 2 weeks post injection.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study that highlights the functional connectivity of somatostatin positive GABAergic neurons within the dentate gyrus and long-range to the medial septum. The paper emphasizes the presence of two subpopulations of DG SOM inhibitory neurons: Hilar-perforant path associated (HIPP described previously) and hilus associated interneurons (HIL) which this paper categorizes for the first time. The HIPP neurons get inputs from granule cells and target the molecular layer while the HILs target the hilus and provide somatic inhibition to PV neurons and long range inputs to the medial septum.</p><p>The study uses modern methods like optogenetics, clarity and plasticity assays. The manuscript presents important data regarding target selective connectivity and functional properties of GABAergic neurons. Inhibition in the dentate gyrus is not as well characterized as other regions of the hippocampus, and the findings of the study are novel and relevant to the field. However, the study is not as thorough as previous work from the same group. The format of the paper is predominantly characterization based. The relatively small datasets, lack of details regarding classification criteria and evidence for the functional role of HIPP and HIL, limit the scope and impact of the study without additional supporting data.</p><p>Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, refer to 32 cells where 8 are considered HIPP and 24 as HIL; however axon length and distribution data is presented from only 4 reconstructed cells in each category. Was this because the rest of the cells did not fill completely? How were partially filled neurons categorized based on morphology (20 for HIL)? Please show reconstructions of more neurons and present clearly what criteria for classification were used. Based on results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with GIN and Som-Cre-tdTom mice there should be more data for reconstruction and quantification of axon length and distribution.</p><p>There are small differences in electrophysiological properties, and as stated in the paper the HIL and HIPP were mainly categorized based on morphology. It would be helpful to perform multivariate analyses (e.g. PCA, HCA) to show differences between different classes similar to Graves et al., 2012, Fuchs et al., 2016, McGarry et al., 2010., Ascoli et al., 2008 What is the resting membrane potential of these two types of neurons?</p><p>Results from the second paragraph/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, that &quot;HILS form the major anatomical substrate for long-distance DG-spetal projections&quot; is based on the result that the 75% of labelled cells present a &quot;morphological characteristics similar to HILs&quot;. There is no detail about the morphological analysis of these cells. Furthermore, can the authors detail the electrophysiological properties (Rin, AP HD, max. AP Frequency) of these long-range projecting neurons to confirm that they look similar to what they found previously.</p><p>Were the recordings for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> performed in GIN or SOM Cre-Ai9 mice to specifically target the SOM interneurons? If not was the SOM identity verified user SOM counterstaining? The time course for measurement of LTD presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, is too short and unstable. Please provide data from longer recordings and greater N.</p><p>Please present paired pulse ratio in addition to the transmission failure rates. Also, provide a supplementary figure showing resting membrane potential, input resistance through the timecourse of the experiment. Previous studies on LTD typically exclude effects of run down using perforated patch recordings. Prior to LTD a basic characterization of basal synaptic transmission would be valuable. For example, as per figure A and B the starting baseline EPSC amplitude in the HIPP vs. HIL cells look considerably different (200 nA vs. 50 nA). Is this representative of the two groups? If not then perhaps the LTP expression is an outcome of the smaller starting amplitude for HIL. Could one plot a correlation between the starting EPSC amplitude and the degree of LTD or LTP in the groups? Again, additional data to support the classification (morphological/physiological) from the HIPP vs. HIL cells should be presented. These long-term recordings must have yielded very good cell fills for detailed reconstruction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> does not specify if example traces are from HIPP or HIL.</p><p>The argument for GC dendrite targeting nature of the HIPP cells is weak. The size of the oml stimulation evoked response in both GC and IN groups is similar for the dendritic layer photostimulation. The small amplitude could reflect the attenuation down the dendritic tree but also differences in membrane time constants of the two populations (GC vs. INs). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> it is unclear what the 3 bars in the plot represent. For comparing strength of synaptic connections in a slice with virally expressed ChR2, it is important to perform dual recordings from each cell type (1 GC and 1 IN from each slice at least). The same applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. See McGarry and Carter, 2016.</p><p>Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is purely anatomical but it is important to use the same approach as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to determine functional connectivity (ChR2 evoked synaptic responses in DG-SOMIs).</p><p>What is the cross talk between the 2 groups of SOM DGs themselves?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Somatostatin-positive interneurons in the dentate gyrus of mice provide local- and long-range septal synaptic inhibition&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>Although some of the issues raised in the original reviews have been addressed with further analysis and experiments, the reviewers still had concerns that will require your attention. We think the observations are interesting and for the most part the experiments are well done. However, in some cases the small sample size precludes some of the strongest conclusions put forth by the authors. Thus, the conclusions need to be toned down to match the experimental data. In that regard, the text of the manuscript will need editing throughout following careful attention to the below comments. The Senior Editor will assess your response in the revised version.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. One of the reviewers still favored testing a cluster analysis to better determine the subtypes of SOM-expressing interneurons. The correlation analysis suggested in Hosp et al., 2014 may not be informative but a PCA or cluster analysis would. Please consider this possibility or discuss in the paper whether or not it would be useful.</p><p>2) The physiology data shows marginally significant differences between groups but included non-reconstructed neurons. Please plot the electrophysiological properties of fully reconstructed neurons and mark them with special symbols. The reason for concern is based on the examples of cells displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where a confocal image was used to see the location of cutoff axon segment or direction of innervation to determine the class. These examples could pass for non-HIPP and non-HIL cells if their axons were only partially visible.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It would be helpful to show a longer pre-induction baseline and a longer post induction time course. The LTD effect (sampled at 15-20 mins for E and F) only appears at the 16-17 min. In addition, the DCG application timecourse (20-40 mins) should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref> to demonstrate whether the magnitude of plasticity was uncorrelated with DCG-IV sensitivity.</p><p>4) One of the reviewers had this additional suggestion regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to which you should respond:</p><p>&quot;There is a flaw in the experimental design of bath applying DCG post LTP or LTD induction and expression and comparing this to the effects of DCG IV in naïve slices from a different data set. The differential impact of DCG IV on HIPP and HIL cells is interesting. It would be interesting to test if the differential expression of plasticity is due to presynaptic property differences (influence of MF versus mossy cells/FFI). A better experiment to perform is to bath apply DCG IV prior to induction and have it constantly present during induction and expression – throughout the course of the plasticity experiment. This would reveal if the LTP/LTD is independent of target selective presynaptic plasticity differences. If the approach chosen by the authors is to be used, then one must compare the effects of DCG IV application pre and post plasticity induction with washout in between during induction.&quot;</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors’ premise about synapse location is supported by the similar rise times of somatic and dendritic evoked IPSCs in granule cells, whereas somatic-evoked IPSCs in interneurons have a faster rise time than dendritic-evoked IPSCs. However, the amplitude data is less convincing as it will depend entirely on the number of activated axons and release probability. The conclusions would be strengthened by additional data and analysis to parse out the subtype-selective contributions. The paired recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are a good complement to results in 4C and 4D to further strengthen the point that IN receive inhibition from HIL; but it still does not exclude the possibility that GCs receive somatic inhibition. Similar paired recordings between HIL and GCs will be the only convincing evidence to back the conclusion. Thus, the authors must tone down the weakest conclusion. Specifically, this statement in Results – &quot;Thus, HIPP cells provide dendritic inhibition onto GCs and interneurons whereas SOM+ axons in the hilus supply powerful perisomatic inhibition onto interneurons&quot; – should be changed to &quot;Thus, HIPP cells provide dendritic inhibition onto GCs and interneurons whereas SOM+ axons in the hilus supply powerful perisomatic inhibition onto interneurons.&quot;</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The lack of functional analysis makes the conclusion from this anatomical analysis weak. We strongly suggest that this figure be deleted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21105.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>As you will see, both reviewers had a number of comments, some of which will require some additional data but both reviewers were interested in the work and thought you would be able to address these issues within approximately 2 months. Even if you cannot complete every requested experiment, we think this can be a strong paper if you focus your conclusions towards their strongest data sets. A major concern was that the classification parameters are not well described and many conclusions are based on observations in small datasets. The differences in the cell types, which is pitched as the key finding of the paper, seem somewhat overstated without addressing the issues raised. The full comments of the reviewers are below.</italic> </p><p>We thank the Senior Editor for the opportunity to revise our study and thereby improve the scientific content of our manuscript. In response to both reviewers, we focused our revision on three major parts:</p><p>1) We increased the number of reconstructions of the two contrasting somatostatin-expressing interneuron (SOMI) types, the hilar-perforant path-associated interneurons (HIPP) and the hilar interneurons (HILs). This resulted in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>.We show now 6 reconstructed HIPP, 6 HIL cells and 2 SOMIs which do not fall in the HIPP and HIL cell classification. We improved the description of classification criteria of the two interneuron types in the Materials and methods (subsection “Immunohistochemistry and Morphology”, last paragraph) as well as the Results section (subsection “Layer-specific axon distributions define two contrasting DG-SOMI types”, last paragraph). We included additional qualitative and quantitative information on the passive and active membrane properties of the two SOMI types such as membrane resting potentials, membrane time constants, the slope of decay of a single action potential and phase plots from individual action potentials. This resulted in new graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-K</xref>.</p><p>2) We increased number of experiments demonstrating long-lasting synaptic potentiation (LTP) in HIL cells and included a new set of plasticity experiments showing long-lasting depression (LTD) in HIPP cells with subsequent DCG-IV bath application which resulted in a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. We performed a coefficient-of variation (CV) analysis which together with the failure rate analysis indicates that both LTD and LTP of synaptic transmission onto HIPP and HILs, respectively, is expressed presynaptically. This resulted in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. We performed additional quantitative data analysis as requested by the reviewers and show that the input resistance of SOMIs does not alter after plasticity induction compared to baseline periods (subsection “Electrophysiology”, last paragraph). Additionally, we provide statistical evidence that LTD and LTP do not depend on the peak amplitude of EPSCs during baseline periods (subsection “Differential forms of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells”). We added a new set of experiments showing that HIPP cells receive DCG-IV-sensitive excitatory inputs indicating their Mossy Fiber (MF)-mediated nature. Our data further show that HIL cells receive DCG-IV sensitive as well as insensitive excitatory inputs indicating that HIL cells receive in addition to MFs also inputs from other glutamatergic cells, very likely local Mossy cells (MCs). These results are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. In response to reviewer 2 we performed additional 3 experiments showing that LTD is long-lasting, extending a recording period of 30 min. This shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>3) We replaced all current-clamp experiments originally shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by voltage-clamp experiments and demonstrate that optogenetic activation of SOMI-positive synaptic inputs targeting dendrites of granule cells (GCs) and dentate gyrus fast-spiking interneurons evoke small and slow IPSCs whereas activation of perisomatic SOMI-positive synapses evokes large and rapid IPSCs in fast-spiking interneurons but not in GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). This further supports our initial conclusion that persiomatic SOMI-expressing synapses are largely formed at interneurons but not at GCs.</p><p>Finally, we performed additional qualitative and quantitative data analysis requested by the reviewers which we list in the point-by-point response to both reviewers below. After this rigorous revision we hope that our study can fulfil the high standards of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors show that somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOMs) in the dentate gyrus are comprised of two populations with distinct anatomical and functional properties. Little is known about SOMs in the DG, and they have generally been treated as a homogenous population, so a comprehensive analysis of their connectivity and function addresses an important issue. I find the main conclusion convincing but I have reservations about some of the specific analyses and conclusions.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Subsection “Layer-specific axon distributions define two contrasting DG-SOMI types”: Both cell types shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> appear to have substantially greater dendrite length than the average length reported in the text (~240 micron). Either this is an oversight, or the morphology of both cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not representative. It might be appropriate to include the other reconstructed cells as supplementary material if in fact there is variability in dendrite structure.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this typo. The total dendritic length for HIPP cells is 2500.4 ± 333.0 µm (6 cells) and for HIL cells 2547.3 ± 427.8 µm (6 cells). We increased the number of reconstructed cells from the original 4 / group to 6 / group shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The last paragraph of the subsection “Layer-specific axon distributions define two contrasting DG-SOMI types” was altered accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) One of the most interesting observations is that HIP and HIL cells exhibit different long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, the interpretation that MFs generate postsynaptic cell-type specific plasticity not fully convincing because the authors have not shown that all the synaptic input to HIPs and HILs are from MFs. Since mossy cells also innervate interneurons in the hilus (i.e. Larimer and Strowbridge, 2008), an alternative possibility is that there is presynaptic cell-type specificity that dictates the polarity of plasticity. EPSCs in HIP and HIL cells may have different sensitivity to DCG-IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), potentially suggesting a different degree of innervation by MFs and mossy cells. Such a difference in excitatory input would be important for understanding distinct network functions as well as the mechanism underlying plasticity.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the importance of input specificity. Indeed, the comments of the reviewer motivated us to perform additional experiments in which we positioned the extracellular stimulation pipette at the granule cell layer (gcl) to hilus border to excite both Mossy Fiber (MF) synapses originating from GCs and Mossy cells (MCs). After obtaining a control period we bath applied DCG-IV which has previously be shown to be a specific group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) agonist which specifically reduces synaptic transmission at MF terminals. We observed that evoked EPSCs in HIPP cells could be substantially blocked by DCGIV by 51.7 ± 3.9% (range 35 – 79%, 10 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>) indicating their MF-mediated nature. Excitatory signals in HIL cells were also diminished by DCG-IV, but to a lesser extent (by 32.6 ± 9.4%, 16 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In contrast to HIPP cells, the magnitude of the DCG-IV effect was highly variable in HIL cells (range 0 – 95%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These data indicate that HILs receive in addition to MFs, excitatory inputs of different origin, very likely MCs. Representative traces as well as the quantitative data analysis are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. On the basis of these findings we performed additional plasticity experiments with subsequent bath-application of DCG-IV which are shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Indeed, all LTP and LTD experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> contain DCG-IV bath-application at the end of the plasticity experiment (20-30 min after plasticity induction). Our data show that independent on the DCG-IV effect, thus independent on the nature of the presynaptic input, HIPP cells expressed predominantly LTD and HIL cells LTP (Spearman’s Rank-Order correlation between DCG-IV effect and magnitude of synaptic plasticity, P &gt; 0.05; subsection “Differential forms of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells”).</p><p>To determine the locus of LTD and LTP expression, we examined changes in the percentage of transmission failures and performed a coefficient-of-variation (CV) analysis following Malinow and Tsien 1990 (Nature 346:177). Our data indicate a presynaptic locus of plasticity expression. These data are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>and were added to the Results section, subsection “Synaptic plasticity at synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells is presynaptically expressed”.</p><p><italic>Along the same lines, the authors suggest (in the Methods) that washout of intracellular components could explain a lack of plasticity in 5/11 HIPP cells and 5/13 HIL cells, but this explanation is not satisfying without additional evidence (is plasticity more likely to occur with high resistance pipettes or perforated patch?). An alternative explanation is that some fibers produce LTP and some LTD, such that the net effect depends on the combination of activated inputs.</italic> </p><p>Due to the low yield of morphologically identified HIPP cells as well as the extremely challenging Gramicidin perforated-patch recordings, we decided to perform additional experiments with high resistance electrodes (Rs &gt;10 MOhm) for &gt;30 min in which LTD was induced in all 3 SOMIs (1 HIPP cell and 2 unidentified SOMIs; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; see also reviewer 2 point 4). Moreover, our new data set on synaptic plasticity includes only experiments with DCG-IV bath- application at the end. In this new data set 2 out of 7 HIPP cells and 1 out of 12 HIL cells show no synaptic plasticity. Thus, our initial proposal that wash-out of intracellular components may cause a lack of plastic changes may not hold and was therefore removed from the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Our data show that the sign and magnitude of synaptic plasticity does not depend on the magnitude of the DCG-IV effect (subsection “Differential forms of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells”). We conclude therefore, that, the sign of synaptic plasticity (LTD and LTP) is not dependent on the nature of the presynaptic glutamatergic inputs but the identity of the target cell.</p><p><italic>3) The idea that SOMs provide both dendritic and perisomatic inhibition seems reasonable based on the axonal targeting of HIPPs and HILs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. But it doesn't make sense to compare IPSPs across cell types (interneurons and GCs) with different passive membrane properties, since the faster time constant of interneurons will assure faster IPSP kinetics regardless of dendritic filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These experiments should be done in voltage clamp.</italic> </p><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and repeated the entire set of experiments under voltage-clamp conditions (12 GCs, 9 interneurons). This new data set is shown in the renewed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref> and supports our initial conclusions that SOMIs induce dendritic small and slow IPSCs at both interneuron and GC dendrites but perisomatic fast and strong inhibitory signals at target interneurons but not at target GCs. The Results section was revised accordingly.</p><p><italic>4) One important variable that was not specified in regards to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is the timing of the experiments relative to the ChR2 injection, since expression level of ChR2 has a significant impact on the light-evoked recruitment of fibers. In the cluster-firing cell of panel D, the 2-ms light pulse appears to generate two presynaptic spikes (either in the same axon or different axons) since the IPSC has a reliable double peak but this is not seen in the other examples. This could suggest a higher level of ChR2 expression. To assure that presynaptic recruitment is the same across all cell types, the experiments must be performed during the same window of time after the viral injection (the Methods states only that experiments were performed &gt; 2 weeks post injection.)</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for emphasizing the importance of the methodological information. All experiments have been performed 14-18 days after viral injection. To exclude differences in EPSC size based on varying expression profiles in presynaptic DG-SOMI fibers, we obtained data from at least two cell types / animal / septal slice in a subset of experiments (3 PVIs and 3 cholinergic cells / slice; 3 PVIs and 3 putative glutamatergic cells / slice). These data are shown representatively for 3 PVI and 3 putative glutamatergic cells in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Thus, differences in the strength of light-evoked EPSCs cannot be explained by differences in the expression profile of ChR2 but rather by differences in the convergence of synaptic inputs. 5</p><p>The methodological information is added to Materials and methods subsection “Optophysiology”, and to the Results subsection “DG-SOMIs provide strong inhibition onto putative septal glutamatergic but weak inhibition onto 307 GABAergic and cholinergic cells”. Finally, we increased the number of experiments and added the new data points to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an interesting study that highlights the functional connectivity of somatostatin positive GABAergic neurons within the dentate gyrus and long-range to the medial septum. The paper emphasizes the presence of two subpopulations of DG SOM inhibitory neurons: Hilar-perforant path associated (HIPP described previously) and hilus associated interneurons (HIL) which this paper categorizes for the first time. The HIPP neurons get inputs from granule cells and target the molecular layer while the HILs target the hilus and provide somatic inhibition to PV neurons and long range inputs to the medial septum.</italic> </p><p><italic>The study uses modern methods like optogenetics, clarity and plasticity assays. The manuscript presents important data regarding target selective connectivity and functional properties of GABAergic neurons. Inhibition in the dentate gyrus is not as well characterized as other regions of the hippocampus, and the findings of the study are novel and relevant to the field. However, the study is not as thorough as previous work from the same group. The format of the paper is predominantly characterization based. The relatively small datasets, lack of details regarding classification criteria and evidence for the functional role of HIPP and HIL, limit the scope and impact of the study without additional supporting data.</italic> </p><p><italic>Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, refer to 32 cells where 8 are considered HIPP and 24 as HIL; however axon length and distribution data is presented from only 4 reconstructed cells in each category. Was this because the rest of the cells did not fill completely? How were partially filled neurons categorized based on morphology (20 for HIL)? Please show reconstructions of more neurons and present clearly what criteria for classification were used. Based on results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with GIN and Som-Cre-tdTom mice there should be more data for reconstruction and quantification of axon length and distribution.</italic> </p><p>We increased the number of reconstructed cells from 4 to 6 for each group and provide a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> showing 6 reconstructions / group. The criterion for interneuron identification was the visual inspection of the axonal arborization pattern. HIPP cells showed axon fibers crossing the granule cell layer (gcl) and forming a lateral stretch of axonal projections predominantly in the outer half of the molecular layer. Some HIPP cells formed axon collaterals in the hilus as previously shown by our work (Savanthrapadian et al., 2014; J Neurosci 34:8197). In case of HIL cells the axon was predominantly located in the hilus and did not distribute in the molecular layer. Cells were identified on the basis of visual identification from confocal image stacks. Partly labelled cells, which did not allow an identification of HIPP or HIL, were excluded from the study. The classification criteria have been added to the Materials and methods subsection “Immunohistochemistry and Morphology”, last paragraph.</p><p><italic>There are small differences in electrophysiological properties, and as stated in the paper the HIL and HIPP were mainly categorized based on morphology. It would be helpful to perform multivariate analyses (e.g. PCA, HCA) to show differences between different classes similar to Graves et al., 2012, Fuchs et al., 2016, McGarry et al., 2010., Ascoli et al., 2008 What is the resting membrane potential of these two types of neurons?</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer we included information on the resting membrane potentials of the two SOMI types to the Results subsection “DG-SOMI types have different intrinsic membrane properties” and to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.</p><p>On the basis of the very distinct and significantly different morphological axonal distribution patterns of the two SOMI types and the small but significantly different physiological parameters (please see the added passive and active membrane properties in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we believe that a cluster analysis as previously performed on dentate gyrus interneuron types (Hosp et al., 2014, Hippocampus, 24:189) will not improve our current results and therefore decided not to perform a cluster analysis. We hope that the reviewer can agree with our decision.</p><p><italic>Results from the second paragraph/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, that &quot;HILS form the major anatomical substrate for long-distance DG-spetal projections&quot; is based on the result that the 75% of labelled cells present a &quot;morphological characteristics similar to HILs&quot;. There is no detail about the morphological analysis of these cells. Furthermore, can the authors detail the electrophysiological properties (Rin, AP HD, max. AP Frequency) of these long-range projecting neurons to confirm that they look similar to what they found previously.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> we show one example of one projecting HIL cell. To improve the clarity on the classification criteria we define the identification parameters in the Results subsection “HIL but not HIPP cells form long-range connections to the medial septum”, last paragraph and in the Materials and methods subsection “Immunohistochemistry and Morphology”, last paragraph. We state that retrogradely labelled cells in the DG had axon fibers located in the hilus but not in the outer molecular layer and therefore were classified as HIL cells. This classification is based on reconstructions from retrogradely tagged and intracellularly labelled cells. Only neurons with an axonal length of &gt;2 mm were considered in the analysis. This resulted in a total of 13 HILs and 2 cells with axon in the hilus and inner molecular layer. We show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> two additionally reconstructed and projecting HIL cells.</p><p>The loading of cells with RedRetroBead markedly changed the membrane characteristics. The input resistance for example increased to 380.4 ± 44.4 MΩ markedly different to the one observed in control HIL cells with 186.7 ± 12.1 MΩ. Moreover, the maximal discharge frequency of retrogradely labelled cells was markedly lower with 56.0 ± 11 Hz than in controls with 141.5 ± 5.7 Hz. We therefore focused our analysis on axon localization only.</p><p><italic>Were the recordings for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> performed in GIN or SOM Cre-Ai9 mice to specifically target the SOM interneurons? If not was the SOM identity verified user SOM counterstaining? The time course for measurement of LTD presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, is too short and unstable. Please provide data from longer recordings and greater N.</italic> </p><p>In all plasticity experiments shown in this study antibody labelling against SOM has been performed (GIN, n = 11 and SOM Cre-Ai9 mice, n = 8 cells). Examples for one HIPP and one HIL expressing LTD and LTP, respectively, and the respective antibody labelling against SOM has been newly included to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>. Following the proposal of the reviewer on the stability of the recordings and the request of reviewer 1 to prove the nature of excitatory inputs onto DG-SOMIs by bath-applying DCG-IV at the end of all experiments (major criticism 2), we increased the total number of experiments from originally 3 to 7 HIPP cell and from the original 6 to 12 HIL cells with stable recordings for 20 min after plasticity induction and subsequent DCG-IV bath-application. In an additional data set of 1 HIPP and 2 non-identified DG-SOMIs which expressed LTD, we increased the recording time from 20 to 30 min with subsequent DCG-IV bath-application resulting in a total post-induction recording time of 40 min. The new data sets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and demonstrate that LTD is a stable, robust and long-lasting phenomenon.</p><p><italic>Please present paired pulse ratio in addition to the transmission failure rates.</italic> </p><p>The number of paired pulses was unfortunately too low for a useful data analysis. However, we performed a coefficient-of-variation (CV) analysis on EPSC peak amplitudes during the time window of 15-20 min after plasticity induction normalized to baseline conditions and plotted the obtained data against the normalized EPSC amplitudes (mean EPSC amplitude after plasticity induction/mean EPSC amplitude at baseline conditions). The majority of data points obtained from LTP experiments were located at or above the identity line and from LTD experiments close to the identity line indicating a presynaptic locus of plasticity expression for both LTP and LTD. The CV analysis together with the significant decline in the percentage of failures in synaptic transmission in LTP but significant increase in failure rates in LTD experiments (15-20 min after induction) compared to baseline values support the presynaptic locus of plasticity expression. These data are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and have been added to the Results subsection “Synaptic plasticity at synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells is presynaptically expressed”.</p><p><italic>Also, provide a supplementary figure showing resting membrane potential, input resistance through the timecourse of the experiment.</italic> </p><p>All experiments have been performed in voltage-clamp conditions. Thus, continuous values on the resting membrane potential (Vrest) as a function of recording time cannot be provided. However, we measure Vrest regularly every 5 min and did not observe significant changes in its value. This is now mentioned newly in the last paragraph of the subsection “Electrophysiology”.</p><p>We followed the proposal of the reviewer and analyzed in a subset of the recorded cells the input resistance (Rin) over recording time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). We show (1) that Rin during the baseline period and 15-20 min after plasticity induction did not significantly change (LTD cells: baseline 326.3 ± 21.2 MOhm, 15-20 min after LTD expression: 323.0 ± 25.5 MOhm, 8 cells; HIL cells: 201.5 ± 19.2 MOhm, after LTP expression: 204.8 ± 14.6 MOhm, 9 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, Rin was stable during the course of the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref>).

Prior to LTD a basic characterization of basal synaptic transmission would be valuable. For example, as per figure A and B the starting baseline EPSC amplitude in the HIPP vs. HIL cells look considerably different (200 nA vs. 50 nA). Is this representative of the two groups? If not then perhaps the LTP expression is an outcome of the smaller starting amplitude for HIL. Could one plot a correlation between the starting EPSC amplitude and the degree of LTD or LTP in the groups? Again, additional data to support the classification (morphological/physiological) from the HIPP vs. HIL cells should be presented. These long-term recordings must have yielded very good cell fills for detailed reconstruction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> does not specify if example traces are from HIPP or HIL.</italic> </p><p>The mean EPSC peak amplitude in HIPP cells expressing LTD was 77.0 ± 19.6 pA during baseline periods. The mean EPSC peak amplitude in HIL cells expressing LTP was 74.6 ± 16.4 pA during baseline periods. The mean peak amplitudes were not significantly different between HIPP and HIL cells (P = 0.767, t-test). The magnitude of synaptic plasticity did not correlate with the amplitude of baseline EPSCs as determined with the Spearman’s Rank-Order correlation (P &gt; 0.05 for both comparisons). This information is shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>) and was added to the Results subsection “Differential forms of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells”.

The size of the oml stimulation evoked response in both GC and IN groups is similar for the dendritic layer photostimulation. The small amplitude could reflect the attenuation down the dendritic tree but also differences in membrane time constants of the two populations (GC vs. INs).</italic> </p><p>Following the request of the reviewer, we repeated the experiments under voltage-clamp conditions and observed similar qualitative results. We recorded IPSCs with small amplitudes upon blue light pulse application close to the dendrites of both fast-spiking INs and GCs and IPSCs with large amplitudes and fast time courses in INs but not in GCs. These data therefore provide evidence of perisomatic SOMI-mediated inhibitory synapses in INs but not GCs. The new set of data have been added to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Please view also response to reviewer 1, point 3.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> it is unclear what the 3 bars in the plot represent. For comparing strength of synaptic connections in a slice with virally expressed ChR2, it is important to perform dual recordings from each cell type (1 GC and 1 IN from each slice at least). The same applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. See McGarry and Carter, 2016.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref> show representative data from 2 HIL-HIL and 2 HIL-BC paired recordings. The three bars represent the synaptic latency (lat), the 20-80% rise time (rise) and the decay time constant (τ) of unitary IPSCs. We improved the figure legend to enhance the clarity on the presented data.</p><p>Recordings have been performed from 12 GCs and 6 INs, from which 3 GCs and 3 INs were recorded in the same slice. The qualitative and quantitative data in simultaneous IN and GC recordings were similar to those ones recorded from individual INs and GCs/slice. We agree that the intensity of ChR2 expression can vary among injected mice. However, recordings have been always performed from GCs and INs of the same injected mouse. Moreover, we compared dendritic vs. perisomatic light-plus mediated IPSCs of the same recorded cell. We therefore strongly believe that differences in the peak amplitude and time course of IPSCs evoked by light-mediated ChR2- activation close to the soma vs. dendrite in INs as well as GCs cannot be explained inter-slice variabilities but differences in the location of input synapses. Finally, to exclude variabilities in IPSC size due differences in viral expression intensity, data shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> have been obtained in a subset of recordings from 2 cell types / slice (3 PVI plus 3 putative glutamatergic cell; 3 PVI plus 3 ChAT cells). This is now explicitly stated in the Materials and methods subsection “Optophysiology”, second paragraph, in the Results subsection “DG-SOMIs provide local dendritic and perisomatic inhibition onto target cells” and “DG-SOMIs provide strong inhibition onto putative septal glutamatergic but weak inhibition onto GABAergic and cholinergic cells”, last paragraph.</p><p><italic>Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is purely anatomical but it is important to use the same approach as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to determine functional connectivity (ChR2 evoked synaptic responses in DG-SOMIs).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for emphasizing this important experiment which we indeed tried. We injected rAAV-ChR2-tdT in the medial septum of PV-Cre mice. Four weeks after viral expression we performed whole-cell recordings from ~100 hilar cells in acute hippocampal slice preparations to evoke light pulse-mediated IPSCs in target cells of the DG. However, we could not record any IPSCs. We conclude that the expression intensity of ChR2 over long distances is not as strong as in the opposite direction from DG-SOMIs projecting to the medial septum. Although we would have loved to have these data, we decided not to continue this set of experiments and hope that the reviewer can support our decision.</p><p><italic>What is the cross talk between the 2 groups of SOM DGs themselves?</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting question. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref> we show that HIL cells are mutually interconnected (2 HIL-HIL pairs) but also target basket cells (2 HIL-BC pairs). Detailed information on the connectivity and synaptic properties among SOMI types, however, are very difficult to obtain and therefore, the focus of an independent study, which we currently follow.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Although some of the issues raised in the original reviews have been addressed with further analysis and experiments, the reviewers still had concerns that will require your attention. We think the observations are interesting and for the most part the experiments are well done. However, in some cases the small sample size precludes some of the strongest conclusions put forth by the authors. Thus, the conclusions need to be toned down to match the experimental data. In that regard, the text of the manuscript will need editing throughout following careful attention to the below comments. The Senior Editor will assess your response in the revised version.</italic> </p><p><italic>Major points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. One of the reviewers still favored testing a cluster analysis to better determine the subtypes of SOM-expressing interneurons. The correlation analysis suggested in Hosp et al., 2014 may not be informative but a PCA or cluster analysis would. Please consider this possibility or discuss in the paper whether or not it would be useful.</italic> </p><p>We performed the requested cluster analysis, which is newly included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>. The corresponding text was inserted in the Results subsection “DG-SOMI types have different intrinsic membrane properties”, last paragraph and a new chapter in the Materials and methods subsection”Cluster analysis”. The cluster analysis was performed by including morphological (axonal and dendritic length, percent distribution of the axon in the hilus, granule cell layer, inner and outer molecular layer; 6 parameters), and physiological properties (input resistance, membrane resting potential, membrane time constant, action potential half-duration, decay time course of single action potentials, maximal discharge frequency; 6 parameters summarized in Materials and methods) of the reconstructed SOMIs depicted as triangles in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-J</xref>. This analysis confirmed our prediction that the recorded DG-SOMIs fall into two distinct groups, HIPP and HIL cells, on the basis of their axon location and intrinsic membrane properties. Due to space limits we moved the representative single action potential and the corresponding phase plot from a HIPP and a HILL cell to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The physiology data shows marginally significant differences between groups but included non-reconstructed neurons. Please plot the electrophysiological properties of fully reconstructed neurons and mark them with special symbols. The reason for concern is based on the examples of cells displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where a confocal image was used to see the location of cutoff axon segment or direction of innervation to determine the class. These examples could pass for non-HIPP and non-HIL cells if their axons were only partially visible.</italic> </p><p>We included the requested symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-J</xref>. We apologize for the low quality of the figure leaving the reviewers with the impression that the axon was cut. We show now instead of the confocal images the morphological reconstructions of the two SOMI types confirming that they are a representative HIPP and a HIL cell.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It would be helpful to show a longer pre-induction baseline and a longer post induction time course. The LTD effect (sampled at 15-20 mins for E and F) only appears at the 16-17 min. In addition, the DCG application timecourse (20-40 mins) should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref> to demonstrate whether the magnitude of plasticity was uncorrelated with DCG-IV sensitivity.</italic> </p><p>We included the time course of the pre-control of 10 min in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>. We show the time course of the DCG-IV effect for individual experiments (LTD and LTP) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>. Due to the high heterogeneity of the DCG-IV effect among HIL cells we included a graph showing the DCG-IV effects for every individual plasticity experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (left). Moreover, we included a new plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (right) showing that the degree of LTD/LTP and the magnitude of the DCG-IV effect are not correlated. We would like to emphasize that a significant reduction in the mean synaptic transmission (LTD) was expressed in the time window of 10-15 min as well as 15-20 min post induction compared to pre-induction periods shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (right).</p><p>We show post-induction time courses for up to 21 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>. We cannot provide longer time courses for this set of experiments. However, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> the time course of LTD (3 SOMIs) for up to 30 min after plasticity induction with subsequent DCG-IV bath- application (total recording time 45 min). These experiments demonstrate that LTD in SOM-positive interneurons is stable and remains for long periods of time (&gt;20 min after plasticity induction).</p><p><italic>4) One of the reviewers had this additional suggestion regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to which you should respond:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;There is a flaw in the experimental design of bath applying DCG post LTP or LTD induction and expression and comparing this to the effects of DCG IV in naïve slices from a different data set. The differential impact of DCG IV on HIPP and HIL cells is interesting. It would be interesting to test if the differential expression of plasticity is due to presynaptic property differences (influence of MF versus mossy cells/FFI). A better experiment to perform is to bath apply DCG IV prior to induction and have it constantly present during induction and expression – throughout the course of the plasticity experiment. This would reveal if the LTP/LTD is independent of target selective presynaptic plasticity differences.</italic> </p><p><italic>We included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (left) the magnitude of the mean DFG-IV effect obtained from all individual synaptic plasticity experiments. The mean DCG-IV effect in HIPP and HIL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, left) after the induction of plasticity was not significantly different from the ones observed in naive slices (P &gt; 0.05, t- test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure 3 supplement 1</xref>; circles represent experiments in naive slices and triangles represent plasticity experiments). This information is now stated in the corresponding figure legend. Moreover, we include a plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (right) demonstrating that the magnitude of synaptic plasticity (LTD and LTP) was uncorrelated with the extent of the DCG-IV effect on synaptic transmission. These data as a whole suggest that the magnitude of the observed plasticity changes (LTD/LTP) were independent on the nature of the input synapse.</italic></p><p>Excitatory inputs that expressed LTD in HIPP cells were consistently DCG-IV sensitive (~52% block) pointing to their mossy fiber-mediated nature. In contrast, excitatory inputs in HIL cells showed a milder mean DCG-IV sensitivity (~32% block) with a high heterogeneity in the individual DCG-IV effects (range -2.4 to 96% blocking effect) suggesting that in addition to mossy fibers, different glutamatergic inputs, very likely originating from mossy cells, may contribute to synaptic plasticity. To test whether these additional glutamatergic inputs may express synaptic plasticity, we followed the proposal of the reviewer and performed an additional set of experiments in which we bath-applied DCG-IV before establishing the whole-cell recording of an SOMI and continued to apply DCG-IV throughout the entire experiment. Our data show that synaptic potentiation could still be induced (LTP by 144.9 ± 5.2%; 4 SOMIs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). Indeed, LTP reached values similar to experiments in which EPSCs were markedly blocked by DCG-IV &gt;20 min after LTP expression indicating their mossy fiber-mediated nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> of the main manuscript). These data as a whole support our hypothesis that synaptic plasticity in SOMIs is independent of the nature of the synaptic input and can be induced at mossy fiber and other types of glutamatergic synapses, very likely mossy cell inputs.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21105.020</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Long-lasting potentiation can be induced at glutamatergic inputs targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SOMIs) in the presence of the group II mGluR agonist DCG-IV.</title><p>EPSCs were evoked by extracellular stimulation with a pipette positioned at thegranule cell layer to hilus border. Plot summarizes the time course of EPSC peak amplitudes evoked at glutamatergic input synapses targeting SOMIs before and after associative pairing as indicated by the arrow. EPSCs were averaged over 30 sec intervals and normalized to baseline values. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was determined 15-20 min after plasticity induction. Note, DCG-IV was bath-applied throughout the entire experiment to block mossy fiber-mediated EPSCs (4 SOMIs). These data together with our finding that LTP can be induced at glutamatergic inputs onto SOMIs that are strongly DCG-IV sensitive and therefore mediated by mossy fibers (blocking effect &gt;40%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> left in the main manuscript), suggests that LTP induction in SOMIs is independent on the nature of the input synapse.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21105.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21105.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21105-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>If the approach chosen by the authors is to be used, then one must compare the effects of DCG IV application pre and post plasticity induction with washout in between during induction.&quot;</italic> </p><p>The proposed experiments require the recording of a baseline period, followed by DCG-IV bath- application with plasticity induction, the subsequent wash-out of the drug and the recording of synaptic plasticity. A full recovery of synaptic transmission at mossy fiber synapses requires a long wash-out time (approximately 25 min). We are concerned that after DCG-IV washout residual effects of the drug on intracellular signaling cascades might generate unexpected or variable effects on synaptic release or on the expression of synaptic plasticity. Therefore, we fear that the results obtained from the proposed experiments might not provide a reliable answer to the reviewer’s question. The most convincing experiment would be the repetition of the here presented plasticity experiments in a pair configuration (GC-SOMI vs. mossy cell-SOMI pairs). However, these experiments are highly challenging due to the difficulty obtaining these pairs. We would therefore propose to tone down our conclusion at the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “Differential forms of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses targeting HIPP and HIL cells”, with the sentence, ‘…suggesting that LTP was induced at mossy fiber terminals and at other glutamatergic synapses, very likely those originating from mossy cells…’.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors’ premise about synapse location is supported by the similar rise times of somatic and dendritic evoked IPSCs in granule cells, whereas somatic-evoked IPSCs in interneurons have a faster rise time than dendritic-evoked IPSCs. However, the amplitude data is less convincing as it will depend entirely on the number of activated axons and release probability. The conclusions would be strengthened by additional data and analysis to parse out the subtype-selective contributions. The paired recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are a good complement to results in 4C and 4D to further strengthen the point that IN receive inhibition from HIL; but it still does not exclude the possibility that GCs receive somatic inhibition. Similar paired recordings between HIL and GCs will be the only convincing evidence to back the conclusion. Thus, the authors must tone down the weakest conclusion. Specifically, this statement in Results – &quot;Thus, HIPP cells provide dendritic inhibition onto GCs and interneurons whereas SOM+ axons in the hilus supply powerful perisomatic inhibition onto interneurons&quot; – should be changed to &quot;Thus, HIPP cells provide dendritic inhibition onto GCs and interneurons whereas SOM+ axons in the hilus supply powerful perisomatic inhibition onto interneurons.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We fully agree and follow the proposal of the reviewer by toning down our statement at the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “DG-SOMIs provide local dendritic and perisomatic inhibition onto target cells”.
