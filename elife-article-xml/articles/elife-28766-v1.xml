Here, we report that RNF145, a previously uncharacterized ER membrane ubiquitin ligase, participates in crosstalk between these critical signaling pathways. RNF145 expression is induced in response to LXR activation and high-cholesterol diet feeding. Transduction of RNF145 into mouse liver inhibits the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and reduces plasma cholesterol levels. Conversely, acute suppression of RNF145 via shRNA-mediated knockdown, or chronic inactivation of RNF145 by genetic deletion, potentiates the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes and increases cholesterol levels both in liver and plasma. Mechanistic studies show that RNF145 triggers ubiquitination of SCAP on lysine residues within a cytoplasmic loop essential for COPII binding, potentially inhibiting its transport to Golgi and subsequent processing of SREBP-2. These findings define an additional mechanism linking hepatic sterol levels to the reciprocal actions of the SREBP-2 and LXR pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>LXR</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scientist Development Grant (16SDG31180008)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL088528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Temel</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL111932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Temel</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL030568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK063491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tontonoz</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF145 is shown to contribute to crosstalk between the LXR and SREBP-2 pathways in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise control of cholesterol levels is critical for the normal function of cells and organisms. The maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis relies on a delicate balance between production, uptake and output. Two transcription factor families with opposing actions – the liver-X receptors (LXRs) and the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) – are the main orchestrators of this balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hong and Tontonoz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Horton et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>LXRs are nuclear receptors activated by cholesterol metabolite oxysterols in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehmann et al., 1997</xref>). There are two LXR receptors, LXRα and LXRβ, that share a high degree of functional overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Castrillo and Tontonoz, 2004</xref>). In response to elevated cellular cholesterol levels, they function to induce the expression of genes involved in the efflux of cholesterol, including <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> and <italic>Apoe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laffitte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Repa et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Venkateswaran et al., 2000</xref>). Abrogation of LXR expression in mouse models results in cholesterol accumulation and accelerated atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schuster et al., 2002</xref>). Pharmacological activation of LXRs with synthetic agonists in mice confers protection against atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joseph et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Terasaka et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, SREBPs control the transcription of lipid biosynthesis genes. SREBP-2 preferentially regulates the expression of genes involved in cholesterol production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horton et al., 2003</xref>). Immature SREBP-2 protein is retained in the ER through the interaction with SCAP and INSIG proteins. In response to low cellular cholesterol levels, SCAP undergoes a conformational change that permits it to move from ER to Golgi in COPII vesicles, where it is processed to its mature form. The mature SREBP-2 transcription factor then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Srebf2</italic> in mice is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vergnes et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Scap</italic> knockout mice show reduced nuclear SREBP accumulation and low cholesterol levels in serum and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of the LXR and SREBP pathways in lipid homeostasis it is not surprising that mechanisms for crosstalk between them have emerged. For example, LXR responds to elevated hepatic sterol levels by stimulating fatty acid synthesis through transcriptional induction of <italic>Srebp1c</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Repa et al., 2000a</xref>). SREBP-2 acts as a positive regulator of <italic>Abca1</italic> gene expression by enabling the generation of oxysterol ligands for LXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wong et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, an intronic microRNA located within <italic>Srebf2</italic> gene, <italic>miR-33</italic>, inhibits the expression of <italic>Abca1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rayner et al., 2010</xref>). LXR inhibits cellular cholesterol uptake in an SREBP-independent fashion through the induction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>). LXR was also recently shown to modulate cholesterol biosynthesis in mouse liver by inducing the expression of the non-coding RNA <italic>LeXis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sallam et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe an addition mechanism for LXR-SREBP crosstalk. We identify RNF145, an ER membrane ubiquitin E3 ligase with no previously known function, as an inhibitor of hepatic SREBP-2 processing. Expression of <italic>Rnf145</italic> is induced in response to LXR activation and high-cholesterol diet feeding. Overexpression of <italic>Rnf145</italic> inhibits the expression of cholesterologenic genes, whereas inactivation of <italic>Rnf145</italic> stimulates it. We show that RNF145 induces the ubiquitination of SCAP on two lysine residues that lie in proximity to COP-II binding site, thereby inhibiting its transport to Golgi and the subsequent processing of SREBP-2. These findings define an additional mechanism linking hepatic sterol levels to the reciprocal actions of the SREBP and LXR pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNF145 is an LXR target gene encoding an ER-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase</title><p>Inspired by our prior work on the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL and its role in mediating effects of the LXR pathway on lipoprotein receptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>), we endeavored to identify addition E3 ligases whose expression was responsive to LXRs. The gene encoding the putative E3 ligase RNF145 was previously identified as a potential target gene of LXR by RNA-seq analysis in a genome-wide transcriptional profiling of primary mouse hepatocytes treated with the synthetic LXR ligand, GW3965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sallam et al., 2016</xref>) and this finding was recently confirmed by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cook et al., 2017</xref>).

The combination of LXR and RXR ligands did not further induce <italic>Rnf145</italic> expression. In contrast, the stimulation of <italic>Rnf145</italic> expression by LXR ligand was lost in primary hepatocytes from LXR DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that it was dependent on the expression of LXRs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28766.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNF145 is an LXR-regulated ubiquitin E3 ligase gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression levels of <italic>Rnf145</italic> as determined by real-time PCR analysis in primary hepatocytes from wild type or LXR DKO mice treated overnight with DMSO control, GW3965 (1 μM) or the combination of GW3965 (1 μM) and LG268 (50 nM).

Another group has recently confirmed the regulation of <italic>Rnf145</italic> by LXRs, but did not observe metabolic consequences of acute knockdown of this E3 ligase in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cook et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis of the <italic>Rnf145</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice has thus revealed phenotypes associated with RNF145 deficiency not predicted by in vitro models.</p><p>Although RNF145 shares a certain degree of structural similarity to other ER membrane E3 ligases, especially TRC8, it appears to serve a very distinct function in cholesterol homeostasis. In our study, RNF145 was the only protein among the E3 ligases tested to inhibit the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and to reduce serum cholesterol levels when expressed in mouse liver. Interestingly, analysis of domain structure of RNF145 suggests the protein, like TRC8, may harbor a sterol-sensing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). This raises the possibility that, in addition to its transcriptional regulation by LXR, the protein abundance or E3 catalytic activity of RNF145 could be subject to post-transcriptional regulation in response to cellular sterol levels.</p><p><italic>Rnf145</italic> was presumed to encode a RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase based on its sequence, but its potential targets and biological function were previously unknown. In this study we identified SCAP, an important regulator of SREBP signaling, as a direct ubiquitination target of RNF145. This finding is intriguing as there have been few prior reports of post-translational modification of SCAP activity. Bornfeldt and colleagues reported that SCAP was phosphorylated by the cAMP pathway during steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shimizu-Albergine et al., 2016</xref>). We have extended this work to show that SCAP can also be ubiquitinated. In most cases, polyubiquitination of proteins with K48-linked chains often serves to target proteins for degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chau et al., 1989</xref>), whereas K63 linkages have been associated with non-proteolytic functions. Interestingly, ubiquitination of SCAP by RNF145 did not lead to degradation of SCAP in our assays. Non-proteolytic ubiquitination via K63 linkage is particularly common in membrane proteins, whose sorting and transport are frequently regulated by this mode of modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mukhopadhyay and Riezman, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, both acute suppression of RNF145 via shRNA-mediated knockdown and chronic inactivation of RNF145 by genetic deletion potentiated the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes in the liver. However, the effects of these different manipulations of RNF145 expression were only partially overlapping. For example, acute knockdown of <italic>Rnf145</italic> led to an elevation of liver cholesterol content, but this effect was not observed in the chronic knockout model. One plausible explanation for this difference is that chronic activation of SREBP signaling could lead to the activation of compensatory machinery that ameliorates sterol accumulation in the liver.</p><p>Since SCAP is a key regulator of the processing of both SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, alterations of SCAP might be expected to affect both SREBP-1 and -2 target genes. We observed suppression of both SREBP-1 and -2 target genes in response to acute RNF145 expression in the liver, but SREBP-1 targets recovered of the course of several days whereas the SREBP-2 pathway remained suppressed. In the setting of developmental deletion loss of RNF145 (<italic>Rnf145<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice), we observed selective upregulation of SREBP-2 target genes. The basis for this differential response is not yet clear, but compensatory regulatory mechanisms appear likely to be at play. It is known that the interactions of the INSIG-SCAP complex with SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are differentially sensitive to sterols, as increasing hepatic sterol content leads to decreased SREBP-2 but increased SREBP-1 pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Repa et al., 2000a</xref>). It is possible that ubiquitination of SCAP differentially affects its interactions with SREBP-1 and SREBP-2.</p><p>How does the LXR-RN145-SCAP pathway fit with the INSIG-SCAP sterol-sensing pathway for SREBP-2 regulation? It is clear from studies of knockout mice that the INSIG-SCAP pathway is the dominant regulator, especially in the liver. However, redundant mechanisms have evolved for the modulation of many important biological pathways. In fact several examples of parallel or complementary mechanisms for regulation of metabolism by SREBPs and LXR have been described. LXRs are critical for maximal transcription of SREBP-1c, and loss of hepatic LXR expression therefore compromises SREBP-1c-dependent lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeBose-Boyd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Repa et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>). LXR activation also promotes the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1c, but not SREBP-2, by altering membrane phospholipid composition though induction of <italic>Lpcat3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rong et al., 2017b</xref>). Oxysterols not only inhibit SREBP processing, but also activate LXRs. Indeed, recent work from Horton and colleagues indicates that sterol LXR ligands generated by the SREBP-2 pathway are actually required for SREBP-1c pathway activity in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rong et al., 2017a</xref>). The relative abilities of specific sterols to regulate SREBP and LXR also differ. For example, 25-hydroxycholesterol is a potent inhibitor of SREBP processing but a weak LXR agonist, whereas 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol preferentially activates LXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scotti et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, RNF145 action is likely to be more relevant when LXR activators are abundant. Unfortunately, as the recent Horton study also makes clear, the identities of the key endogenous LXR activators in liver remain to be fully determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rong et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Long-term investigations of transgenic and knockout models, performed under a variety of dietary conditions, will be needed in order to fully define the physiological role of the LXR-RNF145 pathway in metabolism. Given, that RNF145 expression is abundant in other metabolic tissues such as the intestine, it seems likely that tissue-specific loss-of-function models will also be informative. Nevertheless, the present study has delineated a previously-unrecognized mechanism for ubiquitin-mediated crosstalk between the LXR and SREBP signaling pathways and opened up new avenues for future study. It is tempting to speculate that manipulation of RNF145 activity could provide an alternative strategy for pharmacological intervention in human cholesterol metabolism. This could be especially attractive in settings in which the LDLR receptor is inactive and statins are ineffective, such as familial hypercholesterolemia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents, plasmids, and gene expression</title><p>GW3965 was synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Collins et al., 2002</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zhang and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the role of the ER-resident ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF145 as an LXR target that regulates the SREBP-SCAP pathway by adding ubiquitin chains. This study identifies a new mechanistic control on cholesterol homeostasis, which is positioned at the interface of LXR and SREBP2. Furthermore, it reveals a function of a ubiquitin ligase (Rnf145) that, up until now, did not have any identified function, and demonstrates a new post-translational modification and regulatory action on a key cholesterol sensor, Scap. The resultant model is that high cholesterol triggers LXR activation, which in turn increases transcription of RNF145 and ubiquitination of SCAP at lysines 454 and 466, resulting in a decrease in COPII-mediated SREBP-2 processing. The net result is that ubiquitin modified SCAP-SREBP is retained in the ER and SREBP activation is blunted. This is an attractive mechanism, but several issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issue that needs to be addressed is data demonstrating that endogenous SREBP-2 is altered when RNF145 is knocked down and/or over expressed. Without this information, it would be unclear whether the proposed regulatory pathway operates under physiologic conditions.</p><p>The localization studies of RNF145, while likely correct, are insufficient. Negative controls for Golgi, mito, etc. should be shown. Also, a western blot of fractions would help to show RNF145 localization (if there is a sufficient antibody).</p><p>There is no assessment of direct protein interactions between RNF145 and SCAP. Although this might be difficult to show, did the authors try this by IP and mass spec?</p><p>The gene regulations studies with overexpression and KO of RNF145 are convincing. However, it is not clear to me why this regulation of SCAP affects only SREBP-2. Do the authors have a hypothesis? Can it be tested? SCAP regulation should affect both SREBPs.</p><p>The effects of RNF145 knockdown and over expression on SREBP-2 protein expression in mice in vivo when RNF145 levels are manipulated needs to be directly analyzed.</p><p>It is somewhat surprising that the role for SCAP in regulating SREBP-1 does not appear to be mentioned here?</p><p>Harvesting mice after a 6hr fast might not be best for measuring anabolic processes (especially SREBP driven processes). Was circadian time controlled as well at time of harvest?</p><p>It would be important to document degree of over-expression and knockdown for RNF145 WT and mutant proteins in vivo in Figures 2-4. Without this information it is hard to interpret lack of mutant function and whether an increase in RNF145 mediated effects should be expected.</p><p>The major proposed effect of the RNF145 manipulation is on SREBP-2 activity, given that results for a liver specific knockout of SREBP-2 was recently published by Horton et al. (PMC5348127). A comparison of the current results with those for the SREBP-2 loss should be included in the Discussion.</p><p>To rigorously interpret the reduced ubiquitination of SCAP mutants in Figure 3C and E, the level of immunoprecipitated HSV-SCAP needs to be included to control for variations in immunoprecipitation.</p><p>Given the previous literature on Scap and its established direct regulation by cholesterol and by Insig, it is unclear where this LXR-Rnf145-SREBP2 circuit fits into the normal physiology. In the Discussion, the authors should try to unwrap this complexity and perhaps even provide an illustrated model of all the mechanisms in play.</p><p>The authors show SREBP2 target genes are altered by Rnf145 over-expression or deficiency, in vivo.

We agree that data concerning the regulation of endogenous SREBP-2 is important to support the conclusions of this study. In order to investigate the processing of endogenous SREBP-2 in response to altered levels of RNF145, we fractionated nuclei from liver tissue of mice overexpressing RNF145. We did not detect any change in the precursor form of SREBP-2 in the membrane fraction in response to RNF145. However, in the nuclear fraction, we found that the cleaved, mature SREBP-2 was clearly decreased in mice expressing RNF145 (new Figure 3I). These data are consistent with the decreased mRNA expression of SREBP-2 target genes in mice expressing RNF145.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The localization studies of RNF145, while likely correct, are insufficient. Negative controls for Golgi, mito, etc. should be shown. Also, a western blot of fractions would help to show RNF145 localization (if there is a sufficient antibody).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive suggestion. We have provided additional data to strengthen the conclusions about RNF145 location as follows. First, in addition to the ER marker calnexin shown in the original manuscript, we have performed immunofluorescence microscopy with another ER marker, Sec26. We found that RNF145 co-localized with Sec26, confirming its ER localization (new Figure 2). Second, we assessed colocalization with the mitochondria marker protein TOM20. We found that the signals for RNF145 and Tom20 were largely non-overlapping, further supporting our conclusions (new Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no assessment of direct protein interactions between RNF145 and SCAP. Although this might be difficult to show, did the authors try this by IP and mass spec?</p></disp-quote><p>We have in fact tried to detect the interaction between RNF145 and SCAP with co-immunoprecipitation assays in cells overexpressing both proteins. However, we could not detect an interaction (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). This result is not unexpected, because it is common for the interaction between an E3 ubiquitin ligase and its substrate to be dynamic, transient, and unstable, rendering it difficult to detect in such assay. As an example, one cannot detect the interaction of IDOL with the LDLR in standard IP assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The gene regulations studies with overexpression and KO of RNF145 are convincing. However, it is not clear to me why this regulation of SCAP affects only SREBP-2. Do the authors have a hypothesis? Can it be tested? SCAP regulation should affect both SREBPs.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting issue. To address this, we performed experiments to compare the time courses of RNF145 regulation of SREBP-2 versus SREBP-1 target genes. The data indicate that both SREBP-2 and SREBP-1 target genes are rapidly inhibited by RNF145 overexpression. However, the expression levels of SREBP-1 target genes rebounded, whereas the expression of SREBP-2 target genes remained suppressed (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). These findings suggest a compensatory response of SREBP-1 targets. We conclude that the observation that RNF145 primarily affects SREBP-2 target genes on day 6 is unlikely to be due to selective effects of SCAP on SREBP-2, but is rather attributable to differential compensatory responses. This issue has now been discussed in the manuscript. Further research will be needed to address the molecular basis for these responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effects of RNF145 knockdown and over expression on SREBP-2 protein expression in mice in vivo when RNF145 levels are manipulated needs to be directly analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>This same point was raised by another reviewer.

All mice in the animal experiments were housed under a 12-hour light (6am-6pm), 12-hour dark (6pm-6am) cycle. Mice in the experimental groups, as well as those in the respective control groups, were fasted at 9 am and harvested at 3pm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be important to document degree of over-expression and knockdown for RNF145 WT and mutant proteins in vivo in Figures 2-4.

The expression levels of RNF145 in the knockdown experiment are reported in Figure 7A. We have now also included the expression levels of wild-type and mutant RNF145 in overexpression experiment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major proposed effect of the RNF145 manipulation is on SREBP-2 activity, given that results for a liver specific knockout of SREBP-2 was recently published by Horton et al.

Cholesterol biosynthesis and clearance are subjected to complex regulation by multiple redundant pathways, e.g. HMCGR degradation and PCSK9 in addition to the INSIG-SCAP-SREBP2 pathway. We certainly do not dispute the established physiological role of the INSIG-SCAP-SREBP-2 pathway. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that RNF145 is an additional modifier that may contribute in certain contexts. We have included additional discussion of this issue in the manuscript as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show SREBP2 target genes are altered by Rnf145 over-expression or deficiency, in vivo.

Unfortunately, it is our understanding that the levels of tritium required for the in vivo cholesterol synthesis assay described by the Dallas group are not permitted in research laboratories in the State of California.</p></body></sub-article></article>
