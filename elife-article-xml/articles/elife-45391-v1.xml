The memory of recurring conditions could also benefit future generations; however, neuronally-encoded behavior isn’t thought to be inherited across generations. We tested the possibility that environmentally triggered modifications could allow ‘memory’ of parental experiences to be inherited. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, exposure to predatory wasps leads to inheritance of a predisposition for ethanol-rich food for five generations. Inhibition of Neuropeptide-F (NPF) activates germline caspases required for transgenerational ethanol preference. Further, inheritance of low NPF expression in specific regions of F<sub>1</sub> brains is required for the transmission of this food preference: a maternally derived <italic>NPF</italic> locus is necessary for this phenomenon, implicating a maternal epigenetic mechanism of NPF-repression. Given the conserved signaling functions of NPF and its mammalian NPY homolog in drug and alcohol disorders, these observations raise the intriguing possibility of NPY-related transgenerational effects in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>transgenerational behavior</kwd><kwd>ethanol</kwd><kwd>NPF</kwd><kwd>parasitoid wasp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP1MH110234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosco</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR0011-15-1-0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosco</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM009704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bozler</surname><given-names>Julianna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Maternally experienced environmental stress leads to multigenerational inheritance of ethanol preference and an altered rewards pathway in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To what extent is personality and behavior predetermined at birth? Philosophers and scientists alike have struggled with this question, and many have settled on the <italic>tabula rasa</italic>, or <italic>blank slate</italic> perspective. This long-standing notion posits we are without form or direction until our individual experiences shape us. Over the past decades, however, evidence has accumulated that suggests parental environment can have significant phenotypic consequences on the next generation, thus eroding this notion of a blank slate. The Dutch Hunger Winter Study was one of the first documented examples of ancestral experiences influencing subsequent generations. Children conceived in the Netherlands during the World War II blockade, and ensuing famine, had higher rates of obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heijmans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stein et al., 1975</xref>). More recent studies have found that neurological and mental health conditions also appear to have persistent impact on the next generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeshurun and Hannan, 2019</xref>). Further, risk factors for children of Holocaust survivors, such as reduced cortisol sensitivity, have been linked to methylation state of the glucocorticoid receptor promoter, and increased methylation in offspring has been associated with paternal diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yehuda et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Studied largely in the public health context, there are limited examples of environmental inheritance that can be experimentally tested. Genetic model systems are indispensable for understanding molecular mechanisms of causation. For example, male mice trained to associate fear with an odor, transmitted sensitivity of this odor to their sons. In this instance, researchers concluded that offspring possessed an increased abundance of sensory neurons specific to the same odor their fathers were trained to fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dias and Ressler, 2014</xref>). Similarly, environmental enrichment activities can ameliorate behavioral defects of mutant mice defective in long-term potentiation and memory. This behavioral rescue is heritable to the next generation through the activation of an otherwise latent p38 signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2009</xref>). Parental exposure to toxins and nutritional challenges also can change germline information, affecting growth and metabolism of future generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Skinner et al., 2013</xref>). These few examples suggest that parental environment can have a profound impact on subsequent generations. Elucidating mechanisms behind these environmentally triggered epigenetic programs is essential for a complete understanding of the foundational principles upon which biological inheritance is based.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females, when cohabitated with endoparasitoid wasps, shift to prefer ethanol food as an egglaying substrate, where ethanol food protects Drosophila larvae from wasp infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kacsoh et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila suzukii</italic> similarly shifts egglaying preference to food with atropine, giving its progeny protection against wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Poyet et al., 2017</xref>). Ethanol preference in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is linked to a decrease in Neuropeptide F (NPF) in the female brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kacsoh et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with previous work on NPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shohat-Ophir et al., 2012</xref>), and its mammalian homolog NPY that has been studied in the context of drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Landayan and Wolf, 2015</xref>). NPY modulation governs ethanol consumption in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thiele et al., 1998</xref>) and is implicated in human alcohol abuse disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mottagui-Tabar et al., 2005</xref>). This behavioral output is believed to be a consequence of the NPF/NPY role in the rewards pathway, with NPF signaling being rewarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Desai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). NPF activity is considered representative of the motivational state of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Landayan and Wolf, 2015</xref>). Several recent studies also have shown that ‘stressful’ experiences regulate NPY/NPF levels, providing a link between environmental cues and NPF/NPY signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broqua et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shohat-Ophir et al., 2012</xref>).

Previous studies have shown that flies defective in long-term memory exhibit an ethanol preference only in the presence of wasps, but not after wasp removal. The long-term memory mutant <italic>Orb2<sup>ΔQ</sup></italic> produced offspring with an ethanol preference when the embryo collection for the F<sub>1</sub> generation was conducted in the presence of wasps, but this ethanol preference was greatly reduced in offspring collected post-wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Similar results were found for the memory mutant <italic>amn<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). To further probe the role of long-term memory, a conditional knockdown of <italic>Orb2</italic> was employed: In this system, upon ingestion of the drug RU486, a RNA hairpin to <italic>Orb2</italic> is expressed in the mushroom body, a region of the brain essential for long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roman et al., 2001</xref>). These experiments provide the advantage of generating offspring with wild type long-term memory and avoid the possible developmental complications of mutant lines. Legacy flies collected during the wasp exposure and subsequently tested did exhibit an ethanol preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). However, legacy flies from the parental RU486 treatment collected post-wasp exposure did not display an ethanol preference. These data provide insight in two ways: First, functional long-term memory is not a compulsory requirement to generate ethanol-preferring offspring. Second, the mutant data suggests that intact long-term memory is not required to inherit ethanol preference. Given that ethanol preference in the absence of wasps is long-term memory dependent, this experiment reveals that the neuronal signaling is different for maintained ethanol preference in the F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed previous findings, where, following a wasp exposure, F<sub>0</sub> flies have an ethanol preference that persists for more than a week, returning to baseline after ten days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Sister cohorts of F<sub>1</sub> flies were collected at two time points along this F<sub>0</sub> ethanol preference decay; one immediately following wasp exposure (brood 1), and a second, ten days post wasp exposure (brood 2). Brood two did not display an inherited ethanol preference, suggesting that wasp exposure does not inflict a permanent change in the F<sub>0</sub> germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Again, these findings replicated in OR flies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), indicating that these observations are robust and not dependent on the context of a particular genetic background.</p><p>To explore further the role of time and dynamics of wasp exposure, multiple generations of flies were exposed to wasps. We found that inherited ethanol preference can be enhanced with successive generations of wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This trend did not repeat when nonconsecutive generations were repeatedly exposed to wasps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). This suggests that the enhancing effect observed in the successive exposures is time sensitive and may be linked to the ethanol preference of the parental flies.</p><p>Several other factors point to distinctions between the F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> ethanol preference behavior. Male F<sub>1</sub> legacy flies, mated to naïve females produced offspring (F<sub>2</sub>) with an ethanol preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Additionally, 14–16 day old F<sub>1</sub> flies displayed an ethanol preference, demonstrating that F<sub>1</sub> flies do not have an ethanol preference decay curve similar to that of the F<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transcriptional changes</title><p>Global transcriptional changes in the female head across generations were examined with RNA sequencing. Heads from the exposed legacy F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> generation were collected and normalized to their respective unexposed legacy group. These results were then compared with the F<sub>0</sub> generation, which was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozler et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of the F<sub>0</sub> data detected 98 differentially expressed transcripts (15 down and 83 up) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> heads showed very few differentially expressed transcripts, 4 and 5 transcripts respectively. Of the differentially expressed transcripts, no transcript was shared between groups. These data indicate that although wasp exposure itself results in global transcriptional changes in the female head, this observation does not hold true for the subsequent generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Germline caspases are necessary</title><p>Mid-oogenesis germline apoptosis (stage 7–8 oocytes) is triggered upon wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacsoh et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kacsoh et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kacsoh et al., 2015</xref>). However, this wasp response is not heritable like the ethanol preference behavior, and F<sub>1</sub> females do not exhibit germline apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Nevertheless, maternal germline knockdown of the effector caspases <italic>Dcp-1</italic> and <italic>drice</italic> (maternal-αtubulin-Gal4 &gt; UAS-Dcp-1[RNAi], and maternal-αtubulin-Gal4 &gt; UAS-Drice[RNAi] respectively) produce offspring without an ethanol preference, regardless of parental treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Although protein-starvation triggers germline apoptosis similar to wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), offspring from mothers with starvation-induced apoptosis do not inherit an ethanol preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This indicates that germline apoptosis in and of itself is not sufficient for inheritance of ethanol preference.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NPF and its receptor modulate germline apoptosis</title><p>NPF is known to play a role in food seeking, ethanol consumption, and numerous other reward pathways, and NPF levels decrease in the fan shaped body of female fly brains following wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kacsoh et al., 2013</xref>). Even in the presence of wasps, overexpression of NPF (NPF-Gal4 &gt;UAS NPF) inhibits ethanol preference, while in the absence of wasps, knockdown of NPF (NPF-Gal4 &gt;UAS-NPF[RNAi]) is sufficient to induce the ethanol preference behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Given this NPF modulation of ethanol preference in females, we asked whether NPF also signaled to germline cells, triggering caspases and apoptosis. Strikingly, NPF knockdown induces mid-oogenesis apoptosis in the absence of wasps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), while overexpression of NPF results in no elevation in germline apoptosis even in the presence of wasps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Similarly, NPF-receptor (NPFR) knockdown in neurons (Elav-Gal4 &gt;UAS-NPFR[RNAi]) alone leads to significantly elevated levels of apoptosis (28%, when compared to parental line controls p=6.2e<sup>−4</sup> and 1.5e<sup>−4</sup>), and this effect is enhanced with wasp exposure (61%, p=7.0e<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Taken together these observations link ethanol preference behavior and mid-oogenesis apoptosis in the F<sub>0</sub> females, where both processes are likely caused by changes in NPF and NPFR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Changes in NPF trigger transgenerational inheritance of ethanol preference</title><p>We speculated that the NPF-triggered changes in F<sub>0</sub> behavior and germline might also correlate with observed changes in offspring. For these experiments, it was critical to ensure that F<sub>1</sub> flies did not share the maternal genotype, and a crossing scheme was devised to avoid progeny with transgene expression (see Materials and method section). Legacy flies from mothers with NPF knockdown exhibit ethanol preference, even in the absence of wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Inherited ethanol preference is enhanced when the parental NPF knockdown flies are exposed to wasps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). By contrast, NPF overexpression in F<sub>0</sub> mothers exposed to wasps produced offspring lacking the ethanol preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). NPFR knockdown experiments mirror these findings: Maternal NPFR knockdown produces offspring with an ethanol preference compared to unexposed control lines; again this effect is enhanced when NPFR knockdown is paired with wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of NPF in F<sub>1</sub> flies blocks ethanol preference in the exposed F<sub>1</sub> legacy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>), raising the possibility that F<sub>1</sub> legacy flies inherit NPF in a repressed or low expression state.</p><p>We therefore hypothesized that regulation or depression of NPF might be a means of this behavioral inheritance. Global changes in NPF RNA were not detected in either the F<sub>0</sub> or F<sub>1</sub> female heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, antibody staining allowed for a region specific examination of NPF protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We note that NPF was not reduced in all regions of the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> brains, as intensity of P1 neurons was not reduced in either the F<sub>1</sub> or F<sub>2</sub> flies, although significant reduction was observed in P1 neurons of F<sub>0</sub> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>NPF protein is reduced in the fan shaped body following wasp exposure.</title><p>NPF antibody staining has a similar pattern to that of NPF-Gal4 expression in an adult female brain, inset shows a magnification of the two large P1 neurons and the fan shaped body (FSB) (<bold>A</bold>).

It is possible that apoptosis is due to a localized decrease in NPF not shared between the two generations; perhaps the apoptosis is triggered by other NPF neurons or synapses. It is also conceivable that other neural processes are altered in the flies that we did not detect, decoupling the apoptosis and ethanol preference behaviors in the later generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Maternal chromosomal inheritance of ethanol preference behavior</title><p>To determine whether maternal or paternal exposure were equally important for transgenerational inheritance of ethanol preference, wasp-exposure and mating were controlled in two separate experiments. First, mated females were exposed to wasps in the absence of male flies. Second, wasp-exposed males were mated to naïve virgin females, removing the maternal exposure as a factor. Interestingly, F<sub>1</sub> offspring from an exclusively maternal wasp exposure inherit ethanol preference, while F<sub>1</sub> offspring from an exclusively paternal exposure did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Importantly, this demonstrates a key difference between the F<sub>0</sub> males and the F<sub>1</sub> males, and it may point to an ‘activation phase’ and ‘maintenance phase’ of the epigenetic program. We have previously reported that female flies require sight to induce a behavioral response to wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kacsoh et al., 2015</xref>). In further support of the maternal contribution to the inheritance of ethanol preference, blind female flies (ninaB<sup>1</sup>; UAS-ninaB) mated to CS males did not produce offspring with an ethanol preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In the reciprocal experiment, blind fathers mated to CS females did generate ethanol-preferring offspring following a wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Maternal chromosome three is required for inherited ethanol preference.</title><p>Experiments with exclusively maternal or paternal wasp exposure demonstrate that maternal wasp exposure is necessary for ethanol preference inheritance (<bold>A</bold>). ‘Blind’ flies, with a mutation in <italic>ninaB</italic> were used to test the requirement of sight: maternal or paternal ninaB<sup>1</sup> flies (mated with wild type counterparts) were wasp exposed and offspring tested for ethanol preference (<bold>B</bold>). Schematic of compound chromosome 2; progeny inherit both copies of the chromosome from either maternal or paternal source and are identified based on chromosomal markers (<bold>C</bold>).

The relative location of NPF (red) on chromosome three and the deleted region of the deficiency stock is shown in a diagram (<bold>E</bold>). The inheritance of ethanol preference was observed in flies receiving an intact maternal NPF locus on a balancer chromosome and not in flies from receiving a maternal NPF deficiency (Df3) chromosome: Paternal inheritance of the NPF deficiency had no effect on transmission of ethanol preference (<bold>F</bold>). Asterisk indicates a p-value of &lt;0.05 from a Mann-Whitney U test. Error bars are bootstrap 95% confidence intervals.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45391-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The maternal epigenetic inheritance of ethanol preference could be conferred by chromosomal elements and/or cytoplasmic factors. If ethanol preference is inherited through a chromatin mark, then chromosome parental-origin tests should reveal a requirement for maternal chromosomal inheritance. However, if inheritance is conferred through a maternally contributed cytoplasmic factor, then passage of all chromosomes through paternal gametes should have no effect, as wasp-exposed females can still maternally deposit molecules and organelles into the oocyte. To test what maternal components may be conferring inheritance of ethanol preference we first focused on chromosomal elements using attached, or compound, chromosomes. Flies where each of the two homologs are fused cannot make haplo-chromosome gametes. Instead, they can only make gametes with one or zero copies of the fused chromosome, and therefore F<sub>1</sub> flies inherit ‘pairs’ of homologs that are entirely maternally or paternally derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In this manner, we tested each of the two major autosomes for parent-of-origin effects. Using phenotypic markers, flies were sorted as having either a maternal or paternal exclusive homolog pair and assayed for ethanol preference. Chromosome-II fusion flies had similar results when inheriting exclusively maternal or paternal Chromosome-II elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Chromosome-III fusion flies also had inheritance of ethanol preference when receiving both copies of Chromosome-III maternally. However, flies with both copies of Chromosome-III from their fathers failed to inherit an ethanol preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). This observation has at least three implications: Most importantly, this indicates that some element on Chromosome-III must be inherited from wasp-exposed mothers in order for ethanol preference behavior to be passed on to F<sub>1</sub> legacy flies. This also suggests that maternal copies of the Chromosome-X, Chromosome-II or cytoplasmic factors, if important, are not sufficient for inheritance of ethanol preference. Lastly, that oocytes giving rise to eggs with zero copies of maternal Chromosome-II still confer ethanol preference, indicates that exclusion of maternal chromosomes itself does not generally interfere with transgenerational inheritance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A maternal NPF locus is required for epigenetic inheritance</title><p>To further delineate what parts of maternally derived Chromosome-III were required for transgenerational inheritance of ethanol preference we tested chromosomes with well defined deletions. As NPF has previously been shown to control ethanol preference behavior, we speculated that the NPF locus on Chromosome-III may be a target of maternal epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shohat-Ophir et al., 2012</xref>). We also observed that F<sub>1</sub> legacy flies inherit low levels of NPF expression specifically in the fan shaped body of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>), consistent with the possibility that F<sub>1</sub> flies inherit repressed NPF expression. If the critical maternal Chromosome-III element is the NPF gene locus, then F<sub>1</sub> offspring with maternal deletions of this chromosomal region may prevent inheritance of ethanol preference, much like not having inherited any maternal copies of Chromosome-III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Using females with one Chromosome-III carrying a large deletion of the NPF gene region and one copy of wild-type NPF on a balancer Chromosome-III allowed us to ask whether an intact maternal NPF gene region was necessary for F<sub>1</sub> inheritance of ethanol preference. We found that legacy F<sub>1</sub> flies from unexposed mothers had no preference for ethanol, regardless of whether they inherited an intact NPF gene on a balancer chromosome or a chromosomal deletion of the NPF region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–f</xref>). Legacy F<sub>1</sub> flies from exposed mothers inheriting a wild-type NPF on a balancer chromosome exhibited a strong preference for ethanol, suggesting that multiple rearrangements, deletions and mutations of a balancer Chromosome-III are not sufficient to prevent ethanol preference in F<sub>1</sub> flies. By contrast, legacy F<sub>1</sub> flies from exposed mothers inheriting a Chromosome-III deletion of the NPF gene region do not inherit any preference for ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). This was true for two different Chromosome-III deletions at the NPF locus, whereas a Chromosome-III deletion that does not disrupt the NPF gene had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Paternally inherited Chromosome-III deletions were not sufficient to prevent ethanol preference in F<sub>1</sub> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>Flies were maintained at room temperature on standard cornmeal-molasses media.

This cohabitation (wasp exposure period) lasted for four days. The unexposed control consisted of the 40 female flies and 10 male flies with no wasp cohabitation. Both treatment groups were maintained at room temperature (approximately 22° C) with a 12 hr light-dark cycle for the duration of the exposure period.</p><p>At the conclusion of the exposure period, flies were separated into two cohorts. Following the removal of all wasps, one group of flies was used to propagate the next generation, while the second group was assayed for ethanol preference. Group one was placed on molasses-based embryo collection plates, supplemented with yeast paste, for egg collection. The collection period lasted for 24 hr, at which point the adult flies were removed. First instar larvae were transferred from these embryo plates to standard media vials.

Briefly, five female flies and one male fly were placed into a modified petri dish with mesh top, termed the ‘fly corral’. Two food sources were placed at opposite ends of the ‘fly corral’. Each food source consisted of 0.45 g of instant drosophila media, hydrated with 2 mL liquid. Control food was hydrated entirely with distilled water, where as ethanol food was prepared with distilled water and a final addition of 95% ethanol to the top of the prepared food, creating a food with 6% ethanol by volume. Food sources were removed and replaced after 24 hr. Figures report the egg laying behavior of the first 24 hr interval unless otherwise noted. Total number of eggs laid on each food source was counted in a blinded fashion with treatment unknown to the counter. These egg counts are reported as a proportion of eggs laid on ethanol food.

These flies were not re-exposed to wasps except in the instance of multigenerational exposure experiments. Two experiments were conducted that involved multiple generations of treatment. For the successive exposures, three groups of flies were assayed; exposed legacy (two generations), exposed legacy (one generation), and unexposed legacy. In this instance, the exposed legacy (two generations) group was generated by subjecting F<sub>1</sub> exposed legacy flies to an additional round of wasp exposures. These flies therefore had grandparental and parental wasp exposure. Exposed legacy (one generation) had parental wasp exposure only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is important to note that the parents of the ‘exposed legacy (one generation)’ flies were F<sub>1</sub> unexposed legacy flies, and therefore had the same density control and egg collection as the other groups for the multigenerational duration of the experiment.</p><p>It is critical to note that baseline ethanol preference is highly variable depending on environmental conditions. Key factors are temperature and humidity, all ethanol oviposition assays were conducted in an environmentally controlled room at 25°C, approximately 30% humidity (±10%) with overhead lighting and a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Despite these controls, baseline ethanol preference varies day-to-day. For this reason, all groups for direct comparison (used in statistical tests) were tested at the same time.</p><p>Pertaining to the nonconsecutive exposure experiments; again three groups were assayed, the exposed legacy F<sub>8</sub> (two generations), exposed legacy (one generation), and the unexposed legacy.

These flies had a six-generation gap between ancestral wasp exposures. Flies in the exposed legacy (one generation) group were produced by exposing F<sub>7</sub> unexposed legacy flies to wasps, and collecting the subsequent offspring.</p><p>Several experiment specific modifications were made to the methods described above. To parse the maternal and paternal contributions to the inheritance of ethanol preference, two experiments were conducted. First, 40 mated female flies were used for wasp exposure, in the absence of males. Ten males were added to the population for the embryo collection period. For paternal contribution, male flies were removed from the exposure chamber and mated to unexposed virgin females. To test the role of vision in maternal inheritance, blind female flies mutant in <italic>ninaB</italic>[1], were crossed to wild type (CS) males.

Deficiency lines were crossed to CS flies and the genotype of the offspring (balancer or deficiency) was inferred from phenotypic markers.</p><p>Particular modifications for the Orb2<sup>ΔQ</sup> memory-mutant experiments included an extra day of embryo collection. Following three-days of wasp exposure, flies and wasps were moved to the embryo collection chamber for the final treatment day. Eggs were collected for 24 hr in the presence of the 20 female Lh14 wasps. At the end of this period, wasps were removed and a new embryo collection plate was introduced for the second day of embryo collections. This second day of collection corresponds to the standard embryo collection timeframe in the above-described experiments. F<sub>1</sub> flies had the same genotype as the parental line.</p><p>Conditional knockdown of Orb2 was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozler et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, flies were bred to have the following transgenes: mushroom-body-Gal4(switch) &gt;UAS-Orb2[RNAi]. The Gal4(switch) driver line contains a Gal4 transcription factor that is active only in the presence of the drug RU486. Vials were prepared with instant food containing two grams of instant drosophila food, hydrated with 8 mL of either RU486 (0.22 mg/mL) in 5% methanol, or vehicle only (5% methanol). Flies and wasps were cohabitated in the prepared vials and were transferred to new food each day regardless of treatment for three days. On the fourth day, an embryo collection was performed on instant food supplemented with yeast (F<sub>1</sub> collection during wasp exposure). The fifth day the wasps were removed and a second egg lay was conducted (F<sub>1</sub> collection post wasp exposure). F1 legacy flies were transferred and raised on cornmeal media, without the addition of vehicle or RU486 and therefore should have fully intact mushroom body and long-term memory capacity.</p><p>Sibling cohorts were collected to assess the longevity of the germline change. ‘Brood 1’ flies were collected in the 24 hr immediately following the removal of the wasps. ‘Brood 2’ flies were collected from the same parents, 10 days after the termination of the wasp exposure.</p><p>Finally, diet restriction experiments had two groups: one with high protein and the other low protein diets.

Olympus DP71 camera. For each experiment, wasp exposure and staining were performed on two separate occasions and final data was pooled after checking for the absence of a batch effect. A minimum of 10 brains were dissected for each treatment replicate as well as RFP-histone co-staining brains. Final quantified sample size range from 15 to 20 (normalized brains), due to sample loss or damage. Imaged samples were only excluded if clear damage or trauma (from dissection or staining process) was evident in the region of interest (FSB or P1 nuerons).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>RNA quantification</title><p>Mature female flies were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and collected in 15 mL conical tubes, either immediately following the treatment period (F<sub>0</sub>), or 3–5 days post eclosion (F<sub>1</sub>-F<sub>2</sub>).

Indeed, it would appear that animals are bound to their ancestors in a way that some might consider Lamarckian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galloway and Etterson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman and Sultan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">J. Marshall and Uller, 2007</xref>). The ethanol preference we observed in this study is heritable but modifiable and responsive to environmental cues, as it can be enhanced or decay across generations. Our data suggest that there is an ultimate return to pre-wasp exposed state by the F<sub>6</sub> generation. If there are lingering effects of wasp exposure beyond this generation, they are not detected in our assays. Not only does the ethanol preference behavior revert to unexposed levels, but we also detected no priming or enhancement effect in the F<sub>8</sub> generation following a second wasp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>).</p><p>Inheritance of ethanol preference requires several factors: We found that the initiation of the epigenetic program in the founding generation (F<sub>0</sub>) is maternal in nature, and requires effector caspases in the female germline. However, continuation of the epigenetic program throughout the remaining generations is distinctly different in several ways. Both male and female progeny (F<sub>1</sub>) are able to pass on ethanol preference to their offspring. Although, it is possible that the F<sub>1</sub> generation requires germline effector caspases for the transmission of the ethanol preference, the lack of female germline apoptosis and paternal ability to confer this behavior points to a caspase-independent maintenance mechanism. A further, and curious, distinction between the generations is in the ethanol preference itself, as it persists in the F<sub>1</sub> generation, rather than mirroring the F<sub>0</sub> generation and decaying over 10 days.</p><p>The unifying mechanism behind many of these observations is the central role of NPF signaling in this system. Governing both germline apoptosis and the ethanol preference neuronal NPF signaling modulates the ethanol preference as well as its inheritance. Maternal imprinting of the NPF locus or nearby regions has a dominant effect, leading to the possibility that the F<sub>1</sub> paternal locus is imprinted in trans. It is tempting to speculate on the role of canonical imprinting mechanisms, such as the Polycomb repressive complexes, although a molecular apparatus remains elusive for the time being (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for fly-wasp mediated ethanol preference.</title><p>A female fly encounters a wasp, based in part on visual signals, leading to a cascade of physiological and behavioral changes. One of the initiating factors following wasp exposure is the depression of NPF in the female fly brain. Under normal conditions, NPF inhibits the ethanol preference behavior and caspase mediated germline apoptosis. Therefore, the reduction of NPF triggers ethanol preference and germline caspases. Activation of the germline effector caspases Dcp-1 and Drice in turn reduced egg laying and participates in the epigenetic reprograming of the female germline and chromosome 3. The epigenetic program is passed to both sexes of the F<sub>1</sub> generation, in that both male and female progeny can pass on the ethanol preference. Further, legacy F<sub>1</sub> female flies inherit depressed NPF in the fan shaped body (FSB), which drives the ethanol preference behavior. Model legend: Measured behavioral outputs are in blue, the dashed lines indicate a speculative or unknown mechanism of action.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45391-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This multi-generational ethanol preference underscores the importance of environmental conditions on behavior and physiology. Numerous studies have indicated that we may need to look beyond the individual, to longer lasting and persistent effects of environmental stresses. This study illustrates the complexity of inheritance and highlights the incredible resiliency and plasticity of organisms to adapt to changing circumstance. Of particular interest is the conserved functions of NPF and its mammalian homolog NPY in modulating a variety of human behaviors, including stress responses and alcohol abuse disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thorsell and Mathé, 2017</xref>). Our studies raise the intriguing possibility that NPF/NPY and their receptors could be subject to epigenetically modified states determined by parental environment and experience. Germline inheritance of epigenetically modified neuro-signaling networks, such as those modulated by NPF/NPY, could be one mechanism through which transgenerational inheritance of behavioral predispositions persist, as reported here for Drosophila. It should be noted that such epigenetically inherited behaviors that persist for multiple generations could be interpreted as dominant familial genetic traits. If mammalian NPY is inherited in epigenetically modified states, then this would require a fundamental change in how we study and view inheritance of NPY-related behavioral disorders and possible effects of parental environment.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.015</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical tests and p-values relating to main text figures.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-45391-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.016</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Oregon R experimental data.</title><p>Key experiments were replicated using the additional wild-type strain OreR. ‘Corresponding Figure’ indicates the experiment that was replicated: A listing of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> therefore indicates that the experimental conditions for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> were duplicated using OreR flies.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-45391-supp2-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.017</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Canton S day-2 data; mean(s) and p-value(s).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-45391-supp3-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.018</object-id><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>RNA sequencing results from female fly heads across generations.</title><p>The beta value (b) is approximately analogous to the natural log fold change of the transcript, and the q-value is the measure of significance.

They illustrate the disparate ways (experience and development) of exhibiting the preference, and show how the same experience-acquired information (preference) can be manifest through different substrates (neural, germline). The most important findings are that mechanistic requirements of preference alteration within a generation are partially overlapping, yet distinct from the mechanistic requirements of preference inheritance across a generation; they also demonstrate the requirement of a maternal 3rd chromosome in inheritance across generation, implicating imprinting of the NPF gene.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important distinction between preference in exposed flies vs. their progeny is the requirement of memory. The experiment in Figure 1C suggests some degree of dissociation between long term memory of preference and transgenerational inheritance of preference, as long-term memory impairment partially but not completely impairs the transgenerational inheritance. Is this partial transgenerational deficit because the parent can't hang onto the memory, a situation akin to &quot;brood 2&quot; (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) where the parental memory is gone, or does the lack of Orb2 in the mutant impair the inheritance of the offspring (not an unreasonable idea given the role of Orb2 in development)? To distinguish these two models, the authors should do one of several things: impair memory by expressing Orb2 RNAi in the adult mushroom body and assessing the inheritance, or use another memory mutant, or use some other acute MB manipulation.</p><p>2) The authors need to clean the paper up and provide the necessary info in figure legends for the reader to understand what they have done.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, “wasp” should be “wasps”.</p><p>2) There are many grammatical errors throughout the paper e.g. “treated to” ethanol.</p><p>3) Do flies exposed to wasps prefer to <italic>consume</italic> EtOH as well? Are they more likely to be addicted? Just curious.</p><p>4) Figure 1C is not completely clear. The flies assayed are ALL F<sub>1</sub>? Perhaps label this better?</p><p>5) Are the dcp1 and drice knockdowns in ovary only? What is the driver? This information should be added to the legend and text.</p><p>6) Figure 3.</p><p>A)Transgene controls (UAS-NPF and UAS-NPRRNAi) are missing.</p><p>B) There is no label for what the bars are in Figure 3B/C.</p><p>C) Why are only some of the pairwise comparisons shown? Are all others N.S.? If so, this should be stated.</p><p>D) It’s not completely clear in the text if the legacy RNAi flies also have both the driver and RNAi? I would guess not (were they mated to WT males? other males?) but you should state this explicitly in the Results.</p><p>E) Where is NPFR knocked down? Brain? Ovary? Is there NPF in ovary/reproductive tract?</p><p>F) Where is NPF overexpressed? Brain? Ovary?</p><p>7) In general, the figure legends are not well written. They lack a huge amount of detail that the reader needs to evaluate the data, e.g. N, the type of statistical tests used, labels, genotypes etc.</p><p>8) Figure 4. What was the ROI for the quantification? Cell body? Neuropil? Maybe show on the image?</p><p>9) Figure 5. Blind? How? It actually matters – many 'visual' mutations are pleiotropic. A genotype/condition must be given in either text or legend.</p><p>10) Results, subsection “Maternal Chromosomal Inheritance of Ethanol Preference Behavior”: there actually are paternally-inherited regulator RNAs, at least in mice, so this is not completely clear cut.</p><p>11) Figure 3E heading says overexpression and knockdown but the data shows only knock down.</p><p>12) Transcriptomic data: clarify whether changes are relative to unexposed flies of the same generations or relative to exposed flies of different generations. For example, are the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> changes relative to F<sub>0</sub> exposed flies or F<sub>1</sub>/F<sub>2</sub> unexposed flies? At what point do transcriptomes change?</p><p>13) Figure 1—figure supplement 3A suggests female genotype is not important for transgenerational inheritance, while Figure 5 deals with the necessity of female genotype. This needs better clarification.</p><p>There are also a few things that the authors might consider adding/discussing as they would enhance the story; these are not required revisions.</p><p>1) A supplementary figure describing the compound autosome technique for chromosomal localization would be helpful, given the general lack of familiarity with this genetic technique of the vast majority of researchers.</p><p>2) NPF is involved in two very distinct events: acute and relatively unstable preference for ethanol in F<sub>0</sub> and relatively long-lived and stable preference for 5 generations. It is unclear how the NPF signals are regulated differently to accommodate these disparate time scales, considering there is no change in mRNA level in F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub>, although protein level is reduced. One plausible explanation would be tissue-specific transcriptional repression. It would be important to do RNA in situ for NPF both in the F<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> head, particularly focusing on fan shaped body and P1 neurons. Also, is NPF expressed in the germ cells, and what is happening at the NPF genomic locus in germline cells of exposed females?</p><p>3) What is the significance of the difference in NPF levels in P1 neurons in F<sub>0</sub> vs F<sub>1</sub>? Would increase in NPF in P1 abolish experience-dependent changes in preference for F<sub>0</sub> while leaving all its progenies' preferences intact?</p><p>4) What happens to ethanol preference memory when NPF is deleted on maternal chromosome. These flies can't inherit preference-but can they learn it themselves? Also. what happens to their fan body and P1 NPF levels?</p><p>5) How specific are transgenerational effects generally? For example, does starvation-mediated apoptosis lead to transgenerational alteration in starvation responses? The fact that starvation leads to apoptosis but not ethanol preference is interesting in light of this theme.</p><p>6) What mediates the &quot;decay&quot; of this memory in varying time scales?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45391.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important distinction between preference in exposed flies vs. their progeny is the requirement of memory.

Are they more likely to be addicted? Just curious.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting question. Although we have previously shown that adult flies continue to eat following wasp exposure, we do not have any direct data to conclusively show that they preferentially consume ethanol. Unfortunately, to investigate this question one would need a very different experimental design and specialized apparatus. While this is an area of interest for us, we feel that it is better suited to a future investigation and outside of the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>4) Figure 1C is not completely clear. The flies assayed are ALL F<sub>1</sub>? Perhaps label this better?</italic></p><p>We apologize for the confusion.

Importantly, both transgene lines behaved similarly to wild type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) There is no label for what the bars are in Figure 3B/C.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight; we have added labeling for the violin plots in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Why are only some of the pairwise comparisons shown? Are all others N.S.? If so, this should be stated.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of all of our statistical tests are shown in the figure. Statistical tests that yielded a non-significant result are indicated with “N.S” in the figure itself. The chosen statistical comparisons were selected to test specific hypotheses: First, comparisons between treatment group of the same genotype were performed to assay for changes due to wasp exposure. Secondly, we explored the role of NPF signaling, manipulated through genetic means without wasp exposure. Therefore, the unexposed NPF-manipulation group was compared to the unexposed background line. We restricted our statistical tests so that they were hypothesis driven, and although significance for all pairwise comparisons could be calculated we feel that all pairwise comparisons would not be informative and may be statistically inappropriate. For instance, conducting all pairwise tests would necessitate the comparison between samples differing both in treatment and genotype, resulting in a meaningless significance value (in other words, comparisons that are not considering the carefully paired control group for each experimental treatment and/or genotype).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) It’s not completely clear in the text if the legacy RNAi flies also have both the driver and RNAi? I would guess not (were they mated to WT males? other males?) but you should state this explicitly in the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct, the legacy RNAi flies are not carrying both transgenes, as this would have greatly complicated the interpretation of our results. We have stated this more clearly in the Results section: “For these experiments, it was critical to ensure that F<sub>1</sub> flies did not share the maternal genotype, and a crossing scheme was devised to avoid progeny with transgene expression (see Materials and methods section).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) Where is NPFR knocked down? Brain? Ovary? Is there NPF in ovary/reproductive tract?</p></disp-quote><p>The driver line used in the NPF-R experiments was a pan-neuronal driver (ElavGal4).

Brain? Ovary?</italic></p><p>The genetic NPF experiments (overexpression and knockdown) used the NPF-Gal4 line.

Rather, we were trying to disentangle the ‘chromatin mark’ mechanism from the ‘cytoplasmic’ mechanism; which could be either maternal or paternal, however in this case we have shown that males do not participate in the initial transmission of the epigenetic program. We have removed the reference to small RNAs in an attempt to clarify our thinking in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 3E heading says overexpression and knockdown but the data shows only knock down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for finding this error; the figure has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Transcriptomic data: clarify whether changes are relative to unexposed flies of the same generations or relative to exposed flies of different generations.

Alternatively, Figure 5 explores the initial transmission from the F<sub>0</sub> generation (exposed group) to the legacy flies. We believe these data point to differences between the initial transmission (following wasp exposure) and the transmission of the behavior between legacy flies (i.e. activation vs. maintenance). We have attempted to clarify this in several ways. First, we have more clearly labeled the graphs in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A. We have also added text to the Results section to better highlight this difference: “Interestingly, F<sub>1</sub> offspring from an exclusively maternal wasp exposure inherit ethanol preference, while F<sub>1</sub> offspring from an exclusively paternal exposure did not (Figure 5A). Importantly, this demonstrates a key difference between the F<sub>0</sub> males and the F<sub>1</sub> males, and may point to an ‘activation phase’ and ‘maintenance phase’ of the epigenetic program.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
