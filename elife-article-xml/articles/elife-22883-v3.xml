throughout the region. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg<sup>2+</sup>. SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3’UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22883.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22883.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>RNA structure</kwd><kwd>Turnip crinkle virus</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>RNA virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1411836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>My-Tra</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Megan Y L</given-names></name><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Xuefeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI117882-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le</surname><given-names>My-Tra</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kasprzak</surname><given-names>Wojciech K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Taejin</given-names></name><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Bruce A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32AI051967-06A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Megan Y L</given-names></name><name><surname>Simon</surname><given-names>Anne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Folding and unfolding pathways are described for a ribosome-binding 3' cap-independent translation enhancer at the center of a conformational rearrangement that is implicated in the transition from translation to replication of an RNA virus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNAs play key roles in a variety of cellular functions due to their capacity to fold into a number of functionally competent and dynamic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balvay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dethoff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serganov and Patel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simon and Miller, 2013</xref>). Driven by conformational plasticity, RNA elements can assume alternative forms required for different biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dethoff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simon and Gehrke, 2009</xref>). For example, riboswitches in untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial genes can cycle between active and inactive conformations through binding to small metabolites, thereby inhibiting translation or attenuating transcription of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soukup and Soukup, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkler and Breaker, 2003</xref>). Regulatory RNA elements found in viral RNA genomes can also switch between mutually exclusive conformations to regulate incompatible processes such as translation and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Souza and Summers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simon and Gehrke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stammler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stupina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To gain insights into how RNAs transition between alternative conformations, we have studied the folding and unfolding pathways of a 3’ cap-independent translation enhancer (3’CITE) found in the 3´ UTR of TCV. TCV is a positive-strand RNA virus (genus Carmovirus, family <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>) with a single uncapped, non-poly(A) genome of 4053 nt encoding five proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The TCV 3’UTR contains at least five hairpins (H4, H4a, H4b, H5 and Pr) and three critical H-type pseudoknots (Ψ<sub>1</sub>, Ψ<sub>2</sub>, Ψ<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simon and Miller, 2013</xref>), a type of RNA structure that forms when loop residues in a hairpin pair with nearby residues to create a second stem-loop. The coaxially stacked double pseudoknots H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> and H4b/Ψ<sub>2</sub> in conjunction with hairpin H5 fold into a T-shaped structure known as the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>). The TSS serves as a 3’CITE by binding to 80S ribosomes at the P-site through an interaction with the 60S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stupina et al., 2008</xref>). Substituting the entire TSS or H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>/H4b with the analogous regions from the related <italic>Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus</italic> (CCFV) led to viral genomic (g)RNA accumulation that was similar to or greater than wild-type (wt) TCV. In contrast, TCV gRNA accumulated poorly when individual hairpins or other combinations of CCFV hairpins and pseudoknots were substituted. These results suggested that all, or a specific subset of hairpins and pseudoknots, function as a structural domain or subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its function in translation, the TSS serves as a scaffold for multiple interactions with surrounding elements extending into the upstream coat protein ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2012</xref>). The TSS region is also important for replication of a small, non-translated satellite RNA (satC) that contains two TCV-derived 3’ regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2006b</xref>). The basal TSS conformation did not change substantially when bound to ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stupina et al., 2011</xref>), but was significantly altered when a 3’UTR fragment (252 nt) or a 320 nt 3’ terminal fragment was bound by the RdRp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2012</xref>). Prominent changes included enhanced flexibility of: (1) hairpin H3 in the coat protein ORF and adjacent upstream sequences; (2) the terminal loop of hairpin H4 located just upstream of the TSS; and (3) H4a/Ψ<sub>3 </sub>in the TSS. Sequences with reduced flexibility included: (1) the 5’ side of the basal stem of H5; (2) the sequence between H4b and H5; and (3) the A-rich sequence upstream of H4a. These findings suggested that a mechanism exists for the TSS to transition between conformations required for translation and replication after a threshold level of RdRp was available.</p><p>Since the TSS serves as a central hub for interactions with elements throughout the 3’UTR, it seemed likely that disrupting the TSS might trigger the widespread conformational switch that occurs in vitro upon addition of RdRp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2012</xref>). For this current report, optical tweezers (OT), a type of single molecule force spectroscopy, and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD) were used to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the TSS. Our results indicate that the TSS follows an unexpected folding pathway that can be reproduced by SMD for conditions that exclude Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, H4b unfolded first, followed by H5 and then H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, which had been predicted to be the least stable element. In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, H4b unfolded cooperatively with H5, followed by H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was not required to form H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> but enhanced the stability of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> and all other elements tested. Disrupting H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> eliminated the cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5, and H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> was unstable in the absence of the upstream stretch of five adenylates. Mutating two of these adenylates or adjacent downstream residues eliminated specific binding of RdRp to a 3’UTR fragment, suggesting a model where binding of the RdRp to the five adenylate region disrupts H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, leading to loss of interaction between H5 and H4b and promoting the conformational switch that interrupts translation and promotes replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The TSS includes the upstream adjacent adenylates</title><p>A 118 nt fragment (positions 3899 to 4016 in TCV gRNA), which includes the TSS along with 15 upstream residues and eight downstream residues, was previously used to analyze ribosome binding to the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stupina et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A truncated version of this fragment that terminated precisely at the two pseudoknots and omitted the upstream five adenylates (5A) (positions 11 to 110 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was subsequently used to determine the TSS structure by NMR and SAXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuo et al., 2010</xref>). This shorter fragment was not initially stable, and stability required addition of two guanylates at the 5’ end that extended Ψ<sub>3</sub> and disrupted hairpin H4a. One possibility for why the TSS-only fragment was not stable was the omission of the upstream 5A, as it was subsequently shown that adjacent doublet mutations in 5A (positions 8 and 9 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or single mutations disrupting Ψ<sub>3</sub> caused identical enhancements in flexibility of residues throughout the 5A/H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> region as assayed by in-line structure probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). For this reason, the longer 118 nt fragment (TSS118) that included 5A was used for most of the current study.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22883.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Secondary structure, tertiary interactions, and new structural model of the TSS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of TSS118 near the 3’ end of TCV gRNA.

To define the importance of individual adenylates, each was mutated to one or two other nucleotides and mutant gRNAs were assayed for accumulation in protoplasts. Alterations of individual adenylates reduced gRNA levels to between 23% and 55% of wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since A<sub>11</sub> could potentially participate in Ψ<sub>3</sub> by pairing with U<sub>26</sub>, it was altered to both a cytidylate, which should disrupt the base-pair and a guanylate, which might maintain the pairing with a G:U pair. A<sub>11</sub>toC was among the least detrimental of the single nucleotide alterations, reducing accumulation by 45% whereas A<sub>11</sub>toG reduced accumulation by 65%. These results suggest that the reduction in gRNA accumulation due to alteration of A<sub>11</sub> is not connected to its involvement (if any) with Ψ<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>The flexibilities of TSS residues were previously investigated by in-line structure probing using extended fragments that included upstream and downstream hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). To insure that the structure of the TSS within TSS118 was consistent with its structure in longer fragments, TSS118 was 3’ end labelled and the RNA subjected to in-line structure probing. In-line probing reports on the flexibility of individual residues since nucleophilic attack of a ribose 2’OH on the backbone phosphate and ensuing backbone cleavage requires residue flexibility to assume in-line geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soukup and Breaker, 1999</xref>).

Ψ<sub>3</sub>, which was originally identified by generating several different compensatory mutations in full-length gRNA, was not resolved by in-line probing of TSS118, similar to what was previously found when subjecting larger fragments to in-line probing and full-length gRNA to SHAPE structure probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chattopadhyay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To examine the effect of altering 5A on the structure of the TSS, all five adenylates in TSS118 were converted to uridylates (construct 5AtoU) and the mutant RNA fragment subjected to in-line probing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C and D</xref>, and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, selected residues in the 5A region and surrounding sequences of 5AtoU, as well as residues within the H4a loop, displayed flexibility differences of &gt;25% compared with wt. This result is similar to what was found previously when only two adenylates (positions 8 and 9) were mutated within a larger fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, several residues within the large symmetrical loop of H5 and one residue in the linker between H4b and H5 displayed &gt;25% altered flexibility in 5AtoU. Although the 5U in 5AtoU could potentially pair with the five adenylates within the H5 internal loop, only one of the H5 adenylates displayed reduced flexibility, suggesting that structural changes in H5 were not due to an inadvertent pairing opportunity. These results suggest that the TSS forms a similar structure within TSS118 as previously found in longer fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>) and that 5A appears to be involved in stabilizing the structure of (at least) H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Revised structure model of the TCV TSS</title><p>The previously published TSS structure model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>) corresponded to positions A<sub>11</sub> through G<sub>110</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. New structure modeling was performed using the previous model as a starting point and extending it at the 5’ and 3’ ends to include the entire TSS118 fragment.

To investigate this further, we examined the unfolding/folding behavior and stability (i.e., resistance to pulling force) of single TSS molecules under the induction of force using optical tweezers, a form of single molecule force spectroscopy that can be used to investigate conformational changes in single RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenleaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liphardt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ritchie and Woodside, 2015</xref>). TSS118 was joined to 500-nt RNA handles at its 5’ and 3’ ends, which were made double stranded after hybridization to complementary DNA tagged with biotin or digoxigenin (DIG). The biotin DNA handle was attached to a streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead and the DIG DNA handle was attached to an anti-digoxigenin (AD)-coated bead. The streptavidin bead was held in place by a micropipette fixed on a glass chamber and the AD bead was held in an optical trap, which allowed the location of the focal point of the trap to be moved by a piezo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By moving the focal point of the optical trap mechanically, the AD bead was pulled away from the pipette, allowing the connected single-stranded TSS to unfold. Alternatively, the AD bead in the optical trap was repositioned proximal to the pipette, leading to TSS refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tinoco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vilfan et al., 2007</xref>).

In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the TSS was expected to unfold with three transitions, corresponding to hairpins H4a, H4b, and H5.

The predicted ΔG’s (in kcals/mole) were H4a: −6.9; H4b: −9.2; H5: −21.8; H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>: −8.3; and H4b/Ψ<sub>2</sub>: −11.0. Since the dynamic unfolding behaviors of RNA hairpins and pseudoknots also depend on kinetic barriers to unfolding force, rip assignments required using complementary oligonucleotides to disrupt individual hairpins. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, disrupting H4b eliminated rip 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and disrupting H5 eliminated rip 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, disrupting either H4b or H5 resulted in FECs without rip 1*. Rips 2 and 3 were present when H4b was disrupted and rips 1 and 3 were present when H5 was disrupted. These results strongly suggest: (1) in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, rip 1 and rip 2 correspond to unfolding of H4b and H5, respectively; and (2) in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, H4b and H5 unfold cooperatively as rip 1*, which may also contain Ψ<sub>2</sub> that connects H4b with the base of H5.</p><p>Addition of the oligonucleotide complementary to H4a had no effect on any rips in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that the oligonucleotide was blocked from annealing. Therefore, point mutations were introduced into H4a, generating fragment mH4a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When mH4a was subjected to OT in the presence and absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, rip 3 (the most stable transition) was eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that the unusual stability of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> (compared to its predicted value) in the presence or absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> precluded oligonucleotide annealing. Since rip 3 was present in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), Mg<sup>2+</sup> was not required for H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> folding, similar to the ribosome recoding pseudoknot of <italic>Barley western yellows virus</italic> (BWYV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grilley et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, in Mg<sup>2+</sup>, disruption of H4a by point mutations caused rip 1* to apparently be replaced with rips 1 and 2, suggesting that H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> is required for cooperative association of H4b and H5. These results indicate that: (1) in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the TSS unfolds in the order of H4b, H5, and H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>; (2) in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the unfolding order is the H4b/H5 complex, followed by H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>; (3) the H4b/H5 complex depends on the presence of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>; and (4) H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> is substantially more stable than predicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effect of 5A on the stability of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub></title><p>When a fragment containing only H4a (positions 13 to 37) was subjected to OT, no rips were observed, suggesting that H4a is not stable in the absence of Ψ<sub>3</sub> and/or other surrounding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if the enhanced stability of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> requires additional elements such as 5A, the folding pathway of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> was determined using a truncated fragment (positions 1 to 37) composed of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, 5A, and additional flanking residues on both ends to reduce disturbance of handles on H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left).

Since the TSS is a central hub for RNA interactions within the 3’UTR and upstream sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>), it seemed possible that the widespread conformational rearrangement could be triggered by RdRp binding to, and disrupting, the TSS. One consequence of RdRp binding to fragments containing the TSS was reduced flexibility of 5A residues, suggesting that this motif might be a target site for the RdRp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). To assess the validity of this hypothesis, RdRp filter binding assays were conducted on an extended 3’ fragment (positions 3858 to 4053) to determine if binding dissociation constants were affected by mutations in 5A. Recombinant TCV RdRp bound to the wt fragment with a K<sub>d</sub> = 2.6 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, RdRp did not exhibit specific one-site binding to MDV (midivariant RNA, 221 nt), which is a non-template satellite RNA associated with Qβ bacteriophage. A two nucleotide mutation in 5A at positions 8 and 9 (A to U; m74) prevented specific binding of RdRp to the fragment. Loss of specific binding supports our previous finding that m74 also reduced RdRp-directed in vitro transcription of this fragment by 3.6-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>). The ability of the RdRp to continue transcribing low levels of complementary strands in the absence of 5A binding is likely due to the presence of the 3’ terminal Pr hairpin, which in combination with upstream hairpin H4 can promote a low level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Simon, 2006</xref>). Since mutations in 5A disrupt the stability of H4a/Ψ<sub>3,</sub> RNA fragments were also examined that contained mutations in Ψ<sub>3</sub>. Two individual alterations in the loop of H4a (m27, m41) improved binding of the RdRp to the template by 2.5-fold. In contrast, mutations in the two partner residues of m27 and m41 located just downstream of 5A (m26, m40) eliminated one-site binding to the template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that disruption of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> (which occurs when the adenylates are altered in m74) is not the proximal cause of the loss of specific RdRp binding, but rather the RdRp may be specifically interacting with 5A and adjacent downstream sequences, and this interaction may be facilitated by the absence of Ψ<sub>3</sub>.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22883.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>RdRp binding to mutant and wt 3’ fragments in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence and structure of the fragment used for RdRp binding.

However, before simulations can provide fine grain information, the simulated order of unfolding of the TSS helices must agree with the experimental OT results. OT is performed at pulling speeds several orders of magnitude slower than practical for simulations as the total time required to perform one simulation at the experimental pulling speed would be prohibitive. Therefore, we first assessed the impact of pulling speed over a range of two orders of magnitude on the unfolding results simulated with SMD.</p><p>Explicit solvent MD simulations of nucleic acids are considered to be more accurate as all water/salt atoms around the solute are accounted for in the simulation. However, the full extension of the TSS model required a solvent box approximately 700 Å long, resulting in a large simulated system (up-to ~480,000 atoms) and limiting the slowest pulling speed to 0.05 Å/ps, (requiring three weeks to run one simulation). Therefore, computationally much faster MD method using the implicit solvent Generalized Born model (GB) was employed to explore an order of magnitude slower simulated pulling speeds. Both types of simulations used explicit or simulated concentration of monovalent Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> counter ions. Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were not included as their initial placement is unknown. Furthermore, the additional level of complexity introduced by the SMD protocol would not allow sufficient time for the potential coordinating effects of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to be established, and thus their inclusion was deemed insufficiently accurate for use in this study. Therefore, all simulation results are based on NaCl and are compared to experimental conditions in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Initial explicit solvent SMD simulations performed on fragment TSS108 (C<sub>5</sub> through A<sub>112</sub>) at pulling speeds of 1.0 Å/ps and 0.5 Å/ps terminated with H5 and H4b helices remaining partly base-paired, indicating that the RNA chain was ahead of its approximate equilibrium state. Full base-pair opening for the extension of the 5’ and 3’ ends could be achieved by an additional equilibration step at the end of these simulations (i.e., with holding to maintain the extension, but without pulling) or by slowing down the pulling speed to 0.1 Å/ps. These runs yielded an unfolding sequence different from the experimental results, even at the 0.05 Å/ps pulling speed (resulting in the longest practical explicit solvent simulation times). The key observation based on these simulations was that pulling speed affected the orientation of helices relative to the direction of pulling (refer to Appendix 1 for more details). This led to formation of new, transient tertiary interactions by H4b after all hydrogen bonds between H4b and Ψ<sub>2</sub> opened, increasing the resistance to pulling and impacting the order of TSS unfolding. These observations are consistent with results of OT unfolding of a pseudoknot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Introducing a pause in the pulling simulation immediately after Ψ<sub>2</sub> opening to re-equilibrate the system and avoid transient H4b interactions changed the order of TSS opening events to H4b opening first, followed by H5 and then H4a.</p><p>Given this qualitative agreement between the experimental and computational results from the ‘paused’ (locally slowed-down) simulation in explicit solvent, we switched to the implicit solvent (GB) protocol that allowed for an order of magnitude decrease in pulling speed. Three variants of the GB protocol (see Materials and methods) yielded generally consistent results. In 70% to 100% of the SMD simulations (depending on the parameters used) with a constant pulling speed of 0.01 Å/ps, H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> opened last, and in 40% to 50% of all the simulations, the full sequence of events was in agreement with the experimental OT results (H4b opening first, H5 second, and H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> last). Implicit solvent simulations at 0.005 Å/ps pulling speed yielded comparable results. The demonstrated applicability of the implicit solvent MD to optical tweezers pulling simulations of highly structureed nucleic acids is novel in its own right, and worth noting as such.</p><p>Consistent with the slowest ‘paused’ explicit solvent simulation (refer to Appendix 1 for more details), implicit solvent simulations that followed the OT order of TSS unfolding showed none or only minor transient interactions between the H4b terminal loop and other tertiary interaction partners. In addition, as was the case in the majority of the explicit solvent simulations at higher pulling speeds, in the few implicit solvent simulations in which H4b opened last, strong tertiary interactions occurred between H4b loop residues and other nucleotides after the original base pairs involved in Ψ<sub>2</sub> opened. The resulting tertiary structure was oriented approximately in parallel with the direction of pulling. Even though topologically it is a pseudoknot, at the 5’ end of the opening H4b was pulled through a loop (as if it was a true knot in 3D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) that increased the number of opportunistic interactions and resulted in more resistance to pulling than H4a/Ψ<sub>3,</sub> which is not ‘knotted'. In the absence of a new pseudoknot replacing the Ψ<sub>2</sub> interactions with H4b, H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> offered the most resistance to pulling and opened last. The parallel orientation of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> with respect to the direction of pulling increased its stability beyond what the free energy calculations (Mfold and McGenus) would suggest, again, in agreement with another OT pseudoknot unfolding study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A sample SMD-simulated sequence of unfolding events is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> the Supplementary SMD trajectory movie. Unfolding begins with C<sub>6</sub> and 5A adenylates losing their initial triple interactions with Ψ<sub>3</sub> and the extended pairing in Ψ<sub>3</sub> (A<sub>11</sub>). Next, the stacking between H4a and H4b is opened (C<sub>34</sub> and G<sub>35</sub> are pulled apart). This is followed by Ψ<sub>2</sub> opening and H4b pivoting toward vertical (perpendicular to the direction of pulling) without forming any transitional tertiary interactions and unwinding fully as the first of the major TCV TSS helices. In the next stage, the entire H5 opens. Finally, H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> opens with H4a helix pairs opening from the 5’−3’ end toward the hairpin. The illustrated simulation exhibited separation of H4b from pseudoknot Ψ<sub>2</sub> without any transient tertiary interactions, and this clean transition appears to contribute to the clearly defined sequence of events. The individual helices open sequentially, one at a time, rather than partially and in parallel (concurrently). The latter scenario was observed in many SMD simulations at all pulling speeds, although it was most pronounced at faster pulling speeds. For example, rather than ‘waiting for its turn’ to begin opening, H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> opens its 5’−3’ base pair or pairs and pauses as weaker base pairs open elsewhere in the TCV. Gradual changes in the hydrogen-bond interactions that maintain the pseudoknotted 3D topology of the 5’ end are similar to the case of H4b ‘slipping’ (see Appendix 1). This scenario could explain the difference between estimated (13.6 nm) and experimental (9.1 ± 1.5 nm) contour length of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, which would not include any ‘premature’ base pair openings. In multiple runs, we observed partial opening of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> foreshortening the contour length, first to 11.2 nm (C<sub>12</sub> through G<sub>30</sub> or G<sub>13</sub> through C<sub>31</sub>), and then to 9.4 nm (U<sub>15</sub> through G<sub>30</sub>), after which the remaining structure opened rapidly. Similar foreshortening of the contour length was also observed for the opening simulations of H5. A pause in unzipping is predicted for the substructure between C<sub>71</sub> and G<sub>100</sub>, followed by a rapid opening of H5, especially across the non-canonical pairing in its large internal loop. The contour length of this substructure is 17.7 nm, well within the experimental measurements. The experimentally obtained FECs indicate rapid opening (unzipping) of entire helices, one helix at a time, while our simulations include both scenarios and suggest that partial helix opening may play a role in the process.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22883.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>TCV TSS pulling simulation with Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD).</title><p>Snapshots from an implicit solvent SMD simulations with a pulling speed of 0.005 Å/ps for the TSS fragment between C<sub>5</sub> (labeled as 5´) and A<sub>112</sub> (labeled as 3´), inclusively.

How the TSS along with at least 300 nt at the 3’ end of the TCV gRNA convert between the two conformations is unknown.

Based on Mfold-predicted ΔG’s for the three TSS hairpins, H4a (in the absence of the pseudoknot) should be the least stable element (ΔG = −6.9 kcal/mol), followed by H4b (ΔG = −9.2 kcal/mol), and H5 (ΔG = −21.8 kcal/mol).

In addition to H5 being substantially less stable than expected, it also has a smaller than expected contour length (15 to 17 nm compared with the expected length of 25 nm). Reduced stability of H5 may reflect instability of its lower stem (~5.9 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormack et al., 2008</xref>), which might unfold at a lower force range, as suggested by SMD.

In the presence of upstream sequences, including 5A and sequences that form Ψ<sub>3</sub>, H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> is the most stable TSS element and folding is independent of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). High force was also necessary to unfold the human telomerase pseudoknot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Stability of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> was dependent upon association with the upstream 5A as the element did not form when the adenylates were converted to uridylates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). 5AtoU also caused structural changes in H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), similar to what was previously found when just A<sub>9</sub> and A<sub>10</sub> were altered, or Ψ<sub>3</sub> was disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>).

It is therefore possible that interactions other than those proposed in the model and that are stable in MD simulations form between 5A and H4a/Ψ<sub>3.</sub> H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> may also be highly stable due to its coaxially stacked stems, creating base-pair planes perpendicular to the direction of the unfolding force requiring high force to overcome resistance of multiple base pairs at the same time. Computer simulations of the unfolding pathway support this hypothesis by indicating that the structural resistance to pulling is increased for the TSS pseudoknotted motifs beyond their free energy predictions by their orientation parallel (and nearly co-axial) to the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS’s ‘T’ shape). Of the two pseudoknots, the long-distance Ψ<sub>2</sub> is weaker than the short-distance H-type Ψ<sub>3</sub> and opens first, exposing H4b and H5, now oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction of pulling. H4b is shorter (and has a higher predicted free energy) and opens first, followed by H5. Beside the alignment between the motif axis and the direction of pulling, akin to ‘static resistance', we observed what could be labeled as ‘kinetic resistance’ based on the formation of transient (‘slipping’) tertiary interaction between the helices oriented (initially or transiently) along the direction of pulling and in the proximity of other (downstream or upstream) parts of the TSS. For example, Ψ<sub>3</sub> opens gradually and, as the entire Ψ<sub>3</sub> motif opens, transient tertiary interactions outside of the original Ψ<sub>3</sub> base pairs maintain the pseudoknot topology, thus increasing the resistance to pulling and delaying the opening of H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Mg<sup>2+</sup> is important for stabilizing RNA tertiary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Draper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woodson, 2005</xref>) and has been shown to be a key factor in controlling conformational switches in a number of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choudhary and Sigel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reining et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suddala et al., 2015</xref>). In Mg<sup>2+</sup>, cooperative association of H5 and H4b led to a new large rip in the FECs (1*), which unfolded at a lower force than H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, stability of all three TSS transitions increased by 2 to 3 pN over the force required in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and fully stretched H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> (13 nm) was only obtained in Mg<sup>2+</sup> at high force (≥18 pN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results imply that Mg<sup>2+</sup> increases the kinetic barriers to the mechanical unfolding of the TSS elements. In addition, the hopping behavior of H4b and H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> in Mg<sup>2+</sup> changed abruptly between folded and unfolded states between 15.5 and 16 pN for H4b and H5, and between 17.5 pN and 18 pN for H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased the stability of these elements and suppressed their unfolding. This could explain the refolding dynamics of the TSS, which experimentally assumes a conformation compatible with ribosome binding in the absence of the RdRp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>There are several lines of evidence indicating that H4b and H5 associate as a unit within the TSS in Mg<sup>2+</sup>. For example, disruption of either H4b or H5 led to the disappearance of rip 1* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and D</xref>), indicating cooperative unfolding of the two hairpins. Furthermore, disruption of H5 caused H4b to unfold at 11.5 pN in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which was the same force level as in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, alterations that disrupted H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> (mH4a) converted rip 1* to the individual H4b and H5 rips (rips 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that H4b/H5 cooperation required H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>. A connection between H5 and H4b was also previously suggested by finding second-site mutations in H4b when the lower bulge loop of H5 was mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCormack, 2007</xref>). Although FECs indicated that H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> was stable in the absence of H5 or H4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), disruption of H5 eliminated the normal H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> transition in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that RdRp binding to a 3’ fragment is disrupted when 5A is mutated suggests a new model for how the TSS and surrounding sequences transition between alternative conformations. We propose that a basal conformation of the 3’UTR contains the TSS, which serves as a 3’CITE for translation of the RdRp from the gRNA template when the gRNA first enters a cell. When a threshold level of RdRp has been synthesized, the RdRp binds to the 5A region that includes Ψ<sub>3</sub> residues, disrupting H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub>, which consequently disrupts the interaction between H4b and H5. Since the TSS serves as a central hub for interactions throughout the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>), disruption of the TSS would likely cause additional structural changes leading to the alternative conformation of the RNA that is found upon RdRp binding. Although this site of RdRp binding is distal to the 3’end where transcription commences, previous results indicated that a structural connection exists between the 3’ terminus and the 5A region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>), which could place the 3’ end in a position to be accessed by the 5A-bound RdRp. We believe that this scenario provides an intriguing blueprint for possible RNA structural transitions in other viruses with 3' translation elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In-line structure probing</title><p>DNA fragments coding for wt and mutant TSS were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using plasmids containing the full-length TCV gRNA.

Steered Molecular Dynamics simulations in explicit solvent</title><p>The TCV TSS model including all 118 nucleotides of TSS118 was subjected to explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in Amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Case et al., 2014</xref>) which indicated a potential placement of the 5’ end residues A7 through A10 in the major groove of Ψ<sub>3</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>A 108 nt-long fragment of the above model between nucleotides C5 and A112 (inclusively) was selected for the Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulations because it contained all the TCV TSS stable interactions and limited the maximum single-stranded chain extension length, an important factor in explicit solvent simulations (see below). Heavy atoms C5:O5’ and A112:O3’ were selected to determine the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS ‘T’) and the distance restraint parameters were applied to them.</p><p>OT experiments were performed at pulling speeds that were orders of magnitude slower than our simulations (due to the total computer time required to perform one simulation). Thus, we first assessed the impact of several SMD pulling speeds on the predicted unfolding sequence of events and ran the pulling simulations at the slowest speeds practicable with the explicit, then implicit solvent approaches (see Materials and Methods). The most important finding was that pulling speed influences the orientation of helical regions relative to the direction of pulling, most importantly that of H4b, which, in turn, leads to formation of transient tertiary interactions that change the resistance to pulling and alter the sequence of opening of the key domains in the TSS model. Chen at al. previously observed that the parallel orientation of the helices of a pseudoknot to the direction of pulling (i.e. perpendicular orientation of their base pairs) increases the resistance because a shear force is applied to stems, rather than the unzipping force that opens base pairs one at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Our results are consistent with theirs, but additionally indicate that the speed of pulling influences transient orientations of structural elements.</p><p>The explicit solvent SMD simulations at a pulling speed of 1.0 Å/ps terminated with helices H5 and H4b remaining partly base-paired, while the 5’ and 3’ ends of the modeled TCV TSS fragment were pulled 700 Å apart, at which distance the chain should be totally single-stranded. The backbone of the single-stranded (opened) portion of the molecule was overstretched, with the straight-line P-to-P atom distances up to 33% above those found in a relaxed A-form helix. An additional 1.0 ns MD simulation was conducted with the ends held 700 Å apart to let the remaining base pairs open and the forces measured at the end to relax to zero. This was a clear indication that a pulling simulation at this speed keeps the TCV RNA away from (ahead of) its equilibrium state. At 0.5 Å/ps pulling speed, the simulation ended with less base paired structure, and only at 0.1 Å/ps pulling speed were all TSS base pairs open at the end of the simulation.</p><p>Pulling speed also had an impact on the dynamics of the opening of individual TCV TSS helices. At the highest pulling speed, the H5 helix pivoted toward the horizontal (the direction of pulling), formed tertiary interactions with upstream nucleotides and acted like a pseudoknot, additionally increasing resistance to pulling. At all pulling speeds, after the opening of Ψ<sub>2</sub>, H4b remained horizontally oriented and formed new transient tertiary interactions between the adenylates in the H4b terminal loop and the uridylates in the single-stranded linker between H4b and H5. These interactions formed a transient H-type pseudoknot and also increased the resistance to pulling. Such transient tertiary interactions that replaced the original pseudoknots or added new ones influenced the order of TSS unfolding, with H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> opening first, in disagreement with the experimental OT results. Of the seven simulations run at 0.1 Å/ps (two with higher NaCl salt concentrations that did not change the results) only one run yielded a sequence of unfolding events ending with H4a/Ψ<sub>3</sub> opening last. These simulations clearly showed dependence of the sequence of unfolding events on pulling speed and pointed to the need for longer SMD runs simulating slower pulling speed. The longest practical explicit solvent simulation times with the pulling speed of 0.05 Å/ps did not improve the results.</p><p>To evaluate if slowing down the critical step without slowing the entire simulation would bring the simulations into agreement with the experimental data, a pause in the pulling was introduced after the opening of Ψ<sub>2</sub>, i.e. when the last hydrogen bond was lost between the H4b and Ψ<sub>2</sub>. Following this event, the SMD was run for one ns with the TCV TSS ends held at a constant distance (~215 Å) to re-equilibrate the system. During this time, the H4b terminal loop adenylates maintained H-bond contacts with the H4b-H5 linker uridylates, but changed their horizontal orientation to point further away (closer to the perpendicular) from the direction of pulling. After the pause in pulling, the SMD at 0.05 Å/ps was resumed until the full extension of 700 Å was reached. Even though the re-equilibration pause did not lead to immediate full separation of the H4b from the rest of the structure and did not prevent the transient alternative tertiary interaction from forming, the global sequence of structure opening events changed to H4b opening first, H5 opening second and H4a opening last. This was in general agreement with the experimental OT data.</p><p>The explicit solvent results indicated the crucial role of the H4b separation from the rest of TSS after Ψ<sub>2</sub> opening on the sequence of the TSS unfolding events and dependence of this result on the simulated pulling speed. In order to perform slower pulling speed simulations (i.e. longer SMD runs) in reasonable real time, we employed the implicit solvent simulations (Generalized Born model implemented in Amber). These confirmed the crucial role of the pulling speed in bringing the simulation and experimental results into agreement, and they are described in detail in the text of this study.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22883.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sonenberg</surname><given-names>Nahum</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff6"><institution>McGill University</institution>, <country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Previous studies have shown that the TSS structure functions as a unit. That its structure is not altered by binding to ribosomes however, it was significantly altered upon RdRp binding. The authors used optical tweezers to understand how this structure folds and unfolds in order to understand how the conformational change is triggered. This work adds to our understanding of the structure of the TSS beyond what has already been published since it includes sequences adjacent that have been shown to be important ribosome binding and stability of the structure. Here the authors show that stem-loop H4A and pseudoknot (PK) 3 form a stable structure that drives cooperative folding of the rest of the TSS structure. Formation of this structure is dependent on 5 upstream adenosines, which can function as a type of molecular switch by either stabilizing the TSS or upon RDRP binding destabilize it. This manuscript provides convincing data for order of folding and unfolding of the TSS using several different approaches. However, this becomes a bit tedious and redundant. The authors also include supporting data on gRNA TCV transcript levels accumulated with mutations in the 5A region and K<sub>d</sub> measurements of TSS mutants with RDRP that supports their conclusion for how these structures are important for the translation/replication switch. Overall, this is a very nice study that adds to our understanding of the mechanisms for how the TSS structure serves as a molecular switch between translation and replication of the viral RNA. While the detailed study sheds light on the behavior of the TSS, however, more general insights into the folding properties of structured RNAs also come out of this work. This manuscript is generally interesting and would be a good addition to the papers published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “5A is implicated in RdRp binding to a 3’ end fragment”, first paragraph: It seems surprising that a loss of binding of the RDRP to m74 would only reduce transcription by 3.6-fold.

Furthermore, the RdRp may be recognizing the adenylates within the structure of H4a/Psi3, which would be very different from accessibility to unpaired (or breathing) nucleotides that are required for the oligonucleotide.</p></body></sub-article></article>
