also expressed de novo in mucus secreting cancer lines. siRNA-mediated knockdown of 7343 human gene products in a human colonic cancer goblet cell line (HT29-18N2) revealed new proteins, including a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated channel TRPM5, for MUC5AC secretion. TRPM5 was required for PMA and ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC from the post-Golgi secretory granules. Stable knockdown of TRPM5 reduced a TRPM5-like current and ATP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion depended strongly on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which was markedly reduced in TRPM5 knockdown cells. The difference in ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry between control and TRPM5 knockdown cells was abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and by inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). Accordingly, MUC5AC secretion was reduced by inhibition of NCX. Thus TRPM5 activation by ATP couples TRPM5-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> entry to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via an NCX to trigger MUC5AC secretion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00658.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00658.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00658.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Goblet cells are specialized cells that produce proteins called mucins, which combine with water, salt and other proteins to form mucus, the slippery fluid that protects the respiratory and digestive tracts from bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. However, a defect in the production of one particular type of mucin—Mucin 5AC—can result in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Crohn’s disease, so there is a clear need to understand the production of mucus in detail.</p><p>Before they are secreted, the mucins are packaged inside granules in the goblet cells. When a certain extracellular signal arrives at a goblet cell, these granules move through the cell, fuse with the cell membrane and release the mucins, which then expand their volume by a factor of up to a 1000. Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) have a critical role in the signal that leads to the secretion of mucins, but many details about the signalling and secretion processes are poorly understood.</p><p>Now, Mitrovic et al. have used genetic methods to study 7343 gene products in goblet cells derived from a human colon. They identified 16 new proteins that are involved in the secretion of Mucin 5AC, including a channel protein called TRPM5. This protein is activated when the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> inside the cell increases, and its activation allows sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions to enter the cells. These intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ions are then exchanged for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from outside the cell, and these Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions then couple to the molecular machinery that is responsible for the secretion of the mucins.</p><p>By using electrophysiological and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging approaches, Mitrovic et al. were able to visualize and measure TRPM5-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> currents and the subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by the cells, and confirmed that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were responsible for stimulating the secretion of mucins. The next step is to determine how the other 15 genes are involved in mucin secretion and, in the longer term, explore how these insights might be translated into treatments for cystic fibrosis and other conditions associated with defective mucus secretion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mucus is secreted by specialized cells that line the respiratory and digestive tract to protect against pathogens and other forms of cellular abuse. The secretion of mucus is therefore essential for the normal physiology of the wet mucosal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubin, 2010</xref>). The secretory or gel-forming mucin, Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is one of the major components of the mucus in the airways, and hyper- or hyposecretion of this component is a hallmark of a number of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose and Voynow, 2006</xref>). MUC5AC is also expressed at low levels in the gastrointestinal tract and, surprisingly, expressed de novo, and upregulated in colonic mucus from cancer and ulcerative colitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrd and Bresalier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bu et al., 2010</xref>). MUC5AC is also expressed in response to parasitic infection, which is probably its additional physiological role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hasnain et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The gel-forming mucins are giant filamentous glycoproteins that are synthesized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and exported to the Golgi complex where they undergo extensive modification in their oligosaccharide chains. The apparent molecular weight of the gel-forming MUC5AC increases from 500 kD of monomeric unglycosylated ER form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Klinken et al., 1998</xref>) to 2.2 MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thornton et al., 1996</xref>) by glycosylation and oligomerization during its transit through the Golgi apparatus to a secreted form that reaches up to 40 MD in apparent molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheehan et al., 2000</xref>). The heavily glycosylated mucins are sorted, condensed and packed into mucin-secreting granules (MSG). The MSG fuse with the plasma membrane, in a signal-dependent manner, and the condensed mucins expand their volume up to 1000-fold upon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verdugo, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The signaling events that lead to mucin secretion in the airways involve mainly, but not exclusively, P2Y purinergic and muscarinic receptor activation by ATP and acetylcholine, respectively. The subsequent generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) activate protein kinase-C (PKC) and cause the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER to promote mucus secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bou-Hanna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abdullah et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertrand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ehre et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The progress to date on the components involved in the trafficking of mucins has recently been thoroughly reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Dickey, 2008</xref>). Basically, mucins are packed (somehow) into MSG at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). MSGs undergo fusion to produce mature condensed granules that are stored in the cytoplasm. The cortical actin acts as a barrier that is reorganized in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent reaction through the input of PKCε-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wollman and Meyer, 2012</xref>). The passage of mature MSGs through the actin network also requires Myo II and V. The proteins involved in the docking, priming and fusion of the MSGs are reported to include: Rab3d, Rab27, Hsc70, cysteine string protein, Synaptotagmin 2, Munc13-2, Munc13-4, Munc18b, Syntaxin 2, 3, 11, and VAMP8. However, it is not known how many of these proteins are directly involved in mucin secretion and for some, such as the MARCKS protein, the mechanism is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stumpo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arbuzova et al., 2002</xref>). The exact myosin involved in the trafficking of MSGs across the actin barrier remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rose et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jerdeva et al., 2005</xref>). More importantly, the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling and the components involved in this signaling cascade are not fully characterized.</p><p>To date, transport studies have been based on truncated GFP-mucin variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perez-Vilar et al., 2005</xref>) and time-consuming techniques such as combinations of density gradient centrifugation and agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sheehan et al., 2004</xref>). It has therefore been difficult to identify new components involved in mucin secretion and to decipher their mechanism of action.</p><p>As stated above, human cancer cells and cells from patients with ulcerative colitis express and secrete MUC5AC. These cells and cell lines therefore provide a convenient means to address the mechanism MUC5AC secretion. We have established a quantitative assay to measure the secretion of MUC5AC from a human goblet cell line. The procedure was used to screen 7343 human gene products and we describe here the identification and involvement of transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5) channel in MUC5AC secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An assay for mucin secretion</title><p>The human colonic adenocarcinoma cells HT29-18N2 (N2) differentiate to goblet cells upon starvation in protein-free medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>), which increases the production of MUC5AC. Immunofluorescence analysis of accumulated MUC5AC in secretory granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) shows the differences between starved and nonstarved cells. The increase in protein production of MUC5AC after starvation was confirmed by dot-blotting cell lysates of nonstarved and starved N2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Quantification of the dot blot revealed a 45-fold increase of MUC5AC protein levels in starved N2 cells compared to nonstarved N2 cells. Our findings with the dot-blot procedure confirm the lack of MUC5AC production in Hela cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). MUC5AC mRNA analysis by quantitative real-time PCR also confirmed increased MUC5AC mRNA levels in starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the plasma membrane requires an external signal, which results in the production of DAG and the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores. To induce mucin secretion from the starved N2 cells, we used the DAG mimic, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Starved goblet cells were treated for 2 hr with 2 µM PMA to induce MUC5AC secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The extracellular MUC5AC expands and coats the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We took advantage of the stickiness of the mucin film to quantitate secreted MUC5AC. After 2 hr incubation with PMA, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde followed by incubation with an anti-MUC5AC antibody and a secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody to visualize secreted mucin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To detect the intracellular pool of MUC5AC after PMA-induced release, the cells were washed extensively to remove secreted MUC5AC and then fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00658.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mucin synthesis and secretion from goblet cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nonstarved and starved N2 cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody (green).

We tested the effect of perturbing actin cytoskeleton and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on the PMA-dependent secretion of MUC5AC from starved N2 cells. Starved N2 cells were treated with the drugs that affect actin filaments: Latrunculin A and Jasplakinolide. The cells were also treated with the membrane-permeant Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM. The extracellular levels of MUC5AC were measured with the chemiluminescence-based assay. Depolymerization of actin filaments by Latrunculin A had no effect on PMA-stimulated MUC5AC secretion, while BAPTA-AM and the actin-stabilizing agent Jasplakinolide severely affected MUC5AC secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The inhibitory effect of hyperstabilized actin filaments (by Jasplakinolide treatment) on MUC5AC secretion reveals that actin filaments likely act as a barrier to prevent premature fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the cell surface. Inhibition of MUC5AC secretion by BAPTA-AM treatment confirms the known requirement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the events leading to mucin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PMA induces the release of post-Golgi pool of MUC5AC</title><p>Befreldin A (BFA) is known to inhibit cargo export from the ER and causes Golgi membranes to fuse with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989</xref>). To test whether BFA affected the formation of secretory granules, starved N2 cells were incubated with or without 2 µg/ml BFA. After 45 min cells were fixed and examined by immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-MUC5AC antibody and an antibody to the Golgi membrane specific GRASP65 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The dispersal of GRASP65 with BFA treatment shows that our experimental conditions are effective in disrupting the Golgi apparatus. However, MUC5AC staining was unperturbed by BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We then tested the effect of BFA on the constitutive secretion of newly synthesized proteins. Starved N2 cells were labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and then chased in cold methionine-containing medium in the presence of BFA. Analysis of the medium revealed that BFA severely inhibited the secretion of newly synthesized proteins from the starved N2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether BFA affected the regulated secretion of the secretory granules, starved N2 cells were pretreated with 2 µg/ml BFA for 15 min and then treated with 2 µM PMA for 2 hr in the presence of BFA. MUC5AC was then measured in the extracellular medium by chemiluminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The results reveal that BFA treatment does not affect PMA-dependent MUC5AC secretion under the experimental conditions. Therefore, in our assay, we only measure the secretion of MUC5AC contained in the post-Golgi secretory carriers. This measurement is independent of MUC5AC synthesis, export from the ER to the late Golgi, and its sorting and packing into the secretory granules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of <underline>p</underline>roteins <underline>i</underline>nvolved in <underline>m</underline>ucin <underline>s</underline>ecretion (PIMS)</title><p>N2 cells were starved for 6 days and transfected with siRNA oligos against each of the selected 7343 genes.

whether any of the proteins identified in our screening assay have a role in constitutive secretion of cargoes that do not enter the secretory granules. This could reveal the convergent function of PIMS in conventional and regulated protein secretion. N2 cells were starved for 6 days, transfected with siRNAs for the individual PIMS, and 3 days later were washed in methionine free medium for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine containing medium for 15 min and subsequently cultured in methionine containing medium. After 3 hr, the medium was collected and the cells were lysed and measured for total <sup>35</sup>S-methionine incorporation. As a control, BFA was added (at 2 µg/ml) during the whole pulse-chase procedure to inhibit general protein secretion. The secreted medium was normalized to the incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine, corresponding volumes precipitated by TCA, and analysis done by SDS-PAGE. We did not detect any obvious changes in the secreted polypeptide pool in starved N2 cells depleted of the individual PIMS compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for the regulated secretion of MUC5AC and TRPM5 channel activity is known to affect cell membrane potential, we reasoned that the role of TRPM5 in MUC5AC secretion is to modulate secretagogue-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We tested whether extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was required for ATP-dependent MUC5AC secretion. N2 cells were differentiated by starvation and washed; MUC5AC secretion was then induced in either Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium for 30 min in the presence of 100 μM ATP. N2 cells cultured without Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular medium did not secrete MUC5AC upon exposure to ATP.

To further investigate the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this process we measured MUC5AC secretion in cells treated with thapsigargin, which promotes the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2010</xref>) or in response to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin, which mainly facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cytoplasm from the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). MUC5AC secretion by ionomycin was significantly higher than treatment with thapsigargin, however, these reagents were less effective, compared with ATP, in eliciting MUC5AC secretion.

Surprisingly, human pathologies such as colon cancer and ulcerative colitis produce MUC5AC de novo, which is then secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bu et al., 2010</xref>). In general, mucins are produced as a result of cell differentiation and the newly synthesized mucins, like all other secretory proteins, are transported from the ER to the Golgi membranes. In the Golgi complex, the secreted forms of mucins are sorted and packed into granules; the granules mature, fuse with the plasma membrane, predominantly by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cells, and release their content. In cells of the gastro-intestinal lining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bou-Hanna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcelo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertrand et al., 2004</xref>) and eye conjunctiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>) influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> participates in the release of mucins from the secretory granules. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent events are also essential for the release of mucins from the respiratory tract, however, the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is unclear. The general view is that mucin secretion in the airways is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores and independent of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kemp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Dickey, 2008</xref>). However, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for mucin secretion from cholinergic stimulated swine airway submucosal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2011</xref>) as well as by cold and menthol stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The involvement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mucin secretion is therefore likely to be cell type, signal, and mucin specific. The synthesis and secretion of mucins is controlled by a large number of distinct stimuli, which poses additional problems for the identification of proteins involved in mucin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forstner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanley and Phillips, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Epple et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Slomiany and Slomiany, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Overproduction and hyper secretion of gel-forming mucins is linked to COPD, asthma and cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose and Voynow, 2006</xref>) and to the protection of the gut lining against infection and growth of a number of parasites including <italic>H. pylori</italic>.

Our antibody-based detection of secreted MUC5AC is relatively easy, quantitative, and highly accurate. It involves starvation-induced synthesis of MUC5AC, which is then released by treating the cells with PMA. It has recently been shown that secretion of total polymeric mucins from goblet-cell metaplastic human bronchial epithelial cultures is inhibited by BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okada et al., 2010</xref>). This likely represents secretion of newly synthesized mucin that is secreted at some basal rate. PMA mediated MUC5AC secretion reported here is unaffected by BFA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).

These proteins (PIMS) are expressed in the goblet cells and not required for general protein secretion. PIMS include ion channels and regulatory molecules (SUR1, GRIK4 and TRPM5); GPCR’s (CCR9, GRP62 and CCBP2), transcription regulators (SREBF1, ATF6 and NFKB1), Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein (KCNIP3), GTPase activator for Rap1 that controls actin dynamics (SIPA1), actin binding protein (PLEK2), scaffold for the MAPK (TAB1), MAPK15, and a protein involved in melanosome biogenesis (SILV).</p><p>Actin dynamics are important for MUC5AC secretion and, as shown here, stablization of actin filaments but not their depolymerization inhibited MUC5AC secretion. The identification of SIPA1 and PLEK2 could help reveal the components involved in regulating Rap1, which is known to regulate actin filament dynamics in the events leading to the docking/fusion of the MUC5AC-containing secretory granules. SILV is required for the early stages of melanosome biogenesis, and goblet cells express SILV but are not known to make melanosomes. It is reasonable to propose that SILV performs an analogous function in the maturation of MUC5AC granules in the goblet cells. TAB1 and MAPK15 are likely involved in stress response-mediated synthesis and secretion of MUC5AC. The cell-surface ion channels and the GPCRs are likely involved in signaling events that lead to the secretion of MUC5AC. Future analysis of these proteins will help reveal their significance in MUC5AC homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TRPM5 and its role in regulated MUC5AC secretion</title><p>TRPM5 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated monovalent cation selective channel that responds to warm temperature and a key component of the bitter, sweet and umami taste-receptor signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Bitter, sweet and umami tastants are detected by GPCRs that signal through gustducin and PLCβ2 in order to produce DAG and IP<sub>3</sub>.

A large number of GPCRs regulate taste signaling, but it is not clear which family members are expressed in the goblet cells and linked to the activation of TRPM5. We have found several GPCRs and ion channels that are expressed in the goblet cells and required for MUC5AC secretion. It would be important to test whether any of these GPCRs are directly linked to TRPM5 activation in the goblet cells and therefore in the events leading MUC5AC secretion.</p><p>The activity of TRPM5, and its close relative TRPM4, has been shown to couple intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to changes in membrane potential and either an activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels favouring further Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Earley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colsoul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uchida and Tominaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shah et al., 2012</xref>) or a reduction in the electrochemical gradient for store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vennekens et al., 2007</xref>). Our results provide evidence for a novel link between TRPM5 activity and the control of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via the functional coupling of TRPM5 and NCX. NCX at the plasma membrane is one of the major means to extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup> (in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup>) from the cells. However, this transporter can also function in the reverse mode to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry when intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases. Significant Na<sup>+</sup> entry is expected to occur during activation of TRPM5 following IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Sodium entering through the TRPM5 would accumulate intracellularly, thus promoting NCX to act in the reverse mode and permit Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in exchange for the exiting Na<sup>+</sup>. Such a coupling between endogenous NCX and heterologously expressed Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable TRPC3 channel has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosker et al., 2004</xref>). However, our observation describes for the first time the functional coupling between endogenous TRPM5 channel and NCX, and its physiological relevance in the context of mucin secretion.</p><p>In conclusion, we have devised a quantitative assay to measure mucin secretion in human goblet cell lines. Our findings have revealed new components that control MUC5AC secretion. We have described the mechanism linking the activity of TRPM5 with the modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and MUC5AC secretion from the differentiated colonic goblet cell line. It is important now to test the expression of PIMS in cells of the respiratory and gastric lining; their involvement in secretion of MUC5AC and other secreted mucins such as MUC2 to understand the mechanisms of mucin homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) except BAPTA-AM (Biomol International, Farmingdale, NY), Latrunculin A (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA), Jasplakinolide (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and KB-R7943 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), anti-MUC5AC antibody clone 45M1 (Neomarkers, Waltham, MA), anti-GRASP65 C-20 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX), anti-actin antibody clone AC-15 from Sigma-Aldrich anti-β tubulin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich and anti-HA antibody clone 3f10 from Roche (Basel, Switzerland).

The mucin coat is a key protective element of respiratory and intestinal epithelia, and the signals and mechanisms that underlie its synthesis and maintenance are poorly understood. Hence, the work addresses a very important question. Genetic requirements for Mucin 5AC secretion were elucidated with a siRNA-based screen of PMA-induced N2 cells that detects secreted MUC5AC. The reviewers agreed that the screen and hit validation process was rigorously executed, so there is high confidence that the PIMS gene products are key players in Muc5AC secretion, at least in the context of the N2 cell line. The second half of the manuscript uses electrophysiological experiments to address the specific role of one of the hits, TRPM5, in MUC5AC secretion. The results make a convincing case that TRPM5 plays a key and previously unappreciated role in NCX-mediated calcium influx (reverse mode) required for MUC5AC secretion, at least in a colonic cell line. However, the reviewers had three substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The Introduction and Discussion focused on the pathophysiological importance of airway mucin secretion, but you used a different cell type (colonic epithelium) from the one of interest (airway epithelium; Rossi AH, Am J Physiol 2007, 292:92; Kemp PA, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2004, 31:446). Importantly, MUC5AC is not normally produced by colonic epithelium, so the physiological relevance of the results is unclear. This problem was compounded by a number of misstatements. For example, it is stated that secreted mucins “coat the plasma membranes”, which is true in the gut but not in the airway. In addition, “mucus coats epithelial surfaces exposed to the external environment”: this is true (with the caveat above) of some surfaces such as the airways, gut and, genitourinary tract, but not the skin. It is also stated that MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major components of mucus, which is true of the airway but not the gut, as noted above. A small point is that Muc5ac should be used for the non-human protein and MUC5AC for the human, rather than Muc5AC for both.</p><p>2) There has been extensive work on airway epithelia showing that calcium entry from outside the cell is not important acutely in secretion (Bahra P, Brit J Pharmacol 2004, 143:91; Scott CE, Am J Physiol 1998, 275:C285; Rossi AH, J Physiol 2004. 559:555). Since the authors speculate that reduced calcium entry following TRPM5 knockdown is a major mechanism, what is the relevance of the findings to airway epithelium? Are mechanisms of calcium handling different between colonic and airway epithelium?</p><p>The reviewers strongly recommend that these two concerns should be remedied by extensive rewriting. The Introduction and Discussion should include a careful analysis of potential differences between colonic and airway epithelial cells, and their mechanisms of induction of mucin secretion.</p><p>3) The reviewers were concerned that the 2hr PMA stimulation could introduce artifacts. How was this time determined and is it the optimal time for induction? Is it in the linear response range? Since mucin is present in intracellular vesicles that are primed for release, a much shorter activation time would seem more physiological. A 2hr treatment would allow new protein translation and possibly transcription. Therefore, have the authors examined whether addition of cycloheximide, or even APC, during PMA treatment affects mucin release? These experiments might provide insight into the role of the hits identified in the screen (are they expressed constitutively for mucin release, or expressed upon physiological stimulation?).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00658.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We want to state at the outset that we have used a colonic cancer cell line because it is easy to culture, easy to transfect, and it expresses and secretes MUC5AC upon differentiation. Altogether, this is a useful approach to identify proteins required for the secretion of MUC5AC. This is similar, in principle, to the use of HeLa cells and VSV-G to study the components of the secretory pathway. And like the HeLa cells-VSV-G combination, HT29-18N2 cells-MUC5AC has revealed a number of new components in the PMA mediated, post-Golgi release of MUC5AC from the secretory granules. BFA does not affect the secretion of MUC5AC in our experimental conditions, which gives us the confidence to rule out the effects of PIMS on the synthesis, export, and sorting of MUC5AC at the TGN. The next obvious step is to test the involvement of PIMS in primary cultures of the cells that line the respiratory and digestive tract. We expect many of the PIMS will be required for the secretion of MUC5AC and other secreted mucins in other cell types, but there could be noticeable differences as well. Some of these proteins might have cell type specific isoforms or closely related proteins that function at the same step in other cell types. Identification of PIMS will help address many of these issues as we learn more about the system.</p><p><italic>1) The Introduction and Discussion focused on the pathophysiological importance of airway mucin secretion, but you used a different cell type (colonic epithelium) from the one of interest (airway epithelium; Rossi AH, Am J Physiol 2007, 292:92; Kemp PA, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2004, 31:446).

A small point is that Muc5ac should be used for the non-human protein and MUC5AC for the human, rather than Muc5AC for both</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this issue by rewriting the Abstract and Introduction. The Abstract now begins with the following statement: “Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is secreted by goblet cells of the respiratory tract and, surprisingly, also expressed de novo in mucus secreting cancer lines.”</p><p>The Introduction begins with the following statements: “Mucus is secreted by specialized cells that line the respiratory and digestive tract to protect against pathogens and other forms of cellular abuse. The secretion of mucus is therefore essential for the normal physiology of the wet mucosal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rubin, 2010</xref>). The secretory or gel-forming mucin Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is one of the major components of the mucus in the airways, and hyper- or hyposecretion of this component is a hallmark of a number of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose and Voynow, 2006</xref>). MUC5AC is also expressed at low levels in the gastrointestinal tract and, surprisingly, expressed de novo, and upregulated in colonic mucus from cancer and ulcerative colitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrd and Bresalier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bu et al., 2010</xref>).”</p><p>The last paragraph of the Introduction is rewritten to address the reviewers concern with respect to the use of colon cell lines to address the mechanism of MUC5AC secretion. The changes in the text follow:</p><p>“As stated above, human cancer cells and cells from patients with ulcerative colitis express and secrete MUC5AC. These cells and cell lines therefore provide a convenient means to address the mechanism MUC5AC secretion. We have established a quantitative assay to measure the secretion of MUC5AC from a human goblet cell line. The procedure was used to screen 7343 human gene products and we describe here the identification and involvement of transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5) channel in MUC5AC secretion.”</p><p>We now include the following statements in the final paragraph of the Discussion: “It is important now to test the expression of PIMS in cells of the respiratory and gastric lining, their involvement in secretion of MUC5AC, and other secreted mucins such as MUC2, to understand the mechanisms of mucin homeostasis.”</p><p><italic>2) There has been extensive work on airway epithelia showing that calcium entry from outside the cell is not important acutely in secretion (Bahra P, Brit J Pharmacol 2004, 143:91; Scott CE, Am J Physiol 1998, 275:C285; Rossi AH, J Physiol 2004. 559:555). Since the authors speculate that reduced calcium entry following TRPM5 knockdown is a major mechanism, what is the relevance of the findings to airway epithelium? Are mechanisms of calcium handling different between colonic and airway epithelium</italic>?</p><p>We now state the following in the Discussion: “In cells of the gastro-intestinal lining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bou-Hanna et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcelo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertrand et al., 2004</xref>) and eye conjunctiva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>) influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> participates in the release of mucins from the secretory granules. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent events are also essential for the release of mucins from the respiratory tract; however, the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is unclear. The general view is that mucin secretion in the airways is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores and independent of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kemp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Dickey, 2008</xref>). However, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for mucin secretion from cholinergic stimulated swine airway submucosal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2011</xref>) as well as by cold and menthol stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2011</xref>). The involvement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mucin secretion is therefore likely to be cell type, signal, and mucin specific.”</p><p>Additionally, the references cited by the reviewers do not address the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in mucin secretion. Scott 1998 and Rossi 2004, respectively, reported that mucin secretion required both PKC (Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent components in an airway epithelial cell line SPOC1 permeabilized with O-streptolysin. Bahra and colleagues (2004) did not measure mucin secretion: they analysed the calcium responses of P2Y2 receptors in human bronchial epithelial cells and reported the involvement of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx component.</p><p><italic>The reviewers strongly recommend that these two concerns should be remedied by extensive rewriting. The Introduction and Discussion should include a careful analysis of potential differences between colonic and airway epithelial cells, and their mechanisms of induction of mucin secretion</italic>.</p><p>The inclusion of the text, as above, makes it clear that the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mucin secretion is cell type specific and currently a controversial issue.</p><p><italic>3) The reviewers were concerned that the 2 hr PMA stimulation could introduce artifacts.

Therefore, have the authors examined whether addition of cycloheximide, or even APC, during PMA treatment affects mucin release? These experiments might provide insight into the role of the hits identified in the screen (are they expressed constitutively for mucin release, or expressed upon physiological stimulation?)</italic>.</p><p>We now show a time course for the PMA dependent secretion of MUC5AC. The time course for PMA induced MUC5AC secretion revealed a significant increase of MUC5AC secretion at 15 min and maximal MUC5AC secretion was observed after 2h incubation with 2 µM PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It is also very important to note that PMA mediated MUC5AC release is not inhibited by BFA. The release of MUC5AC in our experimental conditions, therefore, is from a post-Golgi pool. This alleviates any potential effects on the synthesis of MUC5AC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
