In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, replication origins occupy characteristic subnuclear localizations that anticipate their initiation timing during S phase. Here, we link localization of replication origins in G1 phase with Fkh1 activity, which is required for their early replication timing. Using a Fkh1-dependent origin relocalization assay, we determine that execution of Dbf4-dependent kinase function, including Cdc45 loading, results in dynamic relocalization of a replication origin from the nuclear periphery to the interior in G1 phase. Origin mobility increases substantially with Fkh1-driven relocalization. These findings provide novel molecular insight into the mechanisms that govern dynamics and spatial organization of DNA replication origins and possibly other functional DNA elements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replication origin</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>forkhead</kwd><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>replication timing</kwd><kwd>nuclear mobility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GMS 05494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aparicio</surname><given-names>Oscar M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GMS 117376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiolo</surname><given-names>Irene E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Establishment of replication-timing involves Fkh1-dependent recruitment and execution of DDK function in G1 phase resulting in dynamic relocalization of origins within the nucleus in anticipation of CDK-dependent origin activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spatial organization of chromosomal DNA elements within the nucleus is thought to derive from and contribute to the regulation of their activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shachar and Misteli, 2017</xref>). For example, euchromatin and heterochromatin represent distinct forms of chromatin that are distinguished by their levels of transcriptional activity, replication timing, and subnuclear localization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caridi et al., 2017</xref>). Chromosomes partition into subdomains ranging from hundreds to thousands of kilobases in length that preferentially self-associate and are consequently referred to as topologically associated domains (TADs) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). TAD boundaries correlate closely with replication timing domains, suggesting that replication timing is determined or influenced by this domain structure and/or <italic>vice-versa</italic>.</p><p>In budding and fission yeast, specific mechanisms defining replication timing are linked with chromosomal domain organization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparicio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>). Rif1, which is highly enriched at telomeres, is globally responsible for delayed replication timing of subtelomeric domains as well as internal late-replicating domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tazumi et al., 2012</xref>). Rif1 acts by directly antagonizing replication initiation triggered by Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) phosphorylation of MCM helicase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>). Against this inhibitory backdrop, specific origins are selected for early activation by mechanisms involving recruitment of Dbf4 (Dfp1 in fission yeast), which is one of several initiation proteins present in limited abundance and thus rate-limiting for origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mantiero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Nurse, 2009</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Dfp1 is recruited to kinetochores through heterochromatin protein Swi6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>), and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, kinetochore protein Ctf19 recruits Dbf4 to stimulate firing of origins within ~25 kb of the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Natsume et al., 2013</xref>), thus ensuring early centromere replication by distinct mechanisms regulating DDK activity. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Fkh1 and/or Fkh2 (Fkh1/2) recruits Dbf4 to many origins distributed throughout chromosome arms, thereby ensuring earlier replication of many centromere-distal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lõoke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ostrow et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Chromosome conformation capture experiments suggest that early-firing origins cluster spatially in G1-phase prior to initiation and this clustering is dependent on Fkh1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knott et al., 2012</xref>). These studies also indicated that early origins generally occupy a distinct space than late origins. Further studies suggest that Fkh1/2 are enriched at TAD boundaries and control contacts among origins within TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eser et al., 2017</xref>). The distinct spatial distributions suggested by these recent studies are in accord with earlier studies that examined the subnuclear distribution of individual origins by fluorescence microscopy. These seminal studies from Heun and Gasser showed that late-firing origins typically associate with the nuclear periphery during G1 phase whereas early-firing origins typically are found in the nuclear interior during G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heun et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heun et al., 2001b</xref>). Despite the observed correlations between origin localization in G1 and firing time in S, the main origin timing determinants mentioned above had not been elucidated and have not been examined for their impact on subnuclear localization of replication origin. In this study, we examined how origin stimulation by Fkh1 determines subnuclear origin localization. Our results suggest that origin relocalize from the nuclear periphery upon execution of the DDK-dependent step of replication initiation, which is stimulated by Fkh1. This may represent the initial stages in the coalescence of replication origins into clusters that will become replication factories.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fkh1-induced origin activation re-positions a subtelomeric origin in G1 phase</title><p>The association between replication timing and subnuclear localization of replication origins and the requirement of Fkh1/2 for the clustering of early-firing replication origins according to chromosome conformation capture studies led us to examine whether Fkh1 has any role in establishing the spatial positioning of origins within the nucleus.

In the current study, we used <italic>fkh1∆ fkh2-dsm instead of fkh1∆ fkh2∆</italic> cells; <italic>fkh1∆ fkh2-dsm</italic> cells are essentially null for replication timing control, but exhibit more normal growth and particularly, more normal cell and nuclear morphologies favorable for cytological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ostrow et al., 2017</xref>).

Images of cells from an unsynchronized population were sorted according to budding morphology, which is reflective of cell cycle progression. The localization of the <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup>-Tomato</italic> focus correlates with cell cycle stage, showing primarily peripheral localization in unbudded and small-budded cells and interior localization in larger-budded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies showing peripheral localization of subtelomeric/late-firing origins in G1 followed by relocalization to the interior during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heun et al., 2001a</xref>). Because origin timing is normally established in G1, we focused further analysis on origins in G1 phase cells.</p><p>In G1-arrested <italic>fkh1∆ fkh2-dsm</italic> cells, almost all cells exhibited peripheral localization of <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel). Induction of <italic>FKH1</italic>, however, resulted in an increase in the proportion of cells with non-peripheral positioning of <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel), suggesting that origin relocalization is associated with initiation timing re-programming by <italic>FKH1</italic>. We confirmed that relocalization is a direct result of <italic>FKH1</italic> induction by demonstrating that neither the induction scheme (raffinose - &gt; galactose) with a strain lacking inducible <italic>FKH1</italic> nor a non-inducing change to a more favorable carbon source (raffinose - &gt; dextrose) resulted in origin relocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm the change in origin localization resulting from <italic>FKH1</italic> induction, we created three-dimensional image reconstructions from confocal z-stacks and measured the shortest distance in three dimensions from the <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic> focus to Nup49-GFP signal in the nuclear envelope amongst populations of cells. Statistical analysis of these measurements shows a significant increase in the distances associated with <italic>FKH1</italic>-induction versus non-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We tested whether the function of <italic>ARS305</italic> is required for relocalization by introducing into the V-R locus <italic>ARS305</italic> bearing a mutation of the ARS consensus sequence (ACS) (ars305-∆ACS), which is essential for ORC binding and origin function.

We also tested <italic>ARS305</italic> with mutations of two proximal Fkh1/2 binding sites (ars305-∆2BS), which retains origin function but is delayed in activation at its normal locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knott et al., 2012</xref>); <italic>ars305-∆2BS<sup>V-R</sup></italic> did not relocalize upon <italic>FKH1</italic> induction, confirming that Fkh1 acts through direct binding in cis to <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In the experiments above, relocalization of <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic> involved induction of <italic>FKH1</italic> from the <italic>GAL1/10</italic> promoter, which results in higher than normal levels of Fkh1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peace et al., 2016</xref>).

Nevertheless, low levels of S/G2/M-CDK activities in G1 phase cannot be ruled out, and indeed, it appears that low levels of DDK are involved.

In particular, we show that early origin specification in G1 phase by Fkh1 induces a change from peripheral to interior nuclear localization of Fkh1-activated origins. Quite remarkably, we find that origin relocalization requires execution of the DDK-dependent step of origin firing that loads Cdc45. That the DDK requirement reflects the key, recognized function of DDK in replication initiation, that is, phosphorylation of MCM proteins leading to Sld3-Cdc45 origin-loading, is demonstrated by the bypass of <italic>CDC7</italic> requirement by phospho-mimetic mutations in <italic>MCM4-14D</italic> as well as the dependence on <italic>CDC45</italic> function.

As predicted by this interaction model, inactivation of DDK activity should phenocopy deletion of <italic>FKH1</italic>, as we have herein demonstrated with depletion of <italic>CDC7</italic> function. Moreover, specific deletion of Dbf4’s C-terminus, which is required for interaction with Fkh1, also phenocopies deletion of <italic>FKH1</italic>. Furthermore, the absence of <italic>FKH1</italic> and <italic>FKH2</italic> function is bypassed by the <italic>MCM4-14D</italic> allele in the presence of increased levels of Cdc45. Together, these results support a mechanism involving Fkh1 recruitment of DDK activity to load Cdc45 at a subset of origins in G1, corresponding with a change in subnuclear positioning of these origins, and early firing in the subsequent S phase.</p><p>Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments have indicated that early firing replication origins preferentially interact with each other, or ‘cluster’ in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2010</xref>). Related studies have shown that Fkh1/2 is required for these spatial interactions amongst early origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ostrow et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that the origin clustering interactions revealed by Hi-C experiments directly reflect origin localization to distinct nuclear territories as observed microscopically. Thus, localization to the nuclear interior might increase the likelihood for physical interaction amongst this subset of origins. Such interactions may be driven by cooperative interactions between Fkh1-bound origins recruiting limiting initiation factors such as Dbf4, Sld3 and Cdc45. This aggregation of origins selected for early/efficient activation has the inevitable consequence that replication initiation transforms these origin clusters into replication foci, which have been observed as concentrations of DNA synthesis and replication factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berezney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frouin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hozák et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newport and Yan, 1996</xref>). These assemblages may contribute to efficient chromosomal replication initiation and elongation in multiple ways, such as accretion of activities and co-factors directly required for DNA synthesis (e.g.: dNTP production), and scaffolding to co-localize and coordinate replication with related activities like chromatin assembly, cohesion establishment, topological resolution, and DNA repair.</p><p>It remains to be determined exactly what maintains either the peripheral or interior localization of origins or what drives relocalization between different subnuclear zones. While telomere tethering to the nuclear envelope has been assumed to cause the peripheral localization of telomere-proximal origins, we find that early origins distal from telomeres that are normally enriched in the nuclear interior, are closer to the nuclear periphery in cells lacking Fkh1, suggesting that perinuclear localization represents a default state for most origins irrespective of telomere tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). It is unclear what promotes this origin localization. Complete elimination of origin function results in even more peripheral distribution of the locus suggesting that peripheral localization is independent of an origin tethering mechanism, and that interior localization is linked to activation of origin function, which may occur, with less efficiency, in the absence of Fkh1/2. There may be passive exclusion from the interior where other activities like transcription may predominate in early G1, or there may be a dedicated tethering mechanism, though origin association with the periphery does not appear to be as stringently localized or as stable as that of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hediger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heun et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heun et al., 2001b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45512.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of origin localization linked to initiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Absent Fkh1, most replication origins are enriched at nuclear periphery, however, Fkh1 binding to a subset of origins allows execution of the DDK-dependent step of initiation, resulting in release from the nuclear periphery and/or capture in the nuclear interior to form early origin clusters. (<bold>B</bold>) Hypothetical mechanism for origin tethering to the nuclear periphery regulated by Rif1-PP1 versus Fkh1-DDK-Cdc45 activities. Rif1 associates with inner nuclear membrane and with licensed replication origins, while associated PP1 antagonizes execution of the DDK-dependent step. Fkh1-dependent recruitment of DDK results in phosphorylation of MCM, Cdc45 loading and local release from Rif1 and PP1. See text for further discussion.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45512-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to subtelomeric origins, Rif1 regulates and associates with origins distal from telomeres and with the nuclear envelope, and therefore could potentially tether origins to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peace et al., 2014</xref>). Rif1 interacts with Dbf4 and with the counteracting PP1 phosphatase, suggesting that the Rif1-origin interaction may be down-regulated by DDK-dependent phosphorylation of MCM proteins and/or Rif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, Fkh1-mediated, origin-specific recruitment of DDK may overwhelm Rif1-mediated PP1 inhibition locally and thereby release the origin from peripheral tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consequent Cdc45 loading might effectively prevent reversal of MCM phosphorylation and fully disrupt interaction with Rif1-PP1. Alternatively, MCM phosphorylation and/or Cdc45 loading might change the licensed origin’s biophysical properties, thereby forcing the origin to occupy and search different space and/or capture scaffolding factors, which may themselves be localized to the interior and thus stabilize interior localization. Future studies aimed at more detailed examination of how individual factors affect origin mobility should provide further insights.</p><p>Previous studies have concluded that peripheral localization of origins is neither necessary nor sufficient to regulate initiation timing. In one study, subtelomeric origin <italic>ARS501</italic> remained late firing following excision (in α-factor-arrested G1 cells) from the chromosome, which allowed its diffusion away from the nuclear periphery, leading the authors to suggest that peripheral localization might promote a chromatin mark that maintains late timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heun et al., 2001a</xref>). However, we have shown that induction of Fkh1 (in α-factor-arrested cells) can reprogram timing of a Fkh-activated origin inserted into the <italic>ARS501</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peace et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that the relevant chromatin mark is MCM phosphorylation, removal of which is promoted by peripheral localization and addition by DDK recruitment. Thus, excised <italic>ARS501</italic> remains late despite its mobilization because DDK is limiting and already recruited by Ctf19 and Fkh1/2 to other origins. Other studies have shown that tethering of early origins to the nuclear periphery does not delay their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebrahimi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zappulla et al., 2002</xref>). However, both origins in these previous studies, <italic>ARS305</italic> and <italic>ARS607</italic>, are Fkh-activated origins that we have shown can overcome the replication initiation delay associated with peripheral localization. Overall, these previous findings fit neatly into our model, which suggests that interior origin localization is a consequence rather than a cause of early timing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>Plasmids are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamic relocalization of replication origins by Fkh1 requires execution of DDK function and Cdc45 loading at origins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philippe Pasero (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper by Zhang et al. addresses a mechanism for the activation of a select subset of origins of DNA replication in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that are dependent on the Fkh1/2 proteins for the normal timing of their activation during S phase. The authors show that in the absence of Fkh1/2, an origin of DNA replication associates with the nuclear periphery and upon expression of Fkh1, the origin re-localizes to the nuclear interior. The later movement is dependent upon DDK (Cdc7-Dbf4) kinase and Cdc45 activities, but not CDK. They present a plausible model in which Fkh1/2 recruits the rate limiting Dbf4 DDK subunit to the nuclear periphery by biding to Fkh1/2, countering the Rif1-PP1 dephosphorylation of Mcm4 and releasing the origin to the interior of the nucleus where Cdc45 binding prevents its re-localization to the nuclear periphery.</p><p>The paper generally is well presented and for the most part the data supports the conclusions, however, the reviewers have raised some points that could be addressed. These are listed below. Thus we ask that a revised paper be submitted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correlation between release from the nuclear periphery and early replication timing leads to the reasonable speculation that sub-nuclear localization mechanistically regulates replication timing. Previous work has concluded that peripheral localization is neither necessary (Heun et al., 2001 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11266454) nor sufficient (Zappulla et al, 2002 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12062049) to regulate replication timing. Furthermore, earlier work from the Gasser and Brewer &amp; Fangman labs suggested that an epigenetic mark is established at late origins in G1 through their interaction with the nuclear periphery and is maintained later on to determine their timing of initiation, regardless of their subnuclear organization. This model is not mutually exclusive with the one proposed by the authors and should be discussed. This should be addressed in the paper.</p><p>2) The view that the re-localization of Fkh1 origins does not depend on residual CDK activity in G1 is not fully supported by the experiment performed with clb5 clb6 mutants. Indeed, S-phase onset is only delayed by 30 minutes in this mutant. In principle, Clb3 and Clb4 could also support a residual CDK activity in alpha-factor arrested cells. It would have been more convincing to use a conditional <italic>cdc28</italic> mutant.</p><p>3) A question that the authors do not address is why, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 does Fkh1 bind non-Fkh1-activated origins? Or, put another way, why does Fkh1 not activate all the origins to which it binds? The manuscript focuses on Fkh1-regulated origins, but it would be important to show that the localization of late origins and Fkh1-independent origins does not depend on Fkh1 and/or DDK activity in G1.</p><p>4) The authors' model is difficult to integrate into a more comprehensive model of sub-nuclear localization. In <italic>fkh1∆ fkh2∆,</italic> are all origins at the nuclear periphery? If so, is there any DNA in the nuclear interior? Why is <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic>-∆ACS confined to the nuclear periphery? In authors' model is that origins bind to the periphery unless released by DDK, but in the case of <italic>ARS305<sup>V-R</sup></italic>-∆ACS, it seems that the origin is required to drive the locus away from the periphery. Why would a non-origin locus bind to periphery? Do all non-origin loci bind to the periphery? These questions should be addressed by testing if the ARS305 ACS is required for FKH1-dependent localization at its endogenous locus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45512.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) The correlation between release from the nuclear periphery and early replication timing leads to the reasonable speculation that sub-nuclear localization mechanistically regulates replication timing.

The results, (subsection “DDK- but not CDK-dependent step of replication initiation drives origin relocalization”, last paragraph and Figure 5D and new Figure 5—figure supplement 1) show that Cdc28 activity is not required for normal localization of ARS305 in G1 cells. We performed these analyses with cells synchronized with alpha-factor prior to Cdc28 inhibition (Figure 5D), and with G1 cells following inhibition of Cdc28 (no alpha-factor treatment) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C). We have eliminated the prior CLB5/6 results for brevity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A question that the authors do not address is why, in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 does Fkh1 bind non-Fkh1-activated origins? Or, put another way, why does Fkh1 not activate all the origins to which it binds? The manuscript focuses on Fkh1-regulated origins, but it would be important to show that the localization of late origins and Fkh1-independent origins does not depend on Fkh1 and/or DDK activity in G1.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the first pair of questions: The definition of Fkh-act was statistically conservative and is based on origin differences in BrdU incorporation levels (WT vs. <italic>fkh1∆fkh2∆)</italic> in HU in our original study (Knott et al., 2012). We also observe that some later-firing origins are delayed in firing in <italic>fkh1∆fkh2∆</italic> cells in the absence of HU, including some telomere-proximal origins (see Figure 2A in Knott et al., 2012). Also, in subsequent studies we showed that overexpression of Fkh1 (Fkh1-OE) leads to increased early firing (in HU) of additional origins, and about half of the origins in previous Figure 4—figure supplement 3B that are designated “other origins” are Fkh1-OE-activated origins. So, most, if not all, Fkh-bound origins are stimulated, but not equally. For example, the number and spacing of Fkh1/2 sites appears to correlate with the level of stimulation (Looke et al., 2012). This is an interesting issue we are working on, but peripheral here, so to avoid this confusion, we have revised this figure (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1) to include only Fkh-activated origins, which directly corresponds to the statement in the text that this supplementary figure supports: “binding of Fkh1 to ARS305 and other Fkh-activated origins was largely unaffected by Cdc7 inhibition”</p><p>Regarding the second point: “it would be important to show that the localization […] does not depend on Fkh1 and/or DDK activity in G1,” we’d suggest that finding that late or Fkh1-independent origins’ localizations were due to Fkh1 and DDK would still be important, albeit less intuitive. Relocalization of specific genomic loci may have indirect consequences for positioning of sequences in <italic>cis</italic>. Nevertheless, we have analyzed ARS501 in WT and <italic>fkh1∆</italic> cells and observe that ARS501 is robustly peripheral in both strains. We have added this data in the text (subsection “Fkh1 globally regulates subnuclear positioning of early origins in G1 phase”, last paragraph) and new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors' model is difficult to integrate into a more comprehensive model of sub-nuclear localization. In fkh1∆ fkh2∆, are all origins at the nuclear periphery? If so, is there any DNA in the nuclear interior? Why is ARS305<sup>V-R</sup>-∆ACS confined to the nuclear periphery? In authors' model is that origins bind to the periphery unless released by DDK, but in the case of ARS305<sup>V-R</sup>-∆ACS, it seems that the origin is required to drive the locus away from the periphery. Why would a non-origin locus bind to periphery? Do all non-origin loci bind to the periphery? These questions should be addressed by testing if the ARS305 ACS is required for FKH1-dependent localization at its endogenous locus.</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of <italic>FKH1</italic>, most of the origins we tested are closer to the periphery though not necessarily at the periphery, and origin DNA is only a small fraction of total DNA, so we don’t think the interior is devoid of DNA. In the case of 305<sup>V-R</sup>-∆ACS, telomere proximity may maintain its peripheral localization (we suspect that Fkh1-induced relocalization of that locus likely results in release of the V-R telomere from the periphery as well, but this requires more work to address). To begin to address the additional questions posed by the reviewers, we have, as requested by the reviewers, analyzed 305∆ACS (and ∆BS) at the endogenous locus. The results are similar as with the V-R locus with both mutations resulting in peripheral localization. Deletion of the ACS causes even more peripheral distribution. This suggests two things: that the locus need not be tethered by an origin to be peripheral but that origin functionality promotes interior localization. Thus, the licensed origin lacking Fkh1/2 binding sites may still occasionally capture DDK and relocalize.</p><p>The idea that Rif is required for peripheral origin tethering is merely speculation; the finding that the locus remains peripheral in the absence of an origin does not contradict the model (there could be different reasons for the peripheral localization in the two cases). We have included a comment on this in the discussion of the model (Discussion, fifth paragraph). Regardless, we don’t think the limited analysis here is sufficient to answer these interesting questions raised by our study. Further work analyzing more loci, particularly more telomere-distal loci will be required to properly and fully answer these questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
