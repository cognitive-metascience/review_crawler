endothelium to dendritic neurons, that allow the cells to function effectively. Here, we elucidated the unique shape of cells in the cornified stratified epithelia of the mammalian epidermis that allows them to achieve homeostasis of the tight junction (TJ) barrier. Using intimate in vivo 3D imaging, we found that the basic shape of TJ-bearing cells is a flattened Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron (f-TKD), an optimal shape for filling space. In vivo live imaging further elucidated the dynamic replacement of TJs on the edges of f-TKD cells that enables the TJ-bearing cells to translocate across the TJ barrier. We propose a spatiotemporal orchestration model of f-TKD cell turnover, where in the classic context of 'form follows function', cell shape provides a fundamental basis for the barrier homeostasis and physical strength of cornified stratified epithelia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19593.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19593.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19593.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin surface – known as the epidermis – is made up of sheets of cells that are stacked up in layers. One of the roles of the skin is to provide a protective barrier that limits what leaks into or out of the body. A particular layer of the epidermis – referred to as the stratum granulosum – is primarily responsible for forming this barrier. The cells in this layer are sealed together in a zipper-like fashion by structures known as tight junctions.</p><p>New skin cells are continuously produced in the lowest cell layers of the epidermis, and move upwards to integrate into the stratum granulosum layer to replace old cells (which also move upwards to leave the layer). How stratum granulosum cells are replaced without disrupting the tight junction barrier was not well understood.</p><p>Yokouchi et al. used a technique called confocal microscopy to examine the stratum granulosum cells in the ears of mice, and found that the shape of these cells forms the basis of the barrier that they form. These cells resemble a flattened version of a shape called Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron: a 14-sided solid with six rectangular and eight hexagonal sides. This structure was proposed by Lord Kelvin in 1887 to be the best shape for filling space. Tight junctions are present on the edges of the flattened Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that the tight junctions move from cell to cell in a spatiotemporally-coordinated manner in order to maintain a continuous barrier throughout the stratum granulosum as cells are replaced. A newly formed stratum granulosum cell appears beneath the cell that it will replace. The shape of these cells enables a new barrier of three-way tight junction contacts to form between them and the neighboring cells in the stratum granulosum. After this barrier has formed, the upper cell leaves the stratum granulosum.</p><p>Future research could address how cells adopt the flattened Kelvin’s tetrakaidecahedron shape, and discover why tight junctions only form in one layer of the epidermis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19593.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19593.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epidermal barrier</kwd><kwd>tissue homeostasis</kwd><kwd>tight junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003478</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amagai</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amagai</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubo</surname><given-names>Akiharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lydia O'Leary Memorial Pias Dermatological Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubo</surname><given-names>Akiharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005865</institution-id><institution>Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubo</surname><given-names>Akiharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Maruho Co., Ltd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amagai</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The three dimensional structure of epidermal cells in the stratum granulosum provides the basis for the homeostasis of the tight junction barrier during cell turnover in the skin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epidermis of the skin is a stratified epithelial cellular sheet that forms physical barriers on the body surface. Epidermal barrier dysfunctions cause not only lethal congenital disorders, but also a predisposition to the development of allergic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGrath and Uitto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kubo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weidinger and Novak, 2015</xref>). The mammalian epidermis has two main physical barriers, an air-liquid interface barrier formed by the stratum corneum (SC) and a liquid-liquid interface barrier formed by tight junctions (TJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kubo et al., 2012</xref>). The TJ is a specialized intercellular adhesion complex that is crucial for epidermal barrier function, as it seals the paracellular space of epithelial cellular sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Van Itallie and Anderson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krug et al., 2014</xref>). Maintenance of the TJ barrier is crucial for proper formation of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sugawara et al., 2013</xref>), and thus for maintaining the physical barriers of the skin.</p><p>The epidermis consists of keratinocytes that proliferate only in the basal layer and move upward to sequentially form stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum (SG), and SC, and finally shed off from the top layer of the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During the course of its upward movement, a keratinocyte becomes flattened at the SG, forms TJs with adjacent cells in the SG2 layer (the second cell layer of the SG), loses its TJs in the SG1 layer (the top layer of the SG) and is finally cornified to form the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kubo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>). Despite its critical importance for the skin homeostasis, the TJ barrier of the epidermis consists of only a single layer of TJs forming a honeycomb-like mesh (TJ honeycomb) in the SG2 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Furuse et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>).

Our model is consistent with a pioneering computational simulation suggesting that the regular 3D stacking structure of the SC can be spontaneously formed by randomly supplied cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Honda et al., 1996</xref>). Our model also accords with in vivo cell-tracing studies demonstrating a random supply of cells from the spinous layer to the SG layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>), and in vivo live observations of the upward movement of spinous layer cells funneling into preexisting cell columns of the SG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the 1980s, the epidermal proliferative unit (EPU) concept postulated that each column of flattened corneocytes corresponds to a set of basal layer stem cells that proliferate directly under the column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Potten and Allen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Potten, 2004</xref>). In the EPU model, the regular interdigitation pattern of the SC is explained by the regular kinetics of basal layer stem cells in each EPU. However, recent in vivo cell-fate-tracing studies demonstrated more random cell fate decisions in the basal cell layer, with EPU model-like upward cell movement funneling into the cell columns of the SG, leading to a new concept: the epidermal differentiation unit (EDU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism dictating the regular interdigitation pattern of cell columns remains enigmatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>In our f-TKD model, the cell columns exist only in the SG and SC layers, rather than extending from the basal layer through to the SC. The cells originate from stem cells in the basal layer and are randomly supplied to a spinous layer. Once the cells enter the SG layer, cell turnover in adjacent columns is tightly coordinated in a spatiotemporal manner, leading to the regular interdigitation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Epidermal homeostasis is maintained by balancing cell proliferation in the basal layer, cell translocation (differentiation) from the basal to the spinous layer, cell integration to the SC/SG layer, and cell shedding from the top of the SC as squames. Future studies are needed to explore how this balance among critical processes in the epidermal layers is regulated to maintain a constant thickness of the epidermis.</p><p>The mammalian epidermis is a representative stratified epithelium. Nutrients for stratified cells are mostly supplied from the basal connective tissue via diffusion through paracellular pathways. If all the keratinocytes in the epidermis formed TJs, cells located in the upper epidermis would likely starve due to their segregation from the nutrient supply by multi-layered TJ barriers. Therefore, it is biologically reasonable that the TJ barrier is single-layered in stratified epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kubo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>). Our observations revealed that TJ formation is restricted only between SG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that coordinate the sequential differentiation steps from SG3 to SG1 cells and restrict TJ-forming activity to SG2 cells are currently unknown. The f-TKD model may help to reveal these mechanisms in future studies.</p><p>Various mammalian epidermis shows a regular interdigitation pattern in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christophers, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackenzie et al., 1981</xref>), suggesting that the f-TKD cell turnover mechanism governs cell differentiation in mammals. Further investigation on whether this characteristic interdigitation pattern is observed in the SC of other vertebrates, such as amphibians, reptiles and birds, may reveal the general applicability of the f-TKD model to cornified stratified epithelia. Other mechanisms could be involved in maintaining TJ barrier homeostasis in simple epithelia and non-cornified stratified epithelia, where apoptotic cells are extruded to the outside TJ barrier by adjacent cells that migrate into the basal side of the apoptotic cells and form multi-junctional TJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pentecost et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The actual structure of the optimal space-filling shape with minimal surface area could be more complex than Kelvin’s model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lewis, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weaire and Phelan, 1994</xref>), and the shape and alignment of corneocytes are much more variegated in human skin compared to mouse ear skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackenzie et al., 1981</xref>). Nonetheless, the basic concept of the spatiotemporal orchestration of SG cell differentiation in the f-TKD model would be sufficient to explain the regular interdigitation pattern of corneocytes observed in various types of cornified skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackenzie et al., 1981</xref>). The f-TKD cell turnover model of the SG can be applied to stratified stacks of variously shaped polyhedral cells and provides a fundamental basis for the maintenance of barrier homeostasis during cell turnover in cornified stratified epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Female 8- to 12-week-old C57B6/J mice were used as wild type in all experiments.

TJ-bearing SG2 cells were shown in three different colors depending on the vertical placement of the cell. A cycle of the SG2-to-SG1 transition of a cell starts with the appearance of the tTJs and is completed by their disappearance. In our model simulation, the SG2-to-SG1 transition of a cell is demonstrated by the gradual change of an SG2 cell to a transparent SG1 cell. The transition of a cell is governed by two local rules: (1) The differentiation of a SG3 cell to become a SG2 cell is synchronized with the differentiation of the pre-existing SG2 cell to become a SG1 cell in each cell column. (2) An SG2 cell located higher than its six adjacent SG2 cells differentiates to become an SG1 cell after a waiting period that is stochastically determined with a uniform probability between 0 and 9.6 hr. This uniform distribution was chosen to best reproduce the average turnover time (24 hr), estimated from the experimentally observed cell turnover rate in mouse ear skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Potten, 1975</xref>) and the percentage of double-edged polygons (9.8%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The average time required to complete the TJ disappearance during SG2-to-SG1 transition was set to be 2.4 hr = 24 × 9.8/100.</p><p>Additionally, the following two rules for TJ production were implemented in the algorithm: (1) Bicellular TJs (green) are produced on edges shared by two SG2 cells when edges are in contact with SG1 cells; (2) tTJs (blue) are produced on edges shared by three SG2 cells. In our simulations, tTJs on double-edged polygons (where TJ replacement takes place) are displayed, but tTJs at vertices of single-edged polygons are not displayed for the sake of simplicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Videos 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">10</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>Yokouchi and colleagues employs state of the art imaging technologies to reveal novel information regarding the structure and turnover of epidermal cells with tight junctions in the skin. The authors show that tight junctions appear with upper and lower polygons in the stratum granulosum (SG). Using observations on TJ shape and function, the present manuscript adapts Kelvin's tetrakaidecahedron to provide a very original, attractive and interesting mathematical and physical model that explains how the continuously renewing epidermal barrier can retain TJ barrier function in a single layer, the SG2, while individual cells move upward. Overall, this manuscript changes the paradigm for our understanding of how stratified cells with tight junctions continually regeneration and yet maintain barrier function. The work is logically presented and the data are reasonably thorough and convincing in support of these impactful conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will likely require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques.</p><p>1) Direct evidence to support the f-TKD shape of the SG2 cells using 3D rendering is necessary. The authors could use a general cell surface membrane label (this can even be done after isolation of SG2 and SG1 cells using the ETA approach) or use phalloidin to label the cell cortex.</p><p>2) The model proposes that the structure identified is essential for epidermal barrier formation. Barrier function of this second TJ polygon is only shown by imaging for one cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. More extensive quantitative analysis, and perhaps an additional test such as biotin penetration, as the observation that the second ZO-1 positive polygon guarantees barrier function during transition is one of the key points of the paper and a corner stone of the model.</p><p>3) If possible, it would be useful to understand how generalizable these observations made in mouse ear are to other stratified epithelia and perhaps to non-keratinizing mucosal surfaces where a lipid-enriched stratum corneum is not present to help maintain barrier function.</p><p>4) The paper would be tremendously strengthened if the authors could quantitatively link the occurrence and disappearance of TJ polygons to the position of cells in relation to its neighbors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19593.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.

The observation of isolated SG2 cells confirmed variations in the shapes of the TJ polygons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), as expected from the regular stacks of f-TKD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The model proposes that the structure identified is essential for epidermal barrier formation.

More extensive quantitative analysis, and perhaps an additional test such as biotin penetration, as the observation that the second ZO-1 positive polygon guarantees barrier function during transition is one of the key points of the paper and a corner stone of the model.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we quantitatively analyzed the barrier function of the interior ZO-1-positive polygons against ETA permeation. The results demonstrating the barrier function of the second TJ polygon were added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and in the text (Results, subsection “Interior polygons show barrier function” and Materials and methods, subsection “Permeation assay”, last paragraph).</p><p>We analyzed ETA permeation into stratified epithelia via en faceimaging because the ETA digestion of Dsg1 inside the TJ barrier results in total disappearance of the signals from the extracellular portion of Dsg1 at the inside TJ barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other tracers, such as the biotin tracers suggested by the reviewer, are not appropriate, because the stratified intercellular staining in stratified epithelia hampers detailed analyses evaluating tracer permeation via en faceobservation. We delineated these potential difficulties in the Results (subsection “Interior polygons show barrier function”, last paragraph) to improve understanding.</p><p><italic>3) If possible, it would be useful to understand how generalizable these observations made in mouse ear are to other stratified epithelia and perhaps to non-keratinizing mucosal surfaces where a lipid-enriched stratum corneum is not present to help maintain barrier function.</italic> </p><p>We added a discussion of simple epithelia and non-cornified stratified epithelia, in which another strategy for barrier maintenance has been observed (Discussion, seventh paragraph). We also expanded on the potential general applicability of the f-TKD model in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p><italic>4) The paper would be tremendously strengthened if the authors could quantitatively link the occurrence and disappearance of TJ polygons to the position of cells in relation to its neighbors.</italic> </p><p>In response to this comment, we performed statistical analysis on the Z-axis position of each polygon, which revealed remarkable regularity in that the exterior polygon was located significantly higher than, and the interior polygon was located significantly lower than, the adjacent single-edged polygons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, Results, subsection “Double-edged TJ polygons are observed in the single-layered epidermal TJ honeycomb”, last paragraph and in Materials and methods, subsection “Counting and analyzing the double-edged polygons”, last paragraph). These observations support the f-TKD model, in which the occurrence and disappearance of TJ polygons are linked to the positions of cells relative to their neighbors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
