The binding of this 43S PIC to the capped 5’ end of mRNA is followed by scanning the mRNA leader for the correct AUG start codon. The binding of eIF1 and eIF1A to the 40S subunit promotes a scanning-conducive, open conformation favourable for rapid binding of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> as a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP, in a conformation (P<sub>OUT</sub>) suitable for scanning successive triplets in the 40S P site for complementarity to the anticodon of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>. The multisubunit eIF3 complex also binds directly to the 40S subunit and stimulates 43S assembly, attachment to mRNA, and subsequent scanning. During the scanning process, hydrolysis of GTP in TC is stimulated by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, but release of phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) from eIF2-GDP-P<sub>i</sub> is prevented by the gatekeeper molecule eIF1 at non-AUG codons. Recognition of an AUG start codon induces a major conformational change in the PIC to a scanning-arrested closed (P<sub>IN</sub>) complex made possible by the dissociation of eIF1, which eliminates a clash it would have with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in its fully accommodated P<sub>IN</sub> conformation. The change is accompanied by the movement of the C-terminal tail (CTT) of eIF1A from eIF1 toward the GAP domain of eIF5. The P<sub>IN</sub> conformation is further stabilized by direct interaction of the unstructured N-terminal tail (NTT) of eIF1A with the codon-anticodon duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hinnebusch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aylett and Ban, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its function as a GAP for eIF2, eIF5 has been implicated in stringent selection of AUG start codons. eIF5 consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD, 1–170 residues), which is connected by a long flexible linker to a C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 2006</xref>). The eIF5-NTD contains the GAP function of eIF5, which is stimulated by the PIC and requires the conserved Arg-15 located in its unstructured N-terminus, possibly functioning as an ‘arginine finger’ that interacts with the GTP-binding pocket in eIF2γ to stabilize the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Algire et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paulin et al., 2001</xref>). Substitution of Gly31 with arginine in the eIF5-NTD (the <italic>SUI5</italic> allele) is lethal but confers a dominant Sui<sup>-</sup> (<italic><underline>su</underline></italic>ppressor of <italic><underline>i</underline></italic>nitiation codon) phenotype indicating error-prone start-codon selection in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1997</xref>). Consistent with this, in the reconstituted system, the eIF5-G31R substitution alters the regulation of P<sub>i</sub> release such that it occurs faster at UUG versus AUG start codons; and it modifies a functional interaction of eIF5 with the eIF1A-CTT to favour the closed PIC conformation at UUG over AUG start codons. Biochemical analysis of intragenic suppressors of <italic>SUI5</italic> with an Ssu<sup>-</sup> (<italic>S</italic>uppressor of <italic>Su</italic>i<sup>-</sup>) phenotype, indicating hyperaccurate start-codon selection, indicated that the effect of eIF5-G31R in both dysregulation of P<sub>i</sub> release and partitioning of PICs between open and closed states contribute to the enhanced UUG initiation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maag et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). Because the location of eIF5 in the PIC was unknown, it has been unclear how the G31R substitution alters these events in the open/P<sub>OUT</sub> to closed/P<sub>IN</sub> transition at the molecular level. Movement of the wild-type eIF5-NTD and the eIF1A CTT toward one another within the PIC is triggered by AUG recognition, and this rearrangement is dependent on scanning enhancer (SE) elements in the eIF1A-CTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>). The fact that mutations in SE elements more strongly reduced the rate of P<sub>i</sub> release than eIF1 dissociation suggested that the SE-dependent movement of the eIF5-NTD toward the eIF1A-CTT facilitates P<sub>i</sub> release following eIF1 dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The eIF5 CTD also performs multiple functions in assembly of the PIC and control of start-codon selection such as promoting the closed PIC conformation by enhancing eIF1 dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nanda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, overexpressing eIF5 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nanda et al., 2009</xref>) or mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2012</xref>) relaxes the stringency of start-codon selection presumably by enhancing eIF1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughran et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the structure of a eukaryotic translation initiation complex containing eIF5 would greatly aid our understanding of its multiple functions.</p><p>The recent structures of eukaryotic translation initiation complexes from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aylett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>) as well as mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aylett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>) have provided many insights into the molecular events involved in scanning and AUG recognition. eIF1, eIF1A, TC and eIF3 have been observed in an open (P<sub>OUT</sub>) conformation, as well as a scanning-arrested closed (P<sub>IN</sub>) conformation of the 40S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). In a partial 48S pre-initiation complex from yeast (py48S), we had tentatively suggested that an unassigned density at low resolution near eIF2γ belongs to eIF5-CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is no clear structural information on the position and conformation of either the CTD or NTD of eIF5 in the PIC.</p><p>Here, we have determined a cryo-EM structure of a yeast 48S complex in the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation at near atomic resolutions (3.0 Å to 3.5 Å maps) containing clear density for the eIF5-NTD (py48S-eIF5N). Remarkably, in this py48S-eIF5N complex, eIF1 has been replaced by the eIF5-NTD, which is bound near the P site at essentially the same position. The tRNA<sub>i</sub> is more fully accommodated in the P site than observed in previous structures containing eIF1, and is also tilted toward the 40S body, apparently setting the stage for its interaction with eIF5B and subsequent joining of the 60S subunit. Extensive interaction with the eIF5-NTD appears to stabilize this tRNA<sub>i</sub> conformation. Mutations expected to weaken the observed eIF5-NTD/tRNA<sub>i</sub> interactions diminish initiation at near-cognate UUG codons <italic>in vivo</italic> and disfavor transition to the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> conformation at UUG codons in reconstituted PICs <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas mutations expected to stabilize the interactions have the opposite effects. The results presented in this work suggest that the eIF5-NTD stabilizes the codon-anticodon interaction and the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state of the PIC, prevents eIF1 rebinding, and promotes a conformation of the 48S PIC compatible with eIF5B binding and subunit joining.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of the cryo-EM structure of a yeast 48S PIC containing eIF5</title><p>Partial yeast 48S PIC maps containing clear density for eIF5-NTD (py48S-eIF5N) were obtained from a 48S sample reconstituted by sequential addition of purified <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5, TC and an eIF4F-eIF4B-mRNA complex to yeast <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> 40S subunits. An unstructured, capped 49-mer mRNA with an AUG codon and an optimal Kozak sequence for yeast was used (See Materials and methods). In our earlier studies, eIF4 factors were not used to deliver the mRNA to the PIC, and the mRNA was uncapped and lacked an optimal Kozak sequence. These changes in assembly protocol may have helped in capturing eIF5 in the 48S.</p><p>The structure of py48S-eIF5N was determined to an overall resolution of 3.0 Å to 3.5 Å in respective maps: 1, A, B, C1 and C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>), and the resulting model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Clear density for the codon:anticodon interaction is observed at the P site; and the complete N-terminal tail (NTT) of eIF1A was resolved, stabilizing the codon:anticodon helix as seen in earlier closed py48S complexes containing eIF1 instead of eIF5-NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39273.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM structure of py48S-eIF5N.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CryoEM maps of the PIC py48S-eIF5N shown in three orientations. Regions of the map are colored by component to show the 40S subunit (yellow), eIF1A (blue), eIF5-NTD (cyan), Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> (green), mRNA (magenta), eIF2α (violet), eIF2γ (orange), eIF2β (red), eIF3 (different shades of pink).

Also, there was no density to account for the C-terminal β-strand of eIF1. Moreover, close inspection revealed discrepancies between the densities and side chains of eIF1, particularly for β-hairpin one at the P site. Together, the known structural similarity of the eIF5-NTD with eIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conte et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), our previous suggestion that the eIF5-NTD might occupy the position of eIF1 on the 40S following eIF1 dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nanda et al., 2009</xref>), and our previous demonstration that the eIF5-NTD can bind directly to the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>), all prompted us to place the structure of eIF5-NTD (PDB: 2E9H) into the unassigned density on the 40S platform. The eIF5-NTD structure accounted for the entire density, including the zinc-binding domain (ZBD) absent in eIF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and the high resolution of the map enabled us to unambiguously model the eIF5-NTD at the atomic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The eIF5-NTD binds on the platform at essentially the same location occupied by eIF1 in previous py48S structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), interacting with 18S rRNA residues in h44 (1760; <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> numbering), h45 (1780 and 1781) and h24 (994, 995, 1001, 1002 and 1004).

Although dissociation of eIF1A from the PIC at this stage of the initiation process is slow and does not appear to be a physiologically relevant event, it does report on the relative abundance and stability of the open and closed states of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In WT PICs, dissociation of eIF1A occurs with biphasic kinetics, with the fast phase reflecting complexes in the open state, in which eIF1A is less stably bound, and the slow phase reflecting the more stable, closed state. The ratio of amplitudes of the slower phase (a<sub>2</sub>) over the fast phase (a<sub>1</sub>) is taken as the apparent equilibrium constant between the closed and open states (a<sub>2</sub>/a<sub>1</sub>) and is referred to as ‘K<sub>amp</sub>’.

This effect is also reflected in the rate constants for the fast (k<sub>1</sub>) and slow (k<sub>2</sub>) phases, which are both higher for complexes assembled on mRNA(UUG) than on mRNA(AUG) (6 vs. 22 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 0.4 vs. 2.1 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that eIF1A is less stably bound in both the open and closed states in complexes assembled on a near-cognate start codon.

As described above, in the presence of WT eIF5, eIF1A is more stably bound to the PIC with mRNA(AUG) than mRNA(UUG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> blue closed circles versus blue closed squares) with a relatively higher K<sub>amp</sub> for mRNA(AUG) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>; rows 1–2), indicating a greater preponderance of complexes in the closed state. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maag et al., 2006</xref>), the G31R-eIF5 substitution, which has a strong, dominant Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccuracy phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, inverts the effect of an AUG versus UUG start codon on the dissociation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> red closed circles <italic>versus</italic> red closed squares). In contrast to WT eIF5, PICs containing G31R eIF5 have higher K<sub>amp</sub> values at UUG than AUG start codons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>, rows 3–4), thus indicating the closed state of the PIC is favored in the former case relative to the latter, consistent with the Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccuracy phenotype. Similarly, k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> values are lower for PICs assembled with G31R on UUG start codons than on AUG codons (k<sub>1</sub> values 18 and 7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and k<sub>2</sub> values 3.0 and 0.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, for AUG and UUG, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>, rows 3–4 <italic>versus</italic> 1–2). The R<sub>bound</sub> values also invert, becoming 0.19 and 0.20 for AUG and UUG, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>, rows 3–4 <italic>versus</italic> 1–2). These results are consistent with the placement of the G31 residue directly across from the first position of the codon:anticodon helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), where an arginine substitution could stabilize the formation of a U:U mismatch and the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state of the complex.</p><p>The additional Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccuracy substitutions in the eIF5-NTD generated here, E26K, G29R, and N30R, all produced a similar pattern to what we observed for eIF5-G31R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). All three substitutions led to higher K<sub>amp</sub> values in PICs with mRNA(UUG) versus mRNA(AUG) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>, rows 5–10), implying that these substitutions in eIF5, like G31R, shift the equilibrium more toward the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state at the near-cognate UUG start codon and away from it at AUG codons. As with eIF5-G31R, k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> were both lower on UUG codons than AUG codons for all three mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>). R<sub>bound</sub> values were either equal for UUG and AUG codons (G29R) or greater for UUG codons (N30R and E26K), as was also the case for G31R (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposal that these positive charge substitutions in eIF5-NTD in the vicinity of the codon:anticodon helix electrostatically stabilize the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation on near-cognate codons. This does not seem to be the only effect, however, because these substitutions actually appear to destabilize the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state on AUG codons, possibly due to steric clashes with the A:U base pair introduced by the arginine side chain.</p><p>We also determined the effects of substitutions in the eIF5-NTD at the same or nearby residues designed to decrease the positive charge or increase the negative charge: G29E, N30E, R28E and R28A. Because these substitutions produced hyperaccurate Ssu<sup>-</sup> phenotypes in the genetic experiments described above, we examined their effects on eIF1A dissociation in the context of PICs assembled with <italic>SUI3-2</italic> (eIF2β-S264Y). Consistent with its Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccuracy phenotype, we observed that eIF2β-S264Y slows the rate of eIF1A dissociation from 48S PICs assembled on mRNA(UUG), reducing the differences in rate constants, K<sub>amp</sub> and R<sub>bound</sub> values between 48S PICs on AUG and UUG mRNAs, relative to the WT complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> red circles <italic>versus</italic> red squares; row 2 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4A</xref> <italic>versus</italic> row 2 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4B</xref>).

These substitutions decrease the occupancy of the closed complex at UUG start codons, as indicated by the decreased K<sub>amp</sub> values on UUG relative to AUG start codons compared to the case with eIF2β-S264Y PICs containing WT eIF5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4B</xref>, rows 5–10).

P<sub>i</sub> release is a late step in start-codon recognition and is gated by eIF1 release and movement of the eIF1A-CTT closer to the eIF5-NTD. It is thought to help commit the PIC to initiation at the selected point on the mRNA. Previous studies have shown that P<sub>i</sub> release is influenced by the nature of the start codon in the mRNA, with a higher rate observed from PICs assembled on AUG start codons as compared to PICs on near-cognate UUG codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Algire et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Algire et al., 2005</xref>), we observed that the kinetics of P<sub>i</sub> release is 2- to 3-fold faster in response to AUG as compared to UUG start codons (k<sub>obs</sub> values of 0.60 s<sup>−1</sup> <italic>versus</italic> 0.26 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5A</xref>, row 1). This trend is reversed when the Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccurate G31R eIF5 mutant replaces the WT factor, with a k<sub>obs</sub> of 0.6 s<sup>−1</sup> for PICs assembled on UUG codons versus 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup> for complexes on AUG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5A</xref>, row 2). This result is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>) and the Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccuracy phenotype of the G31R mutant. Similarly, all of the new Sui<sup>-</sup> hypoaccuracy substitutions in eIF5 (N30R, G29R, and E26K) suppress the rate of P<sub>i</sub> release from the PIC in response to recognition of cognate AUG start codons and/or enhance it in response to near-cognate UUG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, compare green and orange bars; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5A</xref>, rows 3–5). These results are consistent with the conclusion that these substitutions that increase the positive charge on the eIF5-NTD in the region of the codon:anticodon helix stabilize the closed state of the PIC at UUG codons, while destabilizing it at AUG codons.

In the py48S and py48S-closed structures, where tRNA<sub>i</sub> is tightly enclosed in the P site, the location and conformation of the β-hairpin loops 1 and 2 of eIF1 are different from their counterparts in both the py48S-open complex and the simpler PIC containing only eIFs 1 and 1A. These changes to eIF1 are required to accommodate tRNA<sub>i</sub> binding in the conformation observed in the previously reported py48S closed complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). The remodeling of eIF1 loop-1 disrupts certain interactions anchoring eIF1 to the 40S platform, presumably as a prelude to its eventual dissociation. Here, we describe a PIC representing a step further in the pathway, in which eIF1 has dissociated and is replaced by the eIF5-NTD on the 40S platform (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The eIF5-NTD interacts directly with the codon:anticodon duplex and might act to stabilize selection of an AUG start codon, as well as allowing greater accommodation of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site in a tilted conformation. The altered location and conformation of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the py48S-eIF5N complex is completely incompatible with eIF1 binding to the platform, even in the distorted state observed in the previous closed complexes. The eIF5-NTD, in contrast, is complementary to this new conformation and makes stabilizing interactions with the tRNA<sub>i</sub>, thus promoting the fully closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state of the PIC and preventing rebinding of eIF1. The position and tilted conformation of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the py48S-eIF5N complex appears to set the stage for the next step in the initiation pathway, eIF5B-catalyzed subunit joining.</p><p>As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conte et al., 2006</xref>), eIF5-NTD and eIF1 share the same protein fold, and they mostly contact the 40S subunit using analogous structural elements. Moreover, eIF1 and the structurally similar portion of eIF5-NTD contact essentially the same surface of the 40S platform. However, whereas eIF5-NTD binding is compatible with the more highly accommodated P<sub>IN</sub> state of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> and its tilting toward the 40S body observed in the py48S-eIF5N structure – and, in fact, appears to stabilize this fully accommodated state - eIF1 would clash extensively with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in this location and orientation. The β-hairpin loops 1 and 2 of eIF5-NTD make extensive, favorable contacts with the Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, and because eIF5 loop-2 is shorter/more basic and oriented away from the Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, it avoids the electrostatic clash with the tRNA<sub>i</sub>D-loop predicted for the larger/more acidic loop-2 of eIF1 that projects toward the tRNA<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Supporting this view, we recently demonstrated that substituting acidic and bulky hydrophobic residues in eIF1 loop-2 with alanines or basic residues increases UUG initiation <italic>in vivo</italic> and stabilizes TC binding to the PIC at UUG codons, as would be expected from eliminating electrostatic/steric clashing, or introducing electrostatic attraction, between eIF1 loop-2 and tRNA<sub>i</sub>, which removes an impediment to the P<sub>IN</sub> state to enhance selection of a near-cognate start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thakur and Hinnebusch, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our genetic findings provided evidence that electrostatic contacts of basic residues R28 and R73 in eIF5-NTD loops 1 and 2, respectively, with different segments of the tRNA<sub>i</sub> ASL stabilize the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> conformation at the start codon, as replacing them with Ala or Glu residues reduced initiation at UUG codons in yeast cells harboring the hypoaccurate Sui<sup>-</sup> variant eIF2β-S264Y. Consistent with this, the eIF5-R28A substitution also disfavored and destabilized the closed PIC conformation as judged by eIF1A dissociation kinetics, and decreased P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2-GDP-P<sub>i</sub>, primarily or exclusively at UUG codons in 48S PICs reconstituted with the eIF2β-S264Y variant. Similar findings were observed on introducing acidic residues at G29 and N30 in the eIF5-NTD loop-2. The relatively greater effects of these substitutions on UUG initiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in disfavoring/destabilizing the closed PIC conformation and reducing the rate of P<sub>i</sub> release in vitro at UUG versus AUG codons, taken in combination with earlier findings that the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state of the PIC is inherently less stable at UUG versus AUG codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maag et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nanda et al., 2009</xref>), suggests that non-canonical 48S PICs at UUG codons are more sensitive to loop-2 mutations that disrupt electrostatic stabilization of the codon:anticodon duplex by the eIF5-NTD loop-2. Thus, our structural, genetic and biochemical evidence all suggest that contacts between the eIF5-NTD and the tRNA<sub>i</sub> ASL promote the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> conformation of the PIC, and thus are particularly important for efficient initiation not only at AUG codons but also at a near-cognate UUG codon, whereas eIF1 binding in virtually the same location on the 40S platform destabilizes the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state and enforces a requirement for the perfect codon:anticodon duplex formed at AUG codons.</p><p>We found that introducing basic Lys or Arg residues at G29, N30, and E26, which should increase electrostatic attraction between eIF5-NTD loop-2 and the codon:anticodon helix, had the opposite effects of acidic substitutions at G29 and N30 at UUG codons, increasing the UUG:AUG initiation ratio <italic>in vivo</italic>, and favoring/stabilizing the closed PIC conformation and increasing the rate of P<sub>i</sub> release at UUG codons in vitro.

These results seem to indicate that increasing electrostatic attraction with loop-2 can stabilize mismatched codon:anticodon duplexes and thereby promote initiation at near-cognate start codons. However, G31R does not increase initiation at other near-cognate triplets besides UUG <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1997</xref>), and it disfavors the closed PIC conformation and slows down P<sub>i</sub> release at AUG codons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Thus, the putative electrostatic stabilization seems to apply exclusively to the mismatched UUG:anticodon duplex and not those formed by other near-cognates, and to have the opposite effect on the perfect codon:anticodon helix formed at AUG. More work is required to understand the molecular basis of this exquisite specificity of basic loop-2 substitutions for UUG codons as well as the relative specificity for other non-canonical start codons.</p><p>The affinity of eIF1 for the free 40S subunit is ~30 fold higher than that of the eIF5-NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>), which would favor initial binding of eIF1 over eIF5.

This effect of overexpressed eIF1 implies that eIF1 dissociation from the PIC does not necessarily lead to an immediate release of P<sub>i</sub>, an irreversible reaction; a fast rate of eIF1 re-binding driven by mass action can allow resumption of scanning and prevent P<sub>i</sub> release, consistent with the faster rate of eIF1 release than P<sub>i</sub> release from WT PICs reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>). By the same logic, overexpressed eIF5 would decrease reassociation of eIF1 through increased competition with the eIF5-NTD for binding to the 40S platform, and thus stimulate P<sub>i</sub> release at poor initiation sites. In addition to increasing competition by the eIF5-NTD with eIF1 for 40S-binding, eIF5 overexpression might also enhance the ability of the eIF5-CTD to more actively evict eIF1 from the 40S by competing for binding to the beta subunit of eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nanda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The inference that P<sub>i</sub> release does not occur immediately on eIF1 dissociation is also supported by evidence of a functional interaction between the eIF5-NTD and eIF1A-CTT, involving movement of these domains towards one another in the PIC, which is required for rapid P<sub>i</sub> release on AUG recognition following the dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>). We previously speculated that movement of the eIF5-NTD toward eIF1A on AUG recognition would involve replacement of eIF1 with eIF5-NTD on the platform, based on the structural similarity between eIF1 and the eIF5-NTD and also evidence that eIF1 is in proximity to the eIF1A-CTT in the open, scanning conformation of the PIC but moves away from eIF1A on AUG recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maag et al., 2005</xref>) at essentially the same rate that the eIF5-NTD and eIF1A-CTT move towards one another in the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of the eIF5-NTD on the platform observed here in the closed py48S-eIF5N complex, in essentially the same location occupied by eIF1 in the 40S·eIF1·eIF1A and py48S-open complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>), provides strong structural evidence supporting our previous hypothetical model.</p><p>The GAP activity of eIF5 is dependent on Arg15 at the N-terminal end of the NTD. Although Arg15 is in the vicinity of the GDPCP bound to eIF2γ in py48S-eIF5N, it is too distant to function in stimulating GTP hydrolysis. Previous evidence indicates that GTP hydrolysis can occur in the scanning PIC and that P<sub>i</sub> release rather than hydrolysis per se is the step of the reaction most highly stimulated by AUG recognition. The position of eIF5-NTD in our structure is compatible with the notion that GTP hydrolysis has already occurred by the time the eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the platform because the eIF5-NTD is engaged with the codon:anticodon helix rather than the GTP-binding pocket of eIF2γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Movement of the eIF5-NTD into the eIF1-binding site might be the trigger that releases P<sub>i</sub> from eIF2γ and could be the movement detected previously that brings the eIF5-NTD closer to the eIF1A-CTT upon start-codon recognition, a conformational change that is crucial for allowing P<sub>i</sub> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of eIF1 on the 40S platform of the scanning PIC would potentially block access of the eIF5-NTD to the GTP molecule bound to eIF2γ. However, Arg15 resides within an extended NTT devoid of secondary structure that would likely be flexible enough to allow insertion of Arg15 into the eIF2γ GTP-binding pocket when the eIF5-NTD is tethered to the PIC via known interactions of the eIF5-CTD with the eIF3c NTD or eIF2β NTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luna et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The more accommodated position of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> and its tilting toward the 40S body observed with eIF5-NTD bound at the P site in py48S-eIF5N appears to set the stage for the binding of eIF5B and attendant subunit joining, as this tRNA<sub>i</sub> location/conformation is similar to that found in 80S initiation complexes with bound eIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study indicates that eIF5 and eIF5B cooperate in recognition of the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pisareva and Pisarev, 2014</xref>). The stabilizing effect of the eIF5-NTD on the more fully accommodated/tilted conformation of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site may form the basis of cooperation between eIF5 and eIF5B in recognition of AUG codons. In fact, the presence of the eIF5-NTD on the platform does not seem to impose any steric hindrance to the binding of eIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the tRNA<sub>i</sub> conformation in the py48S-eIF5N complex closely resembles that observed in bacterial translation initiation complexes containing IF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hussain et al., 2016</xref>), the eIF5B homolog, suggesting that the processes of tRNA<sub>i</sub> accommodation in the P site converge on a similar position and orientation of tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the final stages of eukaryotic and bacterial translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,C,D</xref>). The mRNA path in the mRNA channel, mainly from −8 to +4 positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F,G</xref>), is also surprisingly similar between bacterial and eukaryotic initiation complexes.</p><p>Both major subdomains of eIF3 are visible in py48S-eIF5N almost exclusively on the solvent side of the 40S, as previously observed in mammalian 43S structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">des Georges et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>) and the yeast 40S-eIF1-eIF1A-eIF3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aylett et al., 2015</xref>). The eIF3a-eIF3c PCI domain is located at the mRNA exit tunnel and seen for the first time interacting with the −12 to −14 mRNA nucleotides, consistent with our recent biochemical analyses implicating the eIF3a-NTD in interaction with this region of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitken et al., 2016</xref>). The quaternary complex of eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cterm is located near the mRNA entry channel in the vicinity of the +12 to+17 mRNA nucleotides, which is also consistent with the same biochemical studies. Comparison of py48S-eIF5N to the previous py48S-open and py48S-closed structures containing eIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>) reveals a dramatic alteration of the position of eIF3b β-propeller, which moves from the entry channel on the solvent side in py48S-eIF5N to communicate directly with initiation factors on the interface surface of the 40S subunit in py48S-open and py48S-closed complexes. We originally interpreted the density map of py48S-closed as indicating binding of the eIF3i β-propeller in association with the 3g-NTD and 3b-CTD beneath the eIF2γ subunit of TC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). More recently it was suggested that the drum-like density attributed to the 3i β-propeller is actually the larger β-propeller of 3b, and that the density in contact with eIF1 is the 3b-RRM rather than the eIF3c-NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simonetti et al., 2016</xref>). Based on a more recent, higher resolution map of a new py48S-open complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Llácer et al., 2018</xref>); PDB 6GSM) we agree with these reassignments. The position of the eIF3b RRM at the interface surface of the py48S-open and -closed complexes, where it can contact eIF1, would clash with the eIF5-NTD bound to the platform in place of eIF1 in py48S-eIF5N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>), which likely contributes to relocation of the eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cterm module to the 40S solvent side, as observed here in the py48S-eIF5N complex.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39273.029</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>eIF3 relocates back to the solvent-exposed surface of 40S.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Modeling of the eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cterm quaternary complex observed in py48S-closed-eIF3 (PDB 6GSN) at the subunit interface of py48S-eIF5N. The location of eIF5-NTD in the latter complex seems to be incompatible with this position of eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cterm at the subunit interface, clashing with it at multiple points (highlighted with black arrows).

Thus, the view emerges that transition of the eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cterm module from the solvent side to the interface side of the 40S occurs at the commencement of the scanning process and is reversed following AUG recognition and the replacement of eIF1 by the eIF5-NTD on the 40S platform.</p><p>Although conformational changes in eIF3 subunits may play a role in the transition between the open and closed states of the PIC, we did not previously observe an effect of eIF3 on the kinetics of eIF1A dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maag et al., 2006</xref>) or P<sub>i</sub> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Algire et al., 2005</xref>) in the reconstituted system when PICs were assembled on the unstructured 43-mer model mRNA. It will be interesting in future studies to determine the effect of eIF3 and its subunits on these parameters with PICs assembled on natural mRNAs in the presence of the eIF4 factors.</p><p>The results of this study allow us to propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) of probable steps in translation initiation after the recognition of the start codon but prior to the subunit joining. Base pairing of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> with the AUG start codon in the P<sub>IN</sub> state of the closed conformation of the 48S PIC weakens eIF1 binding to the 40S subunit. Following eIF1 dissociation and attendant loss of its interaction with the eIF3b RRM, the eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cter module relocates back to the solvent side of the 40S and allows binding of the eIF5-NTD at the site vacated by eIF1. The Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> binds more deeply in the P site and tilts towards the 40S body in a manner stabilized by extensive interactions of eIF5-NTD loop-1/loop-2 residues with the AUG:anticodon duplex. The eIF5-NTD also prevents re-binding of eIF1 and a return to the scanning conformation of the PIC. As proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nanda et al., 2013</xref>), the eIF5-NTD functionally interacts with the eIF1A-CTT to permit irreversible P<sub>i</sub> release and subsequent dissociation of eIF2-GDP. eIF5B is recruited via interaction with the extreme C-terminus of the eIF1A-CTT, captures the accommodated tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site and stimulates joining of the 60S subunit to produce the 80S initiation complex, leading to the final stage of initiation.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39273.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of major conformational changes during initiation.</title><p>(<bold>I</bold>) Binding of eIF1, eIF1A and eIF3 to the 40S subunit facilitates TC binding in the P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation to form the 43S PIC. The disordered NTT of eIF1A is shown as a dashed line. eIF2β and 3 c N-term were not resolved in this complex. (II) Upon mRNA recruitment facilitated by the upward movement of the 40S head (and also Met-tRNAi; shown by black arrows), which expands the mRNA entry channel, eIF3 undergoes major conformational changes and the eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cterm module is repositioned from its initial position on the solvent exposed face of the 40S to the subunit-interface (shown by a pink arrow), contacting eIF2γ and eIF1. These contacts, together with eIF2β contacts with eIF1 and Met-tRNAi, probably stabilize this open scanning-competent conformation of the PIC (py48S-open). eIF2β is semitransparent overlapping eIF1.) (III) After recognition of the start codon, the 40S head moves downward (shown by a black arrow) to clamp in the mRNA and the ASL of the Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> goes deeper into the P site (P<sub>IN</sub> state). eIF2β loses contact with eIF1 and Met-tRNAi and moves away to interact with the 40S head, the NTT of eIF1A stabilizes the codon:anticodon duplex, and eIF2α-D1 interacts with the −3 position of mRNA in the E site. eIF1 is also slightly displaced by Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> from its original position on the 40S platform (shown by a cyan arrow). (IV) Base pairing of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> with the AUG start codon in the P<sub>IN</sub> state and Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> tilting toward the 40S body (shown by a green arrow) weakens eIF1 binding to the 40S subunit causing eIF1 dissociation and, consequently, the eIF3b/eIF3i/eIF3g/eIF3a-Cter module relocates back to the solvent side of the 40S (shown by a pink arrow) and the eIF5-NTD binds at the site vacated by eIF1 (shown by a light cyan arrow) and stabilizes this Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> conformation through extensive interactions of eIF5-NTD loop-1/loop-2 residues with the AUG:anticodon duplex.

The PIC was formed with 15 nM eIF1A-Fl (fluorescein-tagged eIF1A), 1 μM eIF1, 1 μM WT or mutant eIF5, 120 nM 40S subunits, 10 μM unstructured 43-mer model mRNA (GGAA(UC)<sub>7</sub>UNUG(CU)<sub>10</sub>C, where NUG is either AUG or UUG), 300 nM eIF2, 150 nM tRNA<sub>i</sub> and 0.5 mM GDPNP•Mg<sup>2+</sup> in 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM potassium acetate, 3 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, and 2 mM DTT. Reactions were incubated at 26°C for 45 min and fluorescence anisotropy (R<sub>bound</sub>) was measured in Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Horiba). The fluorescein fluorophore was excited at 497 nm and fluorescence anisotropy was monitored at 520 nm. Dissociation of eIF1A-Fl was initiated by addition of a chase consisting of 100-fold excess (1 μM) unlabeled eIF1A and the change in fluorescence anisotropy of eIF1A-Fl was measured over time for up to 3 hr. Anisotropy values were plotted as a function of time and data were fit with a double-exponential decay equation. The individual curves were than end-point normalized, based on the endpoints calculated from the raw curves. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The values of kinetic parameters calculated from the eIF1A dissociation curves has been presented as means ± average deviations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>P<sub>i</sub> release kinetics</title><p>The kinetics of P<sub>i</sub> release from reconstituted 43S PICs in response to start-codon recognition was measured using a rapid-quench device (Kintek) as decribed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saini et al., 2014</xref>). TC was formed at 4X concentration: 3.2 μM eIF2 or Sui3-2 eIF2, 3.2 μM tRNA<sub>i</sub> and 250 pM γ[<sup>32</sup>P]-GTP in 1X recon buffer (30 mM HEPES•KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mM KOAc, 3 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub> and 2 mM DTT). 4X ribosomal complex was made using 800 nM 40S subunits, 3.2 μM eIF1, and 3.2 μM eIF1A. TC and ribosomal complex were mixed in equal volumes to make 2X PIC. Reactions were then initiated in a quench flow with an equal volume of a solution of 2 μM WT or mutant eIF5 and 20 μM model mRNA (AUG or UUG) in recon buffer and quenched at different times with 0.1 M EDTA. The samples were then run on PEI-cellulose TLC plates using 0.4 M KPO<sub>4</sub> buffer (pH 3.4) as the mobile phase. This was followed by phosphorimager analysis to quantify the fraction of GTP hydrolyzed over time. The data were fit with a double exponential rate equation. The first phase corresponds to GTP hydrolysis and the second-phase corresponds to to P<sub>i</sub> release that drives the reaction forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Algire et al., 2005</xref>). All experiments were done at least in duplicate and the kinetic parameter for P<sub>i</sub> release are reported as means ± average deviations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data resources</title><p>Five maps have been deposited in the EMDB with accession codes EMDB: 4328, EMDB: 4330, EMDB: 4331, EMDB: 4327, EMDB: 4329, for the sample one map, Map A, Map B, Map C1 and Map C2, respectively.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Translational initiation factor eIF5 replaces eIF1 on the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote start-codon recognition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We have received the comments from three experts in the field all of whom agree that this manuscript detailing the contributions of eIF5 to the accuracy of start codon selection in eukaryotes during the later stages of initiation has sufficient merit for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. All three reviewers commented on the strength of the study in using a wide breadth of approaches to support their conclusions about the critical role of eIF5 in replacing eIF1 to stabilize AUG start codons (relative to non-optimal start codons). Importantly, all three commented on the claim that the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GDPCP allowed the authors to visualize a post-GTP hydrolysis state – either this conclusion needs to be better supported or articulated, or a more complete coverage of the possibilities moved to the Discussion section of the manuscript. Finally, it was generally felt that the manuscript was overly long and somewhat hard to follow, this being in part a problem of terminology (Sui and Ssu, for example) and in part the need for more schematics detailing some of the experiments. Some broad suggestions for revision are included in the reviewer comments. In light of this broad agreement by the reviewers on the importance of this study, we recommend that this manuscript will be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once the reviewer comments are addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Llácer and colleagues report cryo-EM structures of pre-initiation 48S complexes, supplemented by biochemical and mutational analyses. This work shows that eIF5 binds in place of eIF1, next to Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, to stabilize an initiation complex on the AUG codon. β-hairpin 1 of eIF5 interacts with the codon-anticodon helix. Mutations of this region of eIF5 change the specificity toward the AUG codon and affect the equilibrium between the open and closed PIC on the AUG vs. the near-start UUG codon. These conclusions are made using a range of approaches, including mutant cell growth, monitoring dissociation of fluorescently labeled eIF1A, and monitoring the kinetics of phosphate release from eIF2. These approaches reveal similar results, strengthening the mechanistic implications of eIF5 made using the cryo-EM structures. In addition, the authors resolve and reassign the positions of several subunits of the elusive large eIF3 and describe their detailed interactions with both the 5' and 3' ends of the well-resolved mRNA fragment at the mRNA exit and entry tunnels, respectively.</p><p>Overall, this is a strong and well-written manuscript, which provides critical insights into the role of eIF5 in the mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation. The following questions should be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The eIF5-bound structure is interpreted as &quot;post-release&quot;, despite the presence of non-hydrolyzable GDPCP in eIF2. This interpretation is based on the position of the catalytic R15 and interaction of eIF5 with the codon-anticodon helix. But could this complex represent a pre-hydrolysis state? In this work, rates of dissociation of eIF1A are faster than or similar to those of P<sub>i</sub> release – could this be consistent with the idea of this complex representing a pre-hydrolysis state? It would be good if authors discuss this possibility and suggest what would trigger the movement of the GTPase and R15 toward each other to catalyze GTP hydrolysis.</p><p>2) Kinetic data with fitted curves shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, do not have error bars, whereas the legend for Figure 4 says &quot;errors are calculated as average deviation&quot;. With some points falling off the curve, it is unlikely that two measurements for each point were nearly identical. Authors should add error bars or comment on their absence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors present evidence for how the accuracy of start codon selection in eukaryotes is achieved, in later stages of the translation initiation process. They use cryo-EM reconstructions, yeast genetics, and biophysical assays to identify how the N-terminus of eukaryotic initiation factor 5 (eIF5) replaces eIF1 to stabilize AUG start codons, as opposed to non-optimal start codons such as UUG. The high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of partial yeast 48S preinitiation complexes (PICs) reveal the positioning of the N-terminus of eIF5 next to the start codon-anticodon interaction, and movement of tRNA<sub>i</sub> into a position more compatible with later steps of subunit joining mediated by eIF5B. This &quot;closed&quot; state (P<sub>IN</sub>) of the PIC helps explain a number of prior genetic and biochemical and biophysical observations that are augmented here by site-directed mutagenesis of two β-hairpin loops in eIF5 seen in the structure at high resolution.</p><p>Genetically, the authors use established genetic systems in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that are either error-prone (Sui<sup>-</sup>) or hyperaccurate (Ssu<sup>-</sup>) in terms of start codon selection. They find that charged amino acids at the tips of the eIF5-NTD β-hairpins have important roles in modulating the accuracy of start codon selection, as indicated by the ratio of UUG:AUG start codon usage. Positively charged amino acids induce a more error-prone phenotype, whereas negatively charged amino acids cause start codon selection to become hyperaccurate.</p><p>The authors then use biochemical and biophysical assays to test how mutations in the eIF5-NTD affect eIF1 release from PICs, and rates of P<sub>i</sub> release, which is thought to occur after start codon recognition and to be gated by eIF1 release. These assays provide complementary supporting evidence for the interpretations of the genetic experiments. They support the idea that favorable eIF5-NTD interactions with the mRNA:tRNA-anticodon stem loop (ASL) at the start codon drives PIC closure, from P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> conformations, which then locks the PIC in a &quot;committed&quot; state of initiation.</p><p>Finally, the authors circle back to describe some additional features of the structure that they observe here, i.e. interactions along the mRNA and the Kozak sequence, and the positioning of parts of eIF3 in the present and prior structures.</p><p>Overall, this paper has potential to provide a compelling view of the late stage of initiation dependent on eIF5. Although it has been known that the eIF5-NTD has high homology to eIF1, the structures presented here, accompanied by genetic and biophysical/biochemical data, provides a mechanistic view of why these homologies matter in translation initiation.</p><p>That being said, the paper in its present form is overly long and hard to follow. It is too technically written in many parts, and the Discussion section is too long given the highlights of the paper. Some thoughts on how the paper could be improved are described below.</p><p>1) The authors use non-hydrolyzable GDPCP in their structural studies and see that the R15 from the eIF5-NTD is far from the bound nucleotide in eIF2. Yet, they jump to the conclusion that their structure represents the state of the 48S PIC after GTP hydrolysis (subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site”). This is not at all clear from the structural results. Interpretation of this sort should be postponed until the Discussion section, where the authors should make their case more clearly.</p><p>2) Somewhere in the figures, the authors should provide extreme close-up views of the tips of the β-hairpins in eIF5-NTD, with the 3.0 Å density. Figure 1—figure supplement 3 is not adequate in this regard. Please include labels for the relevant amino acids.</p><p>3) The authors have to use composite maps and focused classification to identify peripheral elements of the PIC complexes, either due to low occupancy or structural disorder. For these reasons, it is not appropriate to spend too much effort or space interpreting these peripheral elements. For example, is the positioning of eIF3b/g/i observed due to the formaldehyde crosslinking of some of the particles? What about the positioning of the PCI regions of eIF3? It would be hard to say given how the data were merged. Additionally, the resolutions obtained in the present maps do not allow for the modeling required describing eIF3 in Figure 8 and Figure 9, and in the model in Figure 10. As part of their analysis, the authors cite Simonetti et al. (2016), however this paper does not report a bona fide initiation complex. As it is, the misinterpretation of ABCE1 as eIF3 was described in Mancera-Martínez et al. (2017) and in Heuer et al. (2017).</p><p>4) Instead of focusing on eIF3, the authors should show more of the mRNA path, i.e. provide zoom-ins for Figure 6 and Figure 7. This would be helpful given how much of the mRNA the authors see.</p><p>5) The genetic data are very hard to follow, due to the use of technical terms that will not be familiar to a general audience. The authors should define Sui<sup>-</sup> as error-prone (or hypoaccurate, if they prefer that term) in terms of start codon selection whenever it is used, i.e. &quot;error-prone Sui<sup>-</sup> mutatations&quot;. Similarly, Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations should be described as hyperaccurate whenever the term is used. Although this may seem redundant, it would help readers follow the flow.</p><p>6) Related to point 5, it would be most helpful to have schematics showing how the genetic experiments work, as figure supplements.</p><p>7) For the biochemical/biophysical assays of P<sub>i</sub> release and eIF1 release, the authors should provide schematics of how the assays work, and what the different components of the kinetic fitting report. For example, it is hard to know what the a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>bound</sub> parameters mean with respect to start codon selection without having to spend many times rereading the text.</p><p>8) The changes in R<sub>bound</sub> are not meaningful without some sense of the errors in the measurements.</p><p>9) For the methods, unless Saini et al. (2014) is complete and doesn't refer to prior publications itself, the authors should provide the methods for the P<sub>i</sub> and eIF1 release assays here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>While it has been known for some time that eIF5 contributes to start site fidelity, the molecular mechanism to explain this phenomenon is poorly defined. To address this, the authors have used an impressive array of approaches (cryo-EM, biophysical assays, and genetics) to reveal how the N-terminal domain of eIF5 binds to the 40S subunit in place of eIF1 after its dissociation upon start site recognition. The binding of eIF5 to this position on the 40S promotes an altered Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> binding conformation, which ensures stringent start site selection. The structural model is appropriately tested using powerful biophysical and genetic assays. Overall, this is an important study that will move the field forward and I have only minor suggestions to help make some parts of the manuscript clearer to a broad audience.</p><p>It is stated that the position of eIF5-NTD likely represents a post P<sub>i</sub> release state (subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site”). This is based on the fact that Arg15 in eIF5-NTD, which is the catalytic residue for the GAP activity, is too far from eIF2 bound GDPCP to interact with. However, the genetic and biochemical assays indicate that the interaction between eIF5-NTD and the tRNA<sub>i</sub>-ASL is important for the fidelity of start codon recognition. If the eIF5-NTD-ASL interaction occurs after P<sub>i</sub> release (in other word, after the start site has been selected), shouldn't the mutations affect start codon recognition no matter which type of codon invoked P<sub>i</sub> release? The authors later discuss that movement of eIF5-NTD toward this binding site may trigger P<sub>i</sub> release (Discussion section), which is perhaps more realistic. Perhaps the authors can address this apparent inconsistency in the main text to avoid confusion.</p><p>The authors cite their previous study (which then partially sites another previous study) to describe the in vitro biochemical assays in the Materials and methods. It is therefore not clearly explained what factors were actually included in these assays. For example, the authors state in Figure 4 that a 43S-mRNA complex is used, but it is not clear that eIF3 is actually in the complex. If eIF3 is not present (which seems to be the case in the authors' previous start site selection kinetic assays), would its presence alter the kinetics? The authors need to more clearly state what is or is not present in the biochemical assays (and clearly state limitations of the assays if eIF3 is indeed missing) to avoid any possible confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39273.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Overall, this is a strong and well-written manuscript, which provides critical insights into the role of eIF5 in the mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation.

Rather, the change in eIF1A dissociation rates is only a proxy for the alterations in eIF1A affinity that occurs between the open and closed states of the PIC.</p><p>GTP hydrolysis (without P<sub>i</sub> release) is known to occur in the scanning PIC prior to AUG recognition, and the absence of eIF1 in the structure plus the more fully accommodated position of tRNA<sub>i</sub> indicates that both scanning and AUG recognition have already occurred. Accordingly, GTP hydrolysis also would have already been stimulated by eIF5-R15. We believe that the GDPCP is mimicking the GDP-P<sub>i</sub> state following GTP hydrolysis; however, P<sub>i</sub> release cannot occur despite the absence of eIF1. We have removed the first mention of GDPCP and we have revised the sentence in subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site” that may have been misleading the reader. The following sentence is also added to the aforementioned subsection to make our meaning clearer to the reader:</p><p>“Given that GTP hydrolysis occurs in the scanning complex but P<sub>i</sub> release requires eIF1 dissociation (Algire et al., 2005), and noting that eIF1 is absent and replaced by eIF5-NTD, we presume that this complex represents a state following both GTP hydrolysis and eIF1 dissociation but that the use of non-hydrolyzable GDPCP has prevented P<sub>i</sub> release”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Kinetic data with fitted curves shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, do not have error bars, whereas the legend for Figure 4 says &quot;errors are calculated as average deviation&quot;. With some points falling off the curve, it is unlikely that two measurements for each point were nearly identical. Authors should add error bars or comment on their absence.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinetic curves shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 are representative curves from at least 2 independent experiments. Table 4 and Table 5 show the average values of each measured kinetic parameter derived from the individual experiments. The errors are presented in the Tables and represent average deviations of the mean values. We have now clarified these points and thank the reviewer for bringing this inaccuracy to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Overall, this paper has potential to provide a compelling view of the late stage of initiation dependent on eIF5. Although it has been known that the eIF5-NTD has high homology to eIF1, the structures presented here, accompanied by genetic and biophysical/biochemical data, provides a mechanistic view of why these homologies matter in translation initiation.</p><p>That being said, the paper in its present form is overly long and hard to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version we have shortened the manuscript and made modifications to make it easier to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is too technically written in many parts, and the Discussion section is too long given the highlights of the paper. Some thoughts on how the paper could be improved are described below.</p><p>1) The authors use non-hydrolyzable GDPCP in their structural studies and see that the R15 from the eIF5-NTD is far from the bound nucleotide in eIF2. Yet, they jump to the conclusion that their structure represents the state of the 48S PIC after GTP hydrolysis (subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site”). This is not at all clear from the structural results. Interpretation of this sort should be postponed until the Discussion section, where the authors should make their case more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this. We have answered this above (Comment 1 of reviewer 1). In short, we have removed a sentence and modified a sentence in subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site”. These modifications should make our meaning clearer to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Somewhere in the figures, the authors should provide extreme close-up views of the tips of the β-hairpins in eIF5-NTD, with the 3.0 Å density. Figure 1—figure supplement 3 is not adequate in this regard. Please include labels for the relevant amino acids.</p></disp-quote><p>New figure (as Figure 2—figure supplement 2) showing density of hairpins of eIF5-NTD is now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have to use composite maps and focused classification to identify peripheral elements of the PIC complexes, either due to low occupancy or structural disorder. For these reasons, it is not appropriate to spend too much effort or space interpreting these peripheral elements. For example, is the positioning of eIF3b/g/i observed due to the formaldehyde crosslinking of some of the particles? What about the positioning of the PCI regions of eIF3? It would be hard to say given how the data were merged.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the text, we present only the position of the eIF3 or peripheral elements in brief without going into the details. We have removed sentences about the conformational changes and Figure 8C-E from the manuscript.</p><p>The details of the data processing and how the selected particles from each data set were combined are presented in the Materials and methods section and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We have also made a few modifications in the Materials and methods section to make our procedures clearer to the reader.</p><p>The maps obtained with and without crosslinker are almost identical and superimpose very well. We have included a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 6) in the manuscript to make this point. All eIF3 elements are observed without the use of crosslinker as well, and in identical positions. It is mentioned in Materials and methods section that crosslinker did not affect the conformation of eIF3 in the complex, but only increased the occupancy of eIF3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the resolutions obtained in the present maps do not allow for the modeling required describing eIF3 in Figure 8 and Figure 9, and in the model in Figure 10.</p></disp-quote><p>The present maps do not allow for ‘de novo’ modelling for atomic coordinates, as the referee has correctly pointed out. However, rigid body fitting of known eIF3 subunit structures is possible and we have done that. There is no ‘de novo’ modelling involved. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have removed figures (Figure 8C-E) and statements about conformational changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As part of their analysis, the authors cite Simonetti et al. (2016), however this paper does not report a bona fide initiation complex. As it is, the misinterpretation of ABCE1 as eIF3 was described in Mancera-Martínez et al. (2017) and in Heuer et al. (2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion. We have removed the citation from the Introduction where initiation complexes are mentioned. However, we have kept the citation in the Discussion section where the position of the eIF3b WD domain on the subunit interface is mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Instead of focusing on eIF3, the authors should show more of the mRNA path, i.e. provide zoom-ins for Figure 6 and Figure 7. This would be helpful given how much of the mRNA the authors see.</p></disp-quote><p>Zoomed in view of the mRNA path is shown in Figure 6C (at P site), Figure 6D (at A site), Figure 7A (mRNA channel exit) and Figure 7B (mRNA channel entry) as insets.</p><p>We have made the insets in Figure 7A bigger and also added more labels for ribosomal components and residue numbers of eIF3a that are in proximity to the mRNA path.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5). The genetic data are very hard to follow, due to the use of technical terms that will not be familiar to a general audience. The authors should define Sui<sup>-</sup> as error-prone (or hypoaccurate, if they prefer that term) in terms of start codon selection whenever it is used, i.e. &quot;error-prone Sui<sup>-</sup> mutatations&quot;. Similarly, Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations should be described as hyperaccurate whenever the term is used. Although this may seem redundant, it would help readers follow the flow.</p></disp-quote><p>The terms hypoaccurate/hypoaccuracy and hyperaccurate/hyperaccuracy have now been used in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Related to point 5, it would be most helpful to have schematics showing how the genetic experiments work, as figure supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>A schematic figure (figure 3—figure supplement 1) explaining the genetic experiments is now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For the biochemical/biophysical assays of P<sub>i</sub> release and eIF1 release, the authors should provide schematics of how the assays work, and what the different components of the kinetic fitting report. For example, it is hard to know what the a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>bound</sub> parameters mean with respect to start codon selection without having to spend many times rereading the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added schematics of the eIF1A dissociation and P<sub>i</sub> release assays in Figure 4 and Figure 5, as suggested. We have also added indicators in parentheses for the relevant values in Table 4 (open or closed) to indicate which state each corresponds to. In addition, we have added footnotes to the K<sub>amp</sub> and R<sub>bound</sub> columns to indicate what each corresponds to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The changes in R<sub>bound</sub> are not meaningful without some sense of the errors in the measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>Average deviations of R<sub>bound</sub> values for two independent experiments have been shown as errors in Table 4A and Table 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) For the methods, unless Saini et al. (2014) is complete and doesn't refer to prior publications itself, the authors should provide the methods for the P<sub>i</sub> and eIF1 release assays here.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments were done under the same conditions with the same parameters as represented in Saini et al. (2014). However, for maximal transparency, we have now added the experimental details to the text, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Overall, this is an important study that will move the field forward and I have only minor suggestions to help make some parts of the manuscript clearer to a broad audience.</p><p>It is stated that the position of eIF5-NTD likely represents a post P<sub>i</sub> release state (subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site”). This is based on the fact that Arg15 in eIF5-NTD, which is the catalytic residue for the GAP activity, is too far from eIF2 bound GDPCP to interact with. However, the genetic and biochemical assays indicate that the interaction between eIF5-NTD and the tRNA<sub>i</sub>-ASL is important for the fidelity of start codon recognition. If the eIF5-NTD-ASL interaction occurs after P<sub>i</sub> release (in other word, after the start site has been selected), shouldn't the mutations affect start codon recognition no matter which type of codon invoked P<sub>i</sub> release? The authors later discuss that movement of eIF5-NTD toward this binding site may trigger P<sub>i</sub> release (Discussion section), which is perhaps more realistic. Perhaps the authors can address this apparent inconsistency in the main text to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this. We have answered this point above (Comment 1 of reviewer 1). In short, we have removed a sentence and modified a sentence in subsection “The eIF5-NTD replaces eIF1 on the 40S platform near the P site”. These modifications should make our meaning clearer to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors cite their previous study (which then partially sites another previous study) to describe the in vitro biochemical assays in the Materials and methods. It is therefore not clearly explained what factors were actually included in these assays. For example, the authors state in Figure 4 that a 43S-mRNA complex is used, but it is not clear that eIF3 is actually in the complex. If eIF3 is not present (which seems to be the case in the authors' previous start site selection kinetic assays), would its presence alter the kinetics? The authors need to more clearly state what is or is not present in the biochemical assays (and clearly state limitations of the assays if eIF3 is indeed missing) to avoid any possible confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Biochemical assays were done using an unstructured poly(UC) 43-mer mRNA that has a central AUG or UUG codon. We have previously shown that the presence of eIF3 in this reconstituted system with an unstructured model mRNA does not alter the rate of eIF1A dissociation (Maag et al., 2006) or P<sub>i</sub> release (Algire et al., 2005)and thus eIF3 was not used in these assays. We have added text to the Discussion section making this caveat clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
