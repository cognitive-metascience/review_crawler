Here, we discovered that, in the developing neuron from rat, Akt signaling regulates axon growth and growth cone formation through phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2). This enhances Id2 protein stability by means of escape from proteasomal degradation, and steers its localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin that is critical for growth cone formation. Knockdown of <italic>Id2,</italic> or abrogation of Id2 phosphorylation at S14, greatly impairs axon growth and the architecture of growth cone. Intriguingly, reinstatement of Akt/Id2 signaling after injury in mouse hippocampal slices redeemed growth promoting ability, leading to obvious axon regeneration. Our results suggest that Akt/Id2 signaling is a key module for growth cone formation and axon growth, and its augmentation plays a potential role in CNS axonal regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20799.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20799.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axon growth</kwd><kwd>AKT</kwd><kwd>Id2</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd><kwd>developing neuron</kwd><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2013R1A2A2A01005324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Jee-Yin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Akt mediated S14 phosphorylation of Id2 augments its protein stability and growth cone localization, promoting growth cone formation and axon growth in the developing neuron and contributing to axon regeneration in the damaged hippocampus slice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmental axon growth or axon regeneration requires active molecular machinery that regulates specific transcription factors, growth cone components, and mediators of signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fawcett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanabe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raivich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lasorella et al., 2006</xref>). Injured axons of the adult central nervous system (CNS) do not regenerate, because the ability to activate growth genes and growth cone substantially declines as neurons mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fawcett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandes and Tetzlaff, 2001</xref>), and the CNS environment is hostile to those processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Filbin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>). Neutralization of environmental inhibition is not sufficient for axon regeneration; therefore, elucidating intrinsic growth capacity and regulation of the neuron after injury is of critical importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yiu and He, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fawcett et al., 1992</xref>). Indeed, recent studies have proposed that reactivation of the intrinsic growth ability promotes CNS axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Teng and Tang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouquet and Nothias, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leibinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>). It has been proposed that the mechanisms involved in axonal regeneration of the mature CNS have many features in common with those important in CNS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harel and Strittmatter, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Ye, 2005</xref>), Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) signaling controls a variety of neuronal responses. It regulates both axon establishment and elongation both during development and in the regeneration of mature neurons through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). However, the mechanism of GSK3 control of peripheral axon regeneration is controversial and its function in CNS axon regeneration remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saijilafu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gobrecht et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Akt links a host of signaling molecules through activation of mTORC1, which regulates cap-dependent protein translation by inhibiting TSC1/2 to allow axon development, growth, and regeneration in CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morita and Sobue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2008</xref>). However, some evidence suggested an mTORC1 independent pathway that regulates axon regrowth in phosphatase and tensin homolog (<italic>Pten</italic>) deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), which causes aberrant activation of Akt signaling. Thus, although Akt signaling encompasses developmental regulation of the intrinsic neuronal growth and axon regeneration after injury, the roles and molecular mechanism of Akt signaling in the growth of CNS axons remain to be determined.</p><p>Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. During development, Id2 binds to bHLH transcription factors and hampers their ability to activate transcription of several growth inhibitory molecules and receptors, thus promoting axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson, 2006</xref>). Id2 degradation by a complex of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its activator Cdh1 (APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>) reduces axonal growth in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">StegmÃ¼ller and Bonni, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lasorella et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, protection from Id2 degradation results in erratic growth and an abnormal distribution of parallel fibers in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Konishi et al., 2004</xref>), while enhanced Id2 expression in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) promotes axonal growth after spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, Id2 contributes to axonal growth during development and may also be involved in the intrinsic inability of the injured axons to regenerate in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lasorella et al., 2006</xref>). However, to our knowledge the specific temporal and spatial signals that may regulate the molecular changes induced by Id2 are not yet understood.</p><p>In this study, we defined the role of Akt in regulating Id2 functions in axon growth during development and attempted to enhance Akt/Id2 signaling after injury to promote axon regeneration. We identified Id2, as a new binding partner and novel kinase substrate of Akt. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of serine 14 (S14) on Id2 augmented its protein stability through disruption of the association of Id2 and E3 ligase Cdh1. During neuronal differentiation, S14- phosphorylated Id2 is predominantly enriched in the growth cones at the axonal tips where it facilitates axonal growth. This contributed to the maintenance of the growth cone via interaction with radixin, one of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) family of proteins, which links F-actin to the plasma membrane. Moreover, in organotypic hippocampal slice culture, reactivation of Akt/Id2 signaling by adeno-associated virus (AAV) two after injury, prominently increased regrowth of axons, whereas ablation of Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Id2 caused failure in axonal regeneration. Our study suggests the molecular basis of intrinsic growth regulation of Akt/Id2 signaling and delineates the potential role of Akt/Id2 in CNS axonal regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Akt binds to Id2 and phosphorylates serine 14</title><p>Because of the multiple downstream effectors of Akt in both the neuronal soma and axon terminal, this pathway might coordinate different steps of axon growth during development. In an effort to identify downstream targets of the Akt signal that might be involved in the regulation of axon growth, we examined protein interaction profiles using proteomic analysis in PC12 cells stably transfected with a constitutively active (CA) form or a kinase-dead (KD) form of Akt. Interestingly, our proteomic analysis showed that Id2 is a potent binding partner of active Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, we found endogenous interaction between Akt and Id2 in mouse brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); the specific interaction was confirmed in mouse brain extract using purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Id2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Employing Flag-tagged Akt isoforms (Akt1-3), we verified that, among the three isoforms evaluated, Id2 interacts with Akt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our mapping analysis showed that the PH domain of Akt interacts with Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Based on our finding of a development-dependent decline in Akt/Id2 signaling, we wondered if Akt activation regulates Id2 stability by blocking its proteasomal degradation. Treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 protected against Id2 degradation, confirming that the reduction in Id2 level is facilitated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Overexpression of Cdh1 markedly reduced endogenous Id2 level; importantly, this effect was prevented by Akt expression in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In cortical neurons, Id2 protein level was proportionally increased with increased Akt level in the presence of Cdh1, indicating that Akt prevents Id2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Accordingly, polyubiquitination of Id2 was efficiently abrogated in the presence, but not in the absence of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that Akt regulates Id2 protein stability by preventing APC/C<sup>Cdh1</sup>-mediated degradation.</p><p>Id2 was found to be associated with Cdh1. However, the interaction between Id2 and Cdh1 weakened with increased Akt expression, whereas the interaction of Id2 with Akt increased, suggesting that Akt competes with Cdh1 to bind Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The half-life of Id2 was lower in a phospho-ablated mutant (GFP-S14A) that could not be phosphorylated by Akt than in GFP-Id2-WT-expressing cells, whereas a phospho-mimetic mutant (GFP-S14D) showed more stable expression after cycloheximide (CHX) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This implies that Akt protects Id2 from Cdh1-mediated proteasomal degradation through phosphorylation of Id2.</p><p>To further verify the importance of Id2 phosphorylation by Akt for protein stability, we introduced a phospho-ablated mutant or phospho-mimetic mutant of Id2, along with HA-Cdh1, into PC12 cells. While Id2-WT and Id2-S14D rarely bound to Cdh1, the phospho-ablated mutant form of Id2 largely showed enhanced association with Cdh1, reflecting its instability and weak detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Moreover, Id2-WT was found to be more stable in the presence of CA-Akt than in that of KD-Akt, while the Id2-S14A mutant was not stabilized by CA-Akt as it could not be phosphorylated. The protein level of phospho-mimetic Id2-S14D was highly stable regardless of whether CA-Akt or KD-Akt was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Furthermore, using Akt inhibitor VIII, a chemical inhibitor of Akt signaling, we showed a reduction of Id2 protein levels as its phosphorylation is decreased upon inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, whereas in the presence of PD184352, a chemical inhibitor of MAPK signaling, Id2 stability or phosphorylation is not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data suggest that Akt-dependent Id2 phosphorylation enhances resistance to Cdh1-mediated degradation of Id2, interrupting the interaction between Id2 and Cdh1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Phosphorylation of Id2 by akt is essential for augmentation of axon growth and branching</title><p>Akt has been shown to be predominantly localized at the tip of the axon in developing hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yan et al., 2006</xref>).

Cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV three were immunolabeled with neuron specific class III beta tubulin (Tuj1) antibody to assess the extent of axon growth. Ectopic expression of Id2-WT led to considerably better axon growth and branching than that of control; S14D expressing neurons showed more abundant branching and extended length of axon than did the control or Id2-WT expressing neurons, revealing high expression at the tip of axon and branching. In contrast, the phospho-ablated mutant (S14A)-expressing neurons exhibited substantially shorter extent of axon growth and less branching in primary cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Interestingly, we failed to detect GFP signal in the axonal tip of S14A expressing neurons despite no alteration of this signal in the soma, indicating lack of Id2 expression in the growth cone of the growing axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, third panel). Taken together, these data imply that Akt regulates axon growth and branching by regulating Id2 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylation is essential for Id2 localization in the growth cone and branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Akt regulates growth cone localization of Id2 in the developing neuron</title><p>As we found that Akt/Id2 accumulate in the axon tip and branching points in growing hippocampal neurons, and that Akt-mediated Id2 phosphorylation is essential for axonal growth and growth cone localization of Id2, we hypothesized that there might be spatial and temporal correlations between the expression and subcellular localization of Akt/Id2 with development of the growth cone. During the differentiation of hippocampal neurons, we found that prominent endogenous-Id2 expression occurred in the central domain of growth cone and partially colocalized with phalloidin-labeled F-actin, while S14-phospho-Id2 was localized on punctate structures all-around of the growth cone area and filopodia. S14-phospho-Id2 stained strongly in the growth cone leading edge and the peripheral domain, revealing notable co-distribution with phalloidin-labeled F-actin in the growing axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâC</xref>).Â To more accurately determine the role of Akt/Id2 signaling in the growth cone, we monitored Id2 and S14-phospho-Id2 expression as neuronal development proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In the early stage (stage 1: DIV 1) both Id2 and S14-phospho-Id2 were observed in the filopodial and lamellipodial structure of the leading margin. However, as the axon developed (stage II~III: DIV 2 and 3), Id2 was predominantly detected in the central microtubule-containing zone, demonstrating complete co-localization with beta tubulin, while S14-phospho-Id2 displayed a more intense signal at the peripheral-domain of growth cone, where there was relatively less beta tubulin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Stage determination was performed as previously described for hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). Moreover, quantitative analysis that determined the expression level of Id2 or S14-phospho-Id2 from soma to axonal tip, supported the notion that S14-phospho-Id2 is relatively enriched in the tip of the growth cone, with respect to that of Id2, as confirmed by fluorescence intensity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20799.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Akt regulates growth cone localization of Id2 in the developing neuron.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of growth cone, showing microtubule mostly in the central [C] region and F-actin based peripheral [P]region.

We infected the growing axon from hippocampal neuron (stage III) with either GFP-lentiviral control or GFP-lentiviral Id2-siRNA. Control GFP-expressing lentivirus-infected neurons showed normal growth cone architecture that was visualized with expression of radixin. However, knockdown of Id2 in the growing axon dramatically disrupted growth cone shape and cytoskeletal organization detected in neurons with reduced radixin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Quantitative analysis of neuronal response involving alteration of the growth cone indicated noticeable reduction of growth cone size and shortening of axon length, implicating the importance of Id2 expression in the growth cone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Accordingly, restoring Id2 signaling in the absence of endogenous Id2 expressing WT or S14D-Id2 rescued the deregulated axon growth. Conversely, RFP-vector control or S14A-Id2 mutant expression failed to rescue the effect of Id2 in the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the effect of the ablation of S14 phosphorylation on Id2 in the growth cone. In the growth cone of the stage III neuron, radixin was evidently visualized in the filopodia of the growth cone and S14-phospho-Id2 was concentrated in axonal tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Upon treatment of the hippocampal neuron (stage III) with an Akt inhibitor, we found that the number of radixin expressing filopodia was greatly diminished in the axonal growth cone. We also observed that the intensity of radixin staining, as well as the intensity of S14-phospho-Id2 staining, as following the treatment, was remarkably lower than that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This indicates that S14 phosphorylation is critical for the proper function of radixin in the growth cone. In addition, knockdown of radixin in the growing neuron induced alteration in growth cone morphology and size and reduced the number of filopodia. This phenomenon parallels the alteration of endogenous S14-phospho-Id2 distribution as a reduction of growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation did not alter the interaction between Id2 and E47 and both S14D and S14A mutants resulted in a repression of E47-activated luciferase activity similar to Id2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Moreover, employing Id2 constructs that cannot bind to E47 to antagonize transcriptional repression activity of Id2 showed that disruption of the HLH domain of Id1 by a substitution of proline to serine at position 74 or valine to proline at position 91 abolished its ability to inhibit E47 DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pesce and Benezra, 1993</xref>). By substituting proline with serine at position 51, or valine with proline at position 68 in the Id2 counterpart, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A,B</xref>), we demonstrated that although Id2 mutants (S51P or V68P) barely repress E47 transcriptional activity while Id2 WT successfully represses E47-mediated transcription displaying relatively high luciferase activity and the mRNA expression of Nogo receptor, one of well-known downstream gene of E47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3C,D</xref>), Akt-mediated phosphorylation mimetic mutation in either S51P (S14D/ S51P) or V68P (S14D/V68P) provoked axon growth and growth cone localization of these mutants (S14D/ S51P or S14D/V68P), and its effect resembled that of Id2 WT in the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3E,F</xref>), suggesting that Akt mediated S14 phosphorylation probably regulates Id2 apart from transcriptional repression regulation. Taken together, these data suggest that in addition to transcriptional repression of axonal inhibitory molecules in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perk et al., 2005</xref>), Id2 expression in the growing axonal growth cone is a decisive factor for normal growth cone formation and axon growth. These data also suggest that Akt may not simply regulates transcriptional repression of Id2, but also growth cone localization of Id2 that is crucial for its association with radixin in the growing axon, an association that contributes to growth cone function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Akt/Id2 signaling contributes to axon regeneration in injured hippocampal slices</title><p>Because we found that Akt/Id2 signaling is critical for axon growth and growth cone formation in developing neurons, but that this signaling declines after birth, we tested whether reinstatement of the intrinsic growth ability of neuron by introduction of Akt/Id2 signaling contributes to axon regeneration in postnatal hippocampus after injury. We generated AAV2-Id2 and phospho-ablated/mimetic mutants of Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and employed an entorhinal-hippocampus (EH) organotypic slice co-culture (OSC) method that results in well preserved cytoarchitecture, closely reflecting the corresponding maturation schedule in vivo and known as an effective method for the study of axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">del RÃ­o and Soriano, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation of Id2 augments protein stability of Id2 through interruption of the interaction between Id2 and Cdh1, thereby reducing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Id2. In the growing axon, Id2 is highly expressed at the branching point and axonal tip, leading to enhanced axon growth and branching through S14 phosphorylation. More importantly, Akt/Id2 signaling is essential for growth cone formation, interacting with radixin at the peripheral region of the growth cone. Giving hope for translating intrinsic axon growth regulators into treatment in CNS injury, introduction of AAV2-Id2 at the injured EH dramatically enhanced axon regrowth and infection with AAV2-Id2 with active Akt noticeably enhancing axon regrowth, whereas AAV2-Id2 with Akt inhibitor failed to promote axon regeneration. This would suggest that reintroduction of Akt/Id2 signaling in injured CNS neurons might be a useful therapeutic approach for promoting axon regeneration.</p><p>During embryonic development, axonal growth occurs through a highly specialized mechanism in which the leading edge of the growth cone explores the environment and consolidates the cytoskeleton in the appropriate direction of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley and O'Connor, 1994</xref>). Notably, the expression of Akt and Id2 occurs not only in the soma, where Id2 probably prevents expression of E47-induced anti-axonal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perk et al., 2005</xref>), but also at the branching point and the tip of the growing axon, revealing accumulation of S14-phospho-Id2 at the peripheral region of the growth cone, including the actin-rich periphery and filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figures 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figures 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figures 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> ). However, the role and regulation of Id2 in the growth cone has not been elucidated. Here we showed that ectopic expression of S14D-Id2 greatly enhances axon growth and branching, whereas S14A impairs axon growth and branching, rarely detecting growing distal axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, knockdown of Id2 from developing neuron (stage III) that have distinguishable axons, elicited growth cone collapse and subsequent interruption of axon growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Furthermore, interference in Id2 phosphorylation by Akt inhibitor demolished axonal growth cone structure including filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Thus, these finding suggest that, in addition to its role as transcriptional repressor during development of the hippocampal neuron, Id2 acts as downstream mediator of Akt signaling, dictating its protein stability and positioning at the growth cone, and thereby contributing to the proper growth cone formation and axon growth. However, further investigation would be required to determine how S14 phosphorylation of Id2 by Akt steers Id2 localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin, which might be critical for normal growth cone architecture.</p><p>How might Akt/Id2 signaling regulate axon growth and growth cone formation? The roles of Akt in axon growth and growth cone establishment, proposed in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2003</xref>): <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>), occurs mostly through the regulation of GSK3Î². However, an Akt-independent function of GSK3Î² in axon growth and polarization has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that other substrates of Akt may be implicated in axonal length regulation. On the other hand, mTORC1, another well-known downstream target of Akt, has been proposed to be another factor in axon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morita and Sobue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). However, a clear link between Akt mediated regulation of mTORC1 and axonal growth in the CNS neuron has not been directly established. In this study, we proposed Id2 as a novel downstream effector of Akt signaling in the developing CNS neuron. Akt confined S14-phospho-Id2 at the tip of the growing axon thereby allowing its interaction with radixin, which functions in growth cone morphology and motility. We further demonstrated that ablation of S14 phosphorylation of Id2 led to a failure to bind to radixin and altered growth cone morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), suggesting that, during neuronal development, Akt/Id2 signaling contributes to maintenance of the normal structure and functional organization of the growth cone, conceivably interacting with radixin, as S14D-Id2 failed to rescue the altered growth cone in the absence of radixin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). However, further investigation would be required to determine how S14 phosphorylation of Id2 by Akt steers Id2 localization to the growth cone, where Id2 interacts with radixin, which might be critical for normal growth cone architecture.</p><p>The ability of Id2 to promote axon growth and growth cone formation may be related to its ability to interact with components of the neuronal cytoskeletal machinery essential for establishment of neuron shape with a defined axon. We observed that phosphorylation by Akt, Id2 acts as an ERM binding protein, which bound F-actin and enriched the peripheral region of growth cone, while unphosphorylated Id2 predominantly localized in the central region of the growth cone where growing microtubule directed to actin network and, among Id family members (Id1-Id4), only Id2 possesses a SxIP motif-specific sequence to enable its interaction with end binding (EB) proteins and the most prominent microtubule (MT) plus end binding protein (+TIP), which promotes MT dynamicity and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coles and Bradke, 2015</xref>); thus, it is possible to conjecture that Id2 may act as +TIP thereby capable to crosslink the two filaments, actin and microtubule, during axon growth. Two independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arroyo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>), have speculated that both Akt1 and Id2 are interacting partners of cytoplasmic linker associated protein 2 (CLASP2), which is known to act +TIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beffert et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, in addition to radixin, Id2 also interacts with actin-associated enigma homolog (ENH) and is sequestered into the cytoplasm from nucleus during neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lasorella and Iavarone, 2006</xref>). Likewise, Id2 seems to be associated with both actin and microtubule filaments, and we also observed that Id2 forms a complex with EB1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (data not shown). We are currently planning experiments to determine whether Akt/Id2 signaling coordinates actin and microtubule dynamics in the growth cone.</p><p>Successful axon regeneration must be preceded by the successful formation of new growth cones. It has been reported that <italic>Akt1</italic> mRNA was markedly upregulated in injured neurons in adult rats, and that the phosphorylated Akt protein was dramatically increased after axotomy in adult motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namikawa et al., 2000</xref>). A recent study has shown that infection with an Id2-adenovirus prevented E47-mediated induction of the Nogo receptor, which is responsible for three myelin proteins (myelin-associated glycoprotein, Nogo-A, and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein) that account for most of the inhibitory activity of CNS myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silver and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lasorella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996</xref>). In other studies, blocking growth inhibitory molecules allowed for limited regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fry et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting the need for strategies that enhance the intrinsic growth potential of CNS neurons to achieve regeneration. Based on our finding that the development-dependent decline in Akt/Id2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the reintroduction of Akt/Id2 signaling or enhanced Id2 stability by Akt-mediated phosphorylation are critical for axon growth and for the formation of a new growth cone, we attempted to determine the intrinsic growth potential contributed by Akt/Id2 signaling, when the growth ability of CNS neurons has declined. Intriguingly, AAV2-Id2 infection after injury in EH obviously facilitates axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>) and AAV2-S14D-Id2 or AAV2-Id2 with active Akt robustly enhanced axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>), resulting in numerous axons entering the hippocampus after biocytin tracing. In contrast the functional blockade of Id2 by AAV2-phospho-ablated mutants, or treatment with Akt inhibitor in the presence of AAV2-Id2-WT, notably reduced axonal regeneration in the EH model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C,F,G</xref>). Therefore, with the hope of translating intrinsic axon growth regulators into injured CNS, Akt/Id2 signaling could be a potent module to enhance the intrinsic growth potential in damaged CNS neurons</p><p>In summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), our study demonstrated that Id2 localization in the growing axonal tip of the growth cone, as a result of Akt-mediated phosphorylation, is a critical determinant of the intrinsic axonal growth ability in developing neurons, and manipulation of the growth control mechanism of Akt/Id2 signaling may provide new molecular targets for interventions to promote axon regeneration after CNS injury.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20799.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of Akt/Id2 signaling pathway in the neuron.</title><p>Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation of Id2 augments its protein stability and growth cone localization, thereby promoting growth cone formation and axon growth in the developing neuron and contributing to axon regeneration in the damaged hippocampal slice culture.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20799.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20799.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20799-fig8-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary neuron and cell culture</title><p>The brains of E18 rat embryos were dissected, and hippocampi were removed and placed in a 15 ml tube with 14 ml of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) on ice.

First, the authors identify Id2 (Inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 2) as a binding partner of Akt through mass spec. They then show that phosphorylation of Id2 on Serine 14 affects its stability, with consequences for axonal outgrowth and branching in primary hippocampal neurons. Next, they argue that Id2 is present not only in the nucleus but also in the growth cone. Finally, the authors use an in vitro hippocampal slice preparation of axon regeneration to demonstrate that activation of Id2 and Akt/Id2 promotes axon regeneration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript contains some interesting findings linking Akt to Id2 signaling, with the consequences for regeneration. Unfortunately, the data surrounding the proposed function for Id2 growth cone are preliminary and are not adequate to support many of the authors arguments. The authors are challenged by the previously identified role for Id2-mediated transcription in axon outgrowth, and must demonstrate more than localization if Id2 protein in the growth cone in order to demonstrate a novel activity for axonal Id2. The co-localization and interaction studies in this study are not sufficient to rule out the possibility that Akt simply regulates Id2 mediated transcription, regardless of where this phosphorylation event may occur. Significant additional functional work would be required to define an axon specific role for Id2, for example with Id2 constructs that lack DNA binding activity.</p><p>2) We are concerned about the results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> where authors visualize phosphorylated forms of endogenous Id2 proteins in the growth cones of cultured neurons. However, there is no evidence to support that these signals indeed represent phosphorylated forms of Id2 proteins, or even a part of Id2 proteins.

In the developing nervous system, Id2 enhances cell proliferation and inhibits the activity of neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and E proteins such as E47 and E12. Id2 does not bind to DNA because of the lack of a DNA binding domain, but it preferentially binds to ubiquitously expressed bHLH transcription factor and E proteins, and sequesters them from tissue-specific transcription factors such as NeuroD in processes such as neurogenesis, in which these other factors must compete with Id2 to heterodimerize with E proteins. Activation of the bHLH transcription factor E47 induces expression of a group of genes, including Nogo receptor, Sema3F, and Notch1 (Perk et al., 2005; Lasorella et al., 2006; Wang and Baker, 2015), which potently inhibit axon growth.</p><p>We have conducted a series of experiments to address the question the reviewer raised. In the revised manuscript (subsection âAkt/Id2 signaling promotes axon growth by regulating growth cone developmentâ, fourth paragraph and fifth paragraphs), we described following new experimental data.</p><p>First, we asked whether Akt simply regulates Id2-dependent transcription. To determine this, we examined whether Akt-mediated Id2 phosphorylation enhances the interaction between Id2 and E47, thereby upregulating the inhibition of E47-mediated transcription. We co-transfected GFP- Id2-WT, S14D, or S14A with HA-E47 into PC12 cells and performed immunoprecipitation analysis. Id2 phosphorylation did not alter the interaction between Id2 and E47, showing that all Id2 constructs, regardless of phosphorylation status, had similar interactions with E47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, we performed luciferase reporter assays with 3 multimerized E-boxes driving the expression of luciferase (3xE-box-luc) (Jung et al., 2010). Co-transfection of PC12 cells (which express endogenous NeuroD) with 3xE-box-luc and E47 led to significantly higher luciferase activity than the background luciferase activity (3xE-box-luc alone) and, as expected, overexpression of GFP- Id2-WT notably reduced the luciferase activity. In accordance with the results of our binding analysis indicating that S14 phosphorylation of Id2 did not affect Id2 binding to E47, both S14D and S14A mutants also resulted in a repression of E47-activated luciferase activity, as similar to Id2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation of Id2 is probably not necessary for E47 binding since dimerization in the bHLH family has been reported to be mediated by the HLH domain (Voronova and Baltimore, 1990; Pesce and Benezra, 1993) while Akt-dependent phosphorylation occurs N-terminal S14 residue. Therefore, Akt may not simply regulate Id2-mediated transcriptional inhibition but more likely is important in regulating axon growth and growth cone formation in the axonal tip.</p><p>Second, instead of using Id2 constructs that lack DNA binding activity due to lack of DNA binding ability of Id2, we generated Id2 constructs that cannot bind to E47 to antagonize transcriptional repression activity of Id2. In accordance with a previous observation that showed disruption of the HLH domain of Id1 by a proline-to-serine substitution at position 74 or a valine-to-proline substitution at position 91 abolished its ability to inhibit E47 DNA binding (Pesce and Benezra, 1993), we generated proline-to-serine substitutions at position 51 or valine-to-proline substitutions at position 68 in Id2 counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Our binding assay showed that the interaction between E47 and P51S or V68P Id2 mutant was much weaker than that of Id2 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Moreover, both P51S and V68P mutations in the HLH domain of Id2 severely impaired the inhibition of E47-mediated transcription by Id2, revealing higher luciferase activity levels with P51S or V68P expression than observed for Id2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Furthermore, co-transfection of Id2-WT with HA-E47 prevented the E47-mediated transcription of growth inhibitory molecules such as Nogo receptor, one of the best known inhibitors of axon growth (Schwab, 2004) whereas co-transfection of P51S or V68P Id2 mutant with E47 demonstrated relatively less inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3D</xref>). To confirm the effect of Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation on axon growth, we generated phosphor-mimetic P51S (S14D, P51S-Id2) or V68P Id2 (S14D, V68P-Id2) mutants and phosphor-ablated P51S (S14A, P51S-Id2) or V68P Id2 mutants (S14A, V68P-Id2), and determined axon growth and growth cone formation. Although both P51S and V68P Id2 mutant nominally repressed E47-mediated transcription, phosphor-mimetic mutation in P51S (S14D, P51S-Id2) or V68P Id2 (S14D, V68P-Id2) prominently promoted axon growth and led to growth cone localization of these mutant showing normal growth cone architecture resembling S14D-Id2 in the developing neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3E, F</xref>). These data suggest that Akt-mediated S14 phosphorylation probably regulates Id2 independently from transcriptional repression regulation contributing normal growth cone formation and axon growth.</p><p><italic>2) We are concerned about the results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> where authors visualize phosphorylated forms of endogenous Id2 proteins in the growth cones of cultured neurons. However, there is no evidence to support that these signals indeed represent phosphorylated forms of Id2 proteins, or even a part of Id2 proteins. Perhaps the authors can use Id2 knockdown or some other methods to support the authenticity of the signals.</italic></p><p>In accordance with the reviewersâ suggestion, we introduced Id2-siRNA into cultured hippocampal neuron (DIV 3) and validated the specificity of the phosphor-S14 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, knockdown of Id2 disrupted growth cone architecture and was minimally detected in the growth cone while in the control, Id2 expression was prominent in the growth cone. Immunostaining against anti-S14-phospho antibody in the control SCR expressing neuron showed that the phosphor-S14 signal is co-localized with the Id2 signal in the growth cone, revealing an intense signal at the peripheral domain of the growth cone. However, we failed to detect any specific signal of anti-S14-phosphor antibody after knockdown of Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). In other ways, upon Akt inhibitor VIII treatment, S14 phosphor Id2 intensity was diminished following by decrease of Akt phosphorylation in the growth cone along with a reduction of growth cone area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref>). We added this part in the revised manuscript (subsection âAkt regulates growth cone localization of Id2 in the developing neuronâ, last paragraph). Moreover, upon Akt inhibitor VIII treatment, S14 phosphor Id2 was diminished and followed by decreased Akt phosphorylation along with a reduction of Id2 protein whereas upon MAPK inhibitor treatment, S14 phospho Id2 level was not altered following Akt phosphorylation, indicating anti-S14-phosphor antibody specifically detect Akt-mediated phosphorylated S14 residue of Id2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Furthermore, depletion of Akt by shRNA-Akt also led to lower intensity of S14-phosphor Id2 than observed in the control vector transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>; subsection âAkt/Id2 signaling promotes axon growth by regulating growth cone developmentâ, second paragraph). Taken together, anti-S14-phosphor antibody is suitable for detecting S14 phosphorylated Id2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
