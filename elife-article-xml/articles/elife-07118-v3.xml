pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07118.001</object-id><p>To maintain cellular structure and integrity during division, Gram-negative bacteria must carefully coordinate constriction of a tripartite cell envelope of inner membrane, peptidoglycan (PG), and outer membrane (OM). It has remained enigmatic how this is accomplished. Here, we show that envelope machines facilitating septal PG synthesis (PBP1B-LpoB complex) and OM constriction (Tol system) are physically and functionally coordinated via YbgF, renamed CpoB (<bold>C</bold>oordinator of <bold>P</bold>G synthesis and <bold>O</bold>M constriction, associated with PBP1<bold>B</bold>). CpoB localizes to the septum concurrent with PBP1B-LpoB and Tol at the onset of constriction, interacts with both complexes, and regulates PBP1B activity in response to Tol energy state. This coordination links PG synthesis with OM invagination and imparts a unique mode of bifunctional PG synthase regulation by selectively modulating PBP1B cross-linking activity. Coordination of the PBP1B and Tol machines by CpoB contributes to effective PBP1B function in vivo and maintenance of cell envelope integrity during division.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07118.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07118.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07118.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All bacterial cells are surrounded by a membrane, which forms a protective barrier around the cell. Most bacteria also have a wall surrounding the membrane, which provides structural support. When a bacterial cell divides to produce two daughter cells, it produces a belt-like structure around the middle of the cell. This brings the membrane and cell wall on each side together to a ‘pinch-point’ until the two halves of the cell have been separated. This process must be carefully controlled to ensure that the cell does not burst open at any point.</p><p>Some bacteria known as ‘Gram-negative’ bacteria have a second membrane on the other side of the cell wall. These cells divide in the same way as other bacteria, but the need to coordinate the movement of three structures instead of two makes it more complicated. Many proteins are known to be involved. For example, one group (or ‘complex’) of proteins—which includes a protein called PBP1B—helps to produce new cell wall material. Another complex called the Tol system provides the energy needed for the outer membrane to be pulled inwards towards the pinch point. However, it has not been clear how these complexes work together to allow the cell to divide.</p><p>Here, Gray, Egan et al. searched for proteins that can interact with PBP1B during cell division in the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic>. The experiments found that a protein called CpoB interacts with both PBP1B and the Tol system. CpoB is found in a band around the middle of the cell, and it regulates the activity of PBP1B in response to signals from the Tol system. If the activity of CpoB is disrupted, cell wall production and the movement of the outer membrane are no longer coordinated, and the membrane falls apart, leading to the death of the bacteria.</p><p>Gray, Egan et al.'s findings show how the production of new cell wall material can be linked to the inwards movement of the outer membrane during cell division. The next challenges are to understand the precise details of how these processes are coordinated by CpoB and to find out whether CpoB also plays the same role in other bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07118.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07118.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>cell envelope</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>outer membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101824/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vollmer</surname><given-names>Waldemar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5RO1GM102790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>Carol A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P50GM107615-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kerwyn Casey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sofja Kovalevskaja Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Typas</surname><given-names>Athanasios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Molecular Biology Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>internal funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Typas</surname><given-names>Athanasios</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DIVINOCELL project FP7-Health-2007-B-223431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>den Blaauwen</surname><given-names>Tanneke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Council for Chemical Sciences ECHO project #

The sacculus, a continuous mesh-like structure of glycan strands cross-linked by short peptides, encases the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane (IM) and is essential for viability. Several prominent classes of antibiotics (e.g., β-lactams and glycopeptides) inhibit PG synthesis, causing lysis and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schneider and Sahl, 2010</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane (OM), an asymmetric bilayer of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides, surrounds the mostly single-layered sacculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gan et al., 2008</xref>) and forms a vital permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). Covalent and non-covalent interactions between abundant OM proteins (Lpp, Pal, OmpA) and PG tether the OM to the sacculus, maintaining OM stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hantke and Braun, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parsons et al., 2006</xref>). Together, the IM, PG, and OM comprise the tripartite Gram-negative cell envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bacteria must synchronize growth and division of these layers, as imbalanced growth could lead to breaches that compromise the permeability barrier or even the structural integrity of the cell. However, we do not yet understand the mechanisms that accomplish this synchronization.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07118.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Envelope constriction in Gram-negative bacteria and related protein machines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the tripartite Gram-negative cell envelope.

To overcome this challenge, bacteria utilize IM-associated multicomponent machineries that span the entire envelope. Two machineries, organized by distinct cytoskeletal elements, assemble and disassemble in a cell-cycle-regulated manner and mediate different phases of sacculus growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Typas et al., 2012</xref>): (1) the cell elongation machinery (elongasome), organized by the actin homolog MreB, mediates lateral PG synthesis along the length of the cell, and (2) the cell division machinery (divisome), organized by the tubulin homolog FtsZ, mediates new pole synthesis at the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Egan and Vollmer, 2013</xref>). These complex machineries are comprised of structural and regulatory subunits, components with distinct functions (e.g., DNA segregation, PG precursor synthesis and transport), and PG biosynthetic and modifying enzymes.</p><p>Sacculus growth is orchestrated by a repertoire of PG synthases, including glycosyltransferases (GTases) that polymerize glycan strands from the precursor saccharide moiety lipid II, transpeptidases (TPases) that cross-link peptides between adjacent glycan strands, and bifunctional PG synthases that carry out both activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Typas et al., 2012</xref>). The two <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> monofunctional TPases, PBP2, and PBP3, are essential subunits of the elongasome and the divisome, respectively. Likewise, the two major bifunctional PG synthases, PBP1A and PBP1B, participate predominantly in elongation and division, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>). However, in contrast to the monofunctional TPases, which are dedicated to their respective roles, the bifunctional synthases can partially substitute for each other, enabling cells to survive with only one of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yousif et al., 1985</xref>). These IM-localized bifunctional synthases have obligate cognate regulatory OM lipoproteins, LpoA and LpoB, which are required for activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>).

Here, we report that physical and functional coordination of the two machines is required to properly synchronize PG synthesis and OM constriction during cell division.

We show that CpoB, PBP1B-LpoB, and Tol localize concurrently to the septum during cell division, and interact to form a higher-order complex that spatially links PG synthesis and OM invagination. These physical interactions are dynamic and allow direct regulation of PBP1B activity in response to Tol assembly and cycles of PMF utilization. CpoB is required for proper PBP1B function in vivo, and loss of CpoB-mediated coordination between PBP1B and Tol leads to defects in OM integrity, illustrating the importance of mechanisms that ensure coordination of cell division processes across the envelope.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The auxiliary Tol-associated protein CpoB has a PBP1B-associated function</title><p>To identify novel regulators of PG synthesis during cell division, we queried the <italic>E. coli</italic> chemical genomics database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nichols et al., 2011</xref>) for deletion strains whose growth responses closely resembled those of a strain lacking PBP1B (encoded by <italic>mrcB</italic>) across a range of drug and environmental stress conditions.

As cell length correlates with cell cycle progression, measuring fluorescence enrichment at mid-cell in cells sorted by length provides a quantitative metric for temporal comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">den Blaauwen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarsman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Ploeg et al., 2013</xref>).

Thus, CpoB is recruited to the septum during the later stages of cell division, concurrent with Tol, PBP1B, and the onset of OM constriction.</p><p>We next asked which proteins and cell division events are required for recruitment of CpoB to the septum. CpoB failed to localize in cells with temperature-sensitive (ts) FtsZ, FtsA, FtsW, or PBP3 under non-permissive conditions, and in cells depleted for FtsN, indicating that CpoB localization is dependent on divisome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–F</xref>). CpoB also failed to localize following inhibition of PBP3 with aztreonam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4G</xref>), indicating that its localization also requires ongoing septal PG synthesis. However, CpoB localized normally in the absence of PBP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). TolA dependence was more difficult to examine, since delayed OM constriction in the absence of TolA leads to the non-specific accumulation of periplasmic proteins at cell division sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerding et al., 2007</xref>). Under growth conditions that minimized this effect, CpoB continued to localize in the absence of TolA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>), suggesting that it can be recruited independently of TolA. Because a strain lacking PBP1B and TolA is only marginally viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>), we cannot distinguish whether CpoB localization is independent of both PBP1B and TolA, or whether each partner alone is sufficient to drive CpoB localization.</p><p>CpoB localization is thus tied to cell division.

As CpoB and TolA each interact with PBP1B, we tested whether they also form a ternary complex. Indeed, chemically cross-linking a mixture of PBP1B, TolA, and CpoB identified a high-molecular weight species containing all three proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using this technique, we did not detect analogous high molecular weight complexes of PBP1A with TolA or CpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming that the CpoB and TolA interactions and complex formation with PBP1B were specific. Since LpoB is required for PBP1B activation in vivo, we next tested whether CpoB and TolA interact with PBP1B in complex with LpoB. Indeed, in the presence but not absence of PBP1B, His-LpoB retained CpoB and TolA on Ni-NTA beads after chemical cross-linking, indicating that LpoB-PBP1B-CpoB and LpoB-PBP1B-TolA form ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given that all possible ternary complexes containing PBP1B can be formed, we propose that PBP1B, LpoB, CpoB, and TolA also form a quaternary complex.</p><p>As CpoB can form a complex with both PBP1B-LpoB and TolA, its cellular abundance might influence which interactions occur in vivo. Using purified protein as a standard and an antibody specific to CpoB, we determined a CpoB cellular copy number of 4550 ± 540 (<italic>n</italic> = 5) in growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is similar to an estimated protein synthesis rate for CpoB of ∼5200 molecules per generation, determined via ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the abundance of CpoB significantly exceeds the ∼520 molecules of PBP1B and ∼480 molecules of TolA synthesized per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2014</xref>). CpoB forms trimers, which disassociate to the monomeric form when bound to TolA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krachler et al., 2010</xref>). It is unclear in what form(s) CpoB binds to PBP1B. Nevertheless, even in its trimeric form (∼1500 trimers), CpoB is in excess to both PBP1B and TolA and is therefore likely able to interact constitutively with both partners.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that CpoB, PBP1B-LpoB, and Tol associate to form a higher-order complex, spatially linking PG synthesis and OM constriction during cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CpoB and TolA modulate PBP1B-mediated PG synthesis</title><p>We tested the effects of TolA and CpoB on PBP1B GTase and TPase activities in vitro.

LpoB activates both the PBP1B GTase domain, increasing reaction rate, and the TPase domain, thereby producing hyper-cross-linked PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, blue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Egan et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, although CpoB did not affect the cross-linking activity of PBP1B on its own, it partially prevented the formation of hyper-cross-linked PG in the presence of LpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, blue). As CpoB affected neither LpoB binding to PBP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) nor GTase stimulation of PBP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), CpoB must directly interfere with LpoB activation of the PBP1B TPase. Strikingly, TolA alleviated the inhibitory effect of CpoB, restoring the synthesis of highly cross-linked PG in the presence of LpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, cyan). The effect of CpoB on TPase activity was further enhanced at a moderately increased salt concentration (215 mM NaCl), suggesting that its regulatory effect on PBP1B may be intensified under stress. In this condition, LpoB increased cross-linking from 50% to 60%. The addition of CpoB completely prevented this stimulation, whereas TolA again alleviated the CpoB effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right graph). Though the magnitudes of these effects are moderate, they are likely significant in vivo given the essentiality of LpoB for PBP1B function under all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>), including different salt concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68"/>.

In addition to the previously reported PBP1B-LpoB pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>), we observed specific pairwise interactions between CpoB, TolA, and PBP1B, validating that these interactions also occur in vivo. Interestingly, CpoB exhibited minimal or no cross-linking with LpoB in the presence of TolA, but a dramatic increase in cross-linking in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, TolA both prevents CpoB from associating with LpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and from interfering with PBP1B TPase stimulation by LpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that these effects are linked. Since an interaction between CpoB and LpoB was not detected in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), their association in vivo likely occurs in the context of the CpoB-PBP1B-LpoB ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

In contrast, CpoB–LpoB interaction and PBP1B-LpoB complex formation increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Together, these data suggested that CpoB regulates PBP1B-LpoB in response to Tol assembly state, energy state, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the effects of a <italic>tolR</italic> deletion, which prevents TolQR–TolA complex assembly, to those of a <italic>tolR</italic>(D23R) point mutation that allows complex assembly but prevents TolQR–TolA from utilizing PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cascales et al., 2001</xref>).

In contrast, interaction between CpoB and LpoB was highly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This strongly suggests that TolQR–TolA must be energized for TolA to prevent CpoB both from interacting with LpoB and, in conjunction, from inhibiting PBP1B TPase stimulation by LpoB.

In this work, we present a mechanism for coordinating PG synthesis and OM constriction, featuring CpoB, previously of unknown function, as its centerpiece. The PBP1B-LpoB and Tol machines facilitate PG synthesis and OM constriction, respectively, at the closely-spaced leading and trailing edges of the invaginating envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We demonstrate that CpoB connects these processes, promoting physical and functional coordination of the PBP1B-LpoB and Tol machines. We found that both CpoB and TolA interact directly with PBP1B, and our in vitro data support formation of a higher order complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As depicted in our summary model, interactions between PBP1B, LpoB, CpoB, and TolA allow for dynamic regulation of PBP1B activity, and thus functional coordination of the PBP1B and Tol machines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Below, we first discuss how interaction between these machineries tunes PG synthesis, and then indicate the physiological importance of this process. We end with an evolutionary perspective on these findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How CpoB tunes PBP1B-LpoB function to Tol energy state</title><p>In the absence of input from CpoB, LpoB binding to PBP1B stimulates both its GTase and TPase activities. TPase activation results in hyper-cross-linked PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, top left), containing ∼70% cross-linked peptides in vitro. CpoB binding interferes only with TPase stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, top right) so that ∼60% of the peptides are cross-linked. Importantly, this level of cross-linking is similar to that observed in mini-cells, which are formed by abnormal polar divisions in vivo and have an exclusively polar PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Obermann and Höltje, 1994</xref>). Therefore, CpoB reduces cross-linkage to a more physiological level. This may be the default cellular state, as CpoB is present in ∼10-fold excess over its PBP1B and TolA binding partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2014</xref>). CpoB is the first example of an endogenous regulator that can control the TPase activity of a bifunctional PG synthase independently of its GTase activity. It thus mimics the activity of penicillin G, which blocks PBP1B TPase activity without interfering with GTase stimulation by LpoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lupoli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>TolA further modulates PBP1B function by reversing CpoB inhibition, in a manner that is dependent on the state of the Tol apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom panels). Fuelled by PMF-derived energy, TolQR–TolA cycles between at least two alternative states; we propose that each state has distinct functional consequences for PG synthesis. During the non-energized phase of Tol function, CpoB inhibits LpoB-mediated PBP1B TPase hyper-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom right). During the energized phase, however, TolA adopts a new conformation that allows it to alleviate CpoB inhibition, thereby restoring maximal TPase stimulation by LpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom left). Thus, CpoB provides the means to selectively regulate PBP1B catalytic activities, and TolA modulates this effect, linking cycles of PBP1B activity state and the resulting PG cross-linking with cycles of TolQR–TolA energy state while Tol promotes OM invagination.</p><p>TolA also directly stimulates PBP1B GTase activity, independently of and additively with LpoB. We do not yet know whether this stimulation occurs during one or both phases of Tol function. Importantly, recruitment and assembly of the TolQR–TolA IM sub-complex is required for regulation of PBP1B by TolA in vivo: in the absence of TolQ or TolR, interaction between TolA and PBP1B is significantly decreased, whereas interaction between PBP1B and LpoB is enhanced. TolQ and TolA localize to the septum independently of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerding et al., 2007</xref>), and their recruitment may incorporate different regulatory cues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Why is PBP1B tuning necessary for coordinating septal PG synthesis and OM constriction?</title><p>We propose that selectively tuning the GTase and TPase activities of PBP1B offers functional flexibility that is particularly important during constrictive PG synthesis. PBP1B-LpoB has the capacity to produce highly cross-linked PG, which may be required at certain stages of new pole synthesis, but the TPase activity of PBP1B is normally down-regulated by CpoB. Up-regulation is allowed only during energized phases of Tol function. Thus, for PBP1B-LpoB at the septal leading edge, increased cross-linking (TPase) activity is permitted only when the OM is brought into close proximity—as facilitated by cycles of Tol function and energy utilization—allowing energized TolQR–TolA to counteract CpoB. The IM-bound septal leading edge can thereby sense and respond the status of the trailing edge of the constricting envelope (i.e. the OM), and activity cycles of the two machines are synchronized, helping to ensure a constant distance between the OM and IM. Restricting TPase activity based on Tol status may also promote better coordination of septal PG synthesis and septal cleavage by OM-controlled amidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uehara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>By making PBP1B activity responsive to the presence, assembly and energy state of Tol, CpoB enables potential feedback regulation of PG synthesis based on the status of OM invagination. The importance of such coordination can be seen when it is broken, as demonstrated by the phenotypes of a strain lacking CpoB. Multiple antibiotic sensitivities, envelope defects, and genetic interactions paralleling those of a strain lacking PBP1B suggested that CpoB contributes to proper PBP1B function in vivo, an interpretation bolstered by the facts that PBP1B overexpression alleviated these Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> phenotypes and a strain lacking both proteins phenocopied a PBP1B mutant. Envelope defects in the absence of CpoB were relatively mild, likely because redundant mechanisms compensate for loss of coordination by CpoB (e.g., LpoA TPR domain function, discussed below). Yet defects were greatly exacerbated under osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or in the absence of LpoA function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B–D</xref>), indicating that coordination by CpoB becomes more crucial under stress and/or when cells must rely more heavily on PBP1B function. Apparent loss of PBP1B function in the absence of CpoB may result from loss of proper coordination with Tol that is required for efficient and productive utilization of PBP1B activity during septation. In addition, loss of TPase modulation may itself be deleterious, as uncontrolled PG synthase activity can be as detrimental to the cell as no activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Synthetic and hydrolytic enzymatic reactions have to be carefully balanced for seamless PG growth, a principle exploited by β-lactam antibiotics, which lyse cells predominantly via uncontrolled PG hydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kohlrausch and Höltje, 1991</xref>). In this scenario, overexpression of PBP1B may alleviate Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> phenotypes by ensuring that there is enough unbound (hypoactive) PBP1B in the cell to counter-balance hyperactive PBP1B-LpoB in septal PG synthesis.</p><p>Coordination of the PBP1B and Tol machines by CpoB may also be important for proper Tol function. Defects in OM integrity in the absence of PBP1B or CpoB are consistent with such a role. The molecular mechanism by which Tol facilitates OM constriction remains poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Egan and Vollmer, 2013</xref>), and the energized system is currently not amenable to in vitro dissection. It is thus more difficult to determine specific regulatory effects of CpoB and PBP1B on Tol activity. However, coordination likely promotes synchronous OM constriction during cell division, and reciprocal regulation of Tol activity would allow bidirectional coordination of function. Since PBP1B-LpoB can partially compensate for loss of Tol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>), it is possible that the two complexes contribute to OM constriction cooperatively. Finally, it is possible that both Tol and CpoB play additional roles in PG synthesis and/or other envelope processes, which may be elucidated as we continue to improve our understanding of Tol function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Specificity and modularity in PG synthase evolution</title><p>PBP1B and PBP1A retain some core functional redundancy, which allows cell survival when only one is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yousif et al., 1985</xref>). This partial redundancy adds robustness to cell wall biosynthesis. However, PBP1B and PBP1A also have distinct roles. PBP1B is adapted to play a key role in cell division in <italic>E. coli</italic>, as illustrated by phenotypic, localization, and physical interaction data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>), and by the fact that cells without PBP1B lyse from the mid-cell at a higher frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Garcia del Portillo and de Pedro, 1990</xref>). Here, we provide additional evidence for the specialized role of PBP1B-LpoB complex in cell division, as it interacts and physically coordinates its function with the Tol apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerding et al., 2007</xref>). Physical and regulatory interactions thus link PBP1B to septal PG synthesis (PBP3, FtsN, FtsW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fraipont et al., 2011</xref>), PG hydrolysis (MltA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vollmer et al., 1999</xref>), and now OM constriction (Tol and CpoB), integrating division processes that span the envelope. Multiple divisome-associated regulators (FtsN, LpoB, CpoB, TolA) either stimulate or inhibit PBP1B activity. Regulation by other factors may be synergistic or antagonistic with regulation by CpoB and TolA, or alternatively may be employed at different stages of septation, helping PBP1B to further address unique requirements of constrictive PG synthesis.</p><p>PBPs and other PG-related enzymes (e.g., amidases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>) are often characterized by modular architecture, combining broadly conserved catalytic domains with evolutionarily confined non-catalytic domains. We have proposed that these non-catalytic domains provide specificity and diversification to the enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Typas et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of PBP1B, the non-catalytic UB2H domain shares an extensive binding interface with LpoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Egan et al., 2014</xref>), and as we show here is also involved in binding CpoB. Interestingly, LpoB and CpoB approach UB2H from different sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), consistent with their independent binding to PBP1B. CpoB and LpoB come close in this conformation, and this proximity could facilitate the LpoB–CpoB interaction, which is stabilized in the non-energized state of the Tol system. As the UB2H domain and LpoB are present only in enterobacteria and Vibrionaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dörr et al., 2014</xref>), it remains to be determined whether and how the more conserved Tol system is integrated with septal PG synthesis in other bacteria. Interestingly, CpoB is not conserved in all bacteria with a Tol system, or even in some that contain LpoB (e.g., Pasteurellaceae).</p><p>We postulate that other niche-specific factors will tightly coordinate PG septal synthesis and constriction of the different envelope layers in microbes that lack CpoB and/or LpoB. In this regard, our finding that LpoA has an additional function beyond activating PBP1A, one that is redundant with (or otherwise exacerbates the need for) CpoB and is independent of PBP1A, is particularly interesting. First, it extends for the first time the principle of modularity to PG enzyme regulators, as LpoA has two physically separated domains: one for binding and activating PBP1A (C-terminal domain) and one for its CpoB-related function (N-terminal TPR domain). Second, as both CpoB and LpoA possess TPR domains, which are generally involved in protein–protein interactions, it raises the question of whether both their TPR domains are involved in additional binding and/or regulation with other PG-related enzymes. Such function(s) could be independent of PBP1A/B binding and regulation. An alternative scenario, which would explain the CpoB and LpoA redundancy, is that LpoA can directly link to the Tol system. In contrast to CpoB, we could not detect a direct interaction between LpoA and soluble TolA in vitro. However, the LpoA connection to TolA may be more complex (e.g., dependent on conformational state of TolA), or LpoA may achieve a CpoB-like function via connections to other Tol components. Such a connection would be consistent with the ability of PBP1A to partially substitute for PBP1B, and with the general role of the Tol system in envelope integrity. As all these components (PBP1B/A, LpoB/A, CpoB, and Tol) localize independently to division sites, multiple redundant or alternative paths may exist for coordinating PG synthesis and OM constriction, increasing the robustness of the process to function under different conditions and across different organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Physical and functional coordination of PBP1B with Tol, facilitated by CpoB, reveals an important additional layer in the regulatory circuitry that controls PBP1B function, and paints an increasingly intricate picture of PBP1B as a regulatory scaffold that is uniquely adapted for the coordination of cell division process in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Continued dissection of the dynamic, multi-enzyme, membrane-spanning machines that mediate coordinated cell division processes—including investigation of which interactions occur simultaneously, when and where in the cell they occur, and what additional regulatory relationships they confer—will provide greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern interconnected divisome functions and their synchronization. Looking across different organisms will also provide a better overview of which interconnections are broadly required and by what different means they can be achieved. Considering the many facets of cell envelope composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Radolf et al., 2012</xref>) and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leisch et al., 2012</xref>), these questions are bound to have different answers in different bacteria. Nevertheless, the geometric and topological changes inherent during cell division likely generally necessitate a high degree of feedback between the different envelope layers through physical connections that modulate biochemical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weiss, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and proteins</title><p>[<sup>14</sup>C]GlcNAc-labelled lipid II and dansylated lipid II were prepared as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breukink et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertsche et al., 2005</xref>).

Briefly, individual cells were identified and analyzed using the public domain program Coli-Inspector, running under plugin ObjectJ written by Norbert Vischer (University of Amsterdam, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sils.fnwi.uva.nl/bcb/objectj/">https://sils.fnwi.uva.nl/bcb/objectj/</ext-link>), which runs in combination with ImageJ. Via this analysis, parameters including cell length, cell diameter (width) as a function of length, and integrated fluorescence as a function of length (fluorescence profile) were quantified for each cell. For each examined protein, fluorescence profiles of 3000–5000 individual cells were sorted according to cell length to generate profile maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), similar to demographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hocking et al., 2012</xref>). A cell diameter profile map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom panel) was generated from imaged cells that were fixed only. Percentage of cell cycle progression (age) for individual cells was determined based on relative cell length ranking, assuming a logarithmic growth of cell length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarsman et al., 2005</xref>).

Cells were grown in glucose minimal medium at 28°C (permissive temperature) to an OD<sub>450</sub> of 0.2. Subsequently, the growing cells were diluted 1:4 into pre-warmed medium (28°C or 42°C) and grown until the cultures again reached an OD<sub>450</sub> of 0.2. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunolabeled as described (‘Methods’ and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">den Blaauwen et al., 2003</xref>) using antibody to CpoB that had been pre-adsorbed on permeabilized Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> cells to remove cross-reacting antibodies, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buddelmeijer et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent and very thorough study that provides important and novel insights into the biogenesis of the gram-negative cell envelope during cell division. The findings break new ground in the fundamental understanding of bacterial cell division. Also, given the role of the gram-negative cell envelope in antibiotic resistance, the results are also of practical significance. However, there are some areas where the interpretation of the data needs to be more balanced, where the manuscript should be simplified and some additional controls/information need to be included.</p><p>1) The weak phenotype associated with a CpoB deficiency needs to be discussed explicitly. Only a modest elevation in cefsulodin sensitivity and a quite low frequency of cells (1% or less) with membrane blebs are observed. Sensitivity to many drugs would be more apparent if the envelope defect was strong. The relatively weak phenotype does not diminish the findings in this report. It only means that other partially redundant factors (possibly like LpoA) likely remain to be characterized.</p><p>2) The description of the crosslinking data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (presented in the figure with the limited range in the y-axes) also needs to be more balanced. The observed changes may be statistically significant, but the text suggests there is a much more dramatic effect than is actually observed. (For example, in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “CpoB and TolA modulate PBP1B-mediated PG synthesis” the authors state: “…under this condition [215 mM NaCl], CpoB completely prevented PBP1b from synthesizing hyper-crosslinked PG, and TolA again completely alleviated this effect…”.) The total change is only 10%, from 60% crosslinking, down to 50% with CpoB, and back again with TolA addition. The authors need to explicitly state that the observed changes are modest and provide some discussion to indicate that, even so, the trends in the activity suggest an interesting underlying mechanism that quite possibly may have a more significant effect on crosslinking in vivo.</p><p>3) The text related to ternary and quaternary complex formation should similarly be moderated given that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> do not make a compelling case for these conclusions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, the authors present the data to support their conclusion that CpoB or TolA can only interact with LpoB in the presence of PBP1b. In the top panel, a vanishingly small amount of CpoB co-purifies with His-LpoB in the presence of PBP1b. No CpoB co-purifies with His-LpoB without PBP1b, but the yield of His-LpoB is much lower in this sample. Given the low levels of CpoB that co-purified initially, it is hard to know if the lack of interaction here is due to a yield problem. Also, the CpoB that does co-purify in the presence of PBP1b does not look like it is much over background and could just be a small amount of spurious crosslinking. The same is true for the TolA and TolA+CpoB experiments. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, it is difficult to interpret the composition of the crosslinked complexes without the inclusion of pairwise samples (i.e. PBP1b + CpoB with and without TolA etc.).</p><p>4) The data in the paper show a connection between the energy transducing TolAQR complex and PBP1b mediated by CpoB, and this is important advance. However, as evidenced by the title, the authors go beyond this to claim that CpoB coordinates peptidoglycan synthesis with OM constriction. Indeed, throughout the paper the phrase Tol-Pal is used repeatedly, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, Pal is the critical OM protein that would be responsible for this constriction. The fact is that no experiments with Pal (or with TolB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are presented in the entire paper. The OM constriction claim is based on the common assumption that TolA interacts directly with the OM lipoprotein Pal or indirectly with Pal through the periplasmic protein TolB, as implied by the Tol-Pal phrase and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and this assumption may be correct. However, this assumption has been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonsor et al., 2009</xref> EMBO J. 28:2846). Bonsor et al. could detect no interaction between TolA and Pal, and Pal was shown to inhibit the interaction between TolA and TolB, and these results question the existence of a transenvelope Tol-Pal complex. Accordingly, the authors need to be more cautious about the claim made in the title, the renaming of YbgF, the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and the use of the Tol-Pal phrase.</p><p>5) The first part of the paper describing the synthetic lethality of lpoA cpoB mutations is confusing. The authors should simply state the phenotypes of lpoA and mrcA mutants in combination with cpoB are not equivalent, and provide a short discussion of this and what it might mean.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: A specificity control using PBP1a should be included here to rule out the possibility that the observation is a result of TolA and PBP1b in the same detergent micell. Thus, when TolA has no TM domain, it doesn't co-purify.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: More information about the extract samples is needed. Do they represent the input for the immunoprecipitations? Are the intensities directly comparable to the intensities in the IP samples? It would be helpful to know what percentage of the input protein actually ends up being IP-ed. Is it a significant fraction? Or a very small one?</p><p>8) All of the in vitro experiments with full-length TolA have been performed in the absence of significant concentrations of detergent. Is it established that TolA does not form aggregates or interact non-specifically through its hydrophobic transmembrane helix under these conditions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) I might have missed this, but I don't think it was shown that cpoB in trans corrects the membrane and/or other defects of the deletion mutant. Given that the gene is present in the <italic>tol-pal</italic> locus, it is probably important to show the complementation to rule out the possibility that the deletion adversely affects <italic>tol-pal</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper, together with the supplemental data, is very long, very dense, and the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> contains 8 different proteins located in 3 different cellular compartments. Moreover, for 2 of the proteins the gene name and protein name don't coincide. To make it understandable for the general reader of <italic>eLife</italic>, a cartoon depicting these proteins and their cellular location is needed very early in the presentation. The work showing the second function of LpoA is a beautiful story. However, it adds another layer of complexity and I'm not sure that it is critical for the story presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) How have the authors chosen the residues for photo-crosslinking in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? It would be helpful for the reader to get some information on the reasoning behind this experiment.</p><p>2) Why are the signals for the deletion mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref> so different from those of the wild-type strain?</p><p>3) In the SPR experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), not all of the protein dissociates from the chip after washing with buffer. I wonder whether it is correct to simply use the plateau levels of the different curves to calculate the K<sub>D</sub> value if the total peak level apparently reflects more than one distinct complex? This is not really relevant for the conclusion that PBP1B and CpoB interact, but if a K<sub>D</sub> value is given, it should be made sure that it is correct.</p><p>4) In case TolA(sol) does indeed not interact with PBP1B, using this protein would be a good control for the specificity of the effect on PBP1B activity observed with full-length TolA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>5) I wonder how reliable the kinetic rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> are. They appear to vary significantly between the different graphs. Moreover, the values given appear to be based on the bottom graph in which there was apparently some disturbance during the first 400 sec of the measurement.</p><p>6) The authors use the results from their in vivo cross-linking experiments to conclude on direct interactions between proteins (in the subsection headed “Regulation of PBP1B by CpoB and TolA responds to Tol-Pal energy state in vivo”). In general, in this kind of analysis, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that these interactions are indirect, in particular when using a relatively long cross-linker such as DTSSP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07118.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The weak phenotype associated with a CpoB deficiency needs to be discussed explicitly.

We agree that this is likely due to redundant factors, in particular LpoA. It is also worth noting, however, that Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> is sensitive to a number of other drugs and conditions, including almost all β-lactams to which Δ<italic>mrcB</italic> and Δ<italic>lpoB</italic> are sensitive (Nichols et al., 2010 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); these multiple shared sensitivities drive the strong correlation between phenotype profiles of Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> and Δ<italic>mrcB</italic> strains. Also of note, the lysis phenotype of Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> is greatly exacerbated under low-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, while Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> single-mutant phenotypes are relatively mild under ideal lab conditions, in the normal environment of <italic>E. coli</italic>, osmotic stress and other perturbations are likely to exacerbate these phenotypes. We also now make these points more explicitly.</p><p><italic>2) The description of the crosslinking data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>(presented in the</italic> figure <italic>with the limited range in the y-axes) also needs to be more balanced.

The addition of CpoB completely prevented this stimulation, whereas TolA again alleviated the CpoB effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right graph).”</p><p>Although the magnitudes of the effects in the in vitro TPase assay may seem moderate, it is helpful to keep in mind that these are end-point effects, and do not preclude additional rate effects. In addition, these effects are likely significant in vivo: LpoB has only a 10% effect in vitro in these conditions, but is essential for PBP1B function in vivo, under all salt conditions we tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Typas et al<italic>.</italic>, 2010</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paradis-Bleau et al<italic>.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Similarly, all Δ<italic>cpoB</italic> in vivo phenotypes are rescued by overexpressing PBP1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). We have made revisions to make these points more clear and explicit in the text (in the aforementioned subsection).</p><p><italic>3) The text related to ternary and quaternary complex formation should similarly be moderated given that the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5—figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>do not make a compelling case for these conclusions.

We therefore repeated the experiment twice, with less washing, obtaining similar yields of bound His-LpoB in the His-LpoB/PBP1B/CpoB and His-LpoB/CpoB samples. The level of CpoB retained in the His-LpoB/PBP1B/CpoB is clearly above background. The middle panel (with TolA) shows with the His-LpoB sample all untagged proteins clearly above background. In the lower panel, we agree that the experiment with all four proteins together does not prove the simultaneous binding of CpoB, LpoB and TolA to PBP1B to form a quarternary complex, and we have therefore removed this gel to focus on the three ternary complexes, which are supported by the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. This does not require change of the text (please see the subsection entitled “CpoB, TolA, PBP1B, and LpoB form a complex”).</p><p><italic>4) The data in the paper show a connection between the energy transducing TolAQR complex and PBP</italic>1b <italic>mediated by CpoB, and this is important advance.

While we feel it is clear that TolQRA/Pal localize to mid-cell during division and contribute to OM constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerding et al<italic>.</italic>, 2007</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, TolA), we agree that how they do so is not yet clear at a mechanistic level, and we now acknowledge this explicitly in the text and cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonsor et al. (2009)</xref> (Introduction). We now avoid assumptions about trans-envelope Tol-Pal interactions in the text, and refer to the ‘Tol apparatus’ or ‘TolQRA complex’ rather than ‘Tol-Pal’ where appropriate. We also now mention that Tol and CpoB may have additional/other roles during PG synthesis (please see the subsection headed “Why is PBP1B tuning necessary for coordinating septal PG synthesis and OM constriction?”). We do prefer, however, to keep the name ‘CpoB’ because: 1) CpoB localizes to mid-cell during OM constriction, concurrent with TolA and PBP1B; 2) OM defects we observe are also consistent with a role in OM constriction; 3) the name does not assume a specific mechanism of Tol function, only a role in OM constriction; and 4) overall, we feel the name encapsulates our findings and the functional role we have identified.</p><p><italic>5) The first part of the paper describing the synthetic lethality of lpoA cpoB mutations is confusing.

We have adjusted the text (subsection “CpoB, TolA, PBP1B, and LpoB form a complex”) to not overstate the observation that the TM domain is required for binding: “…suggesting that domain I of TolA is important for the interaction.”</p><p>With regard to ensuring specificity using His-PBP1A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> features a sample of PBP1A incubated with TolA (and CpoB) at the same conditions as for Ni-NTA bead pulldown experiments, and we see no significant cross-linking. We also argue that the in vivo co-immunoprecipitation of PBP1B and TolA supports a direct interaction between the two proteins, given that the interaction is still seen in the absence of CpoB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Further, to be more sure of specificity, we have calculated the ratio of protein to detergent micelles and performed a series of controls to ensure that the cross-linking is specific, and not due to a limited number of available detergent micelles.

Or a very small one?</italic></p><p>The extracts are the Triton-soluble membrane fractions, which were used as input for the IPs. We have adjusted the figure and legend to make this clear. Because the IP fractions are concentrated (to deal with the low DTSSP crosslinking), they are not directly comparable to the extracts. The IPs are, however, directly comparable across mutants, as all were concentrated to the same degree. Additionally, we optimized the experiments such that all detectable target protein (as determined by western blot) was immunoprecipitated. We have added additional details to the figure legend and Methods (in the subsection headed “In vivo DTSSP cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation assays”) to make this clear as well.</p><p><italic>8) All of the in vitro experiments with full-length TolA have been performed in the absence of significant concentrations of detergent</italic>. <italic>Is it established that TolA does not form aggregates or interact non-specifically through its hydrophobic transmembrane helix under these conditions?</italic></p><p>All experiments with full-length TolA were done in the presence of 0.06 - 0.075% Triton X-100, which is significantly above the CMC (0.02%) and in the range of what is often used to prevent non-specific interactions (we now note Triton X-100 concentrations properly in the Methods, in the subsections “In vitro protein interaction and activity assays” and “In vitro cross-linking—pulldown and non-reversed immunoblot approaches”).

Supernatant samples were taken before and after centrifugation, both were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. There was no change in the amount of TolA in the supernatant, suggesting that big aggregates are absent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07118.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07118.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07118.028</ext-link></p><graphic xlink:href="elife-07118-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p>Regarding the specificity of the effect on enzyme activity, we have performed in vitro activity assays in which PBP1B (± LpoB) was incubated with PBP3 (possessing it's TM helix) at 0.06% Triton and we see no effect.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) I might have missed this, but I don't think it was shown that cpoB in trans corrects the membrane and/or other defects of the deletion mutant.

The work showing the second function of LpoA is a beautiful story. However, it adds another layer of complexity and I'm not sure that it is critical for the story presented</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback, and have added an early figure illustrating the involved proteins (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Regarding the second function of LpoA, we have simplified this portion of the text (see Major Point 5).

It would be helpful for the reader to get some information on the reasoning behind this experiment.</italic></p><p>We now comment on this in the text (in the beginning of the Results section). We initially modified 18 surface exposed residues of the UB2H domain, identifying 1 (118) cross-linking with CpoB. Next, we modified 6 further residues near T118; of these, E123 cross-linked with CpoB. Then we mutated opposing amino acids (with respect to E123 and T118) on the TP domain (T751 and T753) and found that they also cross-linked with CpoB.</p><p><italic>2) Why are the signals for the deletion mutants in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5"><italic>Figure 4—figure supplement</italic> 5B</xref> <italic>so different from those of the wild-type strain?</italic></p><p>In Δ<italic>tolA</italic>, CpoB levels are in fact elevated (∼25% over wild type), and when TolA is overexpressed they are reduced. (We have observed this both by immunofluorescence, as shown here, and by western blot.) The images that were used to assemble the Δ<italic>tolA</italic> profile map were taken using a shorter exposure time in part to compensate for this, which is why that image profile appears less bright. We note this now in the figure legend. We have also added a plot of fluorescence vs. normalized cell length to clarify this difference; the quantification in this plot accounts for the difference in exposure times. We do not know why TolA has this effect on CpoB levels, though we would speculate that it is an effect of TolA on CpoB stability that is tied to its effect on CpoB oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krachler et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In the SPR experiment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref><italic>), not all of the protein dissociates from the chip after washing with buffer. I wonder whether it is correct to simply use the plateau levels of the different curves to calculate the K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> <italic>value if the total peak level apparently reflects more than one distinct complex? This is not really relevant for the conclusion that PBP</italic>1B <italic>and CpoB interact, but if a K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> <italic>value is given, it should be made sure that it is correct</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, we do not know the stoichiometry of the PBP1B-CpoB interaction. PBP1B can dimerize, and CpoB is a trimer but forms a 1:1 complex with TolA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krachler et al<italic>.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In our SPR experiment CpoB could bind as monomer or trimer to PBP1B (which is possibly a monomer on the chip surface because of the high NaCl concentration during immobilization and the low surface load), and a possible complex of PBP1B with a CpoB trimer could lose CpoB molecules at different rates during the dissociation phase. We do not observe a decline in the RU signal already during the association phase excluding the possibility of a fast binding of a CpoB trimer to PBP1B followed by slow dissociation of one or two CpoB molecules. Taking into account these points, we have now re-analysed the SPR data and calculated the K<sub>D</sub> with the concentration of the CpoB trimer (which is the most likely scenario), and changed the manuscript (in the subsection headed “CpoB, TolA, PBP1B, and LpoB form a complex” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) to indicate that we present the <italic>apparent</italic> K<sub>D</sub> of the interaction of PBP1B with a CpoB trimer.</p><p><italic>4) In case TolA(sol) does indeed not interact with PBP</italic>1B<italic>, using this protein would be a good control for the specificity of the effect on PBP</italic>1B <italic>activity observed with full-length TolA (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We have now done this control showing that, indeed, TolA(sol) has no effect on PBP1B activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>). We also performed a reaction with a large excess of TolA(sol) and CpoB together (both at 40 µM) and saw no effect (not shown).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07118.029</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><italic>&gt;</italic> Contineous GTase assay with dansyl-lipid II and 1 µM PBP1B with 3 µM TolA-his or TolA(sol) at 0.065% Triton, 30°C.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07118.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07118.029</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07118-resp-fig3-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) I wonder how reliable the kinetic rates in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>are. They appear to vary significantly between the different graphs. Moreover, the values given appear to be based on the bottom graph in which there was apparently some disturbance during the first 400 sec of the measurement</italic>.</p><p>We mention in the legend that the variation is due to different conditions (PBP1B concentration, temperature, detergent concentration) optimized for each experiment. For example, with LpoB/TolA the reaction is too fast at the standard conditions to resolve the initial reaction rate; therefore, in this experiment the PBP1B concentration and temperature were lower to allow for rate determination. We did not use the bottom graph for all calculations. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> the fold-increases in rates were always calculated against the mean rate obtained with PBP1B alone at the same reaction conditions, at the fastest rate (which was after 400 sec in the lower graph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We have now clarified this in the Methods (in the subsection headed “In vitro protein interaction and activity assays”).</p><p><italic>6) The authors use the results from their in vivo cross-linking experiments to conclude on direct interactions between proteins (in the subsection headed “Regulation of PBP</italic>1B <italic>by CpoB and TolA responds to Tol-Pal energy state in vivo”). In general, in this kind of analysis, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that these interactions are indirect, in particular when using a relatively long cross-linker such as DTSSP</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, we cannot formally exclude indirect in vivo cross-linking with DTSSP. However, the low cross-linking activity and the fact that we observe the interactions with purified proteins and in the absence of possible bridging partners suggest that these are direct interactions. Therefore, we did not change the text of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
