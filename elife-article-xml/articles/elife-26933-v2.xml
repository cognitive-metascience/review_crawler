Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster, the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). In the photosynthetic organisms, the light-driven formation of the WOC from dissolved metal ions is a key process because it is essential in both initial activation and continuous repair of PSII. Structural information is required for understanding of this chaperone-free metal-cluster assembly. For the first time, we obtained a structure of PSII from <italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic> without the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster. Surprisingly, cluster-removal leaves the positions of all coordinating amino acid residues and most nearby water molecules largely unaffected, resulting in a pre-organized ligand shell for kinetically competent and error-free photo-assembly of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster. First experiments initiating (i) partial disassembly and (ii) partial re-assembly after complete depletion of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster agree with a specific bi-manganese cluster, likely a di-µ-oxo bridged pair of Mn(III) ions, as an assembly intermediate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26933.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26933.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</italic></kwd><kwd>apo-PSII X-ray structure</kwd><kwd>Mn4CaO5-cluster depletion</kwd><kwd>assembly/disassembly of Photosystem II</kwd><kwd>photo-activation</kwd><kwd>intermediate state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Unifying Concepts in Catalysis, Project E2/E3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Miao</given-names></name><name><surname>Dau</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobbek</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name><name><surname>Zouni</surname><given-names>Athina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sonderforschungsbereich 1078, Project A5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bommer</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM055302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chatterjee</surname><given-names>Ruchira</given-names></name><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Award No. RGP0063/2013 310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hussein</surname><given-names>Rana</given-names></name><name><surname>Yano</surname><given-names>Junko</given-names></name><name><surname>Zouni</surname><given-names>Athina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biosciences of the Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contact number: DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yano</surname><given-names>Junko</given-names></name><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structures of photosystem II, with the water-oxidizing Mn4CaO5-cluster fully removed and in an intermediate assembly state, show that photoassembly is facilitated by perfectly pre-arranged protein ligands of the five metal ions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The global oxygen, carbon and nitrogen cycles are driven by complex metalloenzymes.

The shape of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster was described as a ‘distorted chair’: A Mn<sub>3</sub>CaO<sub>4</sub> heterocubane cluster (‘chair base’) with an additional Mn (Mn4) in <italic>exo</italic> position connected to the cubane by two µ-oxo-bridges (‘backrest’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umena et al., 2011</xref>). Further, four water molecules are directly ligated to the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster, two (W1, W2) at Mn4 and the other two (W3, W4) at Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The whole cluster is coordinated by six amino acids from the D1 subunit (PsbA) and one from the CP43 protein (PsbC).</p><p>The mechanism of the PSII repair is important to determine plant productivity and, consequently, a hot spot of physiological research with a research intensity clearly exceeding that of basic research on photosynthetic water oxidation. In the recent research, different models about this mechanism have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Järvi et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nickelsen and Rengstl (2013)</xref> have compared two de novo assembly models for both plants and cyanobacteria exhibiting the common main disassembly phases during the repair (see reviews for more details [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nixon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinz et al., 2016</xref>]). For the light-driven assembly of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster (photo-activation), its mechanism has remained elusive, despite the recent progress in the structure elucidation and mechanistic PSII research in general. The process of photo-activation involves the stepwise incorporation of the Mn and Ca ions into the 'apo-PSIIcc', that is, the dimeric PSII core complex without any metal ions bound at the WOC site. The initial steps of the photo-activation process can be illustrated in the so-called two quantum model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheniae and Martin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dasgupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>): First, a Mn(II) ion binds in the dark at the high-affinity side of the apo-PSIIcc and is oxidized after absorption of a first light quantum forming an unstable Mn(III) intermediate. This step is followed by a light-independent rearrangement. Then a second light quantum drives the oxidation of a second Mn(II) ion resulting in a next assembly intermediate, a binuclear Mn complex, possibly involving two di-µ-oxo bridged Mn(III) ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barra et al., 2006</xref>). The incorporation of the other two missing Mn ions to complete the metal-cluster has not been kinetically resolved.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the determination of the structure of apo-PSIIcc. We used <italic>T. elongatus</italic> PSII crystals described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hellmich et al. (2014)</xref>, where octaethyleneglycolmonododecylether (C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>) detergent-solubilized PSII is crystallized followed by a partial removal of the detergent. This structure consists of a CP43/CP47 and PsbO interlinked row of dimers, packing akin to that in the native thylakoid membrane. The complete depletion of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster was achieved by employing a mixture of NH<sub>2</sub>OH as a reducing agent of the Mn-ions and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chelator for Mn<sup>2+</sup> as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. We performed a systematic study of determining optimal conditions for a complete depletion of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster in dPSIIcc solutions and crystals, by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Interestingly, the incubation of dPSIIcc with NH<sub>2</sub>OH/EDTA in solution not only caused the loss of all the three extrinsic subunits (PsbU, PsbV and PsbO), but also a dissociation of dimeric into monomeric PSIIcc. These results motivated us to develop a new protocol for depletion of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster in C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>-dPSIIcc crystals. For the first time, we obtained a crystal structure of PSII fully depleted of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster, at 2.55 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that all 20 protein subunits and cofactors remained largely unaffected in the absence of the metal-cluster. Small changes in apo-PSIIcc are limited to residues in the vicinity of the cluster and a destabilization of the PsbU subunit. Based on the apo-PSIIcc, initial experiments aiming for a reconstitution of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster were pursued in this study, that paves the road for future structural investigation of assembly intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster depletion performed on dPSIIcc solutions</title><p>We investigated Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster depletion of PSII in solution using various combinations of NH<sub>2</sub>OH and/or EDTA, as suggested in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheniae and Martin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sugiura and Inoue, 1999</xref>). When we treated dPSIIcc solutions with NH<sub>2</sub>OH, they lost O<sub>2</sub> evolution activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the dark-stable S<sub>1</sub>-state of PSII, the WOC is a high valent Mn complex (Mn<sup>III</sup><sub>2</sub> Mn<sup>IV</sup><sub>2</sub>). The addition of NH<sub>2</sub>OH reduces the Mn ions to Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which is no longer stably bound to the PSII apo-protein. Thus, the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster is lost, inactivating light-driven O<sub>2</sub> evolution. A combination of NH<sub>2</sub>OH and EDTA in dPSIIcc solutions caused dissociation of all three extrinsic subunits, PsbU, PsbV and PsbO, whereas all other protein subunits remained bound to PSII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> for larger PSII subunits; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> for smaller PSII subunits). In addition, the absence of PsbO could destabilize the monomer-monomer interaction in the PSII core dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boekema et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komenda et al., 2010</xref>), leading to a monomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consequently, a NH<sub>2</sub>OH/EDTA treated solution of dPSIIcc in C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> lacks the extrinsic subunits mediating crystal contacts in all known high-resolution dPSIIcc crystals.</p><p>To further understand the disassembly process, we also treated the dPSIIcc solution only with EDTA at 50 mM. Under this condition, only the PsbU subunit was removed. This result indicates that PsbU is comparatively loosely bound in the PSIIcc. A destabilization of PsbU is also confirmed by the structural data discussed in the later section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster depletion performed on C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> dPSIIcc microcrystals</title><p>The optimal concentration of NH<sub>2</sub>OH/EDTA was determined by EPR studies.

In the following experiments, we use 50 mM NH<sub>2</sub>OH as the final concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, purple trace). Compared to the spectrum of 'free' Mn<sup>2+</sup> (MnCl<sub>2</sub> solution; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, green trace), the Mn<sup>2+</sup> signal resulting from reduction of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> complex by NH<sub>2</sub>OH has narrower bands and shows modified hyperfine features. In the symmetric hexaaquo coordination in solution, [Mn(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>, we observe a typical six-line EPR signal that arises from the interaction of the electron spin with the <sup>55</sup>Mn nuclear spin (I = 5/2) such that each line represents five almost degenerate spin transitions. In cases where Mn<sup>2+</sup> is bound in an asymmetric environment, like in a protein, a broader signal is observed due to the separation of the different <italic>m<sub>s</sub></italic> levels, and the orientation-dependence of the transitions among them. However, in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, purple trace) only one of the transitions (<italic>m<sub>s</sub></italic> 1/2 ↔ −1/2) remain resolvable and we observe a six-line EPR signal with reduced intensity and narrower spectral width compared to that of the [Mn(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, green trace). Further, washing with 50 mM EDTA ensures that all the Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions inside PSII are removed as evident from the red trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that shows a Mn<sup>2+</sup> free EPR spectrum. (It should be noted that the characteristic TyrD<sup>●</sup> signal of EDTA washed dPSIIcc solutions is significantly weaker than the signal of the untreated sample since the TyrD<sup>●</sup> radical is reduced after addition of NH<sub>2</sub>OH.)

Additional resolution shells extending to 2.2 Å were included in refinement. The structure was build based on the WOC-bound structure at 2.44 Å resolution previously obtained under the same crystallization conditions (PDB entry 4PJ0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hellmich et al., 2014</xref>]). Both the 4PJ0 structure and the 1.9 Å resolution structure (PDB entry 3WU2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umena et al., 2011</xref>]) were used for structural comparison. The overall structures are highly similar and Cα atoms could be superimposed to 4PJ0 with 0.209/0.225 Å rmsd (for the two PSII monomers) and 0.218/0.191 Å (for the two D1 subunits), and to 3WU2 with 0.333/0.257 Å (monomers) and 0.246/0.242 Å (D1). These differences are however consistent with Cα rmsd difference between the two reference structures and may reflect experimental differences such as buffer composition and pH, crystal packing and resolution. 700 water molecules were placed, representing a quarter of those observed at higher resolution in line with expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weichenberger et al., 2015</xref>). Waters are predominantly located within the membrane extrinsic subunits and in channels and cavities leading up to the cluster. They occupy similar positions compared to the high resolution structure (Figure 4B; overlays are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>); but in the apo-PSII structure we did not observe water molecules in place of the W1-4 oxo-ligands otherwise coordinating Mn4 and Ca.</p><p>Removal of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster did not result in any discernible movement of subunits or domains, neither at the PSII donor side nor in the region of the membrane spanning helices or at the acceptor side, as illustrated by an overlay of the C<sub>α</sub> atoms in D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the extrinsic PsbU subunit in the monomer not involved in a crystal contact appeared destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), in line with lability of PsbU binding to PSIIcc in solution in the presence of NH<sub>2</sub>OH/EDTA as discussed above. Structures of thermophilic PSII presented to date share the same <italic>P</italic>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> space group and crystal packing while dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umena et al., 2011</xref>) or detergent depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hellmich et al., 2014</xref>) have resulted in different unit cell size. In both cases, crystal packing relies on contacts between PsbU and PsbV. The crystal contact between the extrinsic subunits PsbU and PsbV acts as a pivot between adjacent PSII dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, inset). Within PSII, PsbU acts as a lid which extends from its closest point (Tyr 103), 14 Å away from the WOC metal-cluster, to 50 Å away. In the crystal packing the two monomers differ as in one monomer PsbU interacts with PsbV’ of a symmetry related PSII dimer in the crystal (locked monomer) while the other monomer (unlocked monomer) does not show this crystal contact between PsbU and PsbV’. While PsbU of both monomers is well resolved, the electron density map of PsbU in the unlocked monomer (which is not stabilized by a crystal contact) is noticeably perturbed in the present structure and apparently more mobile, as judged by atomic B-factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The increased disorder follows through the entire subunit in the one monomer and is translated into the WOC binding site by an interaction of the C-terminal loop of PsbU at Tyr103 which stacks against Pro340 in the C-terminal loop of D1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> inset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This D1 loop connects His337 (µ-oxo-bridge binding), His332, Glu333, Asp342 and the Ala344 carboxyl-terminus which are all ligands to Mn1-4 and Ca. The aromatic structure of Tyr103 in the PsbU protein of red algal PSII has been shown to be important for the optimal function of the WOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okumura et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in the recent cryo-EM structure of spinach PSII, a loop from PsbP takes the place of the PsbU C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). At the WOC binding site, all cluster-ligating side chains, with the exception of Asp170 (located at the opposite side of the WOC site), are more disordered in the unlocked monomer than in the locked monomer even though the cluster is absent in both. From the B-factor analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) we suggest that accessibility and stability of the WOC of PSII treated with reducing and chelating agents may be influenced by a crystal contact involving PsbU. In the locked monomer the WOC is well protected by the intact PsbU subunit (see crystal contact discussed above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, inset, right) whereas in the unlocked monomer the WOC is easier accessible due to the more flexible, perturbed PsbU (no crystal contact in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, inset, left). Thus, crystal packing may have a direct effect on the WOC site. Also in the 2.44 Å resolution structure of the dPSIIcc with fully assembled WOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hellmich et al., 2014</xref>), both monomers differ slightly in the PsbU structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>), albeit more subtle than the two monomers of apo-PSII. Similarly, the XFEL data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Young et al. (2016)</xref>, showed a small difference between the two monomers. These results differ from the conclusions drawn by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al. (2017)</xref> based on their high-resolution structures of PSII, where a difference between the WOC in the two monomers was also observed; they interpreted that the crystal packing most likely does not have an effect, and the structural differences between the two monomers were likely originated from different S-states of the WOC.

This proton-coupled ET step has been found to be strongly slowed down upon Mn depletion and its rate becomes pH dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Styring et al., 2012</xref>). One conceivable explanation is breakage of the TyrZ-His190 hydrogen bond upon Mn depletion. A strong hydrogen bond of 2.4 Å length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umena et al., 2011</xref>) connects the redox active TyrZ and a histidine in D1 in PSII with assembled metal-cluster, whereas for the apo-PSII we determine a distance of 2.8 Å (and of 2.6 Å in the second, unlocked PSII monomer). Yet this observation does not represent evidence for a real change in the TyrZ-O—N-His190 distance, because of the limited resolution of the apo-PSII structure. In conclusion, the TyrZ-O-H—N-His190 H-bond clearly is maintained in the apo-PSII, at least at the proton activity present in the crystals (pH around 7.0–7.5). Structural models at higher resolution are required to answer the question whether the H-bond becomes weakened by removal of the metal-cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>What is there in place of the protein-bound Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster and how could it promote photo-activation?</title><p>In each monomer, two peaks in the electron density map were observed in the absence of the WOC and these have been tentatively assigned as water molecules. They are approximately located at the positions of the two oxygen atoms (O2 and O3) that bridge between Mn2 and Mn3 in the intact complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). (The electron densities also might relate to ammonium or sodium ions from the crystallization buffer or from remaining manganese or calcium ions at low occupancy; yet binding of these cations to the previous O<sup>2-</sup> positions is unlikely.) Inspection of a space-filling model of the emptied WOC site suggests that the gaps between Van-der-Waals spheres do not exceed 3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that two water molecules could be already sufficient to replace the 10 atoms of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> core of the assembled metal-cluster. Although on a first glance surprising, this is understandable: the two water molecules as well as the ligand atoms of the formerly metal-binding residues cover clearly more space in the emptied WOC site because they are not interconnected by coordination bonds; the sum of their Van-der-Waals radii (2 x <italic>R</italic><sub>O</sub> equals about 3.1 Å) exceeds the metal-ligand bonding distance significantly (typical Mn<sup>III/IV</sup>—O bond length of 1.9 Å). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that after removal of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster, several formerly coordinating carboxylate side chains are at H-bonding distances to each other (≤3 Å; His332—Glu189—Asp342; (His337)—Asp342—OCO/Ala344), implying that one carboxylate of each H-bond pair is protonated. Since histidine residues in H-bonding distance to a carboxylate sidechain are most likely protonated, the protonation-state pattern indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is plausible. Assuming that in PSII with fully assembled metal-cluster as well as in the apo-PSII the overall net charge of the metal-cluster site is similar, presumably 2–3 further carboxylate residues (Glu/Asp) will be protonated in the apo-PSII. In conclusion, removal of the five metal ions does not create spatial gaps that would need to be filled by rearrangement of neighboring protein groups. Instead the arrangement of the metal-coordinating residues with and without the metal-cluster is largely the same. Consequently, the apo-PSII, which likely represents the starting state for metal-cluster (re-)assembly, is characterized by pre-formed manganese binding sites, set up to facilitate correct assembly of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster. This chelate effect may be especially strong for Mn1 and Mn2 because there are three coordinating protein groups (versus two for Mn3 and Mn4). All in all, the above structural information points towards an intriguing mode of incorporation of Mn1 and Mn2 into the PSII apo-protein. Namely, deprotonation of the four H-bonding pairs allows for charge-compensated coordination of two Mn cations to the respective residues without any major movement of the coordinating imidazole and carboxylate sidechains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Possible intermediates of disassembly and photo-activation</title><p>After manganese depletion of the dPSIIcc crystals, we achieved partial reassembly of the metal cluster (see also Supplementary).

Due to the low resolution, it remains uncertain whether a single Mn ion binds between the Mn1 and the Mn2 site or whether the Mn1 and Mn2 sites are both occupied by one manganese ion each. Taking into account the pre-formed Mn1 and Mn2 binding sites detected in the apo-PSII, the latter option is more plausible. From these low-resolution crystallographic experiments alone, the precise position, ligation, or occupancy of individual atoms could not be reliably determined. Previous experimental findings supporting a bi-manganese unit as an intermediate in the cluster assembly have been presented (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>] for review). Investigations involving X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) support a di-µ-oxo bridged pair of Mn(III) ions as an intermediate in the heat-induced disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pospísil et al., 2003</xref>), or as an intermediate state during photo-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barra et al., 2006</xref>). The joint evidence from these earlier investigations and our structural data render it plausible that a partially (dis)assembled state of the metal-cluster is formed where the Mn1 and Mn2 site are occupied and interconnected by two bridging oxides (Mn1-(µ-O)<sub>2</sub>-Mn2) in the same way as they are in the fully assembled Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster.</p><p>Several earlier studies arrived at different conclusion whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for proper assembly of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> cluster or not and at what stage of the photo-activation it is involved. The current consensus is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absolutely required for efficient photoassembly and it seems to affect the first photoactivation intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>). In our data we do not see evidence for significant occupancy of the calcium site in the partially assembled metal-cluster. This could be due to several reasons. In previous studies, a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> to Mn<sup>2+</sup> ratio was found to be important for the highest yield of photoactivation with an optimum ratio between 500:1 and 20:1. However, under our buffer conditions it is not possible to increase the calcium concentration (see Materials and methods). It could well be that due to the considerably lower concentration of calcium used we populated an early intermediate state that only includes Mn. On the other hand, one must be aware that at the limited resolution of 4.5 Å achieved for the data of the partially reconstituted PSII it is difficult to locate or decide about the occupancy of calcium (for example it was not possible to locate Ca unambiguously in the initial structural data of intact PSII at 3.8 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zouni et al., 2001</xref>). For that reason, we cannot exclude that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present in the observed assembly intermediate. It should also be noted that previous studies observed the formation of improper Mn clusters with &gt;5 Mn in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1995</xref>) but we do not see any indication of a high number of Mn present in the WOC site, indicating that these clusters are not formed in dPSIIcc crystals under our conditions.</p><p>Recently, strong evidence based on pulsed EPR spectroscopy has been presented that a first step of the photo-activation process is the high-affinity binding of a Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion occurring already in the dark (before onset of illumination) by coordination to two specific axial ligands, Asp170 and Glu333, and thus at the Mn4 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asada and Mino, 2015</xref>), in line with earlier findings reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>). Only Mn4 is coordinated by two carboxylates in trans position and we now find that this distinctive arrangement of Asp170 and Glu333 is maintained upon disassembly of the metal complex. This pre-organized binding site with two axial carboxylate ligands and room for four water ligands in the equatorial plane likely facilitates high-affinity binding of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions in an octahedral geometry. As suggested by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>), Mn may initially bind at the Mn4 site, before it relocates to the Mn1 or Mn2 site. The latter is in line with our observations. Here, we propose a possible model of the initial WOC-reassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) based on our partial assembly data. The movement of the Mn ion initially bound to the Mn4 site towards the Mn1 site could relate to the dark rearrangement step in the two-quantum model of photo-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheniae and Martin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dasgupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Comparison with other metalloenzymes</title><p>The structure of the metal-cluster site is largely identical when comparing fully functional PSII and apo-PSII, in remarkable contrast to many other metalloenzymes. For example, a crystal structure in which the insertion of the catalytic [Mo-7Fe-9S-C] cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spatzal et al., 2011</xref>) of MoFe-containing nitrogenase was interrupted differs remarkably from the holo-protein and shows substantial conformational re-modeling in one of its three subunits whereby a positively charged funnel is created along which the cofactor may be inserted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmid et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, several side and main chain conformations around the cluster cavity vary between cofactor-free and –bound nitrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmid et al., 2002</xref>). A similar situation was reported for FeFe-hydrogenase, where the insertion of the 2Fe sub-cluster to form the H cluster, where the 2Fe sub-cluster is linked to a [4Fe4S]-cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peters et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicolet et al., 1999</xref>), is helped by conformational changes including the formation of a positively charged tunnel from the surface to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulder et al., 2010</xref>). Although dPSIIcc also contains a complex heterometal-cluster, we observed only minor conformational differences between WOC-containing and -free form. As the WOC-free state was generated in the crystal, the absence of conformational changes in PSII may be due to crystal lattice forces, which can not only restrain the dissociation of subunits (PsbU, PsbV and PsbO) but also larger conformational changes near the WOC-binding site. However, local conformational changes in the cavity of the WOC are not restrained by the crystal packing as the residues are directed into a solvent filled cavity. Yet, the side chains do not move.</p><p>The dissimilarity with respect to the assembly of other complex metal sites likely roots in the fact that the WOC is a pentanuclear metal complex with a unique assembly pathway. In contrast to other complex metalloenzymes, whose metal-clusters are assembled on accessory scaffold proteins before being inserted into the target protein, the WOC is assembled in situ, in a multi-step process involving the oxidation of Mn ions at the metal binding site by the tyrosine radical (TyrZ<sup>●</sup>) formed under illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheniae and Martin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dasgupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Burnap, 2016</xref>). We now find that in the apo-PSII, the ligand shell of the Mn<sub>4</sub>Ca-oxo core is pre-organized in a configuration that is surprisingly close to that of the fully assembled metal complex. This almost perfectly pre-organized ligand shell likely facilitates kinetically competent and error-free formation of the metal complex upon light-driven oxidation of Mn ions. Interestingly, although the WOC is unique regarding structural complexity of the Mn<sub>4</sub>Ca metal site and light-driven Mn oxidation during assembly of the metal complex, binuclear Fe or Mn sites found in other proteins not only share similar coordinating residues and bridging ligands, but may also share a similar mode of oxidative self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griese et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>We obtained the PSII structure for crystals completely depleted of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster.

As presented, there are so few details in the paper that the reconstitution experiments could not be replicated independently, and without such details, the reviewers cannot fully assess the validity of the experiments. This issue must be addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Since George Cheniae's early discoveries in the early 1970's, it is known that hydroxylamine causes reduction of Mn in the manganese cluster of PSII followed by loss of oxygen evolution. In cyanobacteria, the loss of the functional manganese cluster results in the loss of the three extrinsic subunits PsbU, PsbV and PsbO following by practical disassembly of the dimeric PSII complex. Reactivation of PSII involves denovo synthesis and assembly of subunits, incorporation of lipids and pigments and finally assembly of the manganese cluster. The stepwise process of photo-activation involves the incorporation of the Mn and Ca ions into the dimeric PSII core complex. First, a Mn(II) ion binds in the dark and is oxidized after absorption of a first light quantum forming an unstable Mn(III) intermediate. Following a light independent rearrangement, a second light quantum drives the oxidation of a second Mn(II) ion resulting in a next assembly intermediate. The incorporation of the other two missing Mn and Ca ions to complete the metal-cluster is not clearly resolved yet.</p><p>Recently &quot;Quebane&quot;-like manganese clusters were synthesized demonstrating the stability and possible self-assembly of such complex. (Barber 2017). However the precise arrangement and the interdependency with the coordinating ligands is not settled. The novelty of this work is that PSII crystals were used for stabilizing the environment of the manganese cluster such that it could be totally depleted without alteration not only in the protein clusters but also of the bound water molecules in its vicinity. This is a remarkable achievement. However the characteristic EPR TyrD● signal was significantly weaker than the signal of the untreated sample presumably because the TyrD● radical was reduced after addition of NH2OH. This alteration might be one of the obstacles that prevented a complete restoration of the oxygen evolution. Even though only partial reconstitution of the manganese cluster was achieved there are sufficient new observations that were achieve at high proficiency to merit publication of the manuscript. This manuscript also can set example for many other unrelated studies that report crystal structures without taking advantage of experiments that could be performed using the crystals.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Zouni and coworkers describes a high-resolution crystal structure of Photosystem II (PSII) in which the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> active site of water oxidation has been removed. Slightly lower resolution structures of partially disassembled and reassembled PSII are also presented. The most striking finding from this structural data is that the protein environment around the active site is basically unchanged in the absence and presence of the Mn cluster. Evidence is presented that in the apo reaction center, only a couple of water molecules fill the void and maintain the geometry of the ligand shell. Therefore, the protein is poised to efficiently assemble the Mn cluster with minimal conformational changes. This result will surprise and impress many in the photosynthesis and bioinorganic research communities.</p><p>All my concerns are with the reconstitution data.</p><p>The authors describe their reconstitution protocol in subsection “Reconstitution of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster<bold>”</bold>. However, not enough detail is provided. Was light provided? What is the occupancy of the QB site? Were electron acceptors added? If no light was used, then only one Mn(II) would be expected to bind to the high affinity site. Only if light was provided is it possible for more than one Mn to be observed.</p><p>In addition, the MnCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations used (10 mM and 5 mM, respectively) are not compatible with efficient photo-assembly. In photo-assembly studies by Cheniae, Burnap, Dismukes, and Brudvig, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is always much higher than Mn<sup>2+</sup> (as is the case in vivo). Maintaining a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]/[Mn<sup>2+</sup>] ration is critical for preventing improperly formed Mn clusters containing &gt;5 Mn per PSII (see Chen, Cheniae 1995). The authors should show that their conditions promote a high yield of photo-assembly with ~4 Mn per PSII.</p><p>It is surprising and concerning that electron density from Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not observed during reconstitution. In subsection “Possible intermediates of disassembly and photo-activation<bold>“,</bold> the authors state &quot;It is disputed whether the calcium ion binds at an early or late photo-activation state&quot; and cite a review by Bao and Burnap. This statement is a mischaracterization of the review and is at odds with the EPR results from Tyryshkin, Dismukes, and coworkers (2006) that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present near the first mononuclear Mn3+ intermediate of photo-assembly. The absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> makes the possibility of an improperly assembled cluster more likely (see previous paragraph).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural insights into the light-driven auto-assembly process of the water-oxidizing Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster in photosystem II&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We rather intended to investigate the structure of the apo site and get some insight into binding of the first Mn in the photoactivation process. We plan to extend these studies in the future to later assembly intermediates and hopefully – eventually to a fully reassembled Mn cluster.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p> <italic>The authors describe their reconstitution protocol in subsection “Reconstitution of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster<bold>”</bold>.

Only if light was provided is it possible for more than one Mn to be observed.</italic></p><p>We have revised the description of the reconstitution protocol to provide more details (Materials and methods). No electron acceptors were added. The reconstitution experiment did not take place in the dark since we had to work with green light (&lt; 2.6 μE /m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> /s) during the treatment of the crystals under the microscope. The accumulated low light exposure was almost certainly sufficient to activate the photooxidation process from Mn<sup>2+</sup> to Mn<sup>3+</sup> at the high affinity site of the WOC. At the current resolution of 4.5 Å, as achieved for the partially reconstituted crystals, the electron density map of the mobile plastoquinone molecule (Q<sub>B</sub>) does not allow to decide about the localization of Q<sub>B</sub>. This is only possible at higher resolutions, better than 3 Å (Loll et al., (2005) resolution. Hence, a PSII crystal structure at a resolution of at least 2.9 Å (Guskov et al., (2009). would be required to determine the occupancy of the Q<sub>B</sub> site. On the other hand it is safe to assume that in the present preparations a sufficient amount of quinones is present to allow transfer of 1 or 2 electrons, as would be necessary for the initial photooxidation of one or two Mn. We previously showed for crystals from similar protein preparations that we can transfer up to 6 electrons without addition of artificial acceptors (Krivanek et al., (2007); (Young et al., (2016), indicating the presence of a small quinone pool in these crystals.</p><p> <italic>In addition, the MnCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations used (10mM and 5mM, respectively) are not compatible with efficient photo-assembly. In photo-assembly studies by Cheniae, Burnap, Dismukes, and Brudvig, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is always much higher than Mn<sup>2+</sup> (as is the case</italic> in vivo<italic>). Maintaining a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]/[Mn<sup>2+</sup>] ration is critical for preventing improperly formed Mn clusters containing &gt;5Mn per PSII (see Chen, Cheniae 1995). The authors should show that their conditions promote a high yield of photo-assembly with ~4Mn per PSII.</italic></p><p>An optimal ratio of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to Ca<sup>2+</sup> was needed for a high yield of photoassembly. In earlier studies, a significantly higher concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was always used in comparison to Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Baranov et al., have determined a fixed Mn<sup>2+</sup> to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio (1:500) which produces the fastest rate and highest yield of photoactivation (Baranov et al., (2004). In contrast, using only 10 to 20- fold higher concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in considerably slower rate of photoassembly (Kolling et al., (2012). However, it must be considered that the Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio suggested from the literature is always for photoassembly experiments with PSII-enriched thylakoid membrane fragments in solutions (e.g. Cheniae, Burnap, Dismukes and Brudvig). In contrast, we used suspensions of crystals of PSII core complex. During our studies we tested various concentrations of MnCl<sub>2</sub> to find the optimum conditions for reconstitution. Whereas very low concentrations did not yield rebinding of Mn, we were able to observe a partial reassembly of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster in PSII crystals at around 10mM MnCl<sub>2.</sub>Since we treated the apo-PSII crystals in the presence of (NH<sub>4)2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, TRIS/HCl and PEG 5000 MME (conditions required to prevent the crystals from dissolving), we observed a precipitation of CaSO<sub>4</sub> when increasing the Ca<sup>2 +</sup> concentration beyond 5 mM. Therefore, we did not attempt a further increase of the concentration of Ca<sup>2+ -</sup>ions and used the maximum Ca concentration possible under our buffer conditions.</p><p>The first Photosystem II crystal structure (Zouni et al., (2001) was determined by a phase extension of 4.2 to 3.8 Å resolution by using a cadmium data set. In this work, we have shown that even small concentrations as well as short incubation times of metal ions (salts) suffice to diffuse into the PSII crystals. The PSII crystals were incubated with only 1 mM CdSO<sub>4</sub> for a few minutes and a binding at the PsbO subunit was observed. Nevertheless, a clear identification of the Ca next to the Mn in the WOC was only possible in the electron density of PSII at 3.0 Å resolution due to its weaker electron density compared to the Mn ions (see discussion in Kern et al., (2007).</p><p>At the limited resolution of 4 - 4.5 Å it is even more difficult to see Ca compared to Mn, so that we cannot exclude that Ca is present. In addition, the Ca site could be not fully occupied or not well-ordered and therefore even more difficult to see compared to the Mn ions.</p><p>In this work, first structural data on the partial re-assembly of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster of PSII were presented at a resolution of 4.5 Å and we want to emphasize that we did not attempt yet to reconstitute a fully activate Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster. Further and detailed experiments involving different buffer conditions, variations of the ratio Ca<sup>2 +</sup> / Mn<sup>2+</sup> and different light conditions on apo-PSII microcrystals by means of membrane inlet mass spectroscopy are planned in the near future to establish optimum conditions for reconstitution of a fully active Mn cluster. But these studies are beyond the scope of the current work. We modified the main text accordingly; see revised text in subsection”Complete and partial Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster depletion on dPSIIcc crystals”.</p><p> <italic>It is surprising and concerning that electron density from Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not observed during reconstitution.

The absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> makes the possibility of an improperly assembled cluster more likely (see previous paragraph).</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the wording for this section was not carefully thought through and modified this section to better describe the literature on the Ca requirement, see subsection “Possible intermediates of disassembly and photo-activation”. As stated above we cannot exclude the presence of Ca based on our low resolution electron densities and we stated this more clearly in the text and also added a sentence to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. We are aware that there is the possibility of an improperly assembled cluster under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions but we did not observe any additional Mn binding (beyond the 1 or 2 that we describe in the manuscript) under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, we observe a similar electron density in terms of extension and position for both the partially disassembled and the partially reconstituted crystals, indicating that we likely observe a similar intermediate in both cases. As stated above the scope of the present work was not to reassemble a fully functional Mn cluster but rather to investigate the structure of the apo binding site and characterize the position of the first Mn bound to the apo site. Future studies will be conducted to characterize the intermediates of assembly in more detail and to find conditions for optimum reconstitution of the full Mn cluster.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p> <italic>This revised manuscript is improved, but additional questions remain regarding the reconstitution protocol and data.</italic></p><p> <italic>Subsection “Partial reconstitution of the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub>-cluster “(&quot;15-20 minutes of dark incubation&quot;) contradicts (&quot;…15 minutes incubation time… the crystals were illuminated with green light…&quot;)</italic></p><p> <italic>How long was the incubation? 15 minutes or 15-20 minutes?
