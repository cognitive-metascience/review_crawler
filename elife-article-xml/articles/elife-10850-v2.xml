drive faithful chromosome segregation. Crossover recombination is non-random across the genome, and centromere-proximal crossovers are associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy, including Trisomy 21 in humans. Here, we identify the conserved Ctf19/CCAN kinetochore sub-complex as a major factor that minimizes potentially deleterious centromere-proximal crossovers in budding yeast. We uncover multi-layered suppression of pericentromeric recombination by the Ctf19 complex, operating across distinct chromosomal distances. The Ctf19 complex prevents meiotic DNA break formation, the initiating event of recombination, proximal to the centromere. The Ctf19 complex independently drives the enrichment of cohesin throughout the broader pericentromere to suppress crossovers, but not DNA breaks. This non-canonical role of the kinetochore in defining a chromosome domain that is refractory to crossovers adds a new layer of functionality by which the kinetochore prevents the incidence of chromosome segregation errors that generate aneuploid gametes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10850.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10850.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10850.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of animals, plants and many other organisms store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus, packaged into structures called chromosomes. Most cells contain two copies of each chromosome – one inherited from each parent. However, sex cells (such as egg cells and sperm cells) contain just one copy of every chromosome, so that when they fuse, the new cell that is formed contains the full set.</p><p>Sex cells form in a process called meiosis, where a cell containing two copies of every chromosome duplicates its genetic material and then divides to form four new cells, each of which contains one copy of each chromosome. During meiosis, different versions of the same chromosome are able to swap sections of their DNA in a process called crossover. However, if a crossover occurs in the wrong part of the chromosome, the chromosome copies may not segregate correctly during cell division. This can lead to the formation of sex cells that contain the wrong number of chromosome copies, which can cause developmental conditions such as Down’s syndrome.</p><p>Crossovers tend not to occur at a region of the chromosomes called the centromere, which is where copies of the same chromosome from the same parent are joined together until it is time for them to separate. If a crossover does occur in this region, segregation problems are more likely to occur. However, exactly how crossovers are suppressed at centromeres is not understood.</p><p>Vincenten et al. examined crossover positioning in budding yeast cells, which are often used as a model to investigate processes such as cell division. This revealed that a protein complex called Ctf19 stops DNA breaks from occurring near the centromere, and so prevents crossovers. Ctf19 also promotes the enrichment of another protein complex called cohesin near centromeres. This does not prevent DNA breaks from occurring, but also prevents crossovers.</p><p>Identifying this role of the Ctf19 complex has paved the way for understanding exactly how DNA breaks are prevented near centromeres. This will allow researchers to determine the impact of misplaced crossovers on how chromosomes segregate into sex cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

reproductive cells during meiosis relies on the accurate segregation of chromosomes during two meiotic divisions (meiosis I and II). Faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I is contingent on inter-homologue linkages that are established during the preceding G2/prophase. These linkages (chiasmata) are the final outcome of programmed DNA break formation and crossover (CO) repair. Improper placement of COs in the vicinity of centromeres negatively influences meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koehler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockmill et al., 2006</xref>), so CO formation close to centromeres is infrequent in many species, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Centola and Carbon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copenhaver et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellermeier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lambie and Roeder, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahtani and Willard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakaseko et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puechberty et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saintenac et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanksley et al., 1992</xref>). However, the mechanisms that control DNA break formation and CO repair close to centromeres remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Talbert and Henikoff, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Centromeres are functionally conserved but structurally diverse, ranging from the simple so-called “point” centromeres of budding yeasts to a variety of more complex “regional” or even holocentric centromeres in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allshire and Karpen, 2008</xref>). Point centromeres are defined by a short ~125bp sequence upon which the kinetochore assembles, while regional centromeres are typically comprised of specialized centromeric chromatin interspersed with blocks of heterochromatin. In fission yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the integrity of pericentromeric heterochromatin was found to repress double-strand break (DSB) formation and centromere-proximal recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellermeier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Westphal and Reuter, 2002</xref>). Although budding yeast lack pericentromeric heterochromatin, suppression of centromere-proximal recombination is also observed in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lambie and Roeder, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, pericentromeric CO suppression has been observed in situations where centromere position is uncoupled from its associated heterochromatin, such as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains carrying translocated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mather, 1939</xref>). These observations suggest the existence of a fundamental mechanism of recombination suppression that functions independently of associated heterochromatin.</p><p>Genome-wide DSB maps in budding yeast have inferred that the centromere exerts a zone of inhibition of meiotic DSB formation, the activity of which decreases over a distance of approximately 10 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Excision of a centromere relieved this DSB suppression, indicating that the centromere, or its associated factors, exert this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robine et al., 2007</xref>). The synaptonemal complex component, Zip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), and the Bloom’s helicase, Sgs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockmill et al., 2006</xref>), which influences repair pathway choice, are also known to minimize centromere recombination. However, both proteins affect recombination globally, acting at a step after DSB formation, and are not specifically localized at centromeres. Instead, centromere-bound factors are likely to dictate the region of recombination suppression in the surrounding pericentromere through mechanisms that remain unclear.</p><p>Candidate centromere-bound factors for the repression of pericentromeric recombination are components of the kinetochore, a sophisticated multi-subunit protein complex nucleated by centromeric chromatin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggins (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheeseman, (2014)</xref>). Within kinetochores, multiple generally conserved sub-complexes can be recognized that perform specific roles. Outer kinetochore sub-complexes together form an interface with microtubules and serve as a platform for spindle assembly checkpoint signaling, coupling chromosome-microtubule interactions with cell cycle progression. Inner kinetochore sub-complexes direct assembly of the outer kinetochore. Several kinetochore subcomplexes together assemble into a Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN; also known as the Ctf19 complex in budding yeast) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McAinsh and Meraldi (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Westermann and Schleiffer (2013)</xref>) As its name implies, the CCAN/Ctf19 complex is bound to centromeric chromatin throughout the mitotic or meiotic cell division program. In meiotic G2/prophase of budding yeast, when recombination occurs, only the Ctf19 and Mis12/MIND (<underline>M</underline>tw1 <underline>i</underline>ncluding <underline>N</underline>nf1-Nsl1-<underline>D</underline>sn1) kinetochore complexes are bound to the centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). The Ctf19 complex exerts long range effects by promoting cohesin enrichment throughout the ~20–50 kb surrounding pericentromere despite being restricted to the core ~125 bp centromere sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernius and Marston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ng et al., 2009</xref>). It does so by targeting the Scc2/4 cohesin loader to the centromere, from where cohesin spreads into the pericentromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernius et al., 2013</xref>). These characteristics make the Ctf19 complex a particularly good candidate for mediating kinetochore-derived recombination suppression. Here we show that both cohesin-independent suppression of DSB formation and cohesin-dependent repair pathway choice underlie a central role for the Ctf19 complex in suppression of CO formation in the pericentromere.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex suppresses pericentromeric COs</title><p>To understand how pericentromeric COs are prevented, we used a fluorescent CO reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thacker et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to measure recombination rates within a pericentromere (around <italic>CEN8, </italic>the centromere of chromosome <italic>VIII</italic>) or, as a control, on a chromosome arm interval of equivalent size on chromosome <italic>VIII</italic> of budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

During meiotic prophase, when recombination occurs, only the MIND and Ctf19 complexes are assembled on centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2012</xref>) and their components associate with kinetochores at least partially independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We were unable to test the requirement for the MIND complex in preventing pericentromeric recombination using the fluorescent reporter assay because depletion of two components of the essential MIND complex, Dsn1 or Mtw1, prevented proper execution of the meiotic divisions and tetrad formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the conserved Ctf19/CCAN kinetochore complex. Using the live cell reporter assay, we observed a significantly increased frequency of pericentromeric COs in cells lacking the Ctf19 complex components Iml3<sup>CENP-L</sup>, Chl4<sup>CENP-N</sup>, Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup> and Ctf19<sup>CENP-P </sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; the gene names of the human homologues are indicated in superscript). This effect appeared to be specific to the pericentromere, as no significant changes in recombination were observed within the chromosomal arm interval in the absence of Iml3<sup>CENP-L</sup>, Chl4<sup>CENP-N</sup>, Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup> and Ctf19<sup>CENP-P </sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Other kinetochore subunits (Cnn1<sup>CENP-T</sup>, Wip1<sup>CENP-W</sup>, Nkp1, Nkp2) had a more modest effect on pericentromeric COs, while we found no evidence that Mhf1<sup>CENP-S</sup> and Mhf2<sup>CENP-X</sup>, which have additional roles in meiotic DNA repair together with Mph1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osman and Whitby, 2013</xref>), are required for suppression of pericentromeric COs. Thus, the Ctf19 inner kinetochore subcomplex affects pericentromeric meiotic recombination.</p><p>We corroborated these findings by analyzing the effect of the Ctf19 complex on global meiotic recombination patterns, using high throughput sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in the haploid progeny generated from meiosis of a hybrid yeast strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oke et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This method allows the detection of CO and non-crossover (NCO) repair products (i.e. gene conversions), which can inform on altered regulation of meiotic DNA break repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Poor spore viability (typically &lt;30%) precluded us from using Ctf19 complex deletion mutants. Instead, we used a meiosis-specific hypomorphic depletion allele of <italic>IML3 (pCLB2-3HA-IML3</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and were able to isolate 8 four-spore-viable tetrads for high-throughput sequencing and global recombination analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Although we observed no global change in the average number of COs or NCOs in the <italic>pCLB2-3HA-IML3 </italic>strain compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), the distribution of recombination was affected: the frequency of both COs and NCOs within 20 kb of centromeres was overall significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). These events were detected on most, but not all, chromosomes, although we are unable to test significance for individual chromosomes due to an insufficient number of events analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

All meiotic recombination events begin with the programmed introduction of DSBs by the topoisomerase-related protein Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). DSBs form throughout the genome, but are strongly repressed within ~3 kb of budding yeast centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). We generated genome-wide DSB maps of the <italic>mcm21</italic>△ mutant by high-throughput sequencing of oligonucleotides that remain covalently bound to Spo11 as a by-product of DSB processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, increased centromere-proximal DSBs were detected in the <italic>mcm21</italic>△ mutant compared with wild type, revealing a general role for the Ctf19 complex in suppression of pericentromeric DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Pericentromeric DSBs in the <italic>mcm21</italic>△ mutant reached a level similar to the genome average (dotted lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that there is no residual DSB suppression in the absence of Mcm21. Strikingly, the increase in DSBs occurred over a narrower domain (~3 kb on each side of the centromere, i.e. a total region of ~6 kb) than CO formation (~20 kb each side of the centromere, ~40 kb in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), indicating that suppression of COs at centromeres is not solely due to a reduction in DSB levels. To compare the effect on DSBs and COs more directly, we examined DSB formation in the intervals on chromosome <italic>VIII</italic> analyzed in the live cell recombination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, we observed an increase in DSBs within the same pericentromeric interval in which we measured CO frequency using the live cell reporter assay. However, DSBs were increased only ~5-fold over wild type in <italic>mcm21</italic>△ within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), while we observed an ~21-fold increase in COs within the same region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

The variability in susceptibility of the different pericentromeres to DSBs is likely explained by their underlying features, since it is well-established that DSB formation is influenced by chromatin and genome organization (e.g. the availability of gene promoters that serve as a preferred target of Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>)).

Pericentromeric enrichment of the meiotic cohesin subunit, Rec8, at G2/prophase I also depended on the Ctf19 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Since cohesin has been implicated in influencing meiotic DNA break formation and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellermeier and Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>), we used the live cell recombination reporter assay to test the requirement for cohesin in preventing pericentromeric COs. To prevent pleiotropic phenotypes and sporulation failure associated with total cohesin loss in meiosis, we employed a mutation in the Scc4 subunit of the cohesin loader (<italic>scc4-m35</italic>), which in vegetative cells specifically abolishes pericentromeric cohesin enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinshaw et al., 2015</xref>). In meiotic prophase, Rec8 levels were indeed reduced at centromeric and pericentromeric sites in <italic>scc4-m35 </italic>cells. However, chromosomal arm sites were also affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>scc4-m35</italic> mutations might influence cohesin loading at non-centromeric sites during meiosis.

To test this, we used the “anchor away” system to selectively and conditionally deplete Ctf19 from the nucleus after S-phase (via timed addition of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that anchoring away Ctf19 before S phase (t=0) would prevent pericentromeric cohesin establishment, similar to a <italic>ctf19</italic>△ strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernius et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, because cohesin establishment is coupled to DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>), addition of rapamycin after S phase (t=3) would allow cohesion establishment, thereby allowing us to test cohesin-independent functions of the Ctf19 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). First, we confirmed the successful removal of Ctf19-Frb-GFP from the centromere by addition of rapamycin either before (t=0) or after (t=3) DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Next, we examined the effect on centromeric cohesin. Rec8 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in prophase I cells revealed that centromeric cohesin levels were more greatly reduced by anchoring away Ctf19 before (t=0 h) rather than after DNA replication (t=3 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Because this assay does not allow cohesin loaded before or after DNA replication to be distinguished, we sought to test the functionality of pericentromeric cohesin in the two conditions. Since only functional cohesin is expected to be retained at centromeres during anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 1999</xref>), we examined Rec8 on chromosome spreads in binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Although centromeric Rec8 was detected in only 4% of binucleate cells where Ctf19 was anchored away before DNA replication (Rapa t=0), centromeric Rec8 was observed in 48% of binucleate cells where Ctf19 was anchored away after DNA replication (Rapa t=3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Therefore, the presence of Ctf19 before and during S phase allows for the establishment of functional pericentromeric cohesin. Having established conditions that allowed us to uncouple pericentromeric cohesin establishment from post-S phase functions of the Ctf19 complex, we asked whether the role of the Ctf19 complex in suppressing pericentromeric DSBs is linked to its role in cohesin establishment during S phase. As expected, anchoring away Ctf19 before (Rapa t=0) DNA replication led to the appearance of <italic>CEN1-</italic>proximal DSBs with comparable timing and intensity to those of <italic>ctf19</italic>△ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). DSBs were also observed following rapamycin addition at 3 hr, i.e. after DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This suggests that the Ctf19 complex is required throughout meiotic prophase to prevent pericentromeric DSB formation and that it does so in a manner independent of its role in cohesin establishment.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10850.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pericentromeric cohesin does not prevent DSBs, but ensures their repair does not form COs.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Anchoring away Ctf19 after DNA replication and cohesion establishment is not sufficient to prevent the appearance of centromere-proximal DSBs.

Consistent with our findings above, <italic>CEN1-</italic>proximal DSBs were not observed in <italic>rec8</italic>△ or <italic>scc4-m35 </italic>cells, unless a Ctf19 complex component (Mcm21<sup>CENP-O</sup>) was also absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,K</xref>). Thus, DSB inhibition near centromeres does not depend on cohesin, but requires the continuous presence of the Ctf19 complex. These findings provide an explanation for our observation that Ctf19 complex mutants exhibit a higher frequency of pericentromeric COs than <italic>scc4-m35 </italic>mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), despite a comparable reduction in pericentromeric cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Loss of <italic>MCM21</italic> relieved DSB suppression over a domain (~6 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that is much larger than the 125 bp where the kinetochore resides but smaller than the cohesin-rich pericentromere (~20 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We therefore speculate that the large multi-subunit Ctf19 complex may exert DSB suppression near centromeres by altering local chromosome structure such that accessibility of DSB-promoting factors is prevented.</p><p>Our findings suggest that pericentromeric cohesin might provide a safeguarding mechanism to channel residual centromere-proximal DNA breaks towards repair pathways that do not promote CO formation. If this is the case, DSBs arising after DNA replication and pericentromeric cohesion establishment would not be expected to give rise to pericentromeric COs. To test this idea, we anchored away Ctf19 either before (t=0) or after (t=3) DNA replication, both of which induce <italic>CEN1-</italic>proximal DSBs soon thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) and measured CO formation using the live cell reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). Anchoring Ctf19 away before DNA replication (t=0) increased pericentromeric COs to a similar extent to <italic>ctf19</italic>△ cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>), as expected. However, anchoring Ctf19 away after DNA replication (t=3) led to a more modest increase in pericentromeric COs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>), despite comparable levels of DNA break formation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>). Therefore, pericentromeric cohesin acts at a step after DSB formation to direct repair, probably through a pathway avoiding the homolog, to ensure CO suppression near centromeres. Because the cohesin complex is known to promote inter-sister recombination in mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Covo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellermeier and Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001</xref>) the simplest explanation is that increased pericentromeric cohesin shunts meiotic DSBs into inter-sister-specific recombinational repair, although we cannot rule out pericentromere-specific, cohesin-dependent activation of alternative repair pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Zip1 prevents pericentromeric COs and promotes centromere pairing through separate mechanisms</title><p>Rec8 globally influences the localization of the synaptonemal complex (SC) component Zip1 along chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuong and Dawson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brar et al., 2009</xref>). Because Zip1, like cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>) has been suggested to confer a bias on DSBs to be repaired from the sister chromatid, rather than the homolog, and because loss of Zip1 increases pericentromeric COs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but not DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), we reasoned that a critical role of pericentromeric cohesin might be Zip1 recruitment.

Unexpectedly, “full” Zip1 localization along chromosomes was also impaired in Ctf19 complex mutants.

In cells lacking the Ctf19 kinetochore sub-complex, pericentromeric CO formation drastically increases.

On a global scale, the assembly of a meiotic chromosome axis dictates the spatial distribution of the meiotic DSB machinery along chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>). On a smaller scale, genome organization and histone modifications have been shown to allow Spo11 activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Massy (2013)</xref>). Spo11-dependent DSB formation is strongly associated with chromatin regions that are enriched for histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Massy (2013)</xref>) and in budding yeast, these modifications are found near transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tischfield and Keeney, 2012</xref>)). Indeed, within the budding yeast genome, Spo11 prefers to cleave DNA in open, nucleosome-free regions that are most often found in active, divergent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Superimposed on these global determinants of the DSB landscape are specific and spatial controls, which create zones of inhibition within at-risk genomic regions such as telomeres, repetitive DNA arrays and centromeres (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Massy (2013)</xref>). We find that the kinetochore actively minimizes DSB formation within a region of ~6 kb, surrounding all budding yeast centromeres. The underlying genome organization of these regions is not obviously different from the rest of the genome, harboring a similar density of genes and regulatory elements, which would ordinarily be expected to contain several DSB-permissive regions, were they not located close to a centromere. Indeed, in the absence of the Ctf19 kinetochore sub-complex, DSB formation is strongly increased, and these DSBs have features typical of preferred DSB sites genome-wide. Accordingly, one of the strongest pericentromeric DSBs that we identified here, at <italic>CEN1</italic>, falls within a divergent promoter (of the genes <italic>TFC3</italic> and <italic>NUP60; </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The Ctf19 complex suppresses DSB formation surrounding all centromeres, though to different extents depending on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that it overcomes the intrinsic features of the chromatin organization in the pericentromere to dampen DSB activity. This could be achieved by locally shaping a higher order chromosome organization and/or by influencing the recruitment of meiotic chromosome axis components. Intriguingly, the chromosomal region protected from DSBs (~6 kb) extends far beyond the binding of the Ctf19 complex, which is restricted to the 125 bp point centromere, as defined by the assembly of a nucleosome containing the centromere-specific histone variant Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggins, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the Ctf19 complex protects a region about 50 times larger than that occupied by the centromeric nucleosome from DSBs, suggesting that the effect is not merely due to a local disturbance of Cse4<sup>CENP-A</sup>. A precedent for the idea that the Ctf19 complex can exert long-range effects on the pericentromere through its role in driving cohesin loading at the centromere to enrich the surrounding 20–50 kb is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernius and Marston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ng et al., 2013</xref>). However, we found that the Ctf19 complex must prevent DSB formation independently of its role in promoting cohesin enrichment within pericentromeres. Cohesin enrichment was neither sufficient nor required to prevent DSBs near <italic>CEN1</italic>. Furthermore, DSB suppression acts on shorter chromosomal distances (~6 kb), than the ~20–50 kb sized regions within which the Ctf19 complex influences cohesin recruitment. Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of an additional, distinct Ctf19 complex-dependent effect on meiotic DSB formation within regions adjacent to centromeres. By analogy to the effect on pericentromeric cohesin enrichment, we speculate that the Ctf19 complex may enable the centromeric recruitment of factors that alter chromatin organization in the surrounding region.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cohesin recruitment in the pericentromere by the Ctf19 complex diverts DNA repair pathways away from the homolog to prevent CO formation</title><p>Minimizing the initiating event of meiotic recombination, DSB formation, is an efficient way to shield against unwanted pericentromeric CO formation. However, the prevention of pericentromeric DSBs by the Ctf19 complex is not absolute, as DSBs are observed near centromeres in wild type cells, although at reduced levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). We found that DSBs that escape the repressive control of the Ctf19 complex are diverted from repair pathways that would lead to potentially deleterious CO formation by cohesin, which is established at high levels within pericentromeres. These observations are in agreement with previous conclusions that pericentromeric CO formation is more strongly suppressed than DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitzblau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found that forced removal of the Ctf19 complex from kinetochores after S-phase triggered increased DSB formation, but led to only a relatively modest increase in CO formation. Conversely, a cohesin-loader mutant (<italic>scc4-m35</italic>) that disrupts the proper establishment of cohesin showed increased levels of CO formation, whereas no increased DSB formation could be detected. Thus, DSBs that occur within the pericentromeric regions when high levels of cohesion are present are shunted away from inter-homologous recombinational repair (that eventually can yield a CO or NCO). Taking into account the established roles for cohesin in promoting inter-sister repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Covo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellermeier and Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kugou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sjogren and Nasmyth, 2001</xref>), we consider it is most likely that these breaks will preferentially be repaired using the sister chromatid as a repair template.</p><p>How would the enrichment of cohesin minimize inter-homologue repair? One possibility is that high levels of cohesin turn the sister chromatid within pericentromeres into a preferred repair template. Indeed, it has been shown that template choice (sister or homologue) for DSB repair during budding yeast vegetative growth is dictated by the levels of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Covo et al., 2010</xref>). Globally, on meiotic chromosomes, repair of DSBs is normally biased towards use of the homologous chromosome instead of the sister chromatid to ensure at least one COs is formed to link each homolog pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollingsworth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Humphryes and Hochwagen, 2014</xref>). In budding yeast, this homologue bias is established by the Red1/Hop1/Mek1 signaling axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niu et al., 2005</xref>). This signaling pathway is thought to locally antagonize cohesin to enable the use of the more distant homologous chromosome as a repair template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Potentially, the Red1/Hop1/Mek1 system is not capable of counteracting cohesin within pericentromeres, where much higher levels of cohesin are present as compared to elsewhere in the genome. Alternatively, one could envision that, within pericentromeric regions, Red1/Hop1/Mek1 are incapacitated via active inhibition or removal.</p><p>Our findings point to a second mechanism through which cohesin steers repair of meiotic DSBs away from inter-homologue repair: by promoting the local recruitment of Zip1. Zip1 has previously been implicated in preventing pericentromeric CO and NCO repair, and was suggested to promote inter-sister repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). We found that proper recruitment of Zip1 to the pericentromere requires the Ctf19 complex and kinetochore-targeted Scc2/4, consistent with previous studies demonstrating a requirement for cohesin in Zip1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuong and Dawson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brar et al., 2009</xref>). Zip1 performs specific functions at centromeres during prophase, which include non-homologous centromere-coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsubouchi and Roeder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsubouchi et al., 2008</xref>), repression of pericentromeric CO formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>) and the bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gladstone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newnham et al., 2010</xref>). Here we have shown that the Ctf19 complex, presumably through its role in directing pericentromeric cohesin enrichment, enables the dedicated recruitment of a centromere-localized pool of Zip1 to perform these specialized functions.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that the kinetochore, and specifically the Ctf19 complex, promotes the establishment of an inter-homologue recombination-suppressed zone surrounding centromeres. To do so, the Ctf19 complex recruits high levels of cohesin within pericentromeres, which in turn triggers efficient recruitment of the synaptonemal complex component Zip1, effectively leading to strong, local inhibition of inter-homologue directed repair.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A novel role for the kinetochore during meiotic G2/Prophase</title><p>CO formation in the vicinity of centromeres negatively influences meiotic chromosome segregation in diverse organisms, and is associated with the incidence of Trisomy 21, or Down’s syndrome, in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koehler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockmill et al., 2006</xref>). Mechanistically, pericentromeric CO formation has been suggested to lead to a local disturbance of sister chromatid cohesion, which could lead to precocious separation sister chromatid, causing meiosis II non-disjunction and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockmill et al., 2006</xref>). While meiosis II mis-segregation is a characteristic feature of Ctf19 complex mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernius and Marston, 2009</xref>), the impact of pericentromeric COs on this phenotype is currently unclear because of the requirement for this complex for proper pericentromeric cohesion.</p><p>The kinetochore is a sophisticated machine that couples chromosomes to microtubules and drives their segregation in meiosis and mitosis. The kinetochore also serves as a signaling platform that monitors and responds to the state of kinetochore–microtubule attachment in the context of the cell cycle. During meiosis, in addition to the canonical events that also take place during mitosis, the kinetochore takes on additional roles to bring about the specialized segregation pattern. First, sister chromatids need to attach to microtubules that emanate from the same pole in a mono-oriented fashion. Second, sister chromatid cohesion at pericentromeres needs to be protected from removal during meiosis I. In both cases, the kinetochore controls these events by coordinating the recruitment of specific protein complexes (i.e. monopolin and Sgo1/PP2A, respectively) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duro and Marston (2015)</xref>). Our data add a hitherto unknown, additional level of functionality to the kinetochore in meiosis, in which it impacts meiosis-specific CO formation by influencing both meiotic DSB formation and recombinational break repair. As such, it effectively prevents the formation of unwanted chiasma within pericentromeres. Finally, we note that our data might also provide an additional rationale for why much higher cohesin levels need to be established around centromeres, namely to minimise CO formation near centromeres.</p><p>The Ctf19 complex is a generally conserved component of eukaryotic kinetochores. Suppression of meiotic CO recombination within pericentromeres is a widespread feature of meiotic recombination in many diverse organisms, whether or not their centromeres are surrounded by large blocks of heterochromatinized DNA. We therefore suggest that Ctf19 complex-driven suppression of meiotic CO formation serves as a universal component of the mechanisms that shape the meiotic recombination landscape in order to promote the faithful propagation of the genome from generation to the next.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of SK1 and genotypes are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4A</xref> except for the strains used for analysis of recombination genome-wide where AM15182 and AM15183 haploid strains derived from YJM789 and S96, respectively, were used.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Jim Kadonaga (Senior Editor), Michael Lichten (Guest Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Meiotic recombination is suppressed in the vicinity of the centromere in many organisms. Studies in budding yeast have shown that this suppression extends not only to crossovers, but to the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination. This study shows that the conserved Ctf19/CCAN complex, part of the kinetochore which is necessary for recruitment of pericentric cohesin, is required for this suppression, but suggests that it suppresses breaks and crossover through distinct mechanisms.</p><p>The consensus of the reviewers was that this paper brings new information to an important topic and, although the mechanism by which the Ctf19/CCAN complex suppresses DSBs and crossovers remains unclear, the findings of the paper are potentially of sufficient interest, but the following issues need to be addressed. In some cases, the additional work and/or analysis requested below could change some of the major conclusions of the paper, although it seems unlikely that the main conclusion will be affected.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Are other kinetochore complexes involved CO/DSB suppression? Further mutant studies may be beyond the scope, but the involvement of other kinetochore proteins should be considered and discussed. For example, is the MIND complex retained at meiotic centromeres in the absence of the Ctf19 complex?</p><p>2) A general concern involved the switching between different mutants and chromosomal regions in different experiments and figures. If at all possible, additional mutants should be included or additional analysis done so that there is more overlap between figures. For example, the addition of <italic>ctf19-del</italic> to the ChIP-qPCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref> would provide a useful point of comparison to the anchor-away allele used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and thus would provide at least an indirect measure of the efficacy of the anchor away. Similarly, it would be useful to make a direct comparison between COs and DSBs in the same CEN8-associated interval in the <italic>mms21-del</italic> mutant background.</p><p>3) Inclusion of primary data and/or error bars to allow the reader to evaluate differences. For tetrad analyses, this means that the primary data should be included in a supplementary table, so that statistical power can be evaluated as well as significance of difference. Three examples: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, pCLB2-IML3 is &quot;n.s.&quot; relative to wild-type, but one suspects that this may be due to insufficient numbers of tetrads being analyzed, given the differences in frequencies shown. There is a similar concern with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>. Finally, it appears that Ctf19 complexes are increasing crossovers in the arm interval as well, and given the differences (15 versus 25%) it should be easy to make these numbers statistically significant. Given that the spore color assay makes it possible to readily examine hundreds of tetrads, it is important to analyze enough to exclude biologically significant differences that might be masked due to small numbers. In addition, there exist online tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://molbio.uoregon.edu/~fstahl/">http://molbio.uoregon.edu/~fstahl/</ext-link>) that allow calculation of standard errors for tetrad-derived map distances. Please be aware that, upon revision, if it still appears that insufficient tetrads have been analyzed, there will likely be a direct request to analyze more.</p><p>4) The quality of southern blots is below standard; if phosphorimaging was used, it is permissible to subtract general background if this will increase clarity. In critical cases, in particular the comparison between anchor-away at 0 and 3 hr, DSBs must be quantified. It is not at all clear that there is a quantitative difference between the impact of anchor-away 0 versus 3 hr on DSBs and on crossovers, but such a difference lies at the heart of the argument that Ctf19/CCAN depletion differentially affects breaks and crossovers.</p><p>5) The anchor-away experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which lie at the heart of the paper, are problematic in several ways:</p><p>A) The extent of Ctf19 depletion at kinetochores is not assessed-this is an important control to do.</p><p>B) It appears that Ctf19 anchor-away does not result in a loss of pericentric cohesin regardless of when it is executed. Similarly, it appears that there are significant losses of cohesin at CEN4 regardless of the time of execution. Therefore, if there really are differences in DSB repair under the two anchor-away conditions (see point 4, above), it is difficult to see how these can be attributed to differences in cohesin recruitment.</p><p>C) To recapitulate point 4, it is not at all clear that crossovers and DSBs are differently affected by the time when Ctf19 anchor-away is executed. Careful quantification is necessary to prove this point, and if the DSB analysis was only done once, additional replicates will need to be done.</p><p>6) While it is clear that the Ctf19 complex is involved in suppressing DSBs near centromeres, is there still residual suppressing in its absence? In addition to the &quot;fold-change&quot; graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, it would be useful to plot the mean Spo11-oligo signal as a function of distance from the centromere, comparing wild-type and <italic>mcm21-del</italic>. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> in Buhler et al., 2007 for an illustration.</p><p>7) While it is clear that pCLB2-IML3 is a hypomorph, the authors need to address the fact that it displays a clear increase in centromere-adjacent crossovers in only 8 of the 16 yeast chromosomes. Are these data compromised by insufficient numbers? As with tetrad data, the actual number of events need to be reported, so that they can be vigorously analyzed for sufficient statistical power and statistical significance.</p><p>8) With regards to the experiments addressing Zip1 and the role of Ctf19 complex-loaded cohesin in recruiting Zip1:</p><p>A) Ctf19 complex mutants seem to disrupt not only initial Zip1 recruitment to centromeres, but subsequent synapsis. It's not clear why this should be the case, if arm recombination and cohesin loading are unaffected, and this should be addressed.</p><p>B) While <italic>zip1-del</italic> mutants increase pericentromeric crossovers (and possibly zip1-S75E, if sufficient numbers of tetrads are examined), their impact on pericentromeric DSBs is not addressed, and should be.</p><p>C) The <italic>scc4-m35</italic> mutant almost entirely eliminates Zip1 loading at centromeres, but increases pericentromeric crossovers to a substantially greater extent than does <italic>zip1-del</italic>, suggesting that pericentromeric cohesin might be doing other things to suppress crossovers other than recruiting Zip1. This should be considered and discussed, and an epistasis experiment should be considered if you truly believe that this is the main mode of pericentric crossover suppression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10850.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Are other kinetochore complexes involved CO/DSB suppression? Further mutant studies may be beyond the scope, but the involvement of other kinetochore proteins should be considered and discussed. For example, is the MIND complex retained at meiotic centromeres in the absence of the Ctf19 complex?</italic> </p><p>During meiotic prophase, only the Ctf19/CCAN and MIND complexes are present at centromeres. It would be interesting to examine the role of the MIND complex in CO suppression, however, there are considerable technical difficulties with doing so and this is beyond the scope of the current study. MIND is known to be essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachments and, consistent with this, depletion of its Mtw1 and Dsn1 components during meiosis led to a near-complete failure in chromosome segregation with very few tetranucleate cells being produced (this data is now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since measurement of CO frequency relies on the production of spores, we were unable to assay CO suppression in these strains.We were, however, able to examine DSBs at <italic>CEN1</italic> by Southern blotting. We found that Dsn1 is also required for suppression of DSBs, suggesting the integrity of the kinetochore might be generally important for DSB suppression. This data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and referred to in the last paragraph of the subsection “The Ctf19 complex inhibits centromere-proximal DNA breaks”.</p><p>The relationship between the Ctf19 complex and MIND is complex and currently unclear. We observed a modest reduction in the centromeric localization of the MIND component, Dsn1, in the Ctf19 complex mutant, <italic>mcm21</italic>△ . Conversely, Mcm21 was retained at centromeres in Dsn1 cells and appears elevated in Mtw1-depleted cells, despite massive chromosome mis-segregation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests a partial and complex inter-dependence of the Ctf19 and MIND complexes at the kinetochore. The finding that Dsn1 is at least partially localized in <italic>mcm21</italic>△ cells is consistent with the fact that nuclear division occurs in <italic>mcm21</italic>△ but not <italic>pCLB2-DSN1</italic> cells and suggests that the Ctf19 complex functions at least partially independent of the MIND complex in CO suppression. Although we agree that it will be important to understand the relationship between the Ctf19 complex and MIND in CO suppression in the future, further analysis is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>2) A general concern involved the switching between different mutants and chromosomal regions in different experiments and figures. If at all possible, additional mutants should be included or additional analysis done so that there is more overlap between figures. For example, the addition of ctf19-del to the ChIP-qPCR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref> would provide a useful point of comparison to the anchor-away allele used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and thus would provide at least an indirect measure of the efficacy of the anchor away. Similarly, it would be useful to make a direct comparison between COs and DSBs in the same CEN8-associated interval in the mms21-del mutant background.</italic> </p><p>We have now included <italic>chl4</italic>△ and <italic>ctf19</italic>△ strains in the analysis of Rec8 localization by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> in the revised version) to allow comparison with the anchor away experiments.</p><p>We now also include a direct comparison of DSBs and COs in the <italic>CEN8</italic> interval analysed in the live cell recombination assay. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref> and the relevant text is in the first paragraph of the subsection “The Ctf19 complex inhibits centromere-proximal DNA breaks”. This analysis shows that there is an increase in DSB levels within the <italic>CEN8-</italic>associated interval of about 5-fold over wild type. The total increase in CO formation within this interval was 21-fold over wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), lending further support for a dual effect of the Ctf19 complex on recombination outcomes at pericentromeric regions (see also further below).</p><p><italic>3) Inclusion of primary data and/or error bars to allow the reader to evaluate differences. For tetrad analyses, this means that the primary data should be included in a supplementary table, so that statistical power can be evaluated as well as significance of difference. Three examples: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, pCLB2-IML3 is &quot;n.s.&quot; relative to wild-type, but one suspects that this may be due to insufficient numbers of tetrads being analyzed, given the differences in frequencies shown. There is a similar concern with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>.

Please be aware that, upon revision, if it still appears that insufficient tetrads have been analyzed, there will likely be a direct request to analyze more.</italic> </p><p>We have included error bars and statistical analysis throughout.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the helpful suggestions related to the tetrad data and have now done extensive further analyses, which have allowed us to strengthen our conclusions. As suggested, we have now used the online tool to calculate standard errors and these are given on all tetrad data throughout the manuscript. We have also determined statistical power for all tetrad data: all significant effects reported have a statistical power of at least 0.95, with the exception of the decrease in map distance within the arm interval in <italic>zip1</italic>△ cells (power of 0.90) and the modest increase in map distance within the pericentromeric interval when Ctf19 is anchored away after DNA replication (power of 0.87). Of note to the specific examples raised by the reviewers: (1) CO recombination in the pericentromeric interval is indeed significantly increased in <italic>pCLB2-3HA-IML3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); (2) There is a significant, albeit modest, increase in pericentromeric COs when Ctf19-Frb is anchored away after DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). (3) Further analysis of the chromosome arm interval in Ctf19 complex mutants did not provide evidence of a significant increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All raw data is now included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, together with power calculations and statistical analysis.</p><p>It is important to note that although in principle it is possible to score hundreds of tetrads in this assay, this is not feasible for many of the strains in practice. Firstly, expression of the spore autonomous markers relies on tetrad formation and the fraction of Ctf19 complex mutant cells that reach this stage is very low (between ~10-30% depending on the mutant). Furthermore, chromosome segregation is greatly impaired in Ctf19 complex mutants and to avoid confounding effects of mis-segregation, we can only score tetrads where each spore inherits one copy of the chromosome <italic>VIII</italic> (4 blue spores), a relatively small fraction of the overall spore count, which is already low.</p><p>Finally, we found no evidence for significant changes in CO frequency on the chromosomal arm region in Ctf19 complex mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), though the values appear slightly elevated. Power calculations indicate that at least 8000 tetrads per individual strain (containing a faithfully segregated chromosome <italic>VIII</italic>) would need to be analyzed to determine significance for these differences. Due to the difficulties mentioned above, this would be a huge undertaking that would require weeks of analysis for a single strain.</p><p><italic>4) The quality of southern blots is below standard; if phosphorimaging was used, it is permissible to subtract general background if this will increase clarity. In critical cases, in particular the comparison between anchor-away at 0 and 3 hr, DSBs must be quantified. It is not at all clear that there is a quantitative difference between the impact of anchor-away 0 versus 3 hr on DSBs and on crossovers, but such a difference lies at the heart of the argument that Ctf19/CCAN depletion differentially affects breaks and crossovers.</italic> </p><p>We have now repeated and replaced some of the southern blots to improve quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6J</xref>), and for others we have subtracted general background to increase clarity. In the case of the timed anchor-away experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), we have quantified DSB-intensities at <italic>CEN1</italic> at relevant time points and treatment regimes (quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). This quantification shows that DSB intensities at <italic>CEN1</italic> upon anchoring-away Ctf19 after S-phase (t=0 hours) reach comparable levels as compared to DSB intensities (albeit of course only after a delay) that are measured upon anchoring-away Ctf19 before S-phase (t=0 hours). These similar levels of DSB formation soon after rapamycin addition but irrespective of the time in meiosis at which Ctf19 is anchored away, is in contrast with the significant differences in CO levels that we observed when anchoring-away Ctf19 using identical regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). The shown southern analysis and quantification is a representative experiment; a similar experiment was performed that demonstrated comparable effects on DSB intensities and anchoring away of a different Ctf19 complex, Iml3 showed a similar effect on DSB formation. However, due to technical difficulties in quantifying these blots, in part due to weak specific signals together with high background signals, we have decided to only include the DSB quantification of the southern blot that is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>.</p><p>We would like point out that several additional lines of evidence provide strong support for two differential effects of Ctf19/CCAN on DSB formation and recombination, with only the latter depending on cohesin:</p><p>A) Our analysis of DSB levels (based on Spo11-oligo mapping) and CO levels within the CO interval close to <italic>CEN8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>) revealed a 20-fold increase in CO levels, whereas DSB levels only exhibit a 5-fold increase in <italic>mcm21</italic>△. This strongly indicates that Ctf19/CCAN influences CO repair in ways other than merely suppressing DSBs.</p><p>B) We found DSB formation at <italic>CEN1</italic> to be independent of Rec8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), and we also did not observe <italic>CEN1</italic>-associated DSB formation in <italic>scc4-m35</italic> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), despite the fact that we did find a significant effect on pericentromeric CO formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>C) Finally, we note genome-wide maps of DSBs and of CO formation in wild type cells (Blitzblau et al., 2007; Buhler et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2011) have revealed a stronger suppression of COs as compared to DSB formation, again hinting at suppression of pericentromeric CO formation in addition to mere suppression of DSBs.</p><p><italic>5) The anchor-away experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which lie at the heart of the paper, are problematic in several ways:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The extent of Ctf19 depletion at kinetochores is not assessed-this is an important control to do.</italic> </p><p>We have performed anti-GFP ChIP analysis on Ctf19-Frb-GFP and presented the results in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This experiment shows efficient depletion of Ctf19 from the centromere when rapamycin is added either at 0h or at 3h.</p><p><italic>B) It appears that Ctf19 anchor-away does not result in a loss of pericentric cohesin regardless of when it is executed. Similarly, it appears that there are significant losses of cohesin at CEN4 regardless of the time of execution. Therefore, if there really are differences in DSB repair under the two anchor-away conditions (see point 4, above), it is difficult to see how these can be attributed to differences in cohesin recruitment.</italic> </p><p>It is true that some centromeric cohesin is present in prophase even after anchoring away Ctf19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, this is also true in <italic>ctf19</italic>△ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Previous work in vegetatively growing cells (Fernius and Marston, 2009) demonstrated that the Ctf19 complex is important for the timely recruitment of cohesin to centromeres (i.e. before S phase), so that it can be converted to functional cohesin (i.e. cohesin that supports sister chromatid cohesion), which requires DNA replication, as previously demonstrated (Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998). In the absence of the Ctf19 complex, cohesin presumably moves from other (chromosome arm) loading sites to the centromere, but does not become functional because it arrives after the replication fork has already passed. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that only in the case where Ctf19 is present as cells undergo replication (i.e. rapamycin addition at t=3) would functional cohesin be built, while addition of rapamycin before DNA replication (t=0) would preclude functional cohesion establishment. During anaphase I, functional pericentromeric cohesin is protected from separase cleavage and can be observed at centromeres on chromosome spreads. As a measure of the functionalityof cohesin, we therefore performed chromosome spreads to visualize Rec8 in binucleate cells after release from a prophase I block after anchoring away Ctf19 at either t=0 or t=3. This data (now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>) clearly shows an increase in pericentromeric cohesin in binucleate cells treated with rapamycin at t=3, compared to those treated at t=0. We have also extensively re-written this section more carefully explaining our rationale for clarity (subsection “Pericentromeric cohesin shields against CO repair of centromere-proximal DSBs”, second paragraph). Together with the quantification of DSBs (see point 4 above) and the finding that cohesin (<italic>rec8</italic>△ and <italic>scc4-m35</italic>) mutants do not relieve DSB suppression, we believe there is now strong evidence that the Ctf19 complex suppresses DSBs independently of cohesin.</p><p><italic>C) To recapitulate point 4, it is not at all clear that crossovers and DSBs are differently affected by the time when Ctf19 anchor-away is executed. Careful quantification is necessary to prove this point, and if the DSB analysis was only done once, additional replicates will need to be done.</italic> </p><p>See point 4.</p><p><italic>6) While it is clear that the Ctf19 complex is involved in suppressing DSBs near centromeres, is there still residual suppressing in its absence? In addition to the &quot;fold-change&quot; graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, it would be useful to plot the mean Spo11-oligo signal as a function of distance from the centromere, comparing wild-type and mcm21-del. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> in Buhler et al., 2007 for an illustration.</italic> </p><p>This is a great suggestion. We have plotted the Spo11-oligo data as suggested, and this data is now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. The graph clearly shows that there is no residual suppression of DSBs in the absence of the Ctf19 complex, effectively making the regions close to centromeres experience DSB levels that are comparable to average genome-wide DSB levels. We now also explicitly make this point in the text (subsection “The Ctf19 complex inhibits centromere-proximal DNA breaks”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>7) While it is clear that pCLB2-IML3 is a hypomorph, the authors need to address the fact that it displays a clear increase in centromere-adjacent crossovers in only 8 of the 16 yeast chromosomes. Are these data compromised by insufficient numbers? As with tetrad data, the actual number of events need to be reported, so that they can be vigorously analyzed for sufficient statistical power and statistical significance.</italic> </p><p>Due to poor spore viability of the <italic>pCLB2-3HA-IML3</italic> strain we were able to recover only 8 full tetrads for sequencing, so yes, the data are compromised by sufficient numbers and no statistical arguments can be made when considering the chromosomes individually. We included the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> for information only. We have now also included the source data we used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. All statistical arguments are made only when considering all chromosomes together and this analysis is also included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) With regards to the experiments addressing Zip1 and the role of Ctf19 complex-loaded cohesin in recruiting Zip1:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Ctf19 complex mutants seem to disrupt not only initial Zip1 recruitment to centromeres, but subsequent synapsis. It's not clear why this should be the case, if arm recombination and cohesin loading are unaffected, and this should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our observation that full assembly of Zip1 along the spread chromosomes is impaired in Ctf19 complex mutants was unexpected and the reason remains unclear. We suggest that the lower percentage of cells with full length Zip1 staining along chromosomes is simply due to a reduction of Zip1 enrichment in the centromeric region, leading to the “discontinuous” appearance. Ctf19 complex mutants also exhibit a delay in meiotic G2/prophase which potentially exacerbates this effect. Furthermore, our Zip1 ChIP-Seq analysis revealed the strongest concentration of Zip1 at the centromere in wild type cells and a clear reduction in centromeric Zip1 in <italic>mcm21</italic>△ and <italic>iml3</italic>△ mutants. In contrast, chromosomal arm Zip1 does not appear to be grossly affected by deletion of <italic>MCM21</italic> or <italic>IML3</italic> in the ChIP-Seq or ChIP-qPCR analysis (with the exception of the <italic>ctf19</italic>△ mutant, for reasons that are unclear). Furthermore, previous work has established the centromere as the initiation site for chromosome synapsis (Tsubouchi et al., 2008 Genes Dev), yet the importance of this initiation site to the “full” Zip1 tracts typical of wild type cells has not, to our knowledge, been tested. Taken together, our Zip1 ChIP-Seq and chromosome spreading data indicate that initial Zip1 loading at the centromere may be important for robust Zip1 tracts along entire chromosomes. While indeed interesting, we feel that further investigation of the role of the kinetochore in synaptonemal assembly is beyond the scope of the current study but have added a couple of sentences highlighting this observation in the first paragraph of the subsection “Zip1 prevents pericentromeric COs and promotes centromere pairing through separate mechanisms”.</p><p><italic>B) While zip1-del mutants increase pericentromeric crossovers (and possibly zip1-S75E, if sufficient numbers of tetrads are examined), their impact on pericentromeric DSBs is not addressed, and should be.</italic> </p><p>Blitzblau et al., 2007 and Chen et al., 2008 previously showed that Zip1 is not required to suppress pericentromeric DSBs globally, by mapping ssDNA, and also showed, using southern blotting, that DSB intensities and patterns did not change around individual centromeres. We have now used Southern blotting to analyze <italic>CEN1-</italic>proximal DSBs in <italic>zip1</italic>△ cells and come to similar conclusions: Zip1 is not essential for centromere-proximal DSB suppression. This data is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. This finding, together with the fact that we found no evidence that pericentromeric COs are increased in <italic>zip1-S75E</italic> led us to expect no increase in pericentromeric DSBs in the <italic>zip1-S75E</italic> mutant and therefore, given the limited time, we concluded that examination of DSBs in the <italic>zip1-S75E</italic> mutant was not an important priority.</p><p><italic>C) The scc4-m35 mutant almost entirely eliminates Zip1 loading at centromeres, but increases pericentromeric crossovers to a substantially greater extent than does zip1-del, suggesting that pericentromeric cohesin might be doing other things to suppress crossovers other than recruiting Zip1. This should be considered and discussed, and an epistasis experiment should be considered if you truly believe that this is the main mode of pericentric crossover suppression.</italic> </p><p>We have now analyzed additional tetrads to achieve a statistical power of at least 0.96 and found only a minor difference in CO frequency within the pericentromeric interval between <italic>scc4-m35</italic> and <italic>zip1</italic>△ cells (2.4cM vs 2.0cM, respectively). However, this still does not rule out Zip1-independent functions for cohesin in CO suppression and we have included a statement to this effect (subsection “Zip1 prevents pericentromeric COs and promotes centromere pairing through separate mechanisms”, first paragraph).</p><p>We attempted to analyze a <italic>scc4-m35 zip1</italic>△ double mutant in the live cell recombination assay, but unfortunately these cells failed to undergo meiosis and produce tetrads. Although the reasons are currently unclear, this may suggest independent roles for cohesin and Zip1 in some aspect of meiosis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
