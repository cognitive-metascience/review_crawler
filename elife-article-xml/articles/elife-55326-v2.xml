Selective loading of peptides onto MHC I, referred to as peptide editing, is catalyzed by tapasin and the tapasin-related TAPBPR. An important catalytic role has been ascribed to a structural feature in TAPBPR called the scoop loop, but the exact function of the scoop loop remains elusive. Here, using a reconstituted system of defined peptide-exchange components including human TAPBPR variants, we uncover a substantial contribution of the scoop loop to the stability of the MHC I-chaperone complex and to peptide editing. We reveal that the scoop loop of TAPBPR functions as an internal peptide surrogate in peptide-depleted environments stabilizing empty MHC I and impeding peptide rebinding. The scoop loop thereby acts as an additional selectivity filter in shaping the repertoire of presented peptide epitopes and the formation of a hierarchical immune response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in the body keep the immune system informed about their health by showing it fragments of the proteins they have been making. They display these fragments, called peptides, on MHC molecules for passing immune cells to inspect. That way, if a cell becomes infected and starts to make virus proteins, or if it becomes damaged and starts to make abnormal proteins, the immune system can ‘see’ what is happening inside and trigger a response.</p><p>MHC molecules each have a groove that can hold one peptide for inspection. For the surveillance system to work, the cell needs to load a peptide into each groove before the MHC molecules reach the cell surface. Once the MHC molecules are on the cell surface, the peptides need to stay put; if they fall out, the immune system will not be able to detect them. The problem for the cell is that not all peptides fit tightly into the groove, so the cell needs to check each one before it goes out. It does this using a protein called TAPBPR.</p><p>TAPBPR has a finger-like structural feature called the &quot;scoop loop&quot;, which fits into the end of the MHC groove while the molecule waits for a peptide. It was not clear, however, what this loop actually does. To investigate, Sagert et al. mutated the scoop loop of TAPBPR to see what happened to MHC loading in test tubes.</p><p>The experiments revealed that the scoop loop plays two important roles. The first is to keep the MHC molecule stable when it is empty, and the second is to hinder unsuitable peptides from binding. The scoop loop sticks into one side of the groove like a tiny hairpin, so that pushed-out, poorly fitting peptides cannot reattach. At the same time, it holds the MHC molecule steady until a better peptide comes along and only releases when the new peptide has slotted tightly into the groove.</p><p>Understanding how cells choose which peptides to show to the immune system is important for many diseases. If cells are unable to find a suitable peptide for a particular illness, it can stop the immune system from mounting a strong response. Further research into this quality control process could aid the design of new therapies for infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive immunity</kwd><kwd>antigen processing</kwd><kwd>mhc class i molecules</kwd><kwd>peptide editing</kwd><kwd>quality contol</kwd><kwd>chaperones</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC_AdG 789121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TA 157/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A dedicated structural element facilitates chaperone and antigenic peptide selector function of TAP-associated glycoprotein, a major quality assurance auditor in adaptive immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleated cells of higher vertebrates provide information about their health status by presenting a selection of endogenous peptides on MHC I molecules at the cell surface. By sampling these peptide-MHC I (pMHC I) complexes, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes are able to detect and eliminate infected or cancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rock et al., 2016</xref>). In a process called peptide editing or proofreading, peptides derived from the cellular proteome are selected for their ability to form stable pMHC I complexes. This peptide editing is known to be catalyzed by the two homologous MHC I-specific chaperones tapasin (Tsn) and TAP-binding protein-related (TAPBPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleischmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neerincx and Boyle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thomas and Tampé, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wearsch et al., 2011</xref>). The selection of high-affinity MHC I-associated peptide epitopes is of pivotal importance not only for immunosurveillance by effector T lymphocytes, but also for priming of naïve T cells and T cell differentiation. As an integral constituent of the peptide-loading complex (PLC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the ER-restricted Tsn functions in a ‘nanocompartment’ characterized by a high concentration of diverse, optimal peptides. The peptides are shuttled into the ER by the heterodimeric ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter associated with antigen processing TAP1/2, the central component of the PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abele and Tampé, 2018</xref>). In the ER, most peptides are further trimmed by the aminopeptidases ERAP1 and ERAP2 to an optimal length for binding in the MHC I groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evnouchidou and van Endert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hammer et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to Tsn, TAPBPR operates independently of the PLC and is also found in the peptide-depleted <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). Fundamental insights into the architecture and dynamic nature of the Tsn-containing PLC have come from a recent cryo-EM study of the fully-assembled human PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blees et al., 2017</xref>), while the basic principles underlying catalyzed peptide editing have been elucidated by crystal structures of the TAPBPR-MHC I complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>): TAPBPR stabilizes the peptide-binding groove in a widened conformation primarily through the MHC I α2–1 helix, distorts the floor of the binding groove, and shifts the position of β2-microglobulin (β2m). Furthermore, one of the two TAPBPR-MHC I complex structures revealed a remarkable structural feature in TAPBPR named the scoop loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). In TAPBPR, this loop is significantly longer than the corresponding region in Tsn, which was not resolved in the X-ray structure of Tsn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, the scoop loop of TAPBPR is located in the F-pocket region of the empty MHC I binding groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). By anchoring the C-terminal part of the peptide, the F pocket region is crucially involved in defining pMHC I stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abualrous et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hein et al., 2014</xref>). The scoop loop occupies a position that is incompatible with peptide binding and displaces or coordinates several key MHC I residues responsible for binding the C terminus of the peptide. We therefore proposed that the scoop loop can be regarded as a surrogate for the C terminus of the displaced peptide, stabilizing the inherently labile empty MHC I molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). At the same time, by occupying a region critical to peptide binding, the scoop loop might allow only high-affinity peptides to re-enter the MHC I binding groove after displacement of sub-optimal peptide. The proposed importance of the scoop loop for TAPBPR function has recently been scrutinized in a study by Ilca et al. investigating TAPBPR scoop-loop variants using immunopeptidomics and cell-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). Ilca et al. found that a specific leucine residue in the scoop loop facilitates peptide displacement on MHC I allomorphs favoring hydrophobic peptide side chains in their F pocket. Here, we aimed to clarify the role of the scoop loop during TAPBPR-catalyzed peptide editing using in vitro interaction and peptide-exchange studies with defined, purified components. We demonstrate that the scoop loop is of critical importance for TAPBPR-mediated stabilization of empty MHC I clients in peptide-depleted environments and contributes to peptide quality control during editing by impeding released peptide to rebind in the MHC I groove. Collectively, our data support a crucial role for the TAPBPR scoop loop in establishing a hierarchical immune response.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression and purification of different TAPBPR scoop-loop variants and MHC I chaperone clients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) X-ray structure of the TAPBPR-MHC I complex in cartoon representation (PDB ID: 5OPI).

The ER-lumenal domains of wildtype (wt) TAPBPR and the variants, each harboring a C-terminal histidine tag, were expressed in insect cells and purified from the cell culture supernatant via immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).

HLA-A*02:01, the major MHC I allomorph in the Caucasian population and found in more than 50% of the global population, presents a diverse spectrum of immunodominant autoimmune, viral, and tumor epitopes and is therefore medically highly relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucherma et al., 2013</xref>).

A hallmark of peptide editors like TAPBPR is their ability to recognize and chaperone this intermediate until it is located in a peptide-rich environment where a high-affinity peptide ligand can enter the MHC I binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thomas and Tampé, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thomas and Tampé, 2017b</xref>). To scrutinize the role of the scoop loop in chaperoning empty MHC I, we tested the ability of our TAPBPR variants to stabilize peptide-free H2-D<sup>b</sup>. Hence, H2-D<sup>b</sup> (10 µM) loaded with a photo-cleavable peptide was incubated with TAPBPR (3 µM) under UV exposure. Subsequent SEC analysis revealed that both TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> are, in principle, competent to form complexes with MHC I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in comparison to TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), the amount of H2-D<sup>b</sup> complex detected for TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> during SEC was reduced by around 40% and 90%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). After reanalysis of the MHC I chaperone complexes by SEC, the mutant complexes were mostly dissociated, indicating kinetic instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, isolation and reinjection of the wt complex showed that it remained stable for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Yet, in the presence of a high-affinity peptide, even the TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup>-MHC I complex dissociated, in accordance with the role of TAPBPR as a chaperone that stabilizes the MHC I as long as no optimal peptide is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the scoop loop is crucial to an extended lifetime of the chaperone-client complex, enabling the escorting of empty MHC I by TAPBPR in a peptide-deficient environment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Complex formation between MHC I and TAPBPR variants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H2-D<sup>b</sup> (10 µM) loaded with a photo-cleavable peptide (RGPGRAFJ*TI, J* denotes photocleavable amino acid) was irradiated with UV light in the presence of TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> (3 µM, red), TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> (blue), or TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> (yellow) and subsequently analyzed by SEC.

To this end, we employed an in-vitro peptide exchange assay similar to the one previously described for measuring the activity of Tsn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleischmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>). Dissociation of medium-affinity fluorescent peptide from refolded and purified p*MHC I (p* denotes fluorescently-labeled peptide) was monitored by fluorescence polarization after addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled high-affinity competitor peptide in the absence or presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The large molar excess of unlabeled competitor peptide ensures that once a fluorescent peptide dissociates, it does not rebind, but is replaced by an unlabeled competitor-peptide molecule. The observed rate constant is thus solely determined by the dissociation rate constant of the fluorescent peptide. The condition of this assay mimics the environment of the PLC, where optimal, high-affinity peptides abound. For the mouse MHC I allomorph H2-D<sup>b</sup>, TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> and the scoop-loop variants accelerated the uncatalyzed peptide release (2.53 ± 0.37 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) to a similar extent. The TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> mutant lacking the entire scoop loop exhibited slightly reduced activity (7.68 ± 1.17 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) compared to the wt protein (10.41 ± 0.54 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), whereas TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> was slightly more active (12.64 ± 1.03 × 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). When we performed the experiment at a much lower TAPBPR concentration (75 nM), the TAPBPRs retained their activity, and the gradual activity differences between the variants remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> and the scoop-loop mutants have similar affinities for H2-D<sup>b</sup>. TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> was even able to catalyze displacement of a high-affinity peptide from H2-D<sup>b</sup>, although the catalytic effect was considerably smaller (1.8-fold acceleration) than for H2-D<sup>b</sup> loaded with the medium-affinity peptide (4.1-fold acceleration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In a second set of experiments, we analyzed peptide dissociation from the human MHC I allomorph HLA-A*02:01.

The TN3 (E72K) and TN6 (E185K, R187E, Q189S, Q261S) mutants were initially described for Tsn to significantly reduce or abolish MHC I binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). The impact of the TN6 mutations on MHC I interaction was later confirmed for TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). According to the TAPBPR-MHC I crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>), the residue in TAPBPR (E105) corresponding to the mutated residue in Tsn-TN3 forms a hydrogen bond with the swung-out Y84 of the MHC heavy chain, which is involved in coordinating the C-terminus of the peptide in liganded MHC. We reasoned that a mutation to Ala instead of Lys might increase the mutational effect and therefore generated the TN3-Ala mutant. Two of the mutated residues in TN6 (R210 and Q212) are part of the jack hairpin of TAPBPR and form several interactions with MHC I heavy-chain residues, while Q275 lies in the interface with the α2–1 helix and the β8 sheet in the floor of the MHC I binding groove. Consequently, TN3-Ala and TN6 displayed drastically reduced activity towards H2-D<sup>b</sup> in our peptide-exchange experiment, with peptide dissociation rate constants close to the value of the uncatalyzed reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>). In summary, the results of our exchange assays demonstrate that under peptide-rich condition, the tested TAPBPR variants differ gradually in their displacement activity in an allomorph-dependent manner. But even the TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> mutant lacking the scoop loop is still able to substantially accelerate peptide dissociation from MHC I.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The scoop loop acts as an internal peptide competitor</title><p>In the TAPBPR-MHC I crystal structure, the scoop loop binds in the F pocket region of the MHC binding groove and appears to act as a surrogate for the peptide C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). This notion is corroborated by our SEC analyses, which show that the scoop loop stabilizes peptide-free MHC I. We therefore wondered if the scoop loop impedes rebinding of displaced peptide and functions ‘in cis’ as a tethered, internal peptide competitor in the F pocket with extremely high effective concentration. To test this hypothesis, we modified the peptide exchange assay for H2-D<sup>b</sup> and HLA-A*02:01 by adding in a first step only TAPBPR without competitor peptide, which allowed us to monitor the change in free and bound fluorescent peptide under the influence of peptide rebinding in the presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This condition mimics the physiological environment TAPBPR is operating in, where optimal replacement peptides are scarce. Strikingly, after addition of the different TAPBPRs to H2-D<sup>b</sup> loaded with fluorescent peptide, the polarization changes, which correspond to the changes in the ratio of free to bound peptide, diverged dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Peptide dissociation was most pronounced for TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> with the native scoop loop, reaching ~ 60% peptide release, whereas only ~ 12% of the peptide population was released from H2-D<sup>b</sup> by TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup>, and almost no decrease in polarization was caused by TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup>. Similar to our original peptide exchange assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), differences between the two MHC I allomorphs were observed: In comparison to H2-D<sup>b</sup>, TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup>-induced peptide dissociation from HLA-A*02:01 was significantly stronger, approaching the level of peptide release induced by TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Peptide release was also peptide-dependent, as H2-D<sup>b</sup> loaded with a high-affinity peptide led to a significantly smaller decline in bound peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). After addition of competitor peptide (2<sup>nd</sup> step), the observed dissociation rate constants were in the same range as the values determined for the one-step experiment. Moreover, the level of released peptide after TAPBPR addition was titratable and reached saturation at 3 µM TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under the given conditions, TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> was able to dissociate 70% (H2-D<sup>b</sup>) and 80% (HLA-A*02:01) of total MHC I-associated peptide, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggest that the scoop loop interferes with re-binding of displaced peptide. It can only be completely dislodged from the MHC I binding pocket by a high-affinity peptide. The scoop loop thus acts as a crucial selectivity filter during peptide editing on MHC I.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The scoop loop acts as a selectivity filter during peptide editing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of two-step peptide exchange assay.

The molecular underpinnings of their chaperone and peptide proofreading activities have only recently been uncovered by crystal structures of the TAPBPR-MHC I complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). Notably, one of the X-ray structures resolved a loop structure, termed the scoop loop, that is wedged into the F-pocket region of the empty MHC I binding groove and has been postulated to play an important role during peptide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). Here, we show that the TAPBPR scoop loop is indeed critically important in chaperoning intrinsically unstable empty MHC I clients in a peptide-depleted environment. This is illustrated by the reduced chaperone activity of TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup>, which harbors the shorter Tsn scoop loop, and by the dramatically reduced lifetime of the TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> complex. In a peptide-rich, PLC-like environment, emulated by our one-step displacement experiments, the TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> mutant displays the highest activity, while TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> retains the ability to displace peptide. The latter observation appears to be in contrast to the study by Ilca et al. which found that TAPBPR with a mutated, but full-length scoop loop loses its ability to effectively mediate peptide dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ilca et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to stabilizing the chaperone-MHC I complex, we demonstrate that the TAPBPR scoop loop acts as an internal peptide competitor, and thus, as a selectivity filter in the discrimination between low- and high-affinity peptides. Although a direct competition appears to be the most obvious explanation for the effect on peptide rebinding, we cannot exclude that the scoop loop exerts its influence on peptide rebinding by an allosteric mechanism. The peptide-filtering activity seems to be allomorph-dependent for TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup>. Our current interpretation of this allomorph specificity is that the Tsn scoop loop interacts more strongly with the F-pocket region of HLA-A*02:01 and is therefore able to impede peptide rebinding more efficiently than in the case of H2-D<sup>b</sup>. In contrast, TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> shows a strong peptide release activity towards both MHC I allomorphs.</p><p>Based on the new insights, we propose the following model of TAPBPR-catalyzed peptide optimization on MHC I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): The large concave surface formed by the N-terminal domain of TAPBPR mediates its initial encounter with a suboptimally-loaded MHC I, assisted by the C-terminal domain of TAPBPR, which contacts the α3 domain of the MHC I heavy chain and β2m. TAPBPR facilitates the release of low- to medium-affinity peptides primarily by widening the peptide-binding groove through the MHC I α2–1-helix, fastening the peptide-coordinating Tyr84, distorting the floor of the binding groove, and shifting the position of β2m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). This remodeling is made possible by the intrinsic plasticity of MHC I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garstka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McShan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Natarajan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thomas and Tampé, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van Hateren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Hateren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wieczorek et al., 2017</xref>), and it appears to be induced primarily by structural elements of TAPBPR that lie outside the scoop loop. As a result, the TAPBPR<sup>ΔSL</sup> mutant lacking the scoop loop is still able to catalyze peptide displacement. Once the suboptimal peptide has been released, the scoop loop occupies the position of the peptide C terminus in the F-pocket region. The scoop loop thereby contributes to the stabilization of the peptide-deficient binding groove. Our two-step peptide exchange — mimicking a peptide-depleted environment — demonstrates that the scoop loop functions at the same time as a peptide selectivity filter by impeding re-binding of the replaced peptide, either through direct competition with the C terminus of the incoming replacement peptide or through an allosteric mechanism. Hence, the scoop loop contributes to the significant affinity decrease of incoming peptides for the MHC I groove in the presence of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McShan et al., 2018</xref>). Assuming a mode of direct competition, the replacement peptide would dock in the MHC I groove first with its N terminus, before it competes with the TAPBPR scoop loop over the F pocket region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hafstrand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas and Tampé, 2017a</xref>). Negative allosteric coupling between different parts of the MHC I molecule might play a role in the final release of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McShan et al., 2018</xref>). The shorter scoop loop in Tsn suggests that its selective pressure on the replacement peptide is weaker than in TAPBPR. Indeed, our fluorescence polarization and SEC analyses show that the tapasin scoop loop in TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> is less efficient in preventing re-binding of dissociated peptide.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanistic functions of the scoop loop in catalyzed peptide proofreading.</title><p>MHC I molecules bound to low-affinity peptide are recognized by the peptide editor (TAPBPR) (step 1). The editor lowers the peptide affinity of the suboptimally-loaded MHC I and induces dissociation of the low- to medium-affinity peptide (step 2). The scoop loop, which inserts into the F-pocket region of the peptide-binding groove, crucially contributes to the stabilization of the empty MHC I. In the absence of suitable peptides, empty MHC I clients are thereby held in a stable state until they can be loaded with an optimal epitope, for example in the PLC. Re-binding of the low-affinity peptide (step 3) is impeded by the scoop loop, through direct competition and/or via allosteric means. Only high-affinity peptides are able to compete with the editor over key regions of the peptide-binding groove (step 4) to eventually displace the scoop loop and the editor from the MHC I (step 5). The displaced editor is now ready for a new round of peptide selection, and the stable pMHC I complex is licensed to travel via the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55326-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Physiologically, these observations might be explained by the fact that Tsn functions within the PLC, a ‘nanocompartment’ characterized by an abundant and diverse supply of optimal peptides, reaching a bulk concentration of up to 16 µM before the TAP transporter is arrested by trans-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grossmann et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Tsn is supported by other PLC chaperones in stabilizing empty MHC I clients. In contrast, TAPBPR operates as a single MHC I-dedicated chaperone outside the PLC in environments where the concentration of high-affinity peptides is drastically lower and MHC I clients have to be stabilized in a peptide-receptive state for extended periods of time. Long-term stabilization of suboptimally-loaded or empty MHC I by TAPBPR also allows the major ER/<italic>cis</italic>-Golgi glycoprotein folding sensor UGGT1 (UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1) to re-glucosylate the MHC I molecule in order to feed it back into the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and/or allow recruitment of the MHC I to the PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neerincx et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thomas and Tampé, 2019</xref>). In conclusion, the evidence provided by our study indicates that the scoop loop is evolutionarily fine-tuned to enable Tsn and TAPBPR to accomplish their dual function as chaperone and proofreader in the specific subcellular location they operate in. By serving both as a stabilizing element and as selectivity filter in TAPBPR, the scoop loop influences peptide editing and impacts the repertoire of MHC I-associated epitopes presented on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

TAPBPR proteins were expressed in <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (<italic>Sf</italic>21 or <italic>Sf</italic>9) insect cells according to standard protocols for the Bac-to-Bac system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). A high-titer recombinant baculovirus stock was used to infect the insect cells at a density of 1.5–2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, which were cultivated in Sf-900 III SFM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 28°C. The cell culture medium containing secreted TAPBPR was harvested 72 hr after infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Refolding and purification of β2m</title><p>β2m was refolded by dialysis essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodenko et al., 2006</xref>) and purified by SEC on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) in HEPES-buffered saline (1xHBS: 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). Purified protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 3 kDa MWCO, Merck Millipore).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Peptide synthesis and labeling</title><p>The following peptides were used: the photo-cleavable peptide photo-P18-I10 (RGPGRAFJ*TI) (H2-D<sup>b</sup>) [J*=3-amino-3-(2-nitro)phenyl-propionic acid], the non-fluorescent competitor peptides ASNENMETM (H2-D<sup>b</sup>) and FLPSDEEPYV (HLA-A*02:01), as well as the fluorescently labeled peptides TQSC*NTQSI (H2-D<sup>b</sup>), FLPSDC*FPSF (HLA-A*02:01), ASNC*NMETM (H2-D<sup>b</sup>) (C* denotes TAMRA-labeled cysteine). Non-natural peptide epitopes were designed based on their theoretical affinities according to the NetMHCpan server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jurtz et al., 2017</xref>). While TQSC*NTQSI and FLPSDC*FPSF were constructed to have medium affinity (500–600 nM), ASNC*NMETM and the competitor peptides were designed to be high-affinity (8–10 nM) ligands. Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc solid-phase chemistry and purified by C<sub>18</sub> reversed-phase HPLC. The identity of peptides was verified either by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). In order to site-specifically label peptides with fluorophores, 10.5 µM peptide were incubated with 26 µM TAMRA-5-maleimide (single isomer, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TAMRA-6 C2 maleimide (Lumiprobe, Hannover, Germany) (used for labeling of FLPSDC*FPSF) overnight at 4°C. Labeled peptides were purified by C<sub>18</sub> reversed-phase HPLC, and their identity was confirmed by ESI-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Refolding and purification of MHC I allomorphs</title><p>H2-D<sup>b</sup> and HLA-A*02:01 were refolded from inclusion bodies by rapid dilution in the presence of purified β2m and peptide according to established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodenko et al., 2006</xref>).

One-step and two-step dissociation assays were carried out with 300 nM MHC I loaded with TAMRA-labeled peptide, 1 µM TAPBPR, and 300 µM competitor peptide.

Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 min and analyzed by analytical SEC on a Superdex 75 (3.2/300) column (GE Healthcare).

Two different crystal structures of TAPBPR-MHC class I complexes have been solved (Jiang et al., 2017; Thomas and Tampe, 2017). While the two structures show overall similarities in the interaction modes, the location of the scoop loop (approximately residues 22-25 of TAPBPR) in the F-pocket region of peptide-free MHC class I have been in debate (Natarajan et al., Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol., 2019). More recent studies support a model in which the scoop loop plays an important role in TAPBPR-mediated peptide dissociation from MHC class I (Ilca et al., 2018). Using purified human and mouse MHC class I molecules, and purified TAPBPR and its scoop loop mutant, the new study by Sagert et al. further analyzes the role of the scoop loop in TAPBPR function. Overall, this is a very well written manuscript that presents well-thought experiments and interesting results. The experiments are well-performed and controlled, and the results are generally clear-cut, under the tested conditions. Concerns with the manuscript relate to some of the experimental interpretations and conclusions leading to the model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2 nicely presents the formation of TAPBPR/H2-D<sup>b</sup> and how mutating the scoop loop can affect the relative amount of complex formed. While the experiment is highly informative, I am not persuaded that it accurately reports kinetic instability as the authors claim. Rather it is equally possible that it reports thermodynamic destabilisation. Given the reported interactions of the scoop loop with the MHC I peptide-binding groove, lack of the scoop loop or sequence substitution would be expected to weaken the interaction, something that could explain the observations in Figure 2. Can the authors more directly measure the affinity of TAPBPR for MHC I? Even if this is not easily achievable, I think the authors should reconsider their claims for kinetic instability, since deconvolution of kinetics vs. thermodynamics is probably impossible by this particular experiment.</p><p>2) Given the result presented in Figure 2, how do the authors explain the finding that scoop loop variants largely retain their ability to catalyse peptide dissociation (Figure 3)? Is it because the scoop loop interactions with MHC are secondary to the overall TAPBPR-MHC interactions? If the scoop loop variants have a reduced affinity for MHC, would an effect be more obvious if experiments in Figure 3 are repeated at lower concentrations?</p><p>3) Relative to a TAPBPR chimeric construct containing the shorter scoop loop of tapasin, the wild type TAPBPR is shown to form more stable (higher affinity complexes) with MHC I (Figure 2), although the peptide dissociation function of the wild type TAPBPR is less efficient than the chimera with the tapasin scoop loop (Figure 3). The stronger peptide dissociation effect of a TAPBPR with the tapasin scoop loop compared with TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> should be interpreted, explicitly discussed, and taken into account in the overall model of Figure 5.</p><p>4) Notably, mutations of other key TABBPR residues at the TAPBPR-MHC class I interface (TN3 and TN6) are shown in the representative figure to have more significant effects on peptide dissociation than a TAPBPR mutant in which the scoop loop was mutated to a 3xGly sequence, suggesting a dominant role for TN3 and TN6-mediated interactions in inducing peptide dissociation. The dominant role of TN3 and TN6-mediated interactions in inducing peptide dissociation should be acknowledged (including within the model), and their quantifications shown in the same way as Figure 3C and 3E.</p><p>5) In a variant of the peptide dissociation experiment, peptide dissociation was measured in the presence of the three TAPBPR variants, but in the absence of excess unlabeled peptide (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Under this set of conditions, wild type TAPBPR was more efficient at inducing peptide dissociation from H2-D<sup>b</sup> than the two scoop loop mutants, whereas wild type TAPBPR and the tapasin scoop loop mutant appear to have similar efficiencies towards peptide dissociation from HLA-A2. These data are used to argue for a model in which the scoop loop directly interferes with rebinding of a displaced peptide (internal competitor). However, concerns with these interpretations are:</p><p>a) Other models (such as different allosteric effects induced by the three scoop loop variants of TAPBPR) could explain the varying degrees of inhibition of rebinding of dissociated peptides by the TAPBPR variants, which are also predicted to have different affinities for MHC class I. Model validation will need data that can more clearly sort out the difference between an internal competitor model and alternative allosteric effects-based models. If the differences cannot be easily sorted out, at minimum, the model of Figure 5 should be changed to indicate that both the internal competitor model and allosteric model are likely to be relevant.</p><p>b) The effects of the three TAPBPR constructs on inhibition of peptide rebinding vary between HLA-A2 and H2-D<sup>b</sup> (comparing Figure 4 with Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The variable effects of tapasin scoop loop on D<sup>b</sup> vs. HLA-A2 should be expanded, interpreted, and explicitly discussed.</p><p>6) Does the experiment in Figure 4 report a reduced &quot;functional&quot; ability of the scoop loop mutants to remove the peptide from MHC or a reduced affinity of the TAPBPR variants for MHC? This difference is relevant to our understanding of the distinct functionality of the scoop loop (versus being a hinge that makes additional interactions with the MHC). Perhaps the authors could test this by titrating the less active TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> to higher concentrations to see if they can get similar results to the TAPBPR<sup>wt-SL</sup>.</p><p>7) The importance of the scoop loop has recently been demonstrated in the study by Ilca et al. (2018), but the latter paper is only referenced to highlight the differences in conclusions, rather than many other overall similarities in findings. The Ilca et al. paper should be referenced within the Introduction for better acknowledgement of prior contributions to the same questions, and similarities with the present study pointed out in addition to the differences-within the Discussion.</p><p>8) Finally, for readers and for the field, this section in the Introduction is very confusing &quot;Furthermore, one of the two TAPBPR-MHC I complex structures revealed a remarkable structural feature in TAPBPR named the scoop loop (Thomas and Tampe, 2017). […] The scoop loop occupies a position that is incompatible with high-affinity peptide binding and displaces or coordinates several key MHC I residues, including Y84, T143, K146, and W147, which are responsible for binding the C terminus of the peptide.&quot; The authors should rephrase to clarify what has been discovered regarding the scoop loop previously, what is in debate, and specify the open questions that this study will address.</p><p>9) As noted above, model validation will need data that can more clearly sort out the difference between an internal competitor model and alternative allosteric effects-based models. Additional higher resolution structural data, if possible to acquire within two months, may be helpful because the loop was modeled as inserting into the F-pocket in one of the structures (Thomas and Tampe, 2017) but not in the second (Jiang et al., 2017).</p><p>Overall, this is a well-executed study, but the data do not integrate well with the proposed model. In line with the above points, the data are more consistent with a relatively minor (and possibly MHC-context dependent) contribution of the scoop loop to peptide editing, rather than the current emphasis of a critical role. This message should be evident within the Abstract and throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55326.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2 nicely presents the formation of TAPBPR/H2-D<sup>b</sup> and how mutating the scoop loop can affect the relative amount of complex formed.

Directly determining the affinity of TAPBPR for peptide-deficient MHC I, as a measure of chaperone activity, is very difficult, as peptide-deficient MHCs are intrinsically unstable and will precipitate. We tried to determine K<sub>d</sub> values via microscale thermophoresis using MHC I loaded with a photo-cleavable peptide; however, neither T-jump nor thermophoresis delivered a useful signal upon complex formation. In addition, we also aimed to determine <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>for the complexes using fluorescently-labeled TAPBPRs, but the scoop loop mutants turned out to be unstable upon fluorophore attachment. This is why we resorted to SEC analysis using unlabeled proteins. We cannot exclude different equilibrium dissociation constants for the complexes. However, our re-injection experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1; SEC traces for the two TAPBPR scoop-loop mutants have now been added) clearly show that the three complexes have different kinetic stabilities. Furthermore, we have repeated the peptide displacement experiments at a much lower TAPBPR concentration (75 nM) (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and observed gradual activity differences between the three TAPBPR constructs that were similar to the previous measurements at 1 µM, suggesting that the TAPBPRs have affinities for (suboptimally-loaded, and most likely empty) MHC I that are at least in the same range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the result presented in Figure 2, how do the authors explain the finding that scoop loop variants largely retain their ability to catalyse peptide dissociation (Figure 3)? Is it because the scoop loop interactions with MHC are secondary to the overall TAPBPR-MHC interactions? If the scoop loop variants have a reduced affinity for MHC, would an effect be more obvious if experiments in Figure 3 are repeated at lower concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, we chose the high TAPBPR concentrations on purpose to test if the mutants are still active in catalyzing peptide displacement. We have now repeated the experiment at a much lower TAPBPR concentration (75 nM) (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and observed the same relative catalytic activities between the three TAPBPR constructs as before (at 1 µM), suggesting that the TAPBPRs have similar affinities for (suboptimally-loaded, and most likely empty) MHC I. Then, why are the different complex stabilities not reflected in the one-step peptide-displacement assay? We think there might be two reasons: First, the chaperone activity, i.e. the ability to stabilize peptide-free MHC I for a prolonged period of time, does not come into effect in our displacement assay, as the assay is carried out in the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of high-affinity competitor peptide. Secondly, the scoop loop does not appear to be of primary importance for the displacement step in peptide exchange. Other TAPBPR-mediated, scoop loop-independent changes might be more important for induced peptide dissociation (widening of MHC binding groove, salt bridge to Y84, distortion of groove floor, shift of β2m).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Relative to a TAPBPR chimeric construct containing the shorter scoop loop of tapasin, the wild type TAPBPR is shown to form more stable (higher affinity complexes) with MHC I (Figure 2), although the peptide dissociation function of the wild type TAPBPR is less efficient than the chimera with the tapasin scoop loop (Figure 3). The stronger peptide dissociation effect of a TAPBPR with the tapasin scoop loop compared with TAPBPR<sup>wt</sup> should be interpreted, explicitly discussed, and taken into account in the overall model of Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our answer to point 2, we do not think that the chaperone activity (Figure 2) can be directly correlated with the activity in our peptide-displacement assay (Figure 3). Currently, we do not have an explanation for the slightly higher activity of the TAPBPR<sup>Tsn-SL</sup> variant. However, our aim of the displacement measurements was to demonstrate that the two scoop-loop variants are still generally able to catalyze peptide dissociation. Notably, the conditions of the assay (high concentration of competitor peptide) resemble the physiological environment tapasin is operating in, i.e. the peptide-rich environment of the PLC. The tapasin scoop loop might thus be expected to operate optimally under these experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Notably, mutations of other key TABBPR residues at the TAPBPR-MHC class I interface (TN3 and TN6) are shown in the representative figure to have more significant effects on peptide dissociation than a TAPBPR mutant in which the scoop loop was mutated to a 3xGly sequence, suggesting a dominant role for TN3 and TN6-mediated interactions in inducing peptide dissociation. The dominant role of TN3 and TN6-mediated interactions in inducing peptide dissociation should be acknowledged (including within the model), and their quantifications shown in the same way as Figure 3C and 3E.</p></disp-quote><p>It is beyond debate that the Y84-coordinating glutamate in TAPBPR (mutated in the TN3 mutant) and residues mutated in TN6 are crucial for TAPBPR-catalyzed peptide displacement. Catalysis of peptide displacement by TAPBPR involves several induced changes in the MHC I, including a stabilized open conformation of the peptide binding groove, distortion of the groove floor, and displacement of β2m. These changes are mediated by parts of the TAPBPR molecule that are outside the scoop loop and comprise the greater part of the TAPBPR-MHC I interface. Especially, the TN6 mutations affect the core of the TAPBPR-MHC I interface and are therefore expected to drastically reduce displacement activity. We definitely do not claim that the scoop loop is more important for peptide displacement than the aforementioned aspects of catalysis. In the current manuscript we focus solely on the role of the scoop loop, and the main purpose of the experiments shown in Figure 3 was to demonstrate that our two scoop-loop variants are still able to catalyze peptide dissociation.</p><p>We have now included bar diagrams for the TN3 and TN6 measurements in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In a variant of the peptide dissociation experiment, peptide dissociation was measured in the presence of the three TAPBPR variants, but in the absence of excess unlabeled peptide (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

(Electron density for this covalently bound 5-mer peptide is also lacking, probably due to mobility). Higher-resolution crystallographic data might provide more detailed insights into the binding mode of the scoop loop, but the given time frame for revision (2 months) is definitely too short to obtain these data.
