schizophrenia relevant deficits have been observed in rodent models with loss of function mutations in either gene. Here we show that the Aph1b-γ-secretase is selectively involved in Nrg1 intracellular signalling. We found that Aph1b-deficient mice display a decrease in excitatory synaptic markers. Electrophysiological recordings show that Aph1b is required for excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Furthermore, gain and loss of function and genetic rescue experiments indicate that Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes dendritic spine formation downstream of Aph1b-γ-secretase in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the physiological role of Aph1b-γ-secretase in brain and provides a new mechanistic perspective on the relevance of NRG1 processing in schizophrenia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02196.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02196.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02196.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Schizophrenia affects around 1% of the world's population, with symptoms including hallucinations and delusions, apathy and cognitive impairments. Multiple genes and environmental factors interact to increase the risk of schizophrenia, making the causes of the disease—which can differ between individuals—difficult to disentangle. However, Schizophrenia is known to be associated with a reduction in the number of dendritic spines, the small protrusions that allow brain cells to receive inputs from other brain cells.</p><p>One gene that has repeatedly been implicated in schizophrenia is <italic>neuregulin 1</italic> (<italic>NRG1</italic>), which encodes a signalling protein with more than thirty different variants. One of these variants, type III NRG1, is located on the cell membrane. An enzyme called γ-secretase can cleave the 'tail' of this protein, which means that the tail becomes free to move to the nucleus of the cell, where it can alter the expression of genes.</p><p>Fazzari et al. have now studied how different γ-secretases interact with type III NRG1 by using genetic techniques to remove a specific part of the enzymes in the brains of mice. The brain cells of these mutant mice contained fewer dendritic spines than mice with normal γ-secretases. However, the number of dendritic spines in the mutant mice could be restored by introducing γ-secretase.</p><p>These results are consistent with a model in which mutations that remove the ability of γ-secretases to cleave NRG1 lead to some of the structural and functional changes in the brain that are associated with schizophrenia. An improved understanding of the properties of the various γ-secretases could also lead to the design of safer versions of drugs called γ-secretase modulators that are used to treat Alzheimer's disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02196.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02196.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Aph1b</kwd><kwd>Gamma-secretase</kwd><kwd>NRG1</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Alzheimerand's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Strooper</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FWO Foundation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzari</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name><name><surname>De Strooper</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SAO Alzheimer's Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzari</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name><name><surname>Snellinx</surname><given-names>An</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Flemish Goverment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mathusalem grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Strooper</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic rescue experiments reveal that γ-secretase enzymes containing Aph1b subunits control signalling by type III neuregulin 1, with implications for schizophrenia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe disorder that affects neuronal circuits involved in social behaviour and cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis and Sweet, 2009</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that different risk genes interact synergistically to contribute to SZ, mainly by affecting excitatory and/or inhibitory circuitries in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison and Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lisman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis and Sweet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glausier and Lewis, 2013</xref>). In particular, polymorphisms in Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) have been consistently linked to schizophrenia in different populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stefansson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mei and Xiong, 2008</xref>). The <italic>NRG1</italic> gene encodes more than 30 isoforms that differ in structure, expression pattern, processing and signalling modes which complicates the study of the NRG1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mei and Xiong, 2008</xref>). Most Ig-Nrg1 isoforms apparently function as diffusible paracrine signals. Conversely, the cysteine-rich domain-(CRD-) containing Nrg1 isoform (also known as Type III Nrg1) is membrane bound and, in addition to canonical forward signalling via ErbB4, can also signal backward via its intracellular domain (Nrg1-ICD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mei and Xiong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pedrique and Fazzari, 2010</xref>). Converging studies demonstrate that Nrg1/ErbB4 forward signalling controls the establishment of cortical inhibitory circuits and is implicated in the control of neuronal synchronisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Chen et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazzari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rico and Marin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cahill et al., 2012</xref>). However, the physiological role of CRD-Nrg1 intracellular signalling, and thus the function of the membrane bound and intracellular domain of Nrg1 remains unclear.</p><p>In analogy to Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Strooper et al., 1999</xref>), the intracellular part of Nrg1, Nrg1-ICD, is released by intramembrane processing. It is known that γ-secretase activity is responsible for this cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pedrique and Fazzari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marballi et al., 2012</xref>), but it remains unclear which specific γ-secretase is involved. γ-secretases are a family of intramembrane proteases composed of four different subunits: presenilin (PSEN), anterior pharynx homologue 1 (APH1), nicastrin (NCT), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Strooper, 2003</xref>). In the human genome two presenilin (<italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>) and two <italic>APH1</italic> (<italic>APH1A</italic> and <italic>APH1B</italic>) are present; thus, at least four different γ-secretase complexes can be generated. One of the major challenges in the γ-secretase field is to understand whether these different γ-secretase complexes have different biological or pathological functions. This question is particularly relevant for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of SZ since indirect evidence indicates that NRG1 intracellular signalling might be involved in the risk for this disease. In this regard, a Val-to-Leu mutation in the NRG1 transmembrane domain increases the risk for development of SZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</xref>), impairs intramembrane γ-secretase cleavage of Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>) and abnormal NRG1 processing was found in schizophrenic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mei and Xiong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marballi et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, putative loss of function variants of APH1B, a crucial component of the γ-secretase complex, were found to aggregate with <italic>NRG1</italic> risk alleles in schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hatzimanolis et al., 2013</xref>) and Aph1b-loss of function mutations in rodents display behavioural phenotypes that are relevant for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coolen et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Rodents have duplicated the <italic>Aph1b</italic> gene during evolution into highly homologous <italic>Aph1b</italic> and <italic>Aph1C</italic>. In order to model human APH1B loss of function, we previously generated double mutant mice for Aph1b and Aph1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Serneels et al., 2005</xref>), hereafter referred to as <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> or <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> upon Cre-dependent deletion. We also conditionally targeted the <italic>Aph1a</italic> locus, referred to as <italic>Aph1a</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup>. We have found that Aph1a-γ-secretase complexes are necessary to activate Notch signalling and genetic deletion of Aph1a leads to a Notch related embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Serneels et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, deletion of the Aph1bc-γ-secretase complex does not affect Notch signalling but hampers Nrg1 processing and alters sensory motor gating, working memory and sensitivity to psychotropic drugs, thereby mimicking Nrg1 deficiency and various phenotypes related to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coolen et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>). However, the selective role of Aph1bc-γ-secretase complexes and the Aph1bc-γ-secretase-dependent processing of Nrg1 in brain wiring and function remained unstudied.</p><p>In the current study, we address the question of whether the Aph1bc subunit provides specificity to Nrg1 processing and whether this subunit would indeed be involved in the postulated intracellular signalling of Nrg1. We show here that the Aph1bc-γ-secretase complex controls excitatory circuitry via Nrg1 intracellular signalling. Mice mutant for <italic>Aph1bc</italic> display altered expression of excitatory synaptic markers, impaired synaptic transmission and decreased long term potentiation. Furthermore, single cell deletion of <italic>Aph1bc</italic> in vivo impaired dendritic spine formation which could be rescued by the expression of the Nrg1-ICD. Taken together, these data indicate that Nrg1 intracellular signalling downstream of Aph1bc-γ-secretase complexes promotes in a cell autonomous fashion the formation of excitatory connections in cortical neurons. Hence, our study provides a cellular and molecular mechanistic explanation for the cognitive deficits observed in Aph1bc-γ-secretase deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>). More importantly, it provides unique insight into the importance of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in the establishment of functional synapses and the potential aetiological role of misprocessing of NRG1 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aph1bc loss of function alters the expression of synaptic markers</title><p>We reasoned that the behavioural deficits observed in <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>) could be due to abnormal development of the brain.

As it was previously reported that deletion of Presenilins in hippocampal pyramidal neurons impairs synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), we decided to analyse the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus, in <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. The Input-Output (I/O) curves, that show the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in response to stimuli of increasing strength, indicate that baseline synaptic transmission is impaired in <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> heterozygous and <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> homozygous mutant mice as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Next, we studied the relevance of Aph1bc in long-term synaptic plasticity. Induction of long term potentiation (LTP) by three trains of theta burst stimulation is impaired in both heterozygous and homozygous Aph1bc deficient mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Even though reduced basal transmission might in principle interfere with LTP analysis, these results suggest that synaptic plasticity is affected by Aph1bc deletion. Furthermore, we recorded miniature excitatory currents (mEPSCs) which showed normal amplitude but slightly increased inter-event intervals (IEIs) in <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> as compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Since PPF analysis indicates that Aph1bc deletion does not alter release probability, the increased IEIs in mEPSCs suggest a decrease in the number of release sites that is consistent with the decreased expression of excitatory synaptic markers assessed by immunofluorescence.

Therefore, the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Nrg1 is necessary for Nrg1 rescue of spine formation. Besides, even though Aph1a-γ-secretase might redundantly contribute to Nrg1 processing, collectively our data indicate that Aph1bc-γ-secretase is the major regulator of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in this biological process. Finally, single cell Aph1bc deletion in vivo by in utero electroporation impaired spine formation and could be rescued by Nrg1-ICD expression, emphasizing the physiological relevance of our observations.</p><p>Our study indicates that the Aph1bc-γ-secretase complex controls the establishment of excitatory circuits under physiological conditions at least in part through the regulation of Nrg1 intracellular signalling. It should be kept in mind that both γ-secretase complexes and Nrg1 isoforms impinge on multiple signalling molecules that control many facets of neuronal development and function. As several putative γ-secretase substrates have been identified it is still possible that some of them may also contribute to the behavioural deficits of <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, we have previously shown that deletion of Aph1bc does not affect the processing of other major γ-secretase substrates such as Notch and ErbB4 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Serneels et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, mutations of other γ-secretase substrates such as APP or N-Cadherin have not been previously shown to cause schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits in mice or to be associated with schizophrenia. Hence, the biochemical and cell biological evidences from the current work, and the available genetic evidence are consistent with the conclusion that Nrg1 is the major physiological target of Aph1bc-γ-secretase in vivo in the context of synapse formation. The pathological relevance of human <italic>APH1B</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> genetic interaction and of NRG1 processing is further supported by recent studies in Schizophrenic patients linking polymorphisms in these genes to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marballi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hatzimanolis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Nrg1 forward signalling controls the establishment of inhibitory circuits in the cortex by activating its specific receptor ErbB4, which is primarily expressed in cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazzari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, the physiological role of CRD-Nrg1 intracellular signalling via the Nrg1 intracellular domain could not be addressed unambiguously in vivo in available mutant mice since deletion of CRD or TM domain of Nrg1 protein would affect both forward and intracellular signalling.</p><p>Previous in vitro studies proposed that γ-secretase dependent Nrg1 signalling may control the expression of genes that control neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>) and dendritic growth during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>).

Consistent with these findings, schizophrenia-like deficits and impaired maturation of glutamatergic synapses have also been described for mice deficient in Nrg1, ErbB4 and BACE1, a protease that initiates Nrg1 processing by cleaving its extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Pino et al., 2013</xref>). Although these deficits were attributed to loss of ErbB4 activation in pyramidal neurons, this interpretation was challenged by the recent discovery that ErbB4 is almost exclusively expressed by cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazzari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, it was proposed that altered glutamatergic wiring could be the result of a homeostatic response to alterations in ErbB4 expressing fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Del Pino et al., 2013</xref>). Here we propose a complementary, but not mutually exclusive, mechanistic model whereby dendritic spine maturation could directly, in a cell-autonomous manner, be promoted by Aph1bc-dependent Nrg1 intracellular signalling. Notably, it has been suggested that Nrg1 could be involved in activity-dependent regulation of the structural plasticity of glutamatergic circuits since neuronal activity enhances both Nrg1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eilam et al., 1998</xref>) and proteolytic processing by γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ozaki et al., 2004</xref>). Consistently, we show here that Aph1bc-γ-secretase-dependent Nrg1 intracellular signalling promotes spine formation.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide a cellular and molecular mechanism for the cognitive deficits observed in Aph1bc-γ-secretase-deficient mice. Moreover, our study suggests that schizophrenia linked cSNPs in TM domain of NRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Walss-Bass et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mei and Xiong, 2008</xref>) and mutations in <italic>APH1B</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hatzimanolis et al., 2013</xref>) may contribute to the alteration of dendritic spines density observed in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis and Sweet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glausier and Lewis, 2013</xref>), linking APH1B and NRG1 misprocessing firmly to this disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of mice</title><p><italic>Aph1a</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> and <italic>Aph1bc</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Serneels et al., 2005</xref>).

Briefly, 6–8 weeks old mice, were killed by cervical dislocation and the hippocampus was rapidly dissected into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, pH 7.4, saturated with carbogen, 95% O2/5% CO2). Transverse slices (400 μm thick) were prepared from the dorsal area and placed into a submerged-type slice chamber, where they were maintained at 33°C and continuously perfused with carbogen-saturated ACSF. After 90 min incubation, tungsten stimulating electrodes and glass recording electrodes were placed into the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area-CA1 to evoke field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP). To assess basic properties of synaptic responses, I/O curves were established by stimulation with 30–90 µA constant currents (pulse width 0.1 ms). The stimulation strength was adjusted to evoke a fEPSP-slope of 35% of the maximum and kept constant throughout the experiment. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) was examined by applying two pulses in rapid succession (interpulse intervals of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 ms, respectively) at 120 s intervals. 60 min thereafter, baseline recordings were started consisting of three single stimuli with 0.1 ms pulse width repeated at a 10-s interval and averaged every 5 min. LTP was induced by three TBS episodes separated by 10 min, with evoked responses monitored at 1, 4 and 7 min between TBS episodes. 10 min after the last TBS episode, evoked responses were recorded every 5 min during 4 hr. In all experiments, the recording of slices from mutant mice was interleaved by experiments with wild type controls.</p><p>Patch-clamp recordings of mEPSCs were performed in acute hippocampal slices obtained from control and <italic>Aph1bc</italic> mutant siblings.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work elegantly and systematically describes the effect of abrogation of the gamma secretase component Aph1B in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and dendritic spine formation, and provides convincing data pointing towards the neuregulin 1 intracellular domain as a downstream regulator of these events. The authors show beautiful representative dendritic spine figures and statistical analyses appear to be well performed. Work was done both with constitutive Aph1BC knock-out mice, as well as in vitro using conditional single cell deletion. A very novel and interesting part of the work was the in utero electroporation to obtain single cell conditional deletion of Aph1BC, and thereby investigate the effects of abrogation under physiological conditions in a wild-type background. This manuscript also mainly uses mouse genetic approaches and many types of rescue experiments, and thus the data are largely convincing. Lastly, given the increasing demand for molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, these findings may help us better understand the etiology of schizophrenia.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) This manuscript needs to provide electrophysiological data that would strongly support their structural data on dendritic spines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3, 4, and 5</xref>. The authors do not have to try electrophysiological measurements for all the structural data, but at least some of the key results should be accompanied with functional data. For instance, they can measure mEPSCs from cultured hippocampal neurons or brain slices. Measuring mEPSCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> would also help.</p><p>2) The current manuscript is mainly focusing on excitatory synapses situated in dendritic spines, but lacks data for inhibitory synapses. The authors need to visualize inhibitory synaptic markers such as VGAT and gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), and measure mIPSCs for some of the results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3, 4, and 5</xref>.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The Sholl analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> seems to analyze only the proximal regions of the dendrites (∼50 microns). But the dendrites of the CA1 neurons, especially the apical dendrites, are much longer, extending several hundred microns. The coverage should be increased. In addition, the SLM layer of CA1 is not indicated in the figure.</p><p>2) Given the majority of the experiments were performed in the hippocampus, the title of the manuscript containing “…cortical excitatory circuitry…” should be toned down.</p><p>3) In the Abstract, the authors state that “…Aph1B, but not Aph1A, is selectively involved in NRG1 intracellular signaling”, but the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> implicate Aph1A in the processing of NRG1. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) All three panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> lack sample current traces.</p><p>5) The reduced LTP in Aph1BC-/- neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) could be caused by the reduced basal transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This possibility should be mentioned.</p><p>6) In the Discussion, the authors appear to challenge previous work showing that impairment of neuregulin 1 intracellular formation leads to impaired dendritic arborisation (Chen et al., 2010), given that they failed to observe differences in dendritic length in the current study. However, the difference in results may be due to long-term effects of impaired NRG1 intracellular signaling, which is not suffered in the conditional deletion studies. This possibility should be acknowledged.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02196.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) This manuscript needs to provide electrophysiological data that would strongly support their structural data on dendritic spines in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 3, 4, and 5</italic></xref><italic>.

We observed an increase in mEPSCs inter-event intervals in Aph1BC KO mice as compared to Control mice while mEPSCs amplitude was not affected by Aph1BC deletion. These results indicate a decrease in the number of glutamate release sites that is consistent with the reduction in VGluT1 and Homer1 immunoreactivity and with the reduced spine density that we observed. In addition, we also performed recordings of mEPSCs in neuronal cultures to further corroborate the cell autonomous role of Aph1BC-gamma-secretase/Nrg1 intracellular signalling in excitatory transmission. We found that inter-event intervals and amplitude of mEPSCs are impaired by Aph1BC deletion and rescued, although not completely, by expression of Nrg1-ICD in Aph1BC deficient neurons. The experimental approach of mEPSCs recording does not allow discriminating between perisomatic, shaft, and dendritic excitatory connections, and we feel it would be too far-fetched to speculate on the reasons for this incomplete rescue. Nevertheless, these results are in line with the morphological assessment and further support the role for Aph1BC-gamma-secretase/Nrg1 intracellular signalling in excitatory synaptic function.</p><p>These novel data are added to the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The current manuscript is mainly focusing on excitatory synapses situated in dendritic spines, but lacks data for inhibitory synapses. The authors need to visualize inhibitory synaptic markers such as VGAT and gephyrin (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1f</italic></xref><italic>), and measure mIPSCs for some of the results described in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 3, 4, and 5</italic></xref>.</p><p>Gamma-secretase complexes cleave their target subsequently to alfa- or beta-secretase cleavages of the ectodomain. As the ectodomain is in principle already shed we do not anticipate that forward signalling of their target proteins will be affected by downstream gamma-secretase cleavage. Consistent with this model, our previous study suggested that gamma-secretase processing does not impact on Nrg1 forward signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dejaegere et al., 2008</xref>). This observation predicts that inhibitory synapses should not be altered in gamma-secretase mutant mice since inhibitory synapses are regulated by ErbB4 activation.</p><p>In order to test this experimentally as suggested by the reviewers, we visualized inhibitory boutons with the markers VGAT, which labels pre-synaptically all inhibitory synapses, and with PV, since PV+ interneurons are the subpopulation in interneurons where ErbB4 is primarily expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazzari et al., 2010</xref>; Wen L et al., 2010). The intensities of VGAT and PV immunoreactive puncta did not reveal any difference between control and Aph1BC mutant mice. These data are added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1–figure supplement 1</xref>. Considering this observation and the facts that Nrg1 is exclusively expressed by pyramidal neurons and that our study is focused on the role of Aph1BC-gamma-secretase/Nrg1 intracellular signalling in excitatory synapses, we consider that the measurement of mIPSCs would be redundant and out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The Sholl analysis shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5b</italic></xref> <italic>seems to analyze only the proximal regions of the dendrites (∼50 microns). But the dendrites of the CA1 neurons, especially the apical dendrites, are much longer, extending several hundred microns. The coverage should be increased. In addition, the SLM layer of CA1 is not indicated in the figure</italic>.</p><p>Pyramidal neuron in the hippocampus display two kind of dendritic arborisations: the basal dendrites extend themselves in the stratum oriens and display a short and thick arborisation; conversely, the apical dendrites extend themselves in the stratum radiatum with a much longer and less dense arborisation pattern. According to reviewer’s indication, quantification was extended to a longer range and for sake of clarity and completeness analysis of basal and apical dendrites are presented separately. We add this novel figure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>. SLM is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Given the majority of the experiments were performed in the hippocampus, the title of the manuscript containing “…cortical excitatory circuitry…” should be toned down</italic>.</p><p>We changed the title to “hippocampal excitatory circuitry”.</p><p><italic>3) In the Abstract, the authors state that “…Aph1B, but not Aph1A, is selectively involved in NRG1 intracellular signaling”, but the results in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>implicate Aph1A in the processing of NRG1. This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The Abstract was modified and “but not Aph1A” was deleted. A comment to clarify our view on the selective role of Aph1A- vs Aph1BC-gamma-secretase complexes was also added in the discussion. We wrote in the Discussion: “Besides, even though Aph1A-γ-secretase might redundantly contribute to Nrg1 processing, collectively our data indicate that Aph1BC-γ-secretase is the major regulator of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in this biological process.”</p><p><italic>4) All three panels in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>lack sample current traces</italic>.</p><p>Sample current traces were added as requested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The reduced LTP in Aph1BC-/- neurons (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2c</italic></xref><italic>) could be caused by the reduced basal transmission (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2a</italic></xref><italic>). This possibility should be mentioned</italic>.</p><p>In the protocol that we used, the I/O curve is measured first. LTP is subsequently induced by a stimulation of 35% of the maximum (i.e. saturating) stimulation. This procedure thus allows accounting for the variability between slices and genotypes in the measurement of long term plasticity. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that LTP deficiency might be secondary to a deficit in baseline transmission. Nevertheless the referee is right that this experimental paradigm may be in principle biased by reduced basal transmission and this possibility is now mentioned: “Even though reduced basal transmission might in principle interfere with LTP analysis, these results suggest nevertheless that synaptic plasticity is affected by Aph1BC deletion.”</p><p><italic>6) In the Discussion, the authors appear to challenge previous work showing that impairment of neuregulin 1 intracellular formation leads to impaired dendritic arborisation (Chen et al., 2010), given that they failed to observe differences in dendritic length in the current study. However, the difference in results may be due to long-term effects of impaired NRG1 intracellular signaling, which is not suffered in the conditional deletion studies. This possibility should be acknowledged</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment that prompts us to better express and clarify this point. The effect of Nrg1 loss of function on dendritic arborisation was previously studied in two interesting papers from the group of Talmage and Role (quoted references 8 and 32). We do not believe that our study challenges the work by Chen et al, 2010 but indeed is consistent with the observation of Talmage and Role that Nrg1 heterozygous mice do not display abnormalities in dendritic arborisation in vivo. The diverse timeline of abrogation of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in constitutive vs conditional studies is a reasonable explanation for this apparent discrepancy and we acknowledge this now in the Discussion: “We speculate that these differences may be explained by differential effects of long term abrogation of Nrg1 intracellular signalling in Nrg1 constitutive null mice which is not the case in <italic>Aph1BC</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> conditional mice.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
