Although many studies have investigated the development of the arterial valves, it has been assumed that, as with the atrioventricular valves, endocardial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is the predominant mechanism. We show that arterial is distinctly different from atrioventricular valve formation. Whilst the four septal valve leaflets are dominated by NCC and EndMT-derived cells, the intercalated leaflets differentiate directly from <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+/Isl1+ progenitors in the outflow wall, via a Notch-Jag dependent mechanism. Further, when this novel group of progenitors are disrupted, development of the intercalated leaflets is disrupted, resulting in leaflet dysplasia and bicuspid valves without raphe, most commonly affecting the aortic valve. This study thus overturns the dogma that heart valves are formed principally by EndMT, identifies a new source of valve interstitial cells, and provides a novel mechanism for causation of bicuspid aortic valves without raphe.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arterial valve</kwd><kwd>second heart field</kwd><kwd>progenitor</kwd><kwd>bicuspid aortic valve</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/12/15/29935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eley</surname><given-names>Lorriane</given-names></name><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Rachel V</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Lindsay</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhry</surname><given-names>Bill</given-names></name><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Deborah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/15/46/31589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eley</surname><given-names>Lorriane</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhry</surname><given-names>Bill</given-names></name><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Deborah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades of Spain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CB16/11/00399 (Ciber Cardiovascular)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGrogan</surname><given-names>Donal</given-names></name><name><surname>Salguero-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>de La Pompa</surname><given-names>José Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades of Spain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2016-78370-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGrogan</surname><given-names>Donal</given-names></name><name><surname>Salguero-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>de La Pompa</surname><given-names>José Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades of Spain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD16/0011/0021 (Red de Terapia Celular, TERCEL)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGrogan</surname><given-names>Donal</given-names></name><name><surname>Salguero-Jimenez</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>de La Pompa</surname><given-names>José Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of a novel source of progenitor cells that form arterial valve leaflets and that, when disrupted, can lead to bicuspid arterial valve, the most common human cardiac malformation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the commonest congenital cardiac malformation in man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman and Kaplan, 2002</xref>). Together with stenosis of the aortic and pulmonary valves, BAV commonly accompanies other congenital cardiovascular malformations, for example, ventricular septal defects, double outlet right ventricle, hypoplastic left heart syndrome and aortic coarctation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siu and Silversides, 2010</xref>). BAV is also associated with late onset aortopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tadros et al., 2009</xref>). These associations may reflect common developmental origins and/or abnormal haemodynamic forces, but little is known specifically about arterial (semilunar) valve development and mechanisms have been extrapolated from tricuspid and mitral (atrioventricular) valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vlaming et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the pathogenesis of stenotic, dysplastic or bicuspid arterial valves remains obscure, although fusion of adjacent leaflets in fetal life, resulting in the presence of a raphe, is presumed to cause many cases of BAV.</p><p>Over the past 20 years we have developed a good understanding of how the outflow tract develops. Cells derived from the second heart field (SHF) make the major contribution to the outflow tract walls, forming myocardium in the proximal ventricular part, smooth muscle cells in the distal arterial walls, and also the inner endocardial lining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). In the early unseptated outflow tract, peristaltic contraction propels blood forward and retrograde flow is prevented by occlusion of the heart tube lumen by voluminous cardiac jelly interposed between endothelium and contracting myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nomura-Kitabayashi et al., 2009</xref>). As the outflow tract lengthens, the cardiac jelly becomes localised to discrete areas, endocardial cushions, which are the anlagen of the mature valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vlaming et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>). These initially acellular endocardial cushions become populated with mesenchymal cells that give rise to the valve interstitial cells. A major source of cells in both atrioventricular and arterial valves is epithelial or endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT or EndMT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markwald et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markwald et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vlaming et al., 2012</xref>]). In addition, the main outflow tract cushions, that fuse to separate aortic and pulmonary blood flow and also give rise to the arterial valve leaflets, receive a major contribution of neural crest cells (NCC) that have migrated through the pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirby et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waldo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast few NCC are seen in the atrioventricular valves. Smaller swellings located between the main superior and inferior outflow tract cushions, commonly called intercalated cushions (IC), give rise to the remaining two leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramer, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sizarov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously shown that NCC are essential for positioning the main outflow tract endocardial cushions and patterning the arterial valve leaflets, but make only a minor contribution to these IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, we have also shown that the arterial roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that connect the ventricles with the great arteries and house the arterial valves, have a complex origin from both SHF-derived cells and NCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>). However, the contribution of each lineage to the different valve leaflet primordia, and how these relationships affect normal and abnormal leaflet patterning including BAV, remains obscure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34110.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IC have a different morphology to the main outflow cushions during development.</title><p>All sections, except P,Q are taken in a frontal orientation.

We therefore analysed their development from mouse embryonic day (E)9.5 and human Carnegie stage (CS)14. At E9.5, the outflow of the heart consists of a simple tube with an outer myocardial wall, an inner layer of endocardium and an intervening acellular space filled with cardiac jelly. There was no evidence of discrete main or intercalated cushions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By E10.5 the IC were first seen as anterior and posterior thickenings of the outflow tract outer wall, bulging into localised expansions of cardiac jelly heralding the main outflow tract cushions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The IC were obvious at E11.5 as compact swellings within the distal outflow tract wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) whilst rotation of the outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajolle et al., 2006</xref>) placed the aortic IC to the right and the pulmonary IC to the left. By E12.5, all six primordia of the forming aortic and pulmonary valve leaflets appeared morphologically similar, although packing of cells in the forming IC appeared more dense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). At E13.5 and E15.5 the leaflets were indistinguishable from each other using standard histological staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). These observations were confirmed in human embryos at equivalent developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–L</xref>).</p><p>Although of similar appearance, the pulmonary IC became evident earlier in development and was more discrete than the aortic IC at E10.5-E11.5. Moreover, the two IC were positioned at different levels within the outflow reflecting the orientations of the adult valve structures. Thus, the pulmonary IC sits more distally by E11.5 and is surrounded laterally by a cuff of outflow tract myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,P,R</xref>), whereas the larger aortic IC only has proximal contact with myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N,Q,R</xref>). Importantly, both IC have distal continuity with undifferentiated (non-myocardial) outflow tract wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O,Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IC undergo late differentiation to become valve primordia</title><p>These initial observations suggested that the origins of the IC are developmentally distinct from the main outflow cushions. To evaluate the tissue characteristics of these primordia we examined the expression of chondroitin sulphate, a component of both the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cardiac jelly and valve primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markwald et al., 1978</xref>), using CS56 antibody. We also investigated expression of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a myocardial specific protein, to elucidate the relationships of the IC with the myocardial wall. At E10.5 cardiac jelly, labelled by CS56 antibody, was found in a circumferential layer between the myocardium and endocardium, with laterally located accumulations of cells that prefigured the main cushions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although the IC within the wall were not labelled by CS56, a thin layer of CS56-expressing cardiac jelly overlaid their luminal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>). The outflow tract wall labelled with cTnI antibody, but despite continuity with this wall, the IC did not express cTnI. At E11.5, the main outflow tract cushions contained many cells and continued to strongly label with CS56 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, although the IC had expanded, they remained devoid of labelling for cTnI or for CS56, except for the thin layer of adluminal cardiac jelly (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When examined at E12.5, the main cushions and the IC labelled with the CS56 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F,I</xref>). To further understand the differentiation of these IC we examined them for the expression of proteins relevant to endocardial cushion differentiation. Versican is a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan that is expressed early and plays essential roles in cushion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson and Copp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mjaatvedt et al., 1998</xref>). At E10.5, Versican was only detected in the cardiac jelly of the main septal cushions and the thin layer of cardiac jelly overlying the IC. However, at E11.5, prior to expression of CS56, and also at E12.5, Versican was expressed within the bulk of the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–O</xref>). At E10.5 Sox9, a transcription factor necessary for the formation of endocardial cushions and maintained in mature valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>), was abundantly expressed in the circumferential layer of cardiac jelly where the main cushions form, but only in the area immediately adjacent to the endothelium overlying the IC that was labelled by CS56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P,S</xref> – compare to 2 D,G); there was no Sox9 in the main part of the IC at this stage. At E11.5 Sox9 was also expressed throughout the IC and this was maintained at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q,R,T,U</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that at early stages the IC are overlaid by a layer of cardiac jelly but are not endocardial cushions in the classical sense. However, as they mature they express markers of valve interstitial cells. In view of this we henceforth refer to them in this manuscript as intercalated valve swellings (ICVS) as in Kramer’s original description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kramer, 1942</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34110.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>IC are molecularly distinct from the main outflow cushions.</title><p>In each case, arrows mark the IC. * mark the main outflow cushions.

However, all the remaining primordia were statistically different (p&lt;0.0002). Thus, these data showed that there were marked variations in the NCC and EDC contributing to each leaflet and confirmed that there were insufficient <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>+ and <italic>Tek-Cre</italic>+ lineage traced cells to account for all the cells present in these valve primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore looked for alternative sources to explain the origins of the remaining cells in the developing arterial valve leaflets. As the parietal valves of the atrioventricular valves are known to contain epicardially-derived cells (EPDC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gittenberger-de Groot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wessels et al., 2012</xref>]). We asked whether EPDC could contribute to the ICVS or other outflow cushions. To test this, we performed tamoxifen induction in <italic>Wt1-Cre-ERT2</italic> mice starting at E9.5. Analysis at E12.5 showed that although the epicardium itself was strongly labelled, there was no contribution of EPDC into the forming arterial valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>The dorsal pericardial wall and the pharyngeal mesoderm are composed of SHF cells that directly generate the outflow tract myocardium, much of the smooth muscle and fibrous tissue in the proximal and distal outflow vessel walls, and also the endocardium that lines these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waldo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harmon and Nakano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verzi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardson et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the SHF through endothelial EndMT, indirectly populates the outflow tract cushions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verzi et al., 2005</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We wondered whether SHF progenitors might contribute to the ICVS, over and above those provided by EndMT. By lineage tracing using <italic>Mef2c-AHF-Cre</italic>, it was possible to identify all SHF-derived cells adding into the valve anlagen, either directly or through EndMT. Analysis at E11.5 and E12.5 revealed that cells derived from the <italic>Mef2c-AHF-Cre+</italic> SHF make a major and highly reproducible contribution to all of the arterial valve leaflet primordia, including the ICVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>). Chi squared analysis following quantification of the <italic>Mef2c-AHF-Cre+</italic> lineage cells in the E12.5 leaflet primordia showed that the proportion of these cells were significantly different between the different arterial valve primordia, X<sup>2</sup> (df5, N = 7435)=748.2, p&lt;0.0001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Moreover, whilst the right pulmonary primordium was statistically different from the remaining primordia (p&lt;0.02); the aortic left, aortic right and pulmonary left were not significantly different. Importantly, our analysis demonstrated that the numbers and distribution of <italic>Mef2c-AHF-Cre+</italic> lineage cells in the ICVS and in both the main cushions were complementary to the <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>+ lineage (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> with 3E) and were sufficient to explain the presence of all cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Origin of ICVS directly from SHF progenitors in the outflow wall</title><p>A possible source of the SHF-derived cells within the ICVS was trans-differentiation of outflow tract myocardium. To explore this, we carried out lineage tracing using the cardiomyocyte-specific Troponin T-Cre (cTnT; <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>) line. Analyses of the ICVS, both during formation at E11.5 and when they resemble the main cushions at E12.5, showed that the ICVS and the adjacent outflow tract wall was indeed composed of cells demonstrating <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–M</xref>). In addition to this major contribution of <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage cells to the ICVS at these stages, a few labelled cells were also found in the right and left leaflets derived from the main septal cushions, located within the outer parts of the leaflets, close to the myocardial wall. Examination of <italic>Tnnt2-Cre;eYFP</italic> embryos at later stages of development showed that the <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage cells were found in all three arterial valves throughout gestation and postnatally, although the majority were found in the anterior/posterior leaflets; these data indicate that <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage cells make a permanent contribution to the valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). However, as shown earlier, the E11.5 ICVS did not contain differentiated cardiomyocytes, thus did not express cTnT, cTnI, nor αSMA, a smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O,P</xref>). As the <italic>Cre</italic> lineage tracing indicated cells that not only currently expressed cTnT, but also those that were descended from cells that previously expressed cTnT, we used antibodies directed against cTnT/cTnI together with <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> lineage tracing at earlier stages of development, to establish whether cells in the ICVS ever expressed these markers. Despite their <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage labelling, the ICVS did not label with antibodies to cTnT nor cTnI at any stage of development. At E9.75, before the ICVS could be seen in the distal outflow, a region of <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+;cTnT- labelling was seen, likely indicating where the ICVS would develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q–S</xref>). Similarly, At E10.5 the most distal outflow wall was <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>-expressing, but did not label with cTnT antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T–V</xref>). Thus, our data argue against trans-differentiation of ICVS cells from cardiomyocytes. To clarify the timing of Cre expression driven by the <italic>Tnnt2</italic> promoter activity in the ICVS, we used an anti-Cre antibody. By examining embryos at E10.5-E12.5 we showed that at E10.5 Cre protein was found in the forming ICVS and in the myocardial wall. However, by E11.5, and continuing at E12.5, Cre protein was absent from the ICVS, although still maintained in the myocardial walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> activation in the forming ICVS occurred prior to full differentiation to cardiomyocytes and taking into account perdurance of Cre protein, is likely to occur before E10.5.

As they remain in continuity with the dorsal pericardial wall, we wondered if they might also have retained an undifferentiated state. Islet 1 (Isl1) is a specific marker of multipotent SHF progenitors that are yet to differentiate into a broad range of cell types including cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2003</xref>). At E11.5 the ICVS were clearly delineated within the distal outflow wall by Isl1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3W,Y</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>); co-localisation studies showed that some of the cells also expressed Sox9 and thus were directly differentiating into valve interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3W–Y</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). By E12.5, Isl1 expression had essentially disappeared from the outflow tract, although persisting low level Isl1 expression was noted in a few cells in the ICVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, the cells within the ICVS, although of <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage, are formed from <italic>Mef2c-AHF-Cre</italic>-expressing SHF progenitor cells that maintain expression of Isl1 for longer than the surrounding cells, suggesting they differentiate later. Co-expression of reducing Isl1 protein levels but increasing Sox9 protein levels, in the setting of absence of protein for differentiated cardiomyocyte markers, supports direct derivation of valve precursors from SHF, rather than trans-differentiation from myocardial wall.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ICVS derive from SHF epithelium, but not through EMT</title><p>We have previously shown how SHF progenitor cells from the dorsal pericardial wall add to the elongating outflow tract at E9.0-E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsbottom et al., 2014</xref>) and form the myocardium of the outflow tract. As they do so they initially up-regulate E-cadherin and show marked cellular polarisation. As addition continues, they lose their epithelial phenotype, down-regulate Isl1, and then express markers of differentiated cardiomyocytes in the segment of outflow tract we termed the transition zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsbottom et al., 2014</xref>). E-cadherin was expressed throughout the distal outflow wall including the forming ICVS at E10.5, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) but was not expressed in the main cushions. By E11.5 levels of E-cadherin expression were reduced in the ICVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>) and by E12.5, E-cadherin was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). This was paralleled by β-catenin expression, which also labels epithelial cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), but was entirely different from N-cadherin and fibroblast specific protein 1 (Fsp1) immuno labelling, both of which are markers of mesenchymal cells. Specifically, neither N-cadherin nor Fsp1 were expressed in the ICVS at any stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>), indicating that the ICVS do not contain typical mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, collagen I and elastin, both ECM proteins normally seen surrounding SMC in the tunica media of blood vessels and also found in mature valve leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinton and Yutzey, 2011</xref>), were transiently expressed only in the forming ICVS but not in the surrounding walls or main cushions at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M–O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that at E11.5 and E12.5, the ICVS cells express different markers to the cells that make up the right and left leaflets and the adjacent myocardial wall. In contrast, laminin, an ECM protein highly expressed in the basement membrane of epithelia, was highly expressed in the ICVS at E10.5 but was down-regulated by E11.5-E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P–R</xref>).

It is involved, together with its ligand Dll4, in EndMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luna-Zurita et al., 2010</xref>), but also acts later during valve remodelling with an alternative ligand, Jag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacGrogan et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutations have been implicated in BAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garg et al., 2005</xref>). To identify the molecular mechanism underpinning formation of the ICVS we first asked whether there is Notch1 signalling activity in the ICVS. Immunolabelling confirmed that the active Notch1 receptor (Notch1 intracellular domain or N1ICD) was present in the non-myocardial walls of the aortic sac, the distal outflow and the endocardium. It was specifically expressed in cells within the ICVS at E10.5 although by E11.5 only a few cells in the cardiac jelly overlying the core of the ICVS continued to express nuclear N1ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E,I</xref>), indicating a temporal window of Notch1 signalling activity. Immuno staining for Notch2 (using an antibody that recognised the uncleaved form of the protein) was also expressed in the membranes of cells within the ICVS but not in the main cushions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,F,J</xref>). Dll4 was found in the endocardium with N1ICD, but not in the ICVS at either E10.5 or E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also evaluated the expression of both Jag1 and Jag2 ligands in this region of the heart. Jag1 protein was specifically detected within the distal outflow wall and in the core of the ICVS at both E10.5 and E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,G,K</xref>). In contrast, Jag2 was detected only in the inner adluminal region of the ICVS, close to the Notch1ICD-expressing endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,H,L</xref>). On closer examination Notch 2, Jag1 and Jag2 were found at the membrane of ICVS cells that expressed Isl1 at E10.5 and E11.5 whereas N1ICD was mostly expressed in the nucleus of Isl1-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>-AB and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, as we could not find evidence of cTnT protein expression in these latter cell types, even when we looked at the earliest stages, it is likely that transient activation of the promoter occurred in undifferentiated, potentially multipotent, SHF progenitors within the distal outflow. Analysis of this phenomenon in relation to the SMC is the subject of further study in our laboratory. With respect to the ICVS, rather than becoming cardiomyocytes, <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> labeled cells activated Sox9 expression and differentiated to valve interstitial cells, although this occurred at E11.5, approximately a day later than the more proximal cells within the wall differentiated to cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Our data are generally in agreement with and build on the data of Sizarov et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sizarov et al., 2012</xref>).

Moreover, we did not see expression of classical mesenchymal markers such as N-cadherin, αSMA and Fsp1, although the ICVS did express elastin, which is found in mature valve leaflets. The differences between these studies are unclear, but it may be that they reflect the transient expression of some of these markers and/or slight differences in staging and maturation of the ICVS between mouse and human. The delay in differentiation of cells within the ICVS may at least partially explain the activation of the <italic>Tnnt2</italic> promoter in these cells, as they may be poised, but stalled, for differentiation. The presence of <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ lineage cells in the ICVS of the mouse may be a valuable tool to investigate other genes involved in ICVS development, as it allows deletion in the directly-differentiating SHF population in the ICVS, without affecting NCC or EDC. For example, Mib1 is a ubiquitin ligase required in signalling cells for Jag activity. Here, and in a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Captur et al., 2016</xref>), arterial valve defects were observed in <italic>Mib1;Tnnt2-Cre</italic> mutants, although initially the reason for this was unclear. Our data suggest that these defects likely arise because <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> is activated in the valve primordia, deleting <italic>Mib1</italic> and thus inactivating Jag1/Jag2-Notch signalling. This prevents the ICVS, and to a lesser extent the main cushions, from forming properly thus resulting in abnormal leaflets in the mutant embryos.</p><p>EndMT is a crucial process for typical endocardial cushions, but not for ICVS, where the major process is development from SHF cells that directly differentiate into valve interstitial cells in situ. In contrast, there is minor deposition of ECM and Sox9+ cells in the sub-endothelial compartment of the forming ICVS, indicative of a small contribution by EndMT to the ICVS in this region. Notch1 together with Dll4, plays a critical early role during EndMT and Notch signalling is known to be vital for normal development of the main endocardial cushions. Deletion of both <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>Dll4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Limbourg et al., 2005</xref>), result in the early death of the embryos, by E10.5, precluding examination for ICVS formation and thus making it difficult to exclude EndMT from a crucial role in formation of the ICVS. However, evidence from the knockout of <italic>Brg1</italic> in endothelium using <italic>Nfatc1-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerberg et al., 2015</xref>) provides evidence that ICVS are not dependent on EndMT as both anterior and posterior arterial valves leaflets appeared well formed in this mutant.</p><p>Our mouse data, in keeping with those of Sizarov who studied human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sizarov et al., 2012</xref>), suggest that the ICVS form as expansions of compacted cells within the wall of the distal OFT from cells in continuity with the epithelial SHF. These condensations form at the proximal extent of the ‘fishmouth’ of non-myocardial distal outflow wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>) as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>, likely reflecting the asymmetrical addition of SHF cells and the rotation of the outflow wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scherptong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajolle et al., 2006</xref>). These cell condensations then separate from the surrounding wall, forming discrete structures that then undergo differentiation to typical valve cells. Thus, these ICVS cells appear to share an origin and be juxtaposed with the myocardial component of the outflow wall. Indeed, both the myocardial and the ICVS cells are <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>+ suggesting a close relationship between the two populations. It is of note that Jag1 was abundant in the ICVS, which do not utilise EndMT/EMT, and is also abundantly expressed in the outflow tract myocardium. Although Jag1 is also essential for valve development, its role in EndMT is controversial, with some authors suggesting it is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), but others suggesting it is not required for EndMT but plays a later role in the remodelling phases of the main cushion-derived heart valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacGrogan et al., 2016</xref>). From our data, and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">High et al., 2007</xref>), it seems likely that it is Notch1 and/or Notch2 that is the main Notch receptor in the ICVS. Notch1ICD was found in the distal outflow wall and the ICVS, but only transiently, and it was largely down-regulated by E11.5. Notch2 was expressed throughout the ICVS and until E11.5, although as we could not obtain an antibody for the active form of this protein, we cannot be sure that signalling was underway throughout this period. This transient expression within the ICVS is in contrast to the endocardium overlying the main cushions, where both Notch1 and Notch2 were maintained until E12.5 and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Monte et al., 2007</xref>). Notch signalling has been shown to be important for the differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, with its down-regulation crucial for differentiation to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nemir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>) and for activation of Sox9 in cartilage precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mead and Yutzey, 2009</xref>). Thus, the presence and then subsequent removal of Notch1 signalling may be essential in the ICVS for their differentiation to valve interstitial cells. In support of the idea that Notch-Jag signalling is playing an important role in the development of the ICVS, the deletion of <italic>Jag1/Jag2</italic> using <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> resulted in abnormal development of the arterial valve leaflets in 9/11 double mutants examined, including BAV without raphe. Specifically, in 5/11 cases the phenotype was absence or hypoplasia of the non-coronary leaflet that is derived from the ICVS. Although the <italic>Jag1/2;Tnnt2-Cre</italic> mice have a range of defects affecting the ventricular myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Amato et al., 2016</xref>), and so valve defects secondary to the ventricular defects cannot strictly be ruled out, it seems more likely that the reduction/loss of the non-coronary leaflet results from the deletion of Jag expression specifically in the ICVS. The redundancy of <italic>Jag1</italic> and <italic>Jag2</italic> is intriguing and is reminiscent of ventricular wall development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Amato et al., 2016</xref>). Although Jag1 was expressed in the core of the ICVS, Jag2 was restricted to the adluminal cells, close to N1ICD-expressing cells, suggesting that there may be some ligand-specific functional specialization. Further studies will be necessary to delineate these likely complex interactions.</p><p>The <italic>Vangl2;Isl1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Tbx1</italic> mutant mouse lines, both of which have abnormalities associated with limited addition of SHF cells to the outflow, have abnormal valve leaflets that result from failure to form or mature the ICVS; a mechanism that has not previously been described. In the <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant, premature differentiation of SHF to cardiomyocytes, as occurs earlier in the aortic sac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsbottom et al., 2014</xref>), may reduce the availability of SHF-derived cells to form Sox9+ valve interstitial cells and may underlie the reduction in the size of the ICVS and ultimately lead to BAV. The reduction in Notch1ICD and Jag1 in 2 of 3 <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>;Isl1-Cre</italic> embryos suggests that Notch signalling may be playing a role in this process and be regulated by <italic>Vangl2</italic>, either directly or indirectly. Notably, the defects were more common in the aortic valve (as they are in the Notch signalling pathway mutants) and although the reasons for this are uncertain, aortic (but never pulmonary) hypoplasia is common in the naturally occurring <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant, <italic>loop-tail</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that it is the SHF that contributes to the aorta that is preferentially affected in this mutant. Premature loss of progenitor phenotype and differentiation of cardiomyocytes leading to a marked reduction of SHF-derived subpulmonary myocardium has been reported in the <italic>Tbx1</italic> mutant mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vitelli et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, absence of the anterior leaflet of the pulmonary valve (derived from the pulmonary ICVS) has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Théveniau-Ruissy et al., 2008</xref>). Our analyses extend these data to show that a discrete pulmonary ICVS is never formed in the <italic>Tbx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and highlights similarities in the ICVS phenotype between these and the <italic>Vangl2;Isl1-Cre</italic> mutants. Moreover, the role of both <italic>Vangl2</italic> and <italic>Tbx1</italic> in regulating the epithelial properties of the SHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramsbottom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francou et al., 2014</xref>), which form the myocardium and also appear to form the ICVS, suggests that the epithelial phenotype of these cells, at least at early stages of their development, may be crucial. Indeed, it raises the possibility that there is an intrinsic relationship between the loss of epithelial properties of the wall and differentiation of the cells within it to cardiomyocytes. These differences between the affected valve observed between <italic>Vangl2</italic> and <italic>Tbx1</italic> mutants likely reflect inherent differences in the patterning of the outflow tract, further reflecting subdomains within the SHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vitelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scherptong et al., 2012</xref>). BAV has been described in a number of mouse mutants. Notably, in several cases (including following knockout of <italic>Alk2</italic>, a BMP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>), and Slit/Robo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mommersteeg et al., 2015</xref>) signalling) the anterior/non-coronary leaflets specifically failed to form properly. This, therefore may be a common mechanism underlying BAV (without raphe) formation, at least in mice, and may occur when there is disruption of the SHF as we see in the <italic>Vangl2;Isl1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Tbx1</italic> mutants. Raphe are infrequently described in mouse mutants with BAV, although this may be because most mouse mutants are described during fetal life when the leaflets remain unsculpted and thus before a true raphe would be apparent. Although it is not possible to demonstrate the mechanisms of arterial valve development using human embryos it is important to note that at comparable stages of development the appearances of human and mouse valve primordia are very similar and importantly, the expression pattern of Isl1, marking SHF progenitors, is identical. Together our data suggest that loss of SHF progenitors, either because of a failure of their formation or their premature differentiation, may be a common cause of BAV and can explain the common association between this and other intra-cardiac heart malformations. As such, BAV formed in this way may link to the subtype of BAV patterns without raphe, as occurs in 5–10% of BAV cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sievers and Schmidtke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchner et al., 2010</xref>). It will be important to analyse genomic data from patients with this BAV phenotype, searching in particular in SHF and Jag-Notch pathways.</p><p>Our murine and human data show differences between the structure of the aortic and pulmonary ICVS as they develop, that could have relevance to the common incidence of BAV compared to bicuspid pulmonary valve. The aortic ICVS develops more proximally and is not surrounded by a myocardial cuff as it develops, compared with the pulmonary ICVS, which is more distal and is completely surrounded by cardiomyocytes. These differences have also been reported recently in a histological examination of human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milos et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the pulmonary ICVS has a lesser contribution from NCC than does the aortic, and based on the differences we see between <italic>Vangl2</italic> and <italic>Tbx1</italic> mutants, may have different genetic regulation. The ICVS also express tropoelastin during their formation, whereas the main cushions do not, suggesting that these differences in cell lineage between the forming leaflets are reflected by expression of specific proteins. These differences are likely to have morphogenetic impacts on the developing aortic and pulmonary ICVS, which might reflect in their differential predisposition to pathology. Although bicuspid pulmonary valve is rare as an isolated finding in humans, it is common in association with tetralogy of Fallot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chacko et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, defects in the SHF that result in failure to develop one or other ICVS might be relevant to a high proportion of human valve abnormalities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Mef2c-AHF-Cre</td><td>PMID: 16188249</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Wnt1-Cre</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 9843687</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Tek-Cre</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 11161575</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Wt1-ERT-Cre</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 18568026</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Tnnt2-Cre</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 12975322</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td valign="bottom">ROSA-Stop-eYFP</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 11299042</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Isl1-Cre</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 14667410</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Vangl2 flox</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 25521757</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>mTmG</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 17868096</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Tbx1 null</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 11242110</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Jag1 flox</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 15550486</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Jag2 flox</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 20533406</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Mus musculus)</td><td>Mib1 flox</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 18043734</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological <break/>sample(Homo sapien)</td><td>Embryo sections <break/>CS14, 16, 21</td><td valign="bottom">HDBR;

Pairwise chi-squared comparison between the primordia, with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, confirmed that the aortic non-coronary primordium was statistically different from all other primordia.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The British Heart Foundation (PG/15/46/31589 and RG/12/15/29935), together with SAF2016.78370-R, CB16/11/00399 and RD16/0011/0021 from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Industry and Universities, funded this study.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Human embryos were obtained from the MRC/Wellcome funded Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR) held at Newcastle University, UK.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Eley et al. present evidence that intercalated outflow tract cushions form from second heart field derived mesenchyme. In a clearly written manuscript the authors suggest that these cells arise from undifferentiated cells in the outflow wall through Notch signaling. Defining the cellular origins of valve mesenchyme, defects in which cause valve dysmorphogenesis and disease, is an important objective. Differences in mesenchymal cell composition between the aortic and pulmonary ICs and right and left aortic and pulmonary valve primordia are documented, identifying a previously poorly characterized arterial valve population that appears to originate in the SHF. While this detailed study potentially furthers our understanding of arterial valve formation, the reviewers consider that the following revisions are required in order to justify the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors have carried out extensive genetic tracing experiments, the lineage data claiming the SHF origin of arterial valve cells is not compelling. Additional Cre based genetic cell tracing experiments with better spatiotemporal specificity are required to draw this conclusion. The major limitation is the non-inducible <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> approach that would ideally be resolved by using inducible <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> lines (Wu et al. Genesis 2009 or Yan et al. Genesis 2015). Unless this data is available, the authors should temper their conclusion, including in the Abstract and title. The authors should also evaluate Cre protein expression to define the precise expression profile of <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> in the intercalated valve primordia.</p><p>2) The authors should investigate whether Isl1 and Sox9 are transiently co-expressed in cells in the ICs at E11.5 and E12.5. This would provide a strong supporting argument and distinguish their observations from the prior results of Sisarov and colleagues (2012) who showed that human IC primordia express ISL1 and have low levels of SOX9 expression, in contrast to the major cushions (see Figure 5 in Sizarov et al.). The authors also need to discuss the findings of Sisarov et al. in the light of the new data.</p><p>3) The authors argue that IC interstitial cells form from the SHF epithelium, although not through EMT, based on analysis of epithelial marker distribution and lack of EMT transcription factor expression. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened if they could demonstrate that EMT is not required for formation of IC mesenchyme. For example, the authors should show that IC formation is normal in mouse embryos in which the process of EndMT is perturbed (such as endocardial Notch conditional mutant embryos). In addition, please better define an alternate mechanism of mesenchymal cell production that is hinted at. For example, Figure 4 and the cartoon in Figure 9 suggest that this may occur by a local thickening of the outflow wall (see also Sisarov et al.).</p><p>4) Co-immunostaining for NICD (as well as membrane NOTCH1-4) and Jag1 or Jag2 or Isl1 in low and high magnifications is recommended to provide a better view of NOTCH activation in the forming ICVS valves. It would be helpful to perform <italic>Tnnt2</italic>+ lineage analysis of ICVS valves in Jag1/2 compound mutant mice to define the cellular defect(s) underlying the underdeveloped non-coronary valve leaflet.</p><p>5) Given the common failure of posterior IC leaflet development in Notch and <italic>Vangl2</italic> conditional mutant hearts, the authors should provide information as to the epistatic relationship between Notch and <italic>Vangl2</italic>. In the <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant the OFT myocardial wall appears to detach in the innermost layers in Figure 7—figure supplement 2; this defect in wall integrity should also be commented on.</p><p>Points 6-8 require clarifications/modifications of the text rather than new experiments.</p><p>6) Please clarify that the results pertain to cases of BAV without a raphe in the Introduction, Discussion and title. In particular, the authors should discuss whether, as their results imply, BAV without a raphe is more frequently observed linked with outflow CHD.</p><p>7) Concerning developmental asymmetry between the aortic and pulmonary IC, please qualify in the manuscript, including the Abstract, whether activated Notch expression and the functional requirement for Notch in IC formation is specific to the posterior (non-coronary) aortic IC (as suggested in Figures 5 and 6). The authors should also discuss why IC formation may be restricted to particular circumferential regions of the OFT wall, including discussion of prior evidence for differences between the aortic and pulmonary sides of the OFT (Bajolle et al., 2008; Scherptong et al., 2012).</p><p>8) Concerning the last section of the Results, which is less developed, Eley et al. should state that <italic>Tbx1</italic>, like <italic>Vangl2</italic>, is required to regulate normal epithelial features of SHF cells as well as evidence from Théveniau-Ruissy et al., 2008 (Figure 3 therein) that the pulmonary IC is hypoplastic at early developmental stages. New insights provided by the data in Figure 8 beyond those from Théveniau-Ruissy et al., 2008 should be clearly indicated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34110.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors have carried out extensive genetic tracing experiments, the lineage data claiming the SHF origin of arterial valve cells is not compelling.

Similarly, Isl1 antibody reliably labels cells within the outflow tract that are derived from the SHF and still retain progenitor characteristics. For this reason, we believe that there is good evidence that the cells that are found within the ICVS are derived from the SHF and remain undifferentiated for longer that the surrounding tissues (also derived from the SHF). However, in line with the reviewer’s request, we have changed the title and been more circumspect in the Abstract.</p><p>We understand the reviewers’ comments about the timing of the labelling of the cells by <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic>. Unfortunately we do not have the inducible <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> line available to us, and it would not have been possible to obtain the line and optimise its use within the proposed period for the resubmission, however, as suggested, we been able to pin down further the window when the <italic>TnnT2-Cre</italic> was active. <italic>Tnnt2-Cre</italic> has been shown to be expressed in the cardiac crescent from E7.5 and is retained in cardiomyocytes throughout embryonic life (Jiao et al., 2003). These authors also showed that it was effective in deleting floxed allelles after E9.5, but that earlier than this, deletion was incomplete. This is likely because during the period of E8.5 and E10.5, SHF cells are adding to the OFT and differentiating (thus initiating <italic>Tnnt2</italic> expression) only once they are within it. By E10.5 the <italic>TnnT-Cre</italic> driven <italic>YFP</italic> expression is found more distally than is cTnT protein within the outflow wall (Figure 3T-V). This suggests that the <italic>TnnT2-Cre</italic> may be recombining in differentiating cells that do not yet express differentiated cardiomyocyte markers. E10.5 is the earliest time point when we can identify the <italic>TnnT2-Cre</italic>-labelled intercalated valve swellings within the outflow tract and at this stage they have already downregulated cardiomyocyte markers (Figures 2 and 3). As suggested by the reviewers, we have now used an anti-Cre antibody to pin down the period when Cre protein is present. This has shown that whilst Cre protein is present in the ICVS at E10.5, it is not found at E11.5 and E12.5. We have been unable to find any data about the perdurance of the Cre protein, and anyway this is likely to be cell type and temporally specific. However, taken together, this data is consistent with labelling of the ICVS prior to E10.5 (as no cTnT protein is found in the ICVS at this stage), at the time of, or just prior to, their progenitors in the SHF entering the OFT. This data is now included in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and is described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Origin of ICVS directly from SHF progenitors in the outflow wall”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should investigate whether Isl1 and Sox9 are transiently co-expressed in cells in the ICs at E11.5 and E12.5. This would provide a strong supporting argument and distinguish their observations from the prior results of Sisarov and colleagues (2012) who showed that human IC primordia express ISL1 and have low levels of SOX9 expression, in contrast to the major cushions (see Figure 5 in Sizarov et al.). The authors also need to discuss the findings of Sisarov et al. in the light of the new data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a critical point. We have thus carried out co-localisation studies with Isl1 and Sox9 at E11.5 and E12.5 and confirmed that there is transient co-expression of the two markers in ICVS cells. This data is included in Figure 3W-Y and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and is discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “Origin of ICVS directly from SHF progenitors in the outflow wall”. We have also discussed the relevance of this data and how it relates to the previous study by Sizarov et al. (2012) in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that IC interstitial cells form from the SHF epithelium, although not through EMT, based on analysis of epithelial marker distribution and lack of EMT transcription factor expression. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened if they could demonstrate that EMT is not required for formation of IC mesenchyme.

In addition, please better define an alternate mechanism of mesenchymal cell production that is hinted at. For example, Figure 4 and the cartoon in Figure 9 suggest that this may occur by a local thickening of the outflow wall (see also Sisarov et al.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a critical point. In the first instance we have clarified that there is likely a minor early contribution of EndMT to the developing ICVS, as some of the cells closest to the lumen appear to be endocardial in origin (<italic>Tek-Cre</italic> positive – Figure 3D) and we also observed deposition of ECM molecules and Sox9+ cells next to the endocardium of the forming ICVS at E10.5, but not in the rest of the ICVS (arrowheads in Figure 2D, G, J, M, P, S). This appears to be a component of the cardiac jelly that lines the whole of the outflow tract and thus also overlies the forming ICVS. This is clarified in the subsection “IC undergo late differentiation to become valve primordia” and in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>The question of how we could address this experimentally is more complex. Notch1 KO mice die at approximately E10.5 (Limbourg et al., 2005), as do other mutants where EMT is prevented. Previously we attempted to create <italic>Notch1<sup>f/f</sup>;Cad5-ERT-Cre</italic> mice, however, optimisation of the Tamoxifen timing to create the desired phenotypes did not prove possible: when we treated with Tamoxifen from E8.5 the mice recapitulated the Notch1;<italic>Tek-Cre</italic> phenotype and died before E10.5; they did not have a well enough developed heart to see the ICVS. When Tamoxifen was given from E9.5, there was no reproducible valve phenotype. Although this may give circumstantial support for the idea that Notch1 is not required for formation of the ICVS, as they form after E9.5, this is inconclusive. We have searched the literature and have been unable to find any cases where EndMT is comprehensively disrupted and the embryos survive to be analysed at stages beyond E11.5. However, we did find a published paper that showed that when <italic>Brg1</italic> (a component of the BAF chromatin remodelling complex) is knocked out specifically in the endocardium using <italic>Nfatc1-Cre</italic>, EndMT was reduced and valve abnormalities (BAV) were observed (Akerberg et al., 2015). However, the non-coronary leaflet that derives from the ICVS was well formed in all cases shown, suggesting that this is not affected by the reduction in EndMT. This now discussed in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>We agree with the suggestion that we need to better explain our proposed mechanism for formation of the ICVS. This is now discussed in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Co-immunostaining for NICD (as well as membrane NOTCH1-4) and Jag1 or Jag2 or Isl1 in low and high magnifications is recommended to provide a better view of NOTCH activation in the forming ICVS valves. It would be helpful to perform Tnnt2+ lineage analysis of ICVS valves in Jag1/2 compound mutant mice to define the cellular defect(s) underlying the underdeveloped non-coronary valve leaflet.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. We have therefore carried out additional staining for Notch1ICD, Notch2, Jag1, Jag2 and Isl1 in the developing ICVS at E10.5. These are included in Figure 5 and in Figure 5—figure supplement 2. From the literature (High et al., 2008) it does not appear that Notch3 and 4 are expressed in the distal outflow walls and therefore we did not analyse these further.</p><p>To address the second point, that it would be helpful to perform <italic>Tnnt2</italic>+ lineage analysis of ICVS valves in Jag1/2 compound mutant mice to define the cellular defect(s) underlying the underdeveloped non-coronary valve leaflet, we have made some efforts to address this. Although we could not carry out these experiments in Jag1/Jag2 double mutants as this complex cross was not available, we had mentioned in the discussion that <italic>Mib1<sup>f/f</sup>;Tnnt2-Cre</italic> mutants also have abnormalities of the arterial valves, as published in Captur et al., 2015. We have therefore included images of the <italic>Mib1<sup>f/f</sup>;Tnnt2-Cre</italic> valves in Figure 6, but also included analysis of the forming ICVS in mutant and control ICVS at E11.5. This shows that the ICVS is poorly formed in the f/f embryos and that there are fewer Sox9+/Isl1+ cells present, supporting the idea that there is a primary abnormality in the formation of the ICVS in the <italic>Mib1<sup>f/f</sup>;Tnnt2-Cre</italic> embryos. This is described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Jagged-Notch signalling is active and required for ICVS development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the common failure of posterior IC leaflet development in Notch and Vangl2 conditional mutant hearts, the authors should provide information as to the epistatic relationship between Notch and Vangl2. In the Vangl2 mutant the OFT myocardial wall appears to detach in the innermost layers in Figure 7—figure supplement 2; this defect in wall integrity should also be commented on.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to address this issue, we have carried out additional staining of Notch1 and Jag1 in <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutants at E11.5. This has demonstrated that Notch signalling is disrupted in 2/3 of the <italic>Vangl2<sup>f/f</sup>;Isl1-Cre</italic> embryos examined, suggesting that <italic>Vangl2</italic> may be upstream of Notch in the distal outflow wall. This is described in the first paragraph of the subsection “SHF deficiency leads to ICVS defects and BAV”. Whether this is direct or not remains unclear.</p><p>Relating to detachment of the OFT myocardium, we do not interpret this as detachment, but rather interpret this as myocardial differentiation within the ICVS. This is clarified in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points 6-8 require clarifications/modifications of the text rather than new experiments.</p><p>6) Please clarify that the results pertain to cases of BAV without a raphe in the Introduction, Discussion and title.

This is discussed in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Concerning developmental asymmetry between the aortic and pulmonary IC, please qualify in the manuscript, including the Abstract, whether activated Notch expression and the functional requirement for Notch in IC formation is specific to the posterior (non-coronary) aortic IC (as suggested in Figures 5 and 6). The authors should also discuss why IC formation may be restricted to particular circumferential regions of the OFT wall, including discussion of prior evidence for differences between the aortic and pulmonary sides of the OFT (Bajolle et al., 2008; Scherptong et al., 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information in the subsection “Jagged-Notch signalling is active and required for ICVS development”. We have also discussed inherent differences between the aortic and pulmonary sides of the outflow in the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Concerning the last section of the Results, which is less developed, Eley et al. should state that Tbx1, like Vangl2, is required to regulate normal epithelial features of SHF cells as well as evidence from Théveniau-Ruissy et al., 2008 (Figure 3 therein) that the pulmonary IC is hypoplastic at early developmental stages. New insights provided by the data in Figure 8 beyond those from Théveniau-Ruissy et al., 2008 should be clearly indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of <italic>Tbx1</italic> in regulating the epithelial properties of the SHF is discussed briefly in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion. We included additional text on the description of the abnormalities in the pulmonary ICVS in <italic>Tbx1</italic>-/- in the last paragraph of the subsection “SHF deficiency leads to ICVS defects and BAV”. We have also clarified that our study extends and explains the previous study by the Kelly group, by showing that the pulmonary ICVS never forms (general developmental delay in the <italic>Tbx1</italic>-/- means that there are no ICVS – including the aortic – at E10.5). However, the main purpose of this analysis in <italic>Tbx1</italic> mutants was to highlight the similarities to the <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutant and to highlight the importance of the epithelial SHF.
