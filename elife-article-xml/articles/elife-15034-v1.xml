regeneration, yet the cellular basis for this process remains unclear. We took an unbiased approach based on in vivo clonal labeling and tracking of biliary epithelial cells in the three-dimensional landscape, in combination with mathematical simulation, to understand their mode of proliferation in a mouse liver injury model where the nascent biliary structure formed in a tissue-intrinsic manner. An apparent heterogeneity among biliary epithelial cells was observed: whereas most of the responders that entered the cell cycle upon injury exhibited a limited and tapering growth potential, a select population continued to proliferate, making a major contribution in sustaining the biliary expansion. Our study has highlighted a unique mode of epithelial tissue dynamics, which depends not on a hierarchical system driven by fixated stem cells, but rather, on a stochastically maintained progenitor population with persistent proliferative activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15034.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15034.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15034.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell proliferation – the process by which cells multiply – plays an important role in many biological processes, including tissue growth, maintenance and remodeling. In these processes, the way cells proliferate is reportedly related to their roles in the tissue and the structures that they form.</p><p>The biliary tree, a piping system that exists to drain the bile produced in the liver, forms a complex, tree-like, tubular structure. The biliary tree is essential for healthy livers to work well, and has been known to grow and change its structure quite dynamically during an injury or while the liver regenerates. However, it was not clear how biliary tree cells behave as the biliary tree grows and remodels itself. Does each cell behave in the same way? And how does cell growth relate to changes in the structure of the biliary tree?</p><p>Kamimoto et al. have now developed new methods to observe detailed three-dimensional tissue structures and to trace the behavior of single cells. Using these techniques to study a mouse model whose liver was injured by toxic chemicals revealed the behavior of biliary cells as they responded to the injury. None of the biliary cells proliferated uniformly, and there were some peculiar cells that proliferated quite vigorously compared to the others.</p><p>Kamimoto et al. then made a mathematical model that could explain cell behavior and tissue remodeling at different scales. This showed that the activity of those peculiar, rapidly proliferating cells was maintained by chance as the biliary tree expanded. These findings help us understand how the biliary tissue grows and the liver regenerates. They may also provide us with a clue to understanding the nature of the behavior of living things, which is sometimes seemingly ordered and robust, and sometimes unpredictable and mysterious.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the new model can be applied to other types of tissues or in other species. Further work is also needed to investigate which genes and proteins are involved in controlling the behavior of cells in the growing biliary tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue growth, maintenance, and remodeling play central roles in ensuring the structural and functional integrity of adult organs and are achieved through the coordinated actions of cell proliferation and differentiation. In these processes, the location, arrangement and timing of cell proliferation are tightly regulated in tissue-specific and context-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barker et al., 2010</xref>). Selected and dedicated populations of adult stem cells that continuously provide progenies to replenish aged or damaged cells can be found in some tissues, while multiplication of differentiated cells also plays an active role in normal tissue turnover and regeneration in other tissues. Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the spatiotemporal pattern of cell proliferation in intact tissues will provide fundamental insights into organ homeostasis and regeneration.</p><p>The liver epithelium comprises the parenchymal cells, or hepatocytes, and the biliary epithelial cells (BECs), also known as cholangiocytes. In the adult liver, these cells are maintained in a quiescent state in which they stable epithelial sheets and tubules. They enter dynamic regeneration processes once the organ suffers tissue loss or various types of injury. In particular, the regeneration process that responds to chronic injury involves drastic changes in the morphology and phenotype of liver epithelial tissues, and in both human pathologies and animal models often accompanies a phenomenon called the ductular reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gouw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Michalopoulos and Khan, 2015</xref>). The ductular reaction has been histologically characterized as the ectopic emergence and expansion of BEC-marker-positive cells in the liver parenchymal region. After using newly established imaging approaches to capture three-dimensional (3D) tissue morphology in situ, we recently reported that such a phenomenon results from dynamic and adaptive structural changes in intra-hepatic biliary tree architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, ductular reaction essentially represents drastic and complex remodeling of the biliary epithelial tissue, which is likely to be regulated by a sophisticated mechanism that controls BEC proliferation.</p><p>Notably, ductular reaction not only serves as an attractive model for studies of the mechanisms of tissue remodeling and cell proliferation, but also is a pathophysiologically relevant regenerative response of the liver to counter various types of injury stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michalopoulos, 2014</xref>). Several lines of evidence involving knock-out mice for regulatory signals, such as TWEAK, HGF/c-Met and FGF7, have collectively demonstrated that the suppression or failure of ductular reaction leads to exacerbated liver injury and severe defects in liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takase et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the in vivo behavior and manner of growth of BECs during biliary tree remodeling remains largely unknown. For many years, ductular reaction has been regarded and studied as a model that represents the activation of adult liver stem/progenitor cells, which may reside in the biliary tree and which can differentiate into hepatocytes or BECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miyajima et al., 2014</xref>). Although in vitro studies have demonstrated the presence of clonogenic cells in the biliary compartment that are highly proliferative under culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miyajima et al., 2014</xref>), the in vivo existence and behavior of such proliferative BEC subpopulations remain unclear. This was partly because many recent studies employing genetic-lineage tracing approaches in vivo have focused on the trans-differentiation capacities of BECs and of hepatocytes, rather than on the mode of proliferation of BECs themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grompe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Michalopoulos and Khan, 2015</xref>)</p><p>Recently, single-cell approaches have been applied to the field of stem cell research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Etzrodt et al., 2014</xref>). Among these, in vivo quantitative single-cell tracing has successfully revealed the presence of stem/progenitor cell populations and their unique features in various organs, providing fundamental insights into the cellular basis of tissue homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hara et al., 2014</xref>). This technique is designed to reveal the rules of cellular dynamics that underlie tissue growth by tracking a population of single cells comprehensively and by deducing the characteristics of proliferative capacity, cell fate and behavior through statistical analyses involving mathematical simulation. A clonal cell tracing study on BECs was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tarlow et al., 2014b</xref>) that focused solely on the clonal differentiation potential of both hepatocyte and BEC lineages, but not on the clone size (representing the clonal growth potential). Thus, the exact cell numbers of BEC-derived clones were not quantified. The biliary tree has a highly complex and fine structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>), thus it is practically impossible to count or even estimate the number of BECs that reside in it using conventional histological analysis in tissue sections. Hence, it was essential to develop a 3D imaging method that can provide detailed and reliable tissue structure images and thus allow quantitative assessment.</p><p>Here, we aimed to elucidate the basic mechanisms that underlie the morphological transformation of the biliary tree, a key process in liver regeneration. In order to study the precise cellular dynamics in the context of complex tissue structures with branching morphology, we introduced three new methods and strategies: high-resolution 3D imaging, quantitative single-cell tracing, and computational simulation. Using our newly established platform to visualize, label and trace BECs in liver tissue, we first revealed that the expansion and remodeling of the biliary tree in a mouse model of chronic liver injury was predominantly driven by the intrinsic growth of biliary epithelial tissue. We performed quantitative single-cell tracing of BECs in vivo to elucidate the underlying cellular behavior, which was further characterized by mathematical modeling and computational simulation. The results highlighted hitherto unrecognized heterogeneity among BECs and the mode of their proliferation, constituting the basis for the drastic structural transformation of the biliary epithelial tissue in regenerating liver in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ubiquitous and unbiased labeling of BECs using Prom1-CreERT2;R26R-tdTomato mice</title><p>In order to achieve specific and permanent labeling of BECs, we employed a mouse strain in which a tamoxifen-inducible variant of Cre (CreERT2) is knocked-in to the <italic>Prominin1 (Prom1</italic>) locus, hereafter referred to as the Prom1-CreERT2 mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>).

X-gal staining experiments using liver sections showed that nLacZ was expressed in a BEC-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left and right panels). We also performed whole-mount X-gal staining of the entire liver of the Prom1-CreERT2 mice. This resulted in 3D visualization of finely branching, tree-like architecture spreading throughout the organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, middle and right panels), the pattern of which matches well with the biliary tree structure that we recently revealed using an ink-casting technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>).

We first administered a relatively high dose of tamoxifen (10 mg/20 g mouse body weight) into Prom1-CreERT2;R26R-tdTomato mice and analyzed their livers to evaluate labeling specificity and efficiency. Immunostaining images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and FACS plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed that all of the labeled cells were included in the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> BEC population, indicating that the Prom1-CreERT2;R26R-tdTomato mouse can be used for specific labeling of BECs. The labeling efficiency at this dose of tamoxifen was approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The labeling seemed to occur at random in the BEC population: the labeled tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were distributed ubiquitously among EpCAM<sup>+</sup> BECs with no apparent relation to features of the biliary structure, which will be described later in more detail. We also compared the Prom1-CreERT2 lineage-labeled and non-labeled cells in terms of their proliferative characteristics upon liver injury; using a 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, and found no significant difference between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), showing that their proliferative capacities are indistinguishable. In addition, the BEC lineage labeling rate of around 30% did not change significantly, even after ductular reaction was induced by a chronic injury model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also confirmed that no leakiness of labeling occurred in the absence of tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that the BEC labeling in our system occurs in an un-biased manner, and that the labeled cells faithfully represent the entire BEC population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>3D fluorescent imaging of the biliary tree with single-cell resolution</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, the intrahepatic biliary epithelial tissue exhibits a complex yet ordered tree-like structure, which cannot be readily recognized by conventional histological analyses of thin tissue sections.

TAA is known to induce localized cell death of hepatocytes, specifically around the central vein (CV). Continuous administration of this drug causes chronic inflammation and bridging fibrosis, and eventually leads to tumor formation, reminiscent of the progression of fibrotic and cirrhotic liver disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yeh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">De Minicis et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to this pathophysiological relevance, pilot test experiments comparing several injury models also revealed that TAA caused the least autofluorescence in liver specimens (data not shown), which is suitable and advantageous for obtaining high-quality imaging data that can be used to perform analyses on detailed tissue and cellular structures.</p><p>Before proceeding with single-cell clonal tracing of BECs, we conducted tracing experiments in a condition where BECs were labeled en masse to analyze: the pattern of 3D changes in the morphology of the biliary structure; and the relative contribution of the pre-existing BECs to the expanded structures. Beginning 2 weeks after a single administration of a high dose of tamoxifen, the Prom1-CreERT2;R26R-tdTomato mice were continuously administered TAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We first confirmed the spatial distribution of the labeled cells under normal conditions at the onset of the injury protocol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, the BEC labeling occurred evenly in both the duct and ductule compartments, and in an un-biased mosaic pattern independent of other morphological features such as the duct size or branch locations.</p><p>We then analyzed the fate of labeled cells and branching morphogenesis over 8 weeks of the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>). The biliary tree structure began to undergo dynamic remodeling by TAA 2 weeks, with ductules, which reside omni-directionally around the PV in the normal condition, extending uni-directionally toward the CV. The labeled tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were clearly observed in the extending ductular compartment, indicating that the pre-existing biliary epithelial tissue, presumably the ductule, has undergone the morphological change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, white arrows). At TAA 4 weeks, the biliary extension that reached deep into the liver lobule had begun to form intricately branched structures around the CV area. Many tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in these newly formed branches. Remarkably, none of the expanded branches lost their connectivity with the main duct in the peri-portal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, white arrows). This indicates that the ductular reaction is neither the migration of detached BECs nor ectopic emergence of BEC-like cells at a distant area in the liver parenchyma, but rather an extension of branching architecture from the pre-existing biliary tissue. Morphological changes further continued along with the disease progression, and at TAA 8 weeks, drastically expanded BECs appeared to make mesh-like network structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).</p><p>We observed changes to the distribution pattern of the labeled BECs during the course of the injury progression. The labeled tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells remained evenly distributed in a mosaic fashion in the main duct structure around the PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, white arrowheads), but they displayed apparently uneven distribution in the newly formed structures. That is, the expanded compartment around the CV was composed of several clusters of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, white arrows), implicating clonal expansion of a BEC subpopulation therein.</p><p>Notably, we found two opposite features, diversity and uniformity, of the ductular reaction that were visible at the micro- and macro- scale , respectively. When subjected to microscopic observation, biliary tree within each defined region of interest exhibited diversity in terms of growth speed and structural features, particularly at its periphery, even in 3D images. Quantitative analysis of BEC distribution in tissue sections supported this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taking advantage of the LacZ expression in BECs of the Prom1-CreERT2 mouse strain, we also examined the TAA-induced biliary tissue remodeling at the macroscopic scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Organ-wide visualization of the entire biliary tree structure enabled us to grasp the landscape of the ductular reaction, in which whole-tissue remodeling follows an ordered and uniform pattern with respect to both spatial and temporal changes.</p><p>The results of the BEC lineage tracing in the 3D tissue architecture strongly suggested that pre-existing BECs made a major contribution to the ductular reaction in the TAA injury model, at least within the initial period of 8 weeks. It should be noted that, in the present experimental setting, virtually all of the labeled cells were contained within the CK19<sup>+</sup> cell population and that labeled hepatocytes were rarely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This result is consistent with recent reports by many other groups who have used lineage tracing experiments, in that the cells that are induced and expanded by the ductular reaction, or LPCs, do not show stem or progenitor cell-like activity that contributes to new hepatocytes in most, if not all, models of mouse liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grompe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tarlow et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yanger et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hepatocytes are not the main source of the expanded biliary structure</title><p>On the basis of the results of the 3D tracing of BECs, we assumed that pre-existing BECs were the main source of the newly formed biliary structure.

We analyzed the expression of several molecular markers that are associated with BECs/LPCs, including EpCAM, CK19, Prom1, Spp1 (also known as osteopontin), and MIC1-1C3. Upon DDC administration for 8 weeks, we detected many Spp1<sup>+</sup> cells in the tdTomato-labeled population, but we did not detect any EpCAM<sup>+</sup> tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This indicates that while hepatocytes can indeed gain a 'biliary' phenotype in terms of Spp1 expression, they are still not fully converted to BECs as defined by EpCAM expression. FACS analysis using the MIC1-1C3 surface antigen instead of Spp1 also revealed that hepatocytes contributed to the MIC1-1C3<sup>+ </sup>'biliary' population but not to that of the EpCAM<sup>+</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We also examined the expression patterns of Prom1 and CK19 and found that they were essentially the same as that of EpCAM, but they were different from those of Spp1 and MIC1-1C3 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the report by Tarlow et. al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tarlow et al., 2014a</xref>) showing that Spp1<sup>+</sup> MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> proliferating ductular cells derived from hepatocytes upon DDC injury (which they named hepPDs) are distinct from those derived from pre-existing BECs (which they named bilPDs) with respect to the gene expression profile. Specifically, such hepatocyte-derived cells (hepPDs) show little or no expression of CK19, EpCAM, or Prom1. We also estimated the contribution of hepPDs to the biliary population using our BEC labeling system, in which a decrease in the labeling ratio of BECs would be expected if a large number of hepatocytes converted into BECs. We found no significant decrease of labeling ratio after DDC administration in EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells. The ratio might be slightly decreased in MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> cells, but this remains to be confirmed as statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Considering the relatively small contribution of the hepatocyte-derived cells to the entire MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> population upon DDC injury (1.88% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the result overall is consistent with that of the hepatocyte-tracing experiments using the AAV system.</p><p>In the TAA model (as in the DDC model), we did not detect the emergence of hepatocyte-derived EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Intriguingly, even hepatocyte-derived Spp1<sup>+</sup> cells were not detected, suggesting that hepPDs are not induced under this injury condition. Consistently, FACS analysis detected no MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> cells or EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells in the tdTomato<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>), further confirming the notion that hepatocytes do not convert into either BECs (or bilPDs) or BEC-like cells (or hepPDs) in the course of TAA-induced liver injury, even after 8 weeks. Again, the expression patterns of Prom1 and CK19 were the same as that of EpCAM, but different from those of Spp1 and MIC1-1C3 (data not shown). Thus, Spp1 and MIC1-1C3 mark a different and broader cell population from that defined by the expression of CK19, EpCAM and Prom1. We concluded that hepatocyte-derived duct-like cells (hepPDs) do emerge in the DDC model but not in the TAA model, and that they are distinguishable from bilPDs. This finding may be of pathophysiological relevance, in that the DDC model is a cholestatic liver injury model that primarily targets the biliary epithelial system, whereas the TAA model is a hepatotoxic injury model with less severe cholestatic disease phenotypes.</p><p>To gain an insight into the spatial relationship between hepPDs (Spp1<sup>+</sup> EpCAM<sup>-</sup>) and the biliary tissue structure composed of bilPDs (Spp1<sup>+</sup> EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells), we further applied the 3D immunostaining and imaging analyses. 3D images confirmed that hepPDs were barely detected under the normal physiological condition or upon TAA-induced injury. In the DDC model, however, hepPDs emerged around several parts of the pre-existing biliary architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). The tissue architecture composed of hepPDs was different from that composed of bilPDs: the former did not form any single and contiguous branch structure but rather formed a subsidiary structure, located just around the pre-existing branched structures of bilPDs.</p><p>The results of these fate-tracing and 3D-imaging analyses confirmed that although hepatocytes are capable of being converted into the biliary epithelial state in a context-dependent manner, the main contributors to the ductular reaction (in terms of gene expression, cell number, and 3D structure) are pre-existing BECs. These findings also indicate that we can focus solely on the fate and behavior of pre-existing BECs when attempting to determine the cellular basis of the ductular reaction, particularly when using the TAA model.

Prom1-CreERT2;R26R-tdTomato mice were administered a very low dosage of tamoxifen to label BECs at a very low frequency. 3D imaging and FACS analyses showed that the labeling was introduced at a rate of less than 0.2% of total BECs, and that the labeled cells located singly and apart from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). After single-cell labeling, mice were subjected to the TAA protocol and the size of single-cell-derived clonal progenies were analyzed during the course of injury progression. Of note, the labeling index of 0.2% did not change even after the injury period, which is consistent with the notion that the labeling was introduced in an unbiased manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). After 6 weeks of injury, there were still many BECs that had rarely divided and that remained as single cells or merely as clusters composed of a few cells. At the same time, we also observed larger colonies composed of dozens of cells, indicating that some BECs had undergone several rounds of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e,f</xref>).

We classified the biliary epithelial tissue into two distinct portions according to their tube diameter sizes and locations, namely 'duct' and 'peripheral ductule', as we anticipated a putative relationship between the tissue architecture and cell proliferation capacity. This highlighted two important features of colony size distribution. First, the duct compartment contained no large colonies of more than five cells, while the peripheral ductule compartment did contain large colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–g</xref>). Notably, we found no large colonies that were directly connected to the duct cells adjacent to PV. Thus, it is not likely that some proliferative cells reside in a fixed position in the duct compartment and continuously supply progeny toward the periphery. Rather, the colony-initiating, proliferative cells may reside in the peripheral ductule compartment and relocate their position upon parenchymal injury.</p><p>The second feature of colony size distribution relates to the pattern if this distribution. We initially assumed that the distribution of colony size would have a bimodal shape, with one peak corresponding to a non-proliferative population and the other to a proliferative one. However, the empirical data showed a unimodal distribution pattern with long tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and i</xref>). Although the proportion of large colonies was seemingly low, these colonies actually incorporated a relatively large proportion of the total number of proliferated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). The results thus highlight a proliferative and expandable subpopulation of BECs that should make a major contribution to the growth of biliary epithelial tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Proliferating BECs are not strictly compartmentalized in tissue structure</title><p>We further sought to reveal the relationship between cell proliferation and tissue structure in detail. In many tissues, proliferating cells, or stem cells, are spatially arranged within a specific area that has a characteristic tissue structure; for example, intestinal stem cells reside in the crypt bottom of the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barker et al., 2010</xref>). We searched 3D images of the biliary tree for any structural feature corresponding to the location of cycling cells by immunostaining for the cell-proliferation marker Ki67. Most of the Ki67<sup>+</sup> BECs localized to the peripheral area of the biliary tree in the TAA injured liver, whereas only a few Ki67<sup>+</sup> BECs were seen in the duct around the PV area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This distribution pattern fits well with the results of the clonal cell tracing experiments. In the peripheral ductule compartment, the Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were widely scattered. No further sign of a defined stem cell niche, such as a cluster or aligned arrangement of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells, was observed. At 2 weeks of TAA administration, Ki67<sup>+</sup> BECs were already enriched in the peripheral ductule region, and scattered therein, rather than in the ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This suggests that the mode of proliferation is maintained over time. We also examined the distribution pattern of proliferating BECs by continuous labeling of cycling cells using 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and obtained the same result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15034.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proliferating BECs are scattered in the peripheral branching architectures in the biliary tree.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 3D images of the biliary tree (CK19 immunostaining; green) and the cell cycle marker Ki67 (magenta) in TAA-injured liver samples.

To understand the mechanistic basis for such heterogeneity, we sought to construct a simple growth model that could potentially explain and be used to simulate the proliferative behavior of BECs upon injury. For this purpose, it was necessary to collect information about cellular events in a short time scale. We hypothesized that BECs could be classified into two states based on their temporal proliferative capacities, and if this was the case, then the relationship between these states could be examined.</p><p>We designed an experiment to investigate the temporal proliferative state and cell fates of BECs using two nucleotide analogs, BrdU and EdU, like that employed in a previous study on pancreatic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teta et al., 2007</xref>). First, mice were administered with BrdU continuously for 8 days to label in vivo as many proliferating cells as possible (1<sup>st</sup> label). After a short interval, mice were then administered the other nucleotide analog, EdU, for pulse labeling (2<sup>nd</sup> label) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The rationale for this consecutive and double labeling experiment is as follows. If BECs can be classified into two distinct states: an actively and continuously dividing state and a quiescent state, then those BECs that are subjected to the 2<sup>nd</sup> labeling (corresponding to the actively and continuously dividing cells) should also have undergone the 1<sup>st</sup> labeling and thus are mostly observed as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> label double-positive population. Conversely, if BECs are able to convert between the proliferative and quiescent states reversibly, they can divide at arbitrary time points and hence the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd </sup>labelings will occur independently. In this case, significant numbers of the 2<sup>nd</sup> label single-positive cells should be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This experimental strategy can thus allow us to reveal the mode of cell proliferation in terms of the cells' potential for short-term transition between the proliferative and quiescent states. We must note that the definition of proliferative capacity in this particular set of experiments is based on relatively short-term cell behavior, and the proliferative or quiescent state of a current cell does not apply to its progeny. In other words, BECs are classified by their transient cell division manner, but they are not restricted to this state permanently.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15034.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>BECs do not proliferate uniformly and can be subdivided into those in the proliferative state and those in the quiescent state.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram for the experimental design.

In the process of fitting a putative tissue growth model, we employed computational simulation by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using R software to obtain numerous outputs for different sizes of BEC colonies, which eventually converged into a specific distribution pattern. Many rounds of simulation, validation, and modification of different parameters in various combinations were performed until we obtained a simulation result that fitted well with the empirical data from clonal tracing in vivo. (See 'Materials and methods' for details).</p><p>Considering the results of our nucleotide double-labeling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we assumed a simple growth model driven by two cell states, continuously proliferating cells and quiescent cells. As stated before, we recognized that the most distinctive feature of the quantitative clonal tracing data was the heterogeneity in BECs with regard to proliferative activity, as manifested by the uni-modality and long-tailed pattern of the colony size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and i</xref>). To construct a model that recapitulates this feature, we hypothesized that there must be a factor that accounts for the heterogeneous proliferative capacities of each cell. Thus, we incorporated a stochastic cell behavior into our two-state growth model, in that a cell in the proliferative state can alter its growth state to the quiescent state in a probabilistic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We use the term 'stochastic' here in exactly the same manner as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>): to describe that the state of each cell is unpredictable rather than being fixed or pre-determined, with the total proportion of cells in each divergent state being balanced. It is important to note that the concept of stochastic growth does not mean that the transition process occurs in a non-regulated manner. There are indeed factors that regulate cellular growth state and behavior, although the switching and maintenance of each cell's state, timing of each cell division, and duration of each cell cycle 'appear' to be stochastic. Such stochastic behavior has already been shown to exist in progenitor cells in the interfolliculer epidermis (IFE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>), and we defined parameters on the basis of that IFE model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). As expected, the model with the stochastic feature produced a widespread distribution in colony size, with each single proliferating cell yielding colonies of various sizes along the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15034.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mathematical modeling predicts the stochastic nature of the BEC proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram of the proposed growth model.

A simulation result for 8-day injury period fitted significantly better with the experimental data for 2-week tracing than did simulated data for 2 weeks of injury, implying a gap of several days between the timing of colony formation in vivo and in silico. The initial simulation model was based on the assumption that the BECs began to enter the proliferative mode on the day when the injury was induced. We reasoned that the gap might be due to an incorrect estimation of the timing of the commencement of BEC proliferation upon injury, as there must be a lag between the timing of the injury application and that of the concomitant induction of tissue growth. To test this hypothesis, we performed additional immunostaining experiments using Ki67 and found that BECs first entered the cell cycle in vivo 6 days after the TAA injury was started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). This result was consistent with our prediction, and we modified the parameter for the starting point in our revised simulation model accordingly. This modification allowed the obtained patterns of simulation to fit the experimentally obtained in vivo data completely over the time course examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d–f</xref>).</p><p>We further evaluated our model in an additional experiment. Our model predicted that the rate of 'cell loss' should be minimal in the BEC population (model parameter l = 0.001, which means that only 0.1% of BECs would be lost in a day). We evaluated the occurrence of cell death in TAA injury by an in vivo cell-death detection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, almost no cell death was detected in the CK19<sup>+</sup> area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), thus supporting our model prediction.</p><p>Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the proliferation dynamics of BECs upon TAA injury conform to the following stochastic model: (i) upon liver injury, some BECs are activated to change their growth state to the proliferative state, while the others remain quiescent; (ii) those BECs that are in the proliferative state can stochastically and irreversibly convert back to the quiescent state during the course of injury; (iii) the highly proliferative BEC subpopulation is stochastically maintained and produces a large number of progenies, thereby making a major contribution to the expansion and remodeling of biliary epithelial tissue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Understanding the relationship between the mode of cell proliferation and the resultant structural organization within a tissue is one of the fundamental issues in stem cell biology.

Our results have delineated a progressing morphological transformation of the peripheral ductular structure in the TAA model, which is primarily achieved by a tissue-intrinsic cell expansion within the pre-existing biliary epithelium. Intriguingly, the expansion of biliary epithelial tissue is dictated by heterogeneous and stochastic behavior of BECs.

In many instances, the architecture of the biliary tree is illustrated as a simple monolayer tube with a luminal structure that corresponds to the ducts, with little or no attention being paid to the presence of peripheral ductules. However, it is the ductule compartment, rather than the ducts, that makes a key contribution to tissue remodeling, as exemplified by the fact that the majority of the proliferating BECs reside in the peripheral ductule region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Structural and functional units found in many different organs, such as the intestinal crypt and the hair follicle, exhibit fairly ordered structure in that they are reiteratively aligned in quasi-two-dimensional sheet-like tissue structures. By contrast, the biliary tree, especially the ductule compartment, spreads omni-directionally and it is quite difficult to capture its structure comprehensively and reproducibly. Therefore, it is necessary to use 3D-imaging methods to capture the tissue structures and cellular growth dynamics therein accurately and precisely. In order to observe detailed features and connectivity within the biliary tree structure in the liver, we have established a novel 3D staining and imaging method. There are substantial gains to be made by adapting the method so that it can be performed easily and effectively with minimum time and cost, especially for experiments such as quantitative single cell tracing analysis in which large numbers of samples must be handled. We have thoroughly optimized our 3D imaging protocol at various steps to render it easy and cost-effective; our protocol does not require expensive reagents or specialized equipment, and thus provides a versatile method for studying various tissue structures in the liver, as well as in other organs.</p><p>Using quantitative single-cell tracing, we revealed cellular heterogeneity in the biliary epithelial tissue in vivo. More specifically, we found two levels of heterogeneity among the BEC population. First, the biliary epithelial tissue can be subdivided into two classes, namely the duct and peripheral ductule compartments, on the basis of morphological and geographical characteristics. At the population level, the BECs in the peripheral ductule compartment have higher proliferative tendency than those in the ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, among the BECs in the peripheral ductule compartment, there exists further heterogeneity in terms of the proliferative behavior. Not all of the ductule cells exhibit a proliferative response upon injury, and the size of the colonies varies even among the proliferative population. Both of these levels of heterogeneity can be explained by our mathematical model. The model predicts the initial ratio of the proliferating BEC population to be p=0.465, meaning that the majority of BECs do not divide in response to the injury stimulus. This is consistent with the notion that the duct compartment cells, which constitute the major part of the BEC population under the normal condition, do not or rarely divide upon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The proliferative heterogeneity in the peripheral ductule compartment is well represented in the model as change in stochastic growth state (i.e., proliferating vs. non-proliferating states) of BECs.</p><p>The dual nucleotide labeling experiment showed that the proliferative state of BECs switched irreversibly to a quiescent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This feature has also been reported in a previous study of epithelial tissue in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>), but is not consistent with a report that described the manner of cell division and cell fate decision in an in vitro model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>). We think that this discrepancy may be due to the role of BECs in vivo. During the remodeling and growth process in biliary epithelial tissue, BECs must form a functional tubular structure. We assume that BECs may gain a type of steady-state phenotype (or, become more matured and differentiated cells) in order to generate and maintain a functional and robust epithelial tubular structure. From this point of view, it is reasonable to assume that their proliferation state changes irreversibly in vivo. Unfortunately, we do not yet have an established marker that can clearly distinguish BECs in different stages in the course of their functional differentiation and maturation, which prevented us from directly evaluating this possibility. Nevertheless, it could be supported in part by our findings that revealed the relationship between the proliferative capacity of BECs and structural features of the biliary tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), as BECs constituting different tissue structures may be in distinct differentiation stages.</p><p>The opposing concepts of 'stochastic' versus 'deterministic' cell-fate decisions have been established as an important paradigm in stem-cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">O'Neill and Schaffer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enver et al., 2009</xref>). It should be noted that the concept of stochastic versus deterministic regulation, which relates to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, does not refute the existence of temporal proliferative sub-states, as shown in the dual nucleotide labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Here, the deterministic model refers to restriction of a cell to a state that is permanently fixed. In both models, cells are divided into sub-populations according to their transient proliferative state, rather than according to their permanent state. Thus, the existence of a proliferative state does not refute the stochastic model, and the existence of a temporal proliferative state does not simply mean that cell proliferation follows the deterministic model. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that govern the maintenance and regulation of cells are defined differently in the stochastic and deterministic models. In the stochastic model, tissue stem cells, for example, have non-uniform cell fate and the consequences of cell fate selection are not predictable, whereas in the deterministic model, the stem cells give rise to their progeny uniformly and stably. The stochastic growth model first emerged in the 1960s, in order to explain the heterogeneous behavior of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Siminovitch et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Till et al., 1964</xref>). Since then, many studies have revealed the existence and role of stochastic behaviour in various phenomena in living things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Samoilov et al., 2006</xref>). In our simulation, we used a stochastic feature to model not only the cell-fate decision process but also the regulation of the cell cycle length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In our mathematical simulation, we defined quiescent cells as those that do not divide at all, thus we do not need to consider their cell cycle length. We did, however, have to consider the cell cycle length of proliferative cells. We first ran many simulations with a uniform cell cycle length for all cells. We found, however, that the best fit was achieved when we allowed variation in cell-cycle length among the cells. This variation was defined as the parameter m (see 'Materials and methods' for details). Interestingly, this result agrees with the notion proposed by Spencer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>), confirmed by their single-cell experimental system, that there is substantial cell-to-cell variation in cell cycle lengths and delay between mitogen re-stimulation and CDK activation. They also reported that cells had heterogeneous inter-mitotic times, ranging from 20 hr to &gt;50 hr. This fits well with our stochastic proliferation model whose definitions include varying inter-mitotic times.</p><p>In the stochastic model, the number and state of stem cells are maintained unstably. This fits the structural features of the biliary tree well in many regards. First, as the injury progressed, the biliary tree formed numerous arborization and branch ends around the injured area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the location of cycling cells appeared to be scattered at the 3D level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Such frequent remodeling and sporadic proliferation are well suited to the stochastic growth model, which can maintain a spatiotemporally flexible population of proliferating cells. Second, the stochastic model is consistent with diversity in tissue structure at the micro scale. In microscopic view, the stochastic system shows a degree of instability because the cell state may fluctuate and the output may be unpredictable. This feature nicely explains the dynamics of biliary remodeling, in that the detailed shape and degree of expansion of the extended biliary tree varied in each small area of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This is why the architecture of the biliary tree looks complicated when observed by 2D liver section. Thus, the instability shown in the stochastic model matches the microscopic structural diversity of the biliary tree. Third, we focus on a macroscopic feature. In our stochastic model, each cell behaves in a flexible manner, but the total percentages of cells that take each cell-fate decision is strictly defined and follows a particular value at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). This feature of the stochastic model makes the simulation outcome converge into an ordered pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). In other words, the stochastic growth mode provides a stable, robust and consistent outcome in a macroscopic view. This macroscopic feature corresponds to the biliary tree architecture in the macroscopic view, as the biliary tree appears to follow a uniform pattern in both the spatial and temporal terms when it is observed at a large scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the stochastic behavior of BECs plays a fundamental role in establishing a flexible and adaptive tissue remodeling system in the biliary epithelium, which underlies the robust regenerative capacity of the liver upon injury. Studies in other systems, including hematopoietic stem cells and epidermal homeostasis, have revealed similar models and concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Siminovitch et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>), implying that a common and fundamental mechanism governs stochastic cell behavior. Knowledge on the mode of tissue growth provided by this study applies to systems beyond the hepatobiliary system, and should provide significant insights into tissue dynamics and homeostasis in many other organs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and animal experiments</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of The University of Tokyo, under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo (approval numbers 2501, 2501–1, 2609 and 2706).

The same blocking/permeabilization reagent was also used in the following staining process for antibody dilution. We typically stained 10 thick sections in a 2 ml tube with 500 µl of diluted antibody solution. The samples were incubated in the antibody solution on a rocking or shaking device at 4°C for 2 days.

In many studies, the number of cells in a colony has been calculated or estimated on the basis of data obtained from 2D sectioned images. For example, in a previous study in which a similar statistical method was employed to reveal the growth mode of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Driessens et al., 2012</xref>), the number of cells in a clone (clone size) was estimated from 2D section images. This was because the clones formed in the epidermis had an ordered shape and the actual clone size was well correlated with the estimations that can be derived from 2D section images. In stark contrast, the biliary tree exhibits branching and diversified 3D structures, which become far more complex under the liver injury condition, so that it is practically difficult to estimate clone sizes accurately from 2D section images. Hence, we chose to perform 3D imaging followed by direct cell counting to quantify the exact cell number in each colony. This approach is more time consuming than those relying on 2D image analyses, but it can reduce potential experimental errors and artifacts that might otherwise occur when calculating or estimating clone size.</p><p>In the quantitative single-cell tracing experiments, we analyzed the liver samples by making thick (300 μm) sections. This enabled us to observe the entire structure of the labeled clones in the biliary tree in 3D. We genetically labeled BECs at a very low frequency to perform single-cell tracing. This resulted in extremely low density (or, incidence) of labeled clones in the liver tissues, so that it was necessary to examine and observe vast numbers of samples in order for us to achieve data with enough size. One section of a 300 μm thickness has an equivalent data size to 30 sheets of 10-μm-thick 2D sections. Thus, the 3D imaging not only provided the 3D structural information on clone sizes, but also enabled us to survey large areas in tissue samples very efficiently.</p><p>As mentioned before, the liver samples were treated with a nucleotide-staining reagent SYTOX Green. By counting the number of nuclei in a tdTomato<sup>+</sup> colony, we quantified the number of cells in the colony. It typically took only 10 hr to stain all of the nuclei in thick liver sections with SYTOX Green. It took a further 3 hr to treat the stained tissue with the clearing reagent SeeDB. We were thus able to complete these sample preparation steps within a day, showing that our protocol is suited for 3D observation of large quantities of tissue samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Cell status and cell fate</title><p>Based on the distribution pattern of the clone-size data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we hypothesized the existence of heterogeneity in terms of proliferative capacity within BECs. We also presumed that BECs may take two different states, namely the proliferating and quiescent states, and tested this possibility by a nucleotide-incorporation experiment. We speculated that irreversible cell fate changes (in which BECs can change from the proliferating state to the quiescent state but not from the quiescent state to the proliferating state) took place, and the experimental results supported this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,e</xref>).</p><p>The experimental results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> were consistent with the model we had proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, upper panel), but there was one point that did not completely match with our initial expectation. In theory, if our speculation represents reality and the experiment worked perfectly, the percentage of the BrdU and EdU double-positive cells in the EdU-positive population should reach 100%. In practice, however, it was approximately 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). A plausible explanation for this observed discrepancy is that the proportion is lower than the theoretical value (100%) when the 1st labeling fails to label proliferative cells completely, even when BrdU is administered continuously. We assumed that this was probably the case, and thus that the lower level of labeling might be explained by the stochastic characteristics of cell growth. We administered BrdU continuously for 8 days to achieve the maximum level of the 1st labeling so that the entire population of the proliferating cells could be labeled. According to the results of simulation, the cell division rate (denoted as 'm'), corresponding to the probability that any given cell will enter the cell cycle during a day, was relatively low (m = 0.175). In our stochastic model, the timing of the cell cycle entry per day was defined as a Bernoulli process. In this scenario, the final labeling rate of the 1st labeling was expected to be approximately 78.5% (if m = 0.175, then 1-(1-m) ^ 8 = 0.78539). Thus, the observed discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical value for the proportion of the BrdU and EdU double-positive cells was brought about inherently and could be explained by the proliferative behavior of BECs. Our stochastic model and the quantitative data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are mutually consistent with each other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Modeling and parameters</title><p>We simulated biliary epithelial tissue growth using computational Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In the quantitative single-cell tracing experiments, the tissue growth up to 8 weeks of TAA injury was analyzed. We thus sought to reproduce the cellular behavior observed over this 8-week period by simulation. We defined the start of BEC proliferation to occur in a probabilistic manner, presuming that the average cell cycle duration (the period from the beginning of a cell division to the beginning of the next subsequent division) was longer than 24 hr. We defined a simulation model in which each proliferating cell could choose whether or not to start cell division, based on the cell division rate parameter 'm'.</p><p>When a cell enters the cell cycle, it should follow one of three fate options (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The probabilities of selection of each of these fates are defined by two parameters, 'r' and 's'. The parameter r affects stability of the colony size, while the parameter s represents imbalance between the selection of proliferative and quiescent states. In the case where totally balanced tissue growth occurs, such as in the normal maintenance of adult epidermis, the proportions of proliferating and quiescent cells are maintained and the parameter s can be ignored (s = 0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, the parameter s should be considered in biliary epithelial tissue growth because the biliary tree is expanding drastically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the total cell numbers were not maintained during the process. We also added another parameter, 'p', which represented the initial ratio of proliferating cells, as we found that there was a majority of quiescent cells in the BEC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>In general, a negative effect, such as the density effect, should be included in the simulation when a model for growth in a limited space is to be constructed. In our simulation, such a negative effect, which could potentially be caused by an overgrowth of BECs, was not incorporated. It is true that there must be a limit to BECs’ growth because they form a simple epithelial tissue and can only reside and expand within the liver of a certain size. However, within the period of 8 weeks of TAA injury, there still remained an empty space for BECs to grow and expand, and we observed that BECs continued to proliferate during the entire time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, we chose not to designate any parameter defining a density effect into our simulation. Such a parameter may become necessary if we are to simulate the growth of BECs at later time points, for example during the process of tumor formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Code availability</title><p>The program code is available at the following address.</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cytokine/research/simulation_code_ver_201.txt">http://www.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cytokine/research/simulation_code_ver_201.txt</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N Miyata for cell sorting, N Imaizumi for animal care, and the members of the Miyajima lab for helpful discussions and advice.

author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Heterogeneity and stochastic growth regulation of biliary epithelial cells dictate dynamic epithelial tissue remodeling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as Reviewing and Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. There are three major points that we wish you to address.</p><p>The first major point concerns the claim that the injury model is exclusively examining proliferation of BECs. The authors observe that there is no decrease in the Prom1 labeling index in the ductal reactions following TAA treatment (as compared to the initial index). They conclude from this that almost all of the BECs that arise during the ductal reaction come from pre-existing BECs. This would make TAA quite distinct from other injury models, such as DDC, carbon tetrachloride and CDE, in which a sizeable fraction of the ductal reaction cells are hepatocyte derived as shown in recent studies. In support of this claim, the authors report that they have done lineage tracing of hepatocytes using an adeno-associated virus – data that are being prepared for publication separately.</p><p>Because the unique features of this injury model are surprising and are important for the authors' conclusion that there is heterogeneity within the biliary compartment, it would provide additional confidence if this point were more carefully confirmed. For example, it is important to know that the system would be able to detect hepatocyte transdifferentiation into the biliary compartment if it were occurring. Hence, we recommend applying the Prom1 labeling system to an injury model associated with hepatocyte transdifferentiation (e.g. DDC) to ensure that a diminution in labeling index is seen – without this experiment, there is uncertainty about the claim that all of the biliary cells in the TAA model come from pre-existing BECs. It would also be helpful to supply the adeno-associated virus data to the reviewers. The presence of transdifferentiated BECs in the TAA ductal reaction would not negate the authors' conclusions, but it would represent a confounder that needs to be clarified.</p><p>The second major point pertains to the mathematical modeling, some of which supports the existence of a more proliferative subpopulation and some of which does not argue either way. The dual labeling experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggest that BECs do indeed exist in one of two states – proliferative vs. non-proliferative. On the other hand, the fact that the distribution of colony size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is non-Gaussian does not rule out the possibility that statistical variation could account for the presence of the large colonies. In terms of the observation that proliferating cells form larger colonies in the ductular than in the ductal compartment, have the authors envisaged the possibility that the length of the cell cycle differs in duct and ductule cells? In addition, the irreversible switch to a quiescent state does not seem to fit with the notion proposed by Spencer et al., namely that the balance between quiescence and proliferation is controlled after each cell cycle at the end of mitosis (Spencer et al. Cell, 155(2):369-832013). Could the authors discuss this issue?</p><p>Third, the Discussion is confusing when it comes to the distinction between stochastic and deterministic features of the system. The dual labeling experiments indicate that there are proliferative and non-proliferative subsets of BECs, suggesting a deterministic (intrinsic) property. However, if a few &quot;lucky&quot; clones have proliferated more to give rise to the large colonies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, this would suggest a stochastic (random variation) model of expansion. This section needs to be substantially re-written to be understandable by a general reader, particularly if the term stochastic growth regulation is to remain in the title.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15034.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>There are three major points that we wish you to address.</italic></p><p><italic>The first major point concerns the claim that the injury model is exclusively examining proliferation of BECs.

In response to this critical comment, we have decided to include in the revised manuscript the hepatocyte lineage tracing data. Briefly we labeled hepatocytes with rAAV2/8-iCre in R26R-tdTomato mice, which were then applied to DDC or TAA liver injury model. The data is shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, with previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> in the original version re-numbered as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> in the revised version.</p><p>From the hepatocyte lineage tracing data, we confirmed that a large number of hepatocytes began to express some biliary markers (Sox9, Spp1, and MIC1-1C3) in DDC model, while only a very small number of hepatocytes that expressed other biliary markers, CK19, EpCAM and Prom1. This result fits well with recent reports about the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary-like cells (Tanimizu et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2014; Tarlow et al., Cell Stem Cell, 2014). Here, we use the terms “hepPDs” and “bilPDs” that were originally coined by Tarlow et al. (Cell Stem Cell, 2014). They reported that hepatocyte-derived biliary-like cells, hepPDs, were able to be characterized as Sox9<sup>+</sup>, Spp1<sup>+</sup>, MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup>, but EpCAM<sup>-</sup>, CK19<sup>-</sup>, Prom1<sup>-</sup>. They also reported that pre-existing biliary cells that expand upon liver injury, bilPDs, are Sox9<sup>+</sup>, Spp1<sup>+</sup>, MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup>, and EpCAM<sup>+</sup>, CK19<sup>+</sup>, Prom1<sup>+</sup>. We re-analyzed and summarized their data on gene expression profiles in hepPDs, bilPDs and hepatocytes (GSE5552) in an additional figure for the referees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). The data clearly indicates phenotypic difference between hepPDs and bilPDs in terms of expression patterns of the aforementioned biliary markers. Importantly, our intent is not to deny the conversion (or trans-differentiation) of hepatocytes into biliary lineage, but to reiterate that previous reports and our results show that hepatocyte-derived biliary cells (hepPDs) are different from bilPDs derived from pre-existing biliary cells. Tarlow et al. showed hepPDs are different from bilPDs in terms of the ontogeny and gene expression profiles, and our data further supported this by showing that these populations were different from each other in terms of 3D structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). This means we can (and should) analyze the proliferative capacity of biliary cells that are derived from pre-existing biliary cells separately from those of hepatocytes-derived cells.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15034.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15034.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15034.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15034-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>While the results of the hepatocyte tracing experiments may serve as strong and more direct evidence supporting the authenticity of our experimental settings using TAA, in order to answer reviewers’ request, we nevertheless performed the suggested experiments that focus on labeling index with our BEC labeling system in DDC model. We have included data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>in the revised manuscript. Mice were administered tamoxifen (10 mg/mouse). In that condition, around 30% of EpCAM<sup>+</sup> BECs were labeled by the tdTomato reporter, and around 16% of MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> cells were labeled. Then mice were fed with DDC diet for 8 weeks. FACS analyses were performed to quantify the labeling rate of BECs before/after liver injury with two different BEC markers, EpCAM and MIC1-1C3. As expected, we did not find a decrease in labeling rate in EpCAM+ populations after DDC administration. We found tendency for the labeling rate in MIC1-1C3+ populations to be reduced, but were unable to confirm whether the observed difference was significant (N=2 for the normal and DDC conditions, respectively). The percentage of the MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> tdTomato<sup>+</sup> populations was: 16.4% and 15.7% for the normal condition (N=2); and, 14.4% and 15.3% for the DDC condition (N=2). Unfortunately, we did not have any more mice that were available for the analysis during the two-month period allowed for revision. Considering the relatively small contribution of the hepatocyte-derived cells to the entire MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> population upon DDC injury (1.88%, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript), the result is overall consistent with that of the hepatocyte lineage tracing data because most of hepatocyte-derived biliary cells (hepPDs) are MIC1-1C3<sup>+</sup> and EpCAM<sup>-</sup>.</p><p>In general, the studies about hepatocyte-biliary conversion may sometimes appear to be complicated and controversial. Nevertheless, we can explain our data and recent other reports logically and consistently when we carefully consider the expression profiles of various types of biliary epithelial cell markers. In the present study, we are focusing on bilPDs, rather than hepPDs, that form the main structural framework for ductular reaction.</p><p><italic>The second major point pertains to the mathematical modeling, some of which supports the existence of a more proliferative subpopulation and some of which does not argue either way.</italic></p><p>We agree that this point is really important for this study and apologize that our initial manuscript was not sufficiently clear. We have revised our description related to dual labeling experiment, single cell tracing, and simulation. Nevertheless, we think that the results of single cell tracing and mathematical model do not contradict the existence of proliferative state that was shown by dual labeling experiments.</p><p>In the dual labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the revised manuscript), we suggested that BECs could be divided into two types, proliferating cells and non-proliferating cells. The definition was based on statistic relationships of “two cell divisions” (1st labeling the and 2nd labeling). Thus, the term proliferative or non-proliferative refer to temporal state of cell division (two rounds of cell cycle), and we did not define the state, proliferative or quiescent, to be perpetually proliferating. From this experiment, we cannot make assumptions about the whole history of cell fate (that may contain large number of cell division) during colony formation in chronic liver injury periods by TAA. And importantly, there exists the possibility that proliferative cells could be changed into the non-proliferative state, though we do not know when this may occur. Thus, existence of proliferative state does not refute the stochastic model, and existence of temporal proliferative state does not simply mean the deterministic model. In order to generate a model that considers the whole history of cell divisions, we had to perform simulation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>The dual labeling experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggest that BECs do indeed exist in one of two states – proliferative vs. non-proliferative. On the other hand, the fact that the distribution of colony size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is non-Gaussian does not rule out the possibility that statistical variation could account for the presence of the large colonies.</italic></p><p>We apologize about this point and thank the referees for this critical comment. In our original manuscript, we wrote that non-Gaussian distribution means that the large colonies did not result from statistical variation. We admit, however, that it was an overstatement because some statistical variation can indeed make non-Gaussian distributions. We appreciate that the comment made our manuscript accurate. We have deleted that particular sentence in the revised manuscript, while the overall conclusion and concept of our study was not changed or affected.</p><p> <italic>In terms of the observation that proliferating cells form larger colonies in the ductular than in the ductal compartment, have the authors envisaged the possibility that the length of the cell cycle differs in duct and ductule cells?</italic></p><p>We found that most BECs in the ductal compartment remained as single or two cells after 8 weeks of liver injury. In addition, from Ki67 staining experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we found almost no Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in the ductal compartment. Thus we thought that BECs in ductal compartment remain quiescent (G0 phase) rather than undergoing a long cell cycle, because Ki67 is generally expressed in G1, S, G2 and M phases. Therefore, we believe the difference of colony size between ductular compartment and duct compartment was not due to difference of cell cycle length.</p><p>In mathematical simulation, we defined quiescent cells as those that do not divide at all. This means we do not need to consider their cell cycle length. On the other hand, we had to consider the cell cycle length of proliferative cells. We first ran many simulations with uniform cell cycle length for all cells. However, we found that the best fit was achieved when we allowed for variation of cell cycle length among the cells. The variation was defined as the parameter m (See Supplementary Methods for details). Interestingly, this result agrees with the notion proposed by Spencer et al. (Spencer et al. Cell, 155(2):369-383, 2013; which was suggested by the reviewers in the comment below). Briefly, the study confirmed by their single cell experimental system that there is a large cell-to-cell variation of cell cycles and delay between mitogen re-stimulation and CDK activation. They also reported that the cells had heterogeneous inter-mitotic times ranging from 20 hr to &gt;50 hr. This fits well with our stochastic proliferation model, because we defined our model to have various inter-mitotic times.</p><p><italic>In addition, the irreversible switch to a quiescent state does not seem to fit with the notion proposed by Spencer et al., namely that the balance between quiescence and proliferation is controlled after each cell cycle at the end of mitosis (Spencer et al. Cell, 155(2):369-832013). Could the authors discuss this issue?</italic></p><p>We appreciate notifying us an important and insightful report about cell proliferation. We have added some discussion referring to it in the revised manuscript. It is true that there is some discrepancy, as well as common points. We think the discrepancy may be due to the role of BECs in vivo. During tissue remodeling and tissue growth process of biliary epithelial cells, BECs must form a functional tubular structure. We assume that BECs must gain a sort of steady-state phenotype (or, become more matured and differentiated cells) in order to generate and maintain a functional and robust epithelial tubular structure. From this point of view, it is reasonable to assume that proliferation state changes irreversibly in vivo. Unfortunately, there is no established marker so far that can clearly distinguish different stages of BECs in the course of their functional differentiation and maturation, which prevented us from directly evaluating this possibility. Nevertheless, the assumption could be supported partially by our findings that revealed the relationship between the proliferative capacity of BECs and structural feature of the biliary tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), as BECs constituting different tissue structures may be in distinct differentiation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> in the revised manuscript). We have included discussion on this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Third, the Discussion is confusing when it comes to the distinction between stochastic and deterministic features of the system. The dual labeling experiments indicate that there are proliferative and non-proliferative subsets of BECs, suggesting a deterministic (intrinsic) property. However, if a few &quot;lucky&quot; clones have proliferated more to give rise to the large colonies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, this would suggest a stochastic (random variation) model of expansion. This section needs to be substantially re-written to be understandable by a general reader, particularly if the term stochastic growth regulation is to remain in the title.</italic></p><p>We deeply apologize that our Discussion appeared to be confusing and our definition of several words (proliferative, stochastic, and deterministic) might be obscure. We have re-written the Results and Discussion parts to be more clear, precise and understandable. We have also added clear definitions of words, especially conceptual words. We hope the re-defining and words revision make our concept clearer. Basically, our word definition is the same as that of a previous report (Doupe, et al., 2010). We showed the existence of proliferative and non-proliferative states in BECs, but this does not mean that they are deterministic. Here, deterministic refers to restriction of the cell to a state that is permanently fixed, while our finding about proliferative state is referring to temporal state, not to the eventual cell fate. In our model, “switching” of their proliferative state is important.</p><p>The concept of stochastic model does not refute the existence of a proliferative sub population. Cells can be classified into two distinct proliferative states, which can switch in a stochastic manner. We had chosen the concept of “stochastic” for our model in order to explain the heterogeneity of proliferative capacity (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in the revised version) accounting for the existence of transient proliferative sub states (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the revised version). In other words, the stochastic feature of biliary cell proliferation was necessary (and sufficient) to explain our data simultaneously. We have emended explanations in main manuscript about our mathematical modeling and feature of “stochastic cell behavior”. The above description in response to the second major point would also be the answer to solve the discrepancy between the results about dual labeling and colony size distributions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
