Here we introduce the host insect as an expedient model environment for microswimmer research, as it allows examination of microbial motion within a diversified, secluded and yet microscopically tractable space. During their week-long journey through the different microenvironments of the fly´s interior organs, the incessantly swimming trypanosomes cross various barriers and confined surroundings, with concurrently occurring major changes of parasite cell architecture. Multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy provided information about tsetse tissue topology with unprecedented resolution and allowed the first 3D analysis of the infection process. High-speed fluorescence microscopy illuminated the versatile behaviour of trypanosome developmental stages, ranging from solitary motion and near-wall swimming to collective motility in synchronised swarms and in confinement. We correlate the microenvironments and trypanosome morphologies to high-speed motility data, which paves the way for cross-disciplinary microswimmer research in a naturally evolved environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27656.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27656.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma</italic></kwd><kwd>tsetse fly</kwd><kwd>microswimmer</kwd><kwd>sleeping sickness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN 305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK 2157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Trypanosome development within the transmitting tsetse fly reveals essential adaptations of microbial motility to diverse physical microenvironments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microswimmers have intrigued the scientific mind since the very first observations of bacteria, protists and spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobell, 1932</xref>). More than 300 years ago, Leeuwenhoek not only observed free swimming organisms, but also studied ´animalcules´ from animal and human environments, especially the fate of spermatozoa in the female genital tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leeuwenhoek, 1685</xref>). Still, to the present day, model systems for the study of microswimmers in their natural habitats are few and far between. Spermatozoa are <italic>the</italic> model microswimmers, due to their availability as free swimming cells and their importance for sexual reproduction. The significance of the physical properties of the female genital tract for sperm motility and internal fertilisation success has been recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fauci and Dillon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirkman-Brown and Smith, 2011</xref>), but this system naturally remains challenging for in vivo analysis.</p><p>Another major microswimmer model is <italic>E. coli</italic>. The rotating prokaryotic flagellar apparatus has been intensively studied, mainly in order to unravel the mechanisms of chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Micali and Endres, 2016</xref>). Recently, there is great interest in the collective behaviour of prokaryotes and the implications of real life surroundings, as cells seldom stay alone or move without encountering mechanical obstructions for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaban et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Persat et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, bacterial collectives constitute relevant ecosystems themselves, that is as biofilms or intestinal microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Jacob et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The third major group of natural microswimmers are the eukaryotic ciliates and flagellates. Several free swimming protists, pre-eminently the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, have been used as model organisms during the last century, for the analysis of phototaxis, ultrastructural characterisation of the axonemal system and analysis of intraflagellar transport, to name only a few important topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simon and Plattner, 2014</xref>). Again, the relevance of these organisms in their natural habitats is only recently being fully appreciated, as integrated efforts to analyse the huge global diversity of free swimming protists on the one hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>) and to elucidate the mechanisms of unicellular parasites in their host system on the other hand, are under way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krüger and Engstler, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The life cycles of important parasitic protists, including the agents of malaria, Chaga´s disease and African sleeping sickness have been recognised since the late nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leadbeater and McCready, 2000</xref>). African trypanosomes were amongst the first blood parasites to be observed ‘…, wriggling about like tiny eels and swimming from corpuscle to corpuscle, which they seem to seize upon and worry.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruce et al., 1895</xref>). The flagellates were found in blood, tissues and cerebrospinal fluid of various animal species and humans, and their full developmental cycle, involving transmission by the tsetse fly vector, was subsequently described (summarised in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steverding, 2008</xref>]).</p><p>Since then, trypanosomes have become important model organisms, due to their medical importance and fascinating cell biology, including distinctive genetic features and multifaceted developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoare, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matthews, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vickerman et al., 1988</xref>). Although trypanosomes have always fascinated as microswimmers, the exact swimming mechanism of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> has only recently been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>). The parasite is unusual among the flagellates, as the greater part of the flagellum is attached to the cell body, winding around it in a helical course. The flagellum produces waves from both ends of the elastic cell body, which let the cells tumble and twist, producing the wriggling or corkscrew-like trypanosome movement, typically observed in culture media or blood smears. Importantly, the mechanical parameters of the surroundings, that is fluid viscosity or presence of obstacles, influence the parasite’s motile behaviour, affecting the frequency ratio of bidirectional flagellar beating and inducing persistent unidirectional movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, trypanosomes seem to have evolved to be highly versatile swimmers, adapted to react flexibly to different mechanical properties of various microenvironments. This became clear, when the characteristic motility behaviours of different trypanosome species were analysed under changing physical conditions. The parasites exhibited a species-specific dynamic adjustment of motile behaviour to various physical surroundings, which could correlate with their preferred infection niches within their mammalian hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>). The importance of specific niches during infection has been recognised and is currently being scrutinised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caljon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As the interest of biological and especially physical research is focusing on collective swimming behaviour and the influence of borders and confinement, accessible and controllable in vitro and in vivo systems are in demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>). The long-term goal is to pave the way for multidisciplinary explanations of dynamic behaviour in complex living systems. To this effect we describe here the first enclosed host-parasite system that is amenable to highly detailed analysis of diverse microswimmers in defined microenvironments.</p><p>Trypanosomes are transmitted to and from their mammalian host by insect vectors. <italic>T. brucei</italic> is taken up by the tsetse fly during a blood meal, whereupon the parasites undergo a complex developmental cycle, while traversing various organs of the tsetse´s alimentary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ooi and Bastin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013</xref>). The development involves several genetically fixed physiological changes, allowing the adaptation to significantly different host compartments and striking morphological changes, which greatly influence motile behaviour. Motility is necessary for successful infection and transmission back to the mammalian host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rotureau et al., 2014</xref>) and might be of paramount importance for passing several ‘bottlenecks’ in trypanosome development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We consider the trypanosome-tsetse system as particularly attractive for studying flagellate microswimmers in their natural habitats. The small size of the insect allows measurements of trypanosome swimming behaviour at very different scales, ranging from the observation of all parasites in whole flies to single cell analyses with high spatiotemporal resolution. As we show in this work, the system´s motile occupants exhibit all kinds of behaviour posing prevailing questions in microswimmer research on the one hand, and having possible implications for the cell and developmental biology of the parasites on the other hand. This also means potential insight into the evolution of host-microbe systems and infection processes, and therefore further creation of bridges between physical and biological research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy reveals the complex three-dimensional architecture of the microswimmer habitats in the tsetse vector</title><p>In order to make the trypanosome-tsetse system experimentally accessible, we first detailed the in vivo boundary conditions that could influence the motile behaviour of the different developmental stages of <italic>T. brucei</italic> within the tsetse alimentary tract. For this purpose, we adapted light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to map the tsetse fly´s internal topology. This technology allowed us to record high resolution optical sections of complete fly body parts and generate three-dimensional reconstructions of intact tissues. Multicolour LSFM simultaneously localised epithelial tissues via autofluorescence, the peritrophic matrix (PM) through rhodamine-labelled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and the infecting trypanosomes by GFP-expression in the nucleus. The PM is a non-cellular, glycosaminoglycan, glycoprotein and chitin containing, cylindrical sleeve, that continuously lines the gut epithelium and acts as a physical barrier for pathogens ingested within the blood meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lehane et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lehane, 1997</xref>).</p><p>To gain an overview of the fly´s intact digestive tract, the head, legs and wings were removed before preparation of the remaining body for light sheet microscopy by an adapted clearing procedure, which renders the insect cuticle and organs translucent.

The sustainment of the fly body is apparent in a surface rendering model of the autofluorescent cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The PM was folded extensively, producing a multitude of channels, folds and crevices, thereby increasing the absolute surface area. The diameter and thus the surface area of the sleeve significantly increased towards the posterior part of the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), allowing the PM to adapt to the extreme swelling of the gut during a blood meal.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27656.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy details the highly convoluted peritrophic matrix within the tsetse midgut.</title><p>Fly midguts were surgically removed 1–2 days after the last meal.

For this purpose, we infected flies with trypanosomes constitutively expressing fluorescent proteins either in the nucleus, the flagellum (EGFP) or the cytoplasm (tdTomato). We confirmed the developmental progress of the fluorescent protein-expressing pleomorphic AnTat1.1 cell lines through all morphological stages, including the final production of mammalian-infective stages (metacyclic form, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> - <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> - <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In order to generate a map of the characteristic infection process from the posterior midgut to the proventriculus, we analysed these organs, removed from flies at different time points after infection, with trypanosomes expressing a cytoplasmic fluorescent marker protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The amount and location of trypanosomes was evaluated in defined sub-regions of several digestive tracts, prepared and recorded in an identical manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A spatiotemporal map of the mean abundance of parasites shows the characteristic establishment of an early posterior midgut infection, the diminishing of populations between days four and six and the invasion of the anterior midgut and the proventriculus from day seven on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). After days six to seven, the transmission of the parasites depends on developmental stages that cross the PM and colonise the ectoperitrophic space to migrate to the foregut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson and Bailey, 2003</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27656.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Trypanosome midgut infections can be monitored dynamically and with single parasite resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map of the early infection process, analysed by the amount of fluorescent trypanosomes in different areas: proventriculus (PV), anterior midgut (AMG) and posterior midgut (PMG).

Therefore, in order to extend the trypanosome morphotype analysis to living cells, we had previously introduced the concept of a dynamic cellular waveform, which describes the propagation of each flagellar wave along the elastic trypanosome cell body and the resulting deformation of the microswimmer along the time axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>).

Trypanosomes were isolated from different organs of flies infected for at least 20 days, their entire cell body and flagellar membrane were fluorescently labelled, their nuclei and kinetoplasts were stained with DAPI and the cells were rapidly fixed. The labelled trypanosomes were microscopically imaged in order to construct 3D-volume models, which allowed the flagellum to be traced. The data was further used to generate surface-models, which allowed the course of the traced flagellum along and around the body surface to be visualised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27656.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>High-resolution 3D-morphometry of all trypanosome life cycle stages.</title><p>Trypanosomes were isolated from infected tsetse flies (<bold>A–G</bold>) or mice (<bold>H–I</bold>). The cell surface was fluorescently labelled with a sulfo-NHS dye (red) and the cell nuclei and kinetoplasts were labelled with DAPI (cyan). In the left panel, representative 3D-volume models of surface-labelled parasites are shown. The right panel presents the corresponding 3D surface models, with the cell body in grey and the attached flagellum in yellow or orange. Scale bar: 10 µm. Procyclic cells (<bold>A</bold>) exhibit a 180° right hand turn of the flagellum around the cell body. Long procyclic cells (<bold>B</bold>) are larger than normal procyclics, but reveal the same characteristic flagellar attachment. Mesocyclic cells (<bold>C</bold>) show a more elongated cell body and a straighter flagellar attachment, also fulfilling a 180° flagellar turn, but lack a free flagellar tip. During the transformation from mesocyclic to epimastigote cells (<bold>D</bold>), the nucleus elongates and moves posterior, and the cytoplasm at the anterior tip retracts. After repositioning, the epimastigote cell begins cell division, with the kinetoplast duplicating first (E1, 2K1N configuration). The orange flagellum represents the new flagellum of the adolescent short epimastigote daughter cell. Shortly before cytokinesis, the dividing epimastigote cell (E2, 2K2N configuration) shows an almost sperm-like appearance. The short epimastigote cell (<bold>F</bold>) resulting from this division has a thin, straight cell body with an extremely reduced flagellum protruding from the anterior end. Infective metacyclic cells (<bold>G</bold>) in contrast, have a curly appearance with a 180° turn of the flagellum, which originates from the posterior end.

The panel in the middle is a model of the outline for one single flagellar beat analysed frame by frame. The frames were stacked along the time axis in a three-dimensional surface representation, which allows the visualisation of the cellular waveform produced by the flagellum and the cell body in two different views. The flagellar tip was highlighted in blue. The model shows the travelling waves running along the cell body in a top-diagonal view and one wavelength of the flagellar beat in the view of the anterior tip. The frequency (Hz) of the analysed flagellar beat is shown on the right. Procyclic cells (<bold>A</bold>) and long procyclic cells (<bold>B</bold>) show similar waveform patterns, although the long procyclic cells generally swim faster. Mesocyclic cells (<bold>C</bold>) show a characteristic waveform due to their small amplitude during flagellar beating. When they start differentiating from mesocyclic to epimastigote cells (<bold>D</bold>), the amplitude increases again with a higher frequency and cells gain more speed. Dividing epimastigote cells (2K2N) (<bold>E</bold>) have proven to be the fastest swimmers of tsetse fly stages. Short epimastigote cells (<bold>F</bold>) are weak swimmers, despite beat frequencies similar to procyclic cells, due to their lack of a free flagellum.

The fly vector microswimmers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–G</xref>) were compared to the two main bloodstream forms (BSF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>None of the life cycle stages revealed an undulating membrane, which corroborates the finding that propulsion of bloodstream form trypanosomes is solely accomplished by flagellar beating according to resistive force theory, because the membranes of flagellum and cell body are directly adjacent and do not form an extended, fin-like appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>). The procyclic trypanosomes (PCF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) develop in the gut lumen from the cell cycle arrested stumpy BSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Compared to the bloodstream forms, the procyclic cells have elongated and thinned considerably. The posterior end is more pointed and the distance of the flagellar pocket from this end has increased by several micrometres. The flagellum describes a 180° right hand turn around the cell body progressing towards the anterior end. This is similar to the flagellar course in BSF, but as the flagellar pocket is located further anterior, the flagellum wraps around the cell body at a more anterior position. These characteristics of PCF morphology result in the seemingly ‘flipping’ forward swimming movement observed in high speed videos, as the relatively stiff posterior end is not deformed by the flagellar wave. The rotation frequency of procyclic parasites is similar to that of BSF cells, albeit the rotation is easier to observe in the latter as the flagellar wave travels to the posterior end and deforms the whole length of the elastic cell body, giving BSF swimmers a smoother appearing auger-like trajectory, which was eponymous for the parasite.</p><p>The ´long procyclic´ cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> represent a transitional state, whose morphology approaches the mesocyclic type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Note that morphology does not discriminate between early and late procyclic forms expressing different surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knüsel and Roditi, 2013</xref>). For the purpose of this work, we have explicitly analysed the morphologically distinct transition stages and their characteristic behaviour as microswimmers in their distinctive environment. The long procyclic trypanosomes isolated from the flies had elongated and thinned further, without changing the attachment conformation of the flagellum.</p><p>Both procyclic cell types revealed similar cellular waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The long procyclic trypanosomes maintain a slightly higher frequency and amplitude of flagellar oscillation. Additionally, the traveling flagellar wave seems not to be dampened by the posterior end of the cell body as strongly as in the shorter cell. This could be the result of the slightly thinner and more flexible posterior cell end. Together with the increased absolute length of the flagellum, these parameters allow the long procyclic to reach more than double the speed of the shorter form.</p><p>The development of cell cycle-arrested mesocyclic cells is characterised by the disappearance of the free flagellar part at the anterior end, due to further elongation of the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The nucleus had moved further away from the kinetoplast to keep its position roughly in the cell centre. Altogether the cells had a flattened and straight appearance, which coincides with the 180° flagellar turn around the cell being stretched over a longer distance, that is the flagellum spirals around the cell body with a smaller helix angle. Due to the thicker anterior cytoplasmic part, the flagellum often seemed to be able to turn further around the cell body, almost completing a 360° turn.</p><p>The transition to the cellular waveform of mesocyclic cells is characterised by a switch to traveling waves of smaller amplitude and wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Despite constant beat frequency and further increased flagellar length, swimming speed is slightly reduced. The cellular waveform coincides with the anteriorly extended cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The lack of a free anterior part of the flagellum is most likely responsible for the characteristic change of waveform and results in very straight swimming trajectories.</p><p>The transformation of mesocyclic cells into epimastigote forms occurs by a continuous repositioning of the cell nucleus from the anterior to the posterior side of the kinetoplast, followed by re-entry into the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoare and Wallace, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>). The cytoplasm is also continuously reduced, finally leaving the flagellum all but free and the epimastigote microswimmer with an almost sperm-like appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). During the transition from mesocyclic to epimastigote parasites, a continuously larger part of the anterior flagellum protrudes, which results in higher amplitude waves being initiated by the free flagellar tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). While the flagellar length only increases slightly, the beat frequency doubles, allowing the transition stages to reach speeds above 100 µm/s.</p><p>The epimastigotes possess a virtually completely free flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), producing large amplitude waves that travel unhindered to the posterior cell body, enabling to be pulled at speeds well above 100 µm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Cell division is rapidly initiated in epimastigote trypanosomes with the kinetoplast dividing first. The epimastigote cell divides asymmetrically to produce a long and a short epimastigote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The short epimastigote cells are characterised by a rudimentary flagellum attached anteriorly to a thin and stiff cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>). The flagellum is capable of regular oscillation and persistent movement, but the cell does not reach speeds above 10 µm/s, as there is no appreciable travelling wave propagated. Persistent movement is also not sustained in most cells. Thus, within one cell cycle, a very capable microswimmer produces an almost immotile parasite.</p><p>Metacyclic parasites reveal trypomastigote morphology, as the nucleus has repositioned to the anterior side of the kinetoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). They swim freely in the saliva and represent the infective form that is pre-adapted to survive in the mammalian host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otieno and Darji, 1979</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). The cell body appears elastic and is deformed in the shape of the flagellar waveform. The flagellum emerges at the very posterior end and has once more adopted the right hand 180° turn around the cell body. The final insect stage, once more represents a very different type of microswimmer. The effect of the changed morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) on swimming behaviour is immediately obvious in the visualisation of the metacyclic cellular waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The elastic cell body deforms and oscillates with the attached flagellum. The flagellar tip produces waves of high amplitude with frequencies similar to procyclic parasites. A travelling wave propagates along the cell body, but the steep chiral course of the attached flagellum produces relatively high rotational forces, which result in a contracted cellular waveform, reducing forward swimming speed. Following transmission to the mammalian host, the metacylic stage differentiates to the slender bloodstream stage.

The impressive synchronisation of large groups of densely packed, oscillating cells raised the question if this behaviour was driven by quorum sensing, that is by chemical cues, or by hydrodynamic self-organisation processes.

The topology of folds and sheets of the PM seen in top view (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8C</xref>) could thus be compared with the 3D-views to allow a better understanding of the smooth confining structures the trypanosomes were swimming in and along (see below). Importantly, the spatial information gathered by LSFM yielded a quantitative assessment of the confinement states the parasites experience. Solitary swimmers were wrapped in single folded sheets, while co-resident collective assemblies of various sizes were identified between the PM sheets or between PM and the gut tissue. The precise three-dimensional maps allow mathematic analyses of the degrees of confinement and connectivity within the PM maze. The resultant data forms the basis for numerical simulations of single and collective swimming in this natural system of microchannels and crevices. In the living tsetse fly, the PM is not static but is dynamically folded and expanded during the digestion process. Although this initially means an impediment to microscopic analysis, LSFM approaches for rapid live microscopy will be available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heddleston and Chew, 2016</xref>) and the ability to record living microswimmers in such a complex, dynamic system will be an asset.</p><p>The LSFM measurements also allowed instructive visualisations of the intact, parasite-infested proventriculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The localisation of the proventricular trypanosome population revealed marked parasite concentration gradients along intact internal regions of the proventriculus. Again, these data extend the conventional views of trypanosome infestation in these organs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yorke et al., 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson and Bailey, 2003</xref>).</p><p>For live cell analysis by high-speed differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, the flies were cautiously dissected, without destroying the basic inner organisation of the trypanosome infested tissues. We frequently observed single parasites swimming along the extended walls of the PM. Microbe-surface interactions attract considerable attention because of their importance for sperm cells and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">et al., 1963</xref>). Sperm demonstrate a spiralling swimming trajectory that is modified by hydrodynamic and steric interactions at boundaries, resulting in rheotactic movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kantsler et al., 2014</xref>) or surface slithering, which might be beneficial under certain microenvironmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nosrati et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the procyclic to mesocyclic trypanosome morphotypes appear to be adapted to swimming forwards in straight trajectories, which hardly change through contact with the PM. Near-wall motion could rather be guiding the cells by influencing the persistence of forward movement, as the trypanosomes can readily reverse the direction of flagellar waves and perform turning manoeuvres (e.g. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7C</xref>). If space is further restricted, the trypanosomes either reverse flagellar waves and back out of the confined space, or they perform sharp turns of the elastic cell body in order to leave the space by the default forward modus (e.g. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Videos 8A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">9C</xref>). All in all, trypanosomes arguably have a higher degree of control in navigating along walls and through confined spaces than sperm or bacteria.</p><p>When trypanosomes reach dead ends, the flagellum continues beating with constant frequency, and synchronisation of flagellar oscillations can be observed in groups of just few cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8A–C</xref>) or in massive parasite clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Videos 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">10</xref>). Hydrodynamic synchronisation is a well-known phenomenon between sperm flagella ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) and leads to higher order swarm behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Immler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Riedel et al., 2005</xref>). The tsetse system allows the observation of all grades of collective accumulation, as distinct regions of the fly gut harbour different parasite concentrations. The propensity to synchronise is dependent on specific developmental forms, allowing the study of variations on swarming behaviour with changing morphologies. The trypanosomes add a further feature, as their reverse swimming ability allows single swimmers to leave the collectives. Parasite assemblies of identical cell densities can exhibit synchronised swimming behaviour or nematic organisation. They can be located in immediate vicinity, often in a single field of view. In the same area, spaces with freely swimming individual cells are detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We have generated fluorescent parasites, in order to identify single trypanosomes in densely populated organs and tissues of the fly and demonstrate possibilities for quantitative tracking of cell nuclei and individual flagella, resolving cell motility to single flagellar beats.</p><p>Thus, using the tsetse-trypanosome system, we now have the so far unique ability to track single microswimmers of distinct developmentally regulated morphotypes within their natural microenvironments. The natural habitat poses an important challenge though, as it will be necessary to elucidate the relevant physiochemical states prevailing for the parasite’s developmental progression, in order to eventually establish complementary in vitro studies. As this system has naturally evolved, it is per definition complex and needs to be partly abstracted or deconstructed in order to challenge results with adjustable experimental parameters. For this purpose microfluidic systems have been established, especially for the analysis of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu and Dekker, 2016</xref>) and sperm research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knowlton et al., 2015</xref>). Used mainly for biotechnological applications, few studies have focussed on microswimming and the elucidation of natural environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hochstetter and Pfohl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stellamanns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uppaluri et al., 2012</xref>). A major approach to simulating natural environments is seen in research on artificial microswimmers, where both the motile components and the confinement conditions can be controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katuri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The tsetse system can efficiently bridge in vivo analyses and artificial in vitro systems. We have shown that many aspects of the natural environment can be described with sufficient precision to be mimicked by microfluidic structures. Furthermore, we can isolate any natural developmental stage directly from the tsetse fly and study it in vitro, directly following in vivo analysis. We have detailed on the three-dimensional morphologies of all microswimmer types and their dynamic cellular waveforms, which gives us a realistic assessment of the cellular preconditions for distinctive motile behaviour. This data is not only invaluable for deducing the swimming mechanism of a cell in a certain hydrodynamic or confined environment, including interactions with neighbouring cells. It also allows the development of quantitative mathematic models, as we have previously shown in advanced numerical simulations of BSF trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alizadehrad et al., 2015</xref>). The predictive power, especially of multi-particle collision dynamics simulations, is underlined by the fact that the experimentally measured morphology of the mesocyclic stage agrees with the earlier in silico model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alizadehrad et al., 2015</xref>): the angle of the helical flagellar course around the mesocyclic cell body was predicted to be shallower than that of the BSF (or the procyclic form, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A or I</xref>).</p><p>The overall aim of this work was to introduce a tractable in vivo microswimmer system and demonstrate the resolution and the precision of the methods available for studies therein. Due to the broad scope of the work, the quantitative data is necessarily exemplary. For most future analyses, reference frames need to be defined, for example in the just mentioned detailed examination of the helix angle of the trypanosome´s attached flagellum, which constitutes a screw-like body, the conformation of the elastic cell body needs to described in a local, dynamic coordinate system. The dynamic characterisation of body axes in such a system also directly impacts the evaluation of motility-dependence on the flexibility of the cells interior microtubule corset. The interplay between cell body and flagellum generally needs to be taken into account for morphometry, for example in the search of an elusive resting state.</p><p>Another reference system to be described for quantitative microswimmer analysis, is the immediate vicinity of the trypanosome, combining the physical parameters of viscosity and flow of the surrounding fluid, as well as the degree and topology of confinement. Therefore, a straightforward parameter like median swimming speed turned out to be not instructive, instead we regard the maximum speed of a given morphotype as the most valuable parameter for assessing swimming capabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Surprisingly, the flagellar beat frequencies were relatively constant in most cells of one type, suggesting that the specific morphology of the cell plays a role in defining basic parameters of flagellar beating. The physical factors of the surrounding environment then impact on this beating pattern and determine absolute speed and direction of movement. These results are in agreement with those obtained in the analysis of different trypanosome species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krüger and Engstler, 2016</xref>), underlining the general relevance of our observations.</p><p>The results also have implications for fundamental models of flagellar beating. The suggested impact of the cell body´s properties on flagellar beating is consistent with a model of axonemal wave propagation control by mechanical bending forces, that is the geometric clutch hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindemann and Lesich, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindemann, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">1994b</xref>). In this model, dynein activity, causative of the curvature of flagella and cilia, is primarily controlled by mechanical forces acting transverse to the longitudinal arrangement of microtubules. In the case of the trypanosome flagellum, the attachment to the cell body would provide a permanent mechanical resistant force controlling the basic flagellar waveform. On the other hand, the mechanical forces exerted by the environment should also have a direct impact on beat regulation, which we are primed to quantitatively analyse in microfluidic systems.</p><p>In fact, such analyses with tsetse fly trypanosomes directly follow already mentioned experimental setups used to assess the reaction of mammalian trypanosomes to mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heddergott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>). Here, micropillar arrays were designed to mimic the microenvironment of the bloodstream and high-speed, single cell analysis allowed the direct observation of the trypanosomes behaviour upon mechanical resistance. The design of such microfluidic devices is readily adapted, in order to create topologies mimicking the microenvironments described in this work. Thus, hypotheses on hydrodynamically controlled behaviour in certain compartments in the fly, for example, can be directly tested in the corresponding nature-inspired microflow chamber. We envisage producing such structures with elastic materials, which would allow the controlled application of forces on a confined population of parasites. In this way, interesting collective behaviour like the observed switching into synchronised flocks could be analysed.</p><p>In the next step, the microfluidic devices would be connected to pump systems, in order to evaluate the behaviour of the parasites to hydrodynamic flow. Controlled flow regimes would be compared with in vivo measurements, using fluorescent beads together with fluorescent cell lines in tracking experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). Using the combination of flexible microfluidic devices and reversible microfluidic pump systems, even the analysis of peristaltic effects seems in reach.</p><p>Finally, the analysis of microswimmers in a biological system should be conducive to the elucidation of the patho-functional relevance of motile behaviour of specific parasite types. Motility data will help explain unresolved development processes, for example the journey of epimastigotes to the salivary glands or the crossing of the PM. Here, we have focused on the procyclic to mesocyclic stages, as these morphotypes showed prominent synchronisation of flagellar beats and spontaneously formed clusters. The collective microswimmers produce significant forces, capable of moving tissues, thus raising the questions of what influence the amazing numbers of parasites accumulating in the fly have on the surrounding microenvironment and on the trapped cells themselves.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Trypanosome strain und culture</title><p>For this study the pleomorphic trypanosome strain EATRO 1125 (serodeme AnTat1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Ray et al., 1977</xref>) was used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Charles Lindemann (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors employed cutting-edge light microscopy methods including multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy and high speed video microscopy to provide a detailed description of the Tsetse fly alimentary tract tissue topology. They went on and scrutinized the cell morphology and swimming behaviours of the different life cycle stages of the Trypanosoma brucei parasites that navigate through these natural microenvironments. The &quot;tour de force&quot; of this work resides in the unprecedented 3D reconstruction of the host digestive system and visualization of the location of parasites as infection progresses through the morphing stages of the parasite and through the anatomy of the host at an unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.</p><p>This system enables important future hypothesis-driven research ranging from the basic biology of an important parasite to systems-level description of micro swimmer behaviours.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction and the Discussion are heavily skewed to making a case that the importance of the work is to provide a platform or model system for computational biology of microswimmers. The microenvironments and the complex morphology of this system do not readily lend themselves to the simplification that is typically needed for mathematical modeling. This is not considered as a system of choice given the numerous variables that difficult to control and hard to simulate. The authors would do better to focus both introduction and discussion on the novel findings of their own report, which are considerable.</p><p>2) The study revealed interesting patterns of solitary and collective motion and reports rapid switching between synchronized and &quot;chaotic&quot; motion of cells in the ectoperitrophic space of the midgut. On this latter point, the authors raise the question whether synchronization of cell behaviour was driven by chemical cues or by hydrodynamic self-organisation. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is interpreted as &quot;unambiguous&quot; (subsection “Self-organisation of parasites by hydrodynamic interaction”, fourth paragraph) evidence for the latter. The basis for this conclusion is not entirely clear. The authors say a chemical process would &quot;generally be slower&quot; (first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection) and it would be helpful if they could be more precise about the difference in time scales so that the cell behaviour in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref> can be assessed against these expectations.</p><p>3) Despite the stunning quality of the images and videos produced the study does not actually reveal anything new about the tsetse-trypanosome interaction. Even the &quot;astonishing degree of convolution&quot; of the peritrophic matrix (PM) (subsection “Multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy reveals the complex three-dimensional architecture of the microswimmer habitats in the tsetse vector”, third paragraph and Discussion, third paragraph) has been described previously, including data on its dimensions, as it collapses when water from the bloodmeal is excreted. The claim for priority is unfounded: &quot;This was a surprising finding, which allowed a first realistic view into an important environmental compartment for the procyclic and mesocyclic stages of <italic>T. brucei</italic>.&quot; Entomologists in the last century were well aware of this e.g. Wigglesworth (1929). The authors are referring to cartoons of the PM: &quot;a simple hollow sleeve as mostly depicted in the literature&quot;. Incidentally, the description of the PM as &quot;a chitinous sleeve&quot; is also inaccurate, as it contains a lot of protein as well as chitin. A comprehensive coverage of the literature is a prerequisite.</p><p>4) The authors justify the study as a prelude to investigating &quot;what physical and biological constraints the versatile trypanosome microswimmers experience in the vast and multifaceted environment of their insect host&quot;, but it is not clear what hypotheses they would test in future studies. They claim that the tsetse microenvironment offers a tractable model system for studying microswimmers, but the tsetse milieu is not static, changing both in terms of its own movements – peristalsis of the alimentary tract and salivary glands – and in terms of the chemical environment as the infected bloodmeal is digested and further bloodmeals are taken. Comparison with controlled microfluidic environments may be more informative, e.g. to explore why trypanosomes change from synchronized to chaotic swimming (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27656.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The Introduction and the Discussion are heavily skewed to making a case that the importance of the work is to provide a platform or model system for computational biology of microswimmers.

Therefore, we have now removed the redundant mentions of the model character of our work and focus more on the biological impact. Nevertheless, the intention of the study was primarily to introduce the tsetse vector as an enclosed and tractable system as a whole, for studying the natural complexity of microswimmer interactions with/in highly intricate environments. It is true that today the system is by far too little understood to allow mathematical modelling in its entirety. But we can learn from the fly. For example, we have been able to model the swimming behaviour of the different morphotypes, and we have identified in vivo motion patterns that can be modelled, e.g., the near-wall swimming of mesocyclic parasites along the peritrophic membrane (see also our reply to comment 4).</p><p><italic>2) The study revealed interesting patterns of solitary and collective motion and reports rapid switching between synchronized and &quot;chaotic&quot; motion of cells in the ectoperitrophic space of the midgut. On this latter point, the authors raise the question whether synchronization of cell behaviour was driven by chemical cues or by hydrodynamic self-organisation. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is interpreted as &quot;unambiguous&quot; (subsection “Self-organisation of parasites by hydrodynamic interaction”, fourth paragraph) evidence for the latter. The basis for this conclusion is not entirely clear. The authors say a chemical process would &quot;generally be slower&quot; (first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection) and it would be helpful if they could be more precise about the difference in time scales so that the cell behaviour in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref> can be assessed against these expectations.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, the text was imprecise; “unambiguous” was referring to the fact that there is no evidence of cell attachment and that hydrodynamic interactions are most likely. We have rephrased and clarified the paragraph, including the direct comparison to the very limited data there is available regarding time scales of potential chemotactic behaviour in trypanosomes:</p><p>“It should be noted, that the timescale of a few seconds observed here for collective organisational status change is significantly smaller than the shortest known timescale of potential chemotactic behaviour in trypanosomes, which is at least several minutes (Oberholzer et al., 2010). Although chemical signals will undoubtedly be relevant for rapid fluctuations of flagellar beating, an adaptive reaction system required for directed behaviour of parasite swarms is unlikely to be responsible for establishing the switching behaviour observed in our experiments.”</p><p><italic>3) Despite the stunning quality of the images and videos produced the study does not actually reveal anything new about the tsetse-trypanosome interaction. Even the &quot;astonishing degree of convolution&quot; of the peritrophic matrix (PM) (subsection “Multicolour light sheet fluorescence microscopy reveals the complex three-dimensional architecture of the microswimmer habitats in the tsetse vector”, third paragraph and Discussion, third paragraph) has been described previously, including data on its dimensions, as it collapses when water from the bloodmeal is excreted.

Incidentally, the description of the PM as &quot;a chitinous sleeve&quot; is also inaccurate, as it contains a lot of protein as well as chitin. A comprehensive coverage of the literature is a prerequisite.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this important comment, especially the Wigglesworth reference, which we have now cited. Furthermore, we have screened the literature for more information on the convolution of the PM, however, could not find better data than provided by Wigglesworth (1929) and maybe Yorke (1933). In fact, most publications describe the PM only as a continuous, hollow sleeve or tube. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion with the most relevant citations:</p><p>“This distension of the PM upon feeding and the extensive folding after excretion of liquid has been described elegantly in early work on Glossina (Wigglesworth, 1929). […] Studies were undertaken to establish the composition and the role of the PM in trypanosome infection, especially addressing the question how and where the parasites manage to cross this barrier, but data was focussed on detail regions of the matrix, mostly displaying single folds and necessarily in 2D (e.g. Hoare, 1931; Yorke et al., 1933; Willett, 1966; Moloo et al., 1970; Ellis and Evans, 1977; Gibson and Bailey, 2003).”</p><p>We have rephrased &quot;a chitinous sleeve&quot; to:</p><p>“non-cellular, glycosaminoglycan, glycoprotein and chitin containing, cylindrical sleeve”</p><p>Our work provides, among other things, a detailed 3D-topological map of the geometry of the convoluted PM. We show the distribution of the parasites in the folds and we reveal the motion pattern of the trypanosomes in their natural environment. We would like to believe these aspects and the combination thereof are of considerable novelty.</p><p><italic>4) The authors justify the study as a prelude to investigating &quot;what physical and biological constraints the versatile trypanosome microswimmers experience in the vast and multifaceted environment of their insect host&quot;, but it is not clear what hypotheses they would test in future studies. They claim that the tsetse microenvironment offers a tractable model system for studying microswimmers, but the tsetse milieu is not static, changing both in terms of its own movements – peristalsis of the alimentary tract and salivary glands – and in terms of the chemical environment as the infected bloodmeal is digested and further bloodmeals are taken. Comparison with controlled microfluidic environments may be more informative, e.g. to explore why trypanosomes change from synchronized to chaotic swimming (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>).</italic> </p><p>As stated above our study marks a starting point. It provides a static blueprint of the tsetse topology and the distribution of the different trypanosome morphotypes. In the next step, we e.g. explore fluid flow at different scales, ranging from rather slow microflows caused by the trypanosomes itself to massive flows produced by peristalsis. In fact, our current and future work is nature-inspired, i.e. we measure the real environments in the fly and the behaviour of the trypanosomes therein. Then, we abstract from nature and construct microfluidic environments that allow the control of parameters. The results from these experiments could provide hints that might help to explain the in vivo behaviour of the trypanosome microswimmers. We now provide more information of this workflow in the Discussion:</p><p>“In fact, such analyses with tsetse fly trypanosomes directly follow already mentioned experimental setups used to assess the reaction of mammalian trypanosomes to mechanical forces (Heddergott et al., 2012; Bargul et al., 2016). […] Using the combination of flexible microfluidic devices and reversible microfluidic pump systems, even the analysis of peristaltic effects seems in reach.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
