Although optic flow plays an essential role in speed determination, it is less reliable under conditions of low light or sparse landmarks. Under such conditions, insects rely on feedback from antennal mechanosensors but it is not clear how these inputs combine to elicit flight-related antennal behaviours. We here show that antennal movements of the honeybee, <italic>Apis mellifera,</italic> are governed by combined visual and antennal mechanosensory inputs. Frontal airflow, as experienced during forward flight, causes antennae to actively move forward as a sigmoidal function of absolute airspeed values. However, corresponding front-to-back optic flow causes antennae to move backward, as a linear function of relative optic flow, opposite the airspeed response. When combined, these inputs maintain antennal position in a state of dynamic equilibrium.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14449.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14449.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14449.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insects combine information from different senses to help them navigate during flight. Flying insects see moving images, which the brain can use to measure their speeds.

To accurately detect these forces, and also to detect odors from the surrounding environment, insects must precisely position their antennae as they fly.</p><p>To investigate how honeybees use different types of sensory information to position their antennae during flight, Roy Khurana and Sane first placed freely-flying and tethered bees in a wind tunnel. Flying forward causes air to flow from the front to the back of the bee.

This unexpectedly revealed that moving images across the eye from front to back, which simulates what bees see when flying forward, causes the bees to move their antennae backward.

For instance, purely optic flow-based measurements of self-motion can be misleading for insects which experience sideslip while flying in a crosswind. Moreover, reliance on optic flow may be problematic under dimly lit or overcast conditions, or when flying over lakes or deserts which present sparse visual feedback. In such situations, sampling from multiple sensory cues reduces the ambiguity arising from variability in feedback from single modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wehner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherman and Dickinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wasserman et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the integration of multimodal sensory cues is essential for most natural locomotory behaviours, including insect flight manoeuvres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willis and Arbas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frye et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verspui and Gray, 2009</xref>).</p><p>For flight control, the importance of optic flow cues detected by compound eyes is well-documented in diverse insects, including honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srinivasan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baird et al., 2005</xref>), bumblebees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dyhr and Higgins, 2010</xref>), <italic>Megalopta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">David, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duistermars et al., 2009</xref>). In recent years, mechanosensory feedback from antennae has also emerged as a key sensory input for insect flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>). This feedback is transduced primarily by two sets of mechanosensors - the chordotonal <italic>Johnston’s organ</italic> (JO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gewecke, 1974</xref>) which senses a wide range of stimuli from high-frequency antennal vibrations to low-frequency ambient airflow or gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dieudonné et al., 2014</xref>), and the antennal hair plates (or <italic>Böhm’s bristles</italic>) which are involved in the reflexive positioning of antennae during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The characteristic positioning of the antennae at the onset of flight is ubiquitous in most, if not all, flying insects underscoring the evolutionary significance of its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorsett, 1962</xref>). Disruption of antennal positioning due to Böhm’s bristle ablation or reduction of JO inputs severely impairs flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinterwirth and Daniel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sane et al., 2007</xref>). The control of antennal position is thought to be essential for the unambiguous sensing of inputs by the JO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinterwirth et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying this behaviour are not well-understood. Here, we show that the airflow cues sensed by Johnston’s organs and the optic flow cues sensed by eyes combine to maintain and control antennal position during flight in the honeybee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. Each input influences antennal position in an opposite manner; frontal airflow causes antennae to move actively forward against the aerodynamic drag, whereas front-to-back optic flow causes them to move backward. The antennal positioning response thus offers a critical readout for understanding how honeybees integrate information about their own motion from airflow and optic flow cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flying honeybees bring their antennae forward in response to increasing airspeed</title><p>To characterize antennal response to ambient airflow, we provided flying bees with frontal airflow cues as would be experienced by them during forward flight.

When presented with fixed airflow but no optic flow, both tethered and freely-flying bees held their antennae at constant IAA throughout a flight bout (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As frontal airflow increased, both antennae moved forward and mean IAA at each airflow value decreased as a sigmoidal function of airspeed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

This behaviour was similar regardless of whether airspeed stimulus was presented in linearly increasing or decreasing steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or in random order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, antennal position is calibrated against absolute airspeeds, independent of time history. At airspeeds less than 1.5 m/s or greater than 3 m/s, mean IAA at each airflow plateaued in both tethered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) and freely-flying bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies on antennal responses of tethered bees to changing airflow did not report a zone of saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heran, 1957</xref>) perhaps due to coarser sampling of their data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We, however, consistently observed sigmoidal mean IAA responses, similar to locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gewecke, 1974</xref>).

JO spans the pedicel-flagellar joint in the antennae of all Neopteran insects, and tracks the motion of the flagella relative to pedicel. In most insects, the JO consists of several hundred scolopidial units that are range-fractionated. These enable both exquisite sensitivity and narrowly-tuned sensing over a large range of stimulus frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dieudonné et al., 2014</xref>). Does JO also mediate the observed antennal response to changes in airspeed? To test this hypothesis, we attenuated JO feedback by gluing the pedicel-flagellar joint (see Materials and methods) in tethered honeybees, and measured their antennal responses to airflow. To control for the extraneous effects of glue on the antenna (e.g. due to added weight), we glued the second annulus of the flagella from the tip (<italic>sham-treatment</italic>) in a separate group of the bees. Application of glue at the JO does not affect the movement of the antennae because the pedicellar-flagellar joints have no muscles, and hence motion around these joints are passive. Unlike sham-treated bees which showed the typical sigmoid response to frontal airflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, non-normalized data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, N=5), bees with restricted JO positioned their antennae at the onset of flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>; also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>]) but their mean IAA at each airflow was insensitive to changing airspeeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, N=7; p&gt;0.1, Moore’s paired test). These experiments established that JO input is required for antennal positioning during flight, but not at flight onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>).

Does the antennomotor system also respond to optic flow in addition to airflow? To address this question, we simulated forward flight conditions by presenting tethered flying bees with changing temporal frequency of front-to-back optic flow cues on two LED screens, and measured their IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Note that, previous studies on optic flow dependent behaviours in honeybees have typically demonstrated that they extract angular velocity (ratio of temporal and spatial frequency) cues from the image motion, independent of spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Srinivasan et al., 1991</xref>) or temporal frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baird et al., 2013</xref>).

The above honeybee (the individual shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>, bee #1), was presented with randomized optic flow stimulus (<bold>C</bold>). The precise temporal sequence of randomized stimulus varied between bees. Dotted line shows the 10 cps threshold. Each 1 cps step lasts for 1 s from 1–25 cps. IAA response is plotted in two ways: the IAA response to the randomized stimulus (<bold>D</bold>, olive green bars), and the response reshuffled in increasing order of temporal frequencies (E; blue bars). The peak at 20 cps is due to the sharp IAA readjustment at stimulus onset. Grey lines between <bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold> indicate step transitions in temporal frequency values. IAA is predicted to change when stimulus changes occur below or across threshold. Predicted changes in IAA are marked by black circle and no change by white circle. IAA is predicted to decrease (down arrowhead) when optic flow changes from high-to-low under or across threshold, and increase (up arrowhead) when values change from low-to-high under or across threshold. Changes in temporal frequency above threshold (horizontal line) yield no antennal response.

In the subsequent flight bout, the temporal frequency decreased stepwise from 25 to 0 cps (green curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,E</xref>; summary figure showing data from all individuals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) to simulate decreasing flight speed. Each stimulus step lasted for 1 s and the entire protocol for 26 s. When temporal frequency increased from 0 to 25 cps, an initial sharp adjustment in IAA (red curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, summary figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) was followed by a graded response between 0 to approx. 10 cps (grey bar, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), beyond which the value reached a plateau. The response curve for linearly decreasing optic flow (25 to 0 cps, green curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, summary figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) was similar to the increasing cues, except for the lack of initial sharp IAA adjustment from zero to non-zero optic flow (also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,E</xref>).</p><p>In these experiments, the optic flow was patterned to monotonically increase or decrease. Graded IAA responses to such optic flow patterns suggested two possibilities.</p><p>First, as in the case of airflow-based response, IAA response curve is innately calibrated against specific temporal frequency values, independent of its time history. If true, the response curve should remain invariant when the temporal frequency of the stimulus is presented in random order. This is an unlikely possibility because absolute values of optic flow are meaningless without prior knowledge of the spatial structure of the world.</p><p>Second, that bees respond to <italic>changes in</italic> temporal frequency rather than their absolute value. If true, IAA would increase (<italic>or decrease</italic>) in response to positive (<italic>or negative</italic>) changes in temporal frequency within the operating range (e.g. 0–10 cps for the bee in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>) while remaining unchanged outside this range (<italic>i.e.</italic> &gt;10 cps). The threshold value was calculated separately for each bee (see Materials and methods for details). The latter criteria lead to specific predictions of when to expect changes in IAA (filled black circle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) and in which direction (arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).</p><p>To test the above hypotheses, we presented tethered honeybees with grating speeds between 1 to 25 cps in randomized order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>) and compared the measured vs. predicted IAA response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,G</xref>). For each bee, we scored these as the fraction of correct predictions; a score of 1 corresponds to all correct, and 0 to all incorrect predictions. In all the cases, the total prediction score matched the actual observed score well above chance levels (*p&lt;0.001; Student’s T test; see Materials and methods for details). When stimulus bins were rearranged in ascending order of temporal frequency, the reshuffled mean IAA response was not graded (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and H</xref>) ruling out the possibility of innate calibration of IAA against optic flow. Thus, our data show that antennomotor activity in honey bees tracks <italic>changes in</italic> temporal frequency, and not their absolute value.</p><p>Bees typically experience the steepest gradients in optic flow during landing or hovering over flowers when optic flow rates are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baird et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, in the follow-up experiments, we focused on the lower range of stimuli from 0–1.8 cps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>). Even in this narrow range, IAA responses tracked the magnitude and direction of grating patterns on the screen. For example, bee antennae robustly tracked simple sinusoidal stimuli that were both, cycled between front-to-back (0 to 1.8 cps), and back-to-front grating movement (0 to -1.8 to 0 cps) over the 10 s duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), thus verifying that the antennae move in both directions as a function of optic flow. To characterize their responses in this narrow range of temporal frequency (0–1.8 cps), the tethered bees initiated wing flapping in front of a blank screen, followed by a sequence of black-and-white gratings moving front-to-back from 1.8 to 0.3 cps. Each grating sequence lasted for 6 s, interspersed with a static screen (zero optic flow) for 3 s. Despite inter-animal variability in the set points for IAA at zero optic flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), all bees increased their IAA as a function of optic flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), with each step change of 0.3 cps eliciting significant increase in mean IAA (*p&lt;0.0001; Moore’s paired test, N=10) at that optic flow rate. The IAA response of tethered bees to optic flow remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) even when their JO were restricted by gluing the pedicel-flagellar joint, establishing that it is independent of the JO pathway. Thus, front-to-back optic flow causes antenna to move backward, opposite to frontal airflow which causes antenna to move actively forward.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Visual and airflow cues combine to influence antennal positioning</title><p>The experiments outlined above established that inputs from two sensory modalities independently helped the bees to sense airspeed and optic flow. Whereas the JO-based antennal mechanosensory feedback was calibrated against absolute values of airspeed, visual feedback was calibrated relative to changes in optic flow under or across a threshold value. These experiments required flying bees to respond to single sensory cues at a time. Hence, we next measured IAA response of tethered bees to simultaneous visual and airflow cues. The paired stimuli combinations were arbitrarily drawn from values in previous experiments, and are not naturally correlated.</p><p>How do multimodal cues affect IAA response when simultaneously presented? Optic flow (red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and airflow (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) cues were presented in three combinations, represented by three regimes A, B or C (grey bars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Responses of a single bee are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>. In each trial, we started the experiment with an intermediate bimodal combination (grey bars, middle Regime B; optic flow=0.9 cps, airspeed =2.5 m/s) and in random order, either decreased (to Regime A; optic flow =0.3 cps, airspeed =0.5 m/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or increased these values (to Regime C, optic flow =1.8 cps, airspeed =4 m/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Antennae maintained position when the cue combination changed from Regime B to Regime A (green line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; Pp&gt;0.1, Moore’s test), but not when only airflow or optic flow was changed. When airspeed alone (i.e. with static grating) decreased from 2.5 to 0.5 m/s (blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; p&lt;0.001, Moore’s test), both antennae moved backward. However, they moved forward when optic flow alone (i.e. with fan off) decreased from 0.9 to 0.3 cps (red line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; p&lt;0.001; Moore’s test). Similarly, when the cue combination changed from Regime B to Regime C, antennae again maintained position (green line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; p&gt;0.1, Moore’s test), but moved forward when airflow alone increased from 2.5 to 4 m/s (blue line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and backward when optic flow alone increased from 0.9 to 1.8 cps (red line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, visual and airflow cues elicit opposite IAA responses which, when acting in concert, maintain antennal position.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14449.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>IAA responses to combinatorial stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IAA response curve of a tethered bee to changing airflow (blue) and optic flow (red).

We considered three possibilities. First, if the response curve of Cue A remains unaltered in presence of a constant Cue B, then it is likely that the system adapts to cue B. Second, if the response curve to Cue A is uniformly offset by the presence of constant Cue B, then the cross-modal influence is likely linear and summative. Third, if response curve to Cue A is non-uniformly offset in presence of constant Cue B, then crossmodal influences are likely to be non-linear. Testing for possibilities provides insights into how inputs from different modalities combine to determine the antennal position.</p><p>We measured IAA against optic flow in presence of two constant values (0 and 1 m/s) of airspeed. The two curves were uniformly offset over the range from 0 to 1.8 cps (compare dotted and solid lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; *p&lt;0.05, Moore’s test, N=8).

According to this hypothesis, once a specific airflow value is correlated against the observed optic flow, which could be slow or fast, it can then be used to make measurements over much greater range of airspeeds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14449.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14449.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-14449-fig4-v2"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Antennal positioning responses involve multimodal sensory integration</title><p>The above study provides us with insights into how the insect antennomotor system integrates the multiple sensory cues that it encounters during flight. This can be summarized in a general schematic of the multi-modal integration of antennal positioning behaviour in flying honeybees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). For the sake of completeness, this model must also include the role of the mechanosensory hair plates (or Böhm’s bristles) in reflexive antennal positioning, which appears conserved across insects according to our studies in moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>), bees and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sant and Sane, 2016</xref>). To summarize these studies: antennal hair plates are stimulated when the antenna undergoes a substantial movement in the scape-head capsule or pedicel-scape joints. The mechanosensory neurons underlying these bristles directly project into the Antennal Motor and Mechanosensory Center (AMMC) where they arborize on the dendritic fields of antennal motor neurons and activate them. Any gross change in antennal position thus elicits a rapid reflexive correction of the antennal position with latencies under 10 ms in hawk moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>) and probably on the same order in honeybees and other insects. Based on these data, we proposed a model to describe the antennal positioning reflex loop mediated <italic>via</italic> antennal mechanosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>). Although arrangement of the hair plates in different insects varies, the underlying neural circuitry and hair plate function is conserved in moths, bees, and most other insect orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krishnan and Sane, 2015</xref>). Previous studies in hawk moths have described only how the antenna, once positioned, reflexively maintains this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>), and also their response to visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan and Sane, 2014</xref>). However, the combinatorial role of these cues in antennal positioning behaviour <italic>during flight</italic> remained unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that the reflexive maintenance of in-flight antennal positioning is simultaneously modulated by both visual (from eyes) and airflow (from JO) feedback during flight. This study also shows that their action is <italic>via</italic> multi-modal pathways which combine in a mutually antagonistic fashion; whereas frontal airflow detected by JO reduces IAA, the front-to-back optic flow detected by compound eyes increases IAA. The combination of these inputs modifies IAA to a new set point, which is then maintained by the antennal hair plates <italic>via</italic> a negative feedback loop that ensures rapid maintenance and correction of the antennal position. The block diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> thus provides a model for multimodal sensory control of antennal positioning response. It is possible that other inputs, such as olfaction, also additionally modulate the antennomotor responses, which is the subject of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>General relevance of antennal positioning response to mechanosensory and visual cues</title><p>Our study shows that the initial positioning of antennae at the flight onset (<italic>antennal deployment</italic>) is separate from its later inflight maintenance by the multimodal inputs (<italic>inflight antennal positioning</italic>). Both behaviours require the hair plate-mediated reflex pathway but the set-point of this reflex system is under multimodal control in the latter case. In particular, restriction of the JO feedback has no effect on the <italic>antennal deployment behaviour</italic>, whereas it completely disrupts <italic>inflight antennal positioning.</italic> It has been suggested that inflight modulation of IAA maintains the scolopidial units of the JO in their operating range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinterwirth et al., 2012</xref>). Although this hypothesis remains unaddressed and is beyond the scope of this paper, our data clearly show that inflight antennal movements are precisely modulated, and product of both visual (from compound eyes) and mechanosensory (from the hair plates and JO) input. Visual feedback also induces directionally-sensitive antennal movements in other insects such as hawk moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan and Sane, 2014</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mamiya et al., 2011</xref>), and many orthopteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honegger, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike the hair plate reflexes which are strictly unilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2012</xref>), visual feedback drives the activity of both ipsi- and contralateral antennal motor neurons in moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan and Sane, 2014</xref>) and may therefore serve to coordinate the movements of both antennae. The mechanosensory pathways mediated by the hair plates then provide rapid reflexive, local correction of the intended position of each antenna.</p><p>Recent studies have also described how the integration of antennal mechanosensory and visual inputs mediates abdominal flexion in moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinterwirth and Daniel, 2010</xref>) which in turn is relevant for flight control and balance. In honeybees too, their combined effect on the abdominal streamlining behaviour enables drag reduction during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). In freely-flying moths, the stimulation of antennal muscles elicits abdominal flexion accompanied by a change in flight trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinterwirth et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, integration of mechanosensory and visual information mediates flight control in other insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sherman and Dickinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas the relative influence of mechanosensory input is greater during rapid turns, visual input is more important during slower rotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sherman and Dickinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2004</xref>).</p><p>The integration of these multimodal cues quite likely occurs in the Antennal Motor and Mechanosensory Centre (AMMC) region of the insect brain, which houses the soma of the antennal motor neurons. This region also receives the arbors of motion-sensitive visual interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hertel and Maronde, 1987</xref>), and likely also the inputs from cephalic hair mechano-afferents. These different modalities are known to influence diverse flight behaviours. It is thus likely that descending interneurons transduce multimodal sensory information that elicits these behaviours. In locusts, the tritocerebral commissure giant (TCG) interneurone integrates visual and airflow information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacon and Tyrer, 1978</xref>), while other descending interneurons in crickets integrate antennal mechanosensory and visual inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gebhardt and Honegger, 2001</xref>). The importance of AMMC as the site of integration of multimodal sensory feedback is an important topic of future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A putative mechanism of calibration of optic flow based speedometer in honeybees.</title><p>The data on antennal position are also relevant to studies on speedometry in honeybees. A key finding of this paper is that IAA responds to absolute airspeed values from 1.5 to 3 m/s, which is narrow compared to the typical range of airspeeds (between 0 and 7 m/s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">[Wenner, 1963</xref>])of honeybees in free flight. IAA is also calibrated against optic flow cues, but this feedback depends on the spatial structure of the environment. As shown in studies over the past two decades, the odometer in honeybees is quite clearly visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srinivasan, 2014</xref>). The visual system can extract the overall image motion, which is perceived by and integrated over the motion detectors in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zanker et al., 1999</xref>). Honeybees trained to find food at a specific distance in tunnels lined with visual stripes can correctly judge distances even when the spatial frequency of the stripes is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srinivasan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2014</xref>). Moreover, they estimate distances correctly despite head or tailwinds, suggesting that parameters such as windspeed, flight duration and number of wing beats etc. play no role in the odometry. Indeed, image motion cues can also be used to estimate depth and distinguish between near and far objects independent of their size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kirchner and Srinivasan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Srinivasan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, bees appear to be able to separately process size and velocity cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Srinivasan et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Complement to the visual odometer, we show here that honeybees are also able to extract information about both airspeed and groundspeed. Importantly, the airspeed calibration mediated by JO is absolute, but works over a narrow speed range, whereas the groundspeed calibration mediated by optic flow can be tuned over a broader range. We propose the hypothesis that honeybees calibrate their optic flow speedometer using their JO-based system that measures absolute airspeeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). At the onset of a regular flight bout, bees simultaneously sample the optic flow (red lines) and airspeed (blue line). The three red lines correspond to temporal frequency of optic flow that is slow (i.e. if objects are far away) to fast (i.e. if objects are close). Sampling the optic flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; black segments on the red lines) corresponding to the dynamic range of the JO-based airspeed sensor (e.g. between ~1.5 to 3 m/s) provides bees with the means to cross-calibrate average optic flow against absolute airspeeds. As the airspeed-based estimation only works in a narrow range from 1.5 to 3 m/s, the optic flow-based speedometer requires extrapolation well beyond the range of the antennal system. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>, the presence of one cue linearly offsets the response curve for the other, analogous to using a standardized <italic>albeit</italic> narrow-ranging measure (e.g. airflow-based speedometer) to calibrate another arbitrarily scalable measure (e.g. the optic flow based speedometer). A disadvantage of such a system is that it must be recalibrated at the beginning of each bout, or within bouts in case of sudden gusts of wind which may confound the calibration. Under such circumstances, we predict that honeybees would have to slow down to recalibrate their optic flow based speedometer against the airspeed-based speedometer, before resuming flight.</p><p>Our data throw some light on puzzling observations from previous studies. In their study on visual regulation of groundspeeds in honeybees, Barron and Srinivasan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barron and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>) observed that honeybees freely flying within a tunnel lined with checkerboard patterns flew at speeds of approximately 0.4 m/s. However, when the checkerboard pattern was replaced by an axial-stripe pattern which offered sparse optic flow cues, its groundspeed was maintained with low variance at a value of 1.4 m/s. Maintenance of ground speeds (which equals airspeed in still air) requires that bees be able to ‘sense’ their speed even when optic flow cues are sparse. How is this possible if speed is maintained only <italic>via</italic> optic flow? To explain this result, we propose that, in absence of optic flow, the bees rely on their JO-based airflow sensors to both set <italic>and maintain</italic> groundspeed. It is worth noting that the value of 1.4 m/s lies at the cusp of the airflow response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and is maintained as the new reference at different wind speeds in sparse optic flow (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barron and Srinivasan [2006]</xref>).</p><p>A JO-based antennal airflow sensing, can in principle offer a ‘true’ airspeed measure for odometry. It is not presently clear if the visual odometer would need such information as the current model for visual odometry is able to quite robustly explain most observations. One would expect such a speedometer system to accumulate errors as the range increases, as has also been observed with the honeybee odometer, which follows the Weber’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>). Future studies will be required to determine if the several predictions that emerge from this model about honeybee speed control hold true. The antennal positioning responses thus provide unique insights into how honeybees and perhaps other insects sense and combine information from multiple modalities to help reduce ambiguities arising from drift in any one modality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were performed on the European honeybees, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, maintained in an apiary in an outdoor insectary approximately 60 m from the lab.

In free-flight experiments, trained bees were marked with acrylic paint on the thorax and abdomen for easy identification of individuals.

The bee was then provided with sucrose solution and left to recover for 45 min.

We then binned the IAA values for each temporal frequency together to calculate a mean and standard deviation of the IAA response at each temporal frequency rate. We then compared these mean IAA to every other IAA value in the dataset for the bee using the paired non-parametric Moore’s circular test in Oriana 4 (Kovach Computing Services, Anglesey, UK). The temporal frequency rate after which the mean IAA values are not significantly different from the rest of the IAA values is considered the threshold for that bee. The threshold for the bee shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is 10 cps, for the bee in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> is 14 cps and for the bee shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> is 14 cps. The response to the first temporal frequency value is always distinguishable from the rest of the responses as the animal positions its antennae to changing optic flow (from zero to the first value). From the second optic flow onwards, the IAA changes as a response to the change in optic flow (from high to low or low to high) and not with the absolute value of the optic flow. Now that we know the threshold of the antennal response to optic flow, we can predict if for every change in temporal frequency value from one value to a randomly chosen value and so forth, the IAA should change significantly (*p&lt;0.005, Moore’s test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,G</xref>; predictions shown in black, tick indicating that we predict that the IAA should change and cross indicating that the IAA should not change. The green dots indicate that the prediction is correct and the score is 1 in that case. The red dots indicate that the prediction is wrong and the score is 0 in that case. The collated scores are at the end of the series).We can also predict the direction of this change i.e. for a given change from one temporal frequency value to the other, should the IAA increase or decrease given that we know that the IAA should increase for every increase in temporal frequency values up to 10 cps of optic flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,G1</xref>; predictions shown in black, upward pointing arrow predicting that the IAA should increase and the downward pointing arrow predicting that the IAA should decrease. The green dots indicate that the prediction is correct and the score is 1 in that case. The red dots indicate that the prediction is wrong and the score is 0 in that case. The collated scores are at the end of the series). To test for the significance of this score, we scrambled the same dataset randomly so that there is no trend in the IAA values. We repeated the same process for this scrambled dataset. For all the individuals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>, our scores are significantly different from their scrambled datasets (*p&lt;0.001; Student’s T test) both in terms of the threshold and the direction of change in IAA. We repeated this process with a thousand scrambled dataset comparisons and the same results hold true in each case.</p><p>To understand how optic flow and airflow cues influence antennal positioning response in bees, we compared the mean interantennal (IAA) angles at various values of air speed and optic flow stimuli using the paired non-parametric Moore’s circular test. In the experiments where we combined airflow and optic flow cues to look at antennal responses, we quantified these responses as the change in IAA (ΔIAA) from its value in Regime B, in response to step changes in speed of one or both stimulus. In these experiments, our ability to test various combinations of airflow and visual cues was restricted by two factors. First, each trial involving transition from Regime B to Regime A and Regime B to Regime C was performed within a single flight bout. Second, the on board memory of our cameras restricted our recording time to 68 s whereas each combination took a total of 60 s. This left us no more than three combinations that we could explore. In the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we calculated the change in IAA (ΔIAA) as difference in the IAA from when only when one cue was being varied compared to when both the cues were present. In both these experiments, we compared all ΔIAA values with each other and with a hypothetical mean of zero using an ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference test.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Anand Krishnan, Tanvi Deora, Harshada Sant and Dinesh Natesan for their comments, and Umesh

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald L. Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vivek Jayaraman, Emily Baird, and Jack Gray (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this interesting study, the authors show that a linear combination of airspeed and optic flow influences antennal positioning in the bee. These results provide an instructive example of the integration of two distinct sensory modalities (mechanosensation and vision) for what is likely a reduction in perceptual ambiguity. Previous studies from the senior author and others have shown that antennae play an important role in flight control for many insects. Based on previous evidence, mechanosensation mediated by the Johnston's organ (JO) is important for sensing airspeed. There is also evidence (e.g., from Heran et al.) that JO sensing depends on antennal positioning, and, further, that this positioning depends on flight and wind speed. Altogether, these results make the study of multimodal cues that influence antennal positioning interesting. Rather than further clarifying the precise function of antennal positioning, the authors use inter-antennal angle (IAA) as an experimental tool to infer the insect's perception of its own speed. They then dissect the role of the two modalities in shaping the percept by monitoring antennal position while manipulating the bee's access to the distinct cues. The findings are in general well supported by the data and should be of interest to biologists who study multisensory integration and multimodal perception.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement about the thoroughness and interest of the work, but request four revisions which must be addressed before this paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Refocus the paper from speedometry to multimodal integration. Antennal position may well be a reasonable proxy for the bee's perception of speed, but the authors shouldn't claim the paper is directly about speedometry. The paper would be better framed as a study about multimodal integration, as assessed by antennal position.</p><p>2) Clarify that angular velocity is pertinent but was not analyzed. It is important to distinguish between angular velocity and temporal frequency and to make clear in the text that these were not studied independently. It is not necessary to do further experiments with different spatial frequencies.</p><p>3) Add more summary data with statistics to supplement data from individual bees.</p><p>4) The idea of cross-calibration of optic flow by airspeed was not convincing because of problems associated with head/tail winds.</p><p>These main points are amplified in the appended sections of the expert reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Note that even if the experimenters could deduce increases and decreases in the bee's speed based purely on antennal position, which is very unlikely, these findings are not directly about speedometry – the insect does not itself use antennal position as a readout for speed, but may use it to keep the JO in its operating range (subsection “General relevance of antennal positioning response to mechanosensory and visual cues”, third paragraph). Thus, the strong emphasis on speedometry in the title, Abstract and Introduction is somewhat distracting and confusing.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript would benefit from being about a single, well-defined and properly motivated topic, and a well-defined set of questions with logical connections to the results. The main topic is perhaps the use of two different sensory modalities for speed perception as judged by a convenient (albeit imperfect) experimental proxy – antennal position. If that is true, it should be expressed more explicitly. The connection between speed measurements and IAA should then be explained in more detail in the Introduction or at the beginning of the Results section. Perhaps some of the information of antennal positioning presented in the Discussion (e.g. subsection “General relevance of antennal positioning response to mechanosensory and visual cues”, first and second paragraphs) could be moved to the Introduction or the Results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In general, the study approaches this topic in a very thorough manner, although I feel that there is one oversight that limits the scope of the findings. This main concern relates to the handling and interpretation of the results when the visual stimulus is presented. Previous work on honeybees has shown that they measure the angular rate of image motion independently from temporal frequency for visually-guided behaviour. The authors could have explored the respective roles of temporal frequency or angular velocity on the antennal positioning response by changing the visual stimulus from a grating pattern with a set spatial frequency to a pattern that contains a variety of frequencies (such patterns are not unusual and could have easily been used in the setup the authors used). As such, it is not clear in the data regarding the visual stimuli if the responses would be different if the angular velocity rather than the temporal frequency were varied. Although I do not think that it is necessary for the authors to do more experiments, I think that they should be more careful in their interpretation of the results and acknowledge that an analysis of the effect of angular velocity independent of temporal frequency would be informative as to the mechanism underlying the visual control of the antenna position.</p><p>Another concern that I have is that I do not understand the concluding argument that the bees use airspeed to calibrate optic flow. This is because airspeed may not provide very accurate information about the motion relative to the ground, such as in cases of tail wind or strong head winds, which honeybees do fly in. They either need to modify this statement or clarify how they predict the antennal positioning mechanism would work under these situations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14449.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers were in agreement about the thoroughness and interest of the work, but request four revisions which must be addressed before this paper can be published in eLife.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Refocus the paper from speedometry to multimodal integration.

However, as rightly pointed out by the referees, we are not showing its relationship to flight, but rather to antennal positioning. We take this point, and have altered the emphasis from speedometry to multimodal integration, as suggested. Specifically, we have changed the title, a key part of the Abstract, and shortened the last paragraphs in the Introduction that directly addressed speedometry.</p><p><italic>2) Clarify that angular velocity is pertinent but was not analyzed. It is important to distinguish between angular velocity and temporal frequency and to make clear in the text that these were not studied independently. It is not necessary to do further experiments with different spatial frequencies.</italic></p><p>We agree and have added a few sentences and a citation (Srinivasan, 1991) to explain this. Angular velocity is indeed the pertinent parameter, as shown by previous researchers. In our case, we have kept the spatial frequency constant, which means that angular velocity is the temporal frequency times a multiplication factor. We have added text in the Results section to add this caveat.</p><p><italic>3) Add more summary data with statistics to supplement data from individual bees.</italic></p><p>As required, we have added the summary figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>) which combines the behaviour data of all bees to linearly increasing and decreasing optic flow rates in the range of 0 to 25 cycles/s. We tried preparing a common figure for randomized data set, including the scores and reshuffled order of optic flow stimulus in each case, but this makes the figure very unwieldy, and adds very little to the overall point of that figure. Hence, we reverted to the single bee as an illustrative example, with all the other bees included in the supplementary information.</p><p><italic>4) The idea of cross-calibration of optic flow by airspeed was not convincing because of problems associated with head/tail winds.</italic></p><p>These main points are amplified in the appended sections of the expert reviewer comments.</p><p>Head/tail winds will alter the speed of the air-pocket in which the insect moves. However, our data show that what the insect detects as airspeed is its own movement within the air-pocket (i.e. relative to it). This is akin to a swimmer swimming within a current, where it can detect the relative flow of water immediately surrounding its body, but not the absolute speed. Thus, the ambient current (i.e. head and tail wind) should not affect this measurement, as indeed our data corroborates.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>Note that even if the experimenters could deduce increases and decreases in the bee's speed based purely on antennal position, which is very unlikely, these findings are not directly about speedometry – the insect does not itself use antennal position as a readout for speed, but may use it to keep the JO in its operating range (subsection “General relevance of antennal positioning response to mechanosensory and visual cues”, third paragraph). Thus, the strong emphasis on speedometry in the title, Abstract and Introduction is somewhat distracting and confusing.</italic></p><p>We agree and have made the relevant changes (as also outlined in our response to the Point #1 of Essential Revisions above).</p><p><italic>Overall, the manuscript would benefit from being about a single, well-defined and properly motivated topic, and a well-defined set of questions with logical connections to the results. The main topic is perhaps the use of two different sensory modalities for speed perception as judged by a convenient (albeit imperfect) experimental proxy – antennal position. If that is true, it should be expressed more explicitly. The connection between speed measurements and IAA should then be explained in more detail in the Introduction or at the beginning of the Results section. Perhaps some of the information of antennal positioning presented in the Discussion (e.g. subsection “General relevance of antennal positioning response to mechanosensory and visual cues”, first and second paragraphs) could be moved to the Introduction or the Results.</italic></p><p>We agree and have moved part of this section to the Introduction, but kept the rest of the subsection “General relevance of antennal positioning response to mechanosensory and visual cues” in place. This change indeed makes the manuscript more streamlined and economically worded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>In general, the study approaches this topic in a very thorough manner, although I feel that there is one oversight that limits the scope of the findings. This main concern relates to the handling and interpretation of the results when the visual stimulus is presented. Previous work on honeybees has shown that they measure the angular rate of image motion independently from temporal frequency for visually-guided behaviour. The authors could have explored the respective roles of temporal frequency or angular velocity on the antennal positioning response by changing the visual stimulus from a grating pattern with a set spatial frequency to a pattern that contains a variety of frequencies (such patterns are not unusual and could have easily been used in the setup the authors used). As such, it is not clear in the data regarding the visual stimuli if the responses would be different if the angular velocity rather than the temporal frequency were varied. Although I do not think that it is necessary for the authors to do more experiments, I think that they should be more careful in their interpretation of the results and acknowledge that an analysis of the effect of angular velocity independent of temporal frequency would be informative as to the mechanism underlying the visual control of the antenna position.</italic></p><p>We agree with this comment, and have added a couple of sentences acknowledging that this is indeed the case, although keeping spatial frequency constant means that angular velocity is just a scaled version of temporal frequency, so the results should remain unchanged.</p><p><italic>Another concern that I have is that I do not understand the concluding argument that the bees use airspeed to calibrate optic flow. This is because airspeed may not provide very accurate information about the motion relative to the ground, such as in cases of tail wind or strong head winds, which honeybees do fly in. They either need to modify this statement or clarify how they predict the antennal positioning mechanism would work under these situations.</italic></p><p>A subtle but important point may be missed here. Airspeed refers to the speed <italic>within</italic> a given air pocket. When there are strong tail winds and head winds, the whole pocket moves, but the antenna only registers the movement within the air pocket. The net ground speed (optic flow) would be the vector sum of the airspeed of the bee within the air pocket and the speed of the pocket relative to the ground.</p></body></sub-article></article>
