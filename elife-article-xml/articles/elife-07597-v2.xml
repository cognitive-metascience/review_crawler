environment and integrate this information with systemic signals. This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction, and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integrated-imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression, and root system architecture traits. We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07597.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07597.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07597.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil via structures called roots. The shape, size, and structure of a plant's root system can change over its lifetime as the plant responds to changes in their local environment. For example, if water is scarce, a plant may develop a very deep root system that is more efficient at capturing water. Understanding how root systems respond to environmental cues may help us to identify the genes and processes involved.</p><p>In this study, Rellán-Álvarez et al. report a new live-imaging platform for analyzing root architecture and its regulation. This platform is called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (or GLO-Roots for short) and uses ‘luminescent’ markers that allow growing roots to be visualized when plants are grown in thin, soil-filled, transparent pots. GLO-Roots can track the growth of the plant roots as well as the activity of genes that respond to environmental stress. Rellán-Álvarez et al. developed a software tool called GLO-RIA (GLO-Roots Image Analysis) to analyze the resulting images. GLO-RIA performs several different types of image analysis, including one that detects the position, length, and direction of roots, as well as their shape and depth.</p><p>Rellán-Álvarez et al. tested the GLO-Roots techniques in various ways, for example, by analyzing the effects that different conditions have on the growth of the roots of the model plant known as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Depriving the plants of a nutrient called phosphorous caused the roots to grow more horizontally than when phosphorus is plentiful, presumably to allow the plants to expand their search for phosphate in the upper layers of the soil, where this nutrient is usually more abundant. On the other hand, a shortage of water caused the roots to grow more vertically to access water stored deeper in the soil. GLO-Roots can also be used to measure the water content of soil at different depths and how this influences the architecture of the root.</p><p>Further experiments on tomato plants and a grass species called <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> revealed the different architectures of their root systems. Rellán-Álvarez et al. propose that this system could be used to study the roots of other plant species in a variety of environmental conditions. This will provide a more detailed understanding of the ways that different plants adapt in response to changes in their environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07597.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07597.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>imaging system</kwd><kwd><italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-115795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dinneny</surname><given-names>José R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0008769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dinneny</surname><given-names>José R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-0519898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haney</surname><given-names>Cara H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-0820854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schrager-Lavelle</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name><name><surname>Maloof</surname><given-names>Julin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM48707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haney</surname><given-names>Cara H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique -

Soil comprises a complex distribution of particles of different size, composition and physical properties, airspaces, variation in nutrient availability and microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady and Weil, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch and Wojciechowski, 2015</xref>). These physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil can vary on spatial scales of meters to microns, and on temporal scales ranging from seasonal change to seconds. Root tips monitor this environment through locally and systemically acting sensory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tabata et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The architecture of the root system determines the volume of soil where resources can be accessed by the plant (rhizosphere) and is under both environmental and genetic control. Plasticity in growth parameters allows the plant to adjust its form to suit a particular soil. Lateral roots, which usually make up the majority of the total root system, often grow at an angle divergent from the gravity vector. This gravity set-point angle is controlled by auxin biosynthesis and signaling and can be regulated by developmental age and root type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosquete et al., 2013</xref>). Recent cloning of the <italic>DRO1</italic> quantitative trait locus demonstrates that natural genetic variation is a powerful tool for uncovering such control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uga et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Specific root ideotypes (idealized phenotypes) have been proposed to be optimal for acquisition of water and nitrogen, which are distinct from ideotypes for low phosphorus. Based on computational modeling and field studies, the ‘steep, deep, and cheap’ ideotype proposed by Lynch and colleagues may provide advantages to the plant for capturing water and elements like nitrogen that are water soluble and therefore tend to move in the soil column with water. This ideotype consists of highly gravitropic, vertically oriented roots that grow deep in the soil column and develop large amounts of aerenchyma, which reduces the overall metabolic cost of the root system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch and Wojciechowski, 2015</xref>). Other nutrients, like phosphorus, which have limited water solubility and are tightly bound to soil particles, usually accumulate in the top layers of soil and favor root systems that are more highly branched and shallow. The low-phosphorus ideotype effectively increases root exploration at the top layers of soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch and Wojciechowski, 2015</xref>). Modeling of root system variables shows that optimum architecture for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake is not the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Postma and Lynch, 2014</xref>) and suggests tradeoffs that may affect the evolution of root architecture as a population adapts to a particular environmental niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laliberté et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, understanding the architecture of root systems and how environmental conditions alter root developmental programs is important for understanding adaptive mechanisms of plants and for identifying the molecular-genetic basis for different response programs. In addition, root systems have complexity beyond their architecture that needs to be incorporated into our understanding of plant–environment interactions. Primary and lateral roots exhibit different stress response programs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian et al., 2014</xref>) and may play specialized roles in water and nutrient uptake. Thus, it is important to develop methods that allow for a multidimensional characterization of the root system that includes growth, signaling, and interactions with other organisms. Furthermore, physiological parameters that affect whole-plant responses to the environment, such as transpiration, are likely integrated into such processes, thus, requiring a more holistic approach to studies of root function.</p><p>Based on these considerations, we have developed a new root imaging platform, Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots), which allows root architecture and gene expression to be studied in soil-grown plants. GLO-Roots is an integrated system composed of custom growth vessels, luminescent reporters, and imaging systems. We use rhizotrons that have soil volumes equivalent to small pots and support growth of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> from germination to senescence. To visualize roots, we designed plant–codon-optimized luciferase reporters that emit light of different wavelengths. To visualize reporter expression, plants are watered with a dilute luciferin solution and imaged afterwards. We have built a custom luminescence-imaging system that automatically captures images of rhizotrons held vertically.

These genes were curated from the literature and belong to a wide array of biological pathways including nutrient acquisition, hormone and light response and abiotic stress. Whole root and shoot samples were collected at the end of the light and dark periods (long-day conditions: 16-hr light, 8-hr dark) from plants grown in rhizotrons, pots, and petri dishes with two different media compositions: 1x Murashige and Skoog basal salts (ms) 1% sucrose or 0.25x ms, no sucrose (ms25). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the gene expression values showed a separation of soil- and gel-grown root systems in the first principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). In roots grown on gel-based media, we observed enhanced expression of genes associated with light-regulated pathways (flavonoid biosynthesis: <italic>FLAVONOL SYNTHASE1, FLS1</italic>, <italic>CHALCONE SYNTHASE, CHS</italic> and photosynthesis: <italic>RUBISCO SUBUNIT 1A, RBCS1A</italic>, <italic>CYCLOPHILIN 38, CYP38</italic>), which is expected due to the exposure of gel-grown roots to light. In addition, genes associated with phosphorus nutrition (<italic>LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1</italic>, <italic>LPR1, PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1, PHR1</italic>) were less expressed in soil-grown roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting differences in nutrient availability between the different growth systems. Interestingly, shoot samples where not as clearly separated by growth media, and instead, time of day had a greater effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). These data suggest root systems may be particularly sensitive to media conditions and indicate that rhizotron-grown root systems more closely approximate the biology of pot-grown plants than standard gel-based media. Shoot weight and primary root length were significantly reduced for gel-grown plants compared to rhizotron- or pot-grown plants suggesting significant differences in the biology of plants grown under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>While the 2-mm depth of the soil sheet is 10–20 times the average diameter of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root (between 100 and 200 microns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meijon et al., 2013</xref>]), we evaluated whether rhizotron-grown plants exhibited any obvious stress as a consequence of physical constriction. We compared traits of plants growing in vessels that hold similar volumes of soil but in different volumetric shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of lateral roots was significantly lower in pot- and cylinder-grown plants compared to rhizotron-grown plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), whereas primary root length of rhizotron and cylinder-grown plants was significantly greater than pot-grown plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). No significant differences in shoot area were observed between the three systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Thus, these data do not support the hypothesis that rhizotron-grown plants experience physical constriction greater than other vessels holding the same volume of soil.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Generation of transgenic plants expressing different luciferases</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots cannot easily be distinguished from soil using brightfield imaging due to their thinness and translucency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>); thus, reporter genes are needed to enhance the contrast between the root and its environment. Luciferase (LUC) is an ideal reporter to visualize roots: (1) unlike fluorescent reporters, luciferase does not require high-intensity excitation light, which could influence root growth, (2) peat-based soil (a type of histosol) exhibits no autoluminescence but does autofluoresce at certain excitation wavelengths similar to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), (3) while GFP is very stable, and thus not well suited for imaging dynamic transcriptional events, the luciferase enzyme is inactivated after catabolism of luciferin, making it ideal for studying dynamic processes such as environmental responses.

Placing rhizotrons in this position would induce a gravitropic response in plants. Working with Bioimaging Solutions (San Diego, CA), we designed and built a luminescence-imaging system optimized for rhizotron-grown plants. GLO1 uses two PIXIS back-illuminated CCD cameras (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) to capture partially overlapping images of rhizotrons while a motorized stage automatically rotates the rhizotron to capture images of both sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A composite image is generated from the images captured of each side; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows that approximately half of the root system is revealed on each side with few roots being visible on both sides. Apparently, the soil sheet is thick enough to block light from portions of the root system but thin enough to ensure its continuous structure can be compiled from opposite face views. We tested the ability of GLO1-generated images to reveal complete root systems by manually quantifying the number of lateral roots in excavated root systems of eight different plants and testing these results against estimates of lateral root number from images of the same plants visually inspected by four different persons. These comparisons revealed good correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.974) between actual lateral root counts and image-based estimation, indicating GLO1-generated root images provide an accurate representation of the in soil root system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>GLO-RIA: GLO-Roots Image Analysis</title><p>We developed a set of image analysis algorithms that were well suited for the complex root systems that GLO-Roots is able to capture. GLO-RIA is an ImageJ plugin divided in two modules.</p><p>The first module (RootSystem) performs four different types of analysis: (i) a local analysis that detects all root particles in the image and computes their position, length, and direction; (ii) the global analysis performs a root system level analysis and computes the total visible surface, convex hull, width, and depth; (iii) the shape analysis uses elliptic Fourier descriptors or pseudo-landmarks similarly to RootScape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ristova et al., 2013</xref>) to perform a shape analysis on the root system; (iv) the directionality analysis computes the mean direction of root particles in a root system (either on the full image or by a user-defined region of interest in the image). These four analysis methods are fully automated by default, but can be manually adjusted if needed.</p><p>The second module of GLO-RIA (RootReporter) was specifically designed for the analysis of multi-layered images such as combinations of gene reporter, root structure, and soil moisture. Shortly, the plugin works as follows: (i) detection of the gene reporters and the structure reporters in their respective images; (ii) if needed, a manual correction can be performed to correct the automated detection; (iii) gene reporters are linked with the soil water content and the structure reporters, based on their proximity; (iv) gene reporter intensity (either absolute or normalized using the structural reporter) is computed; (v) all data are exported and saved to a Root System Markup Language datafile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lobet et al., 2015</xref>). Gene and structure reporters can be followed across different time and space points. Using an object-oriented approach, great care has been taken to facilitate the user interactions on the different images to streamline the analysis process. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> shows a list of root system features extracted using GLO-RIA.

The observed changes in root architecture are consistent with root system ideotypes that improve phosphorus uptake efficiency.</p><p>GLO-Roots is especially well suited for studying water-deficit (WD) responses. First, shoots are exposed to the atmosphere and vapor pressure deficit is maintained at levels that allow for transpiration of water from the shoot. Second, soil in rhizotrons is exposed to air at the top and dries from the top-down; drying soil increases the volume occupied by air and reduces contact of root with liquid water, all of which are similar to changes in soil expected in the field during WD. Finally, as peat-based soil dries, its optical properties change, allowing moisture content to be approximated from brightfield images. We took advantage of the change in gray-scale pixel intensity to construct a calibration curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>) that quantitatively relates gray-scale pixel intensity to moisture content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>); water content can be color coded in images with appropriate look-up tables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Soil color was not affected by the presence or absence of roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Plants were germinated, grown under control conditions then transferred to 29°C, and standing water was removed from the container holding the rhizotrons starting at 9 DAS or 13 DAS. Elevated temperature combined with water deficit is a common stress that modern crop varieties are poorly adapted to, thus, highlighting the importance of examining this combined treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lobell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ort and Long, 2014</xref>). Plants were maintained in this WD regime until 22 DAS when luciferin solution was added and the plants imaged. At 13 DAS, lateral roots near the soil surface are already emerged (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>) and 9 days of subsequent WD treatment caused lateral roots to show an increase in gravitropism leading to the development of a root system that was deeper and more vertically oriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Roots of Bay-0 plants showed similar responses, though the extent of change was less pronounced since Bay-0 roots are normally more vertically oriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Plants transferred at 9 DAS and grown for 13 days under WD showed less lateral root development in the top layer of soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). At this time point, lateral roots start to emerge (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) and early drought may lead to growth quiescence or senescence. Careful examination of roots in these regions showed evidence of small lateral root primordia populating the primary root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

We observed that both conditions were sufficient to induce a change in root directionality indicating that the plant uses similar mechanisms to avoid heat and water-deficit-associated stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next asked which regulatory pathways controlled the observed changes in lateral root directionality during simulated drought. Hydrotropism is a known environmental response that directs root growth towards wet regions of soil. <italic>MIZ1</italic> is an essential regulator of hydrotropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>); however, <italic>miz1</italic> mutants had no significant effect on WD-induced changes in root directionality, compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), indicating that this response was distinct from hydrotropism. Auxin is an important mediator of gravitropism and auxin treatment causes lateral roots to grow more vertically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosquete et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this role for auxin, mutant plants with loss of function in the auxin receptor TIR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11a">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>) showed a near-random distribution of root angles and did not show changes in the root system directionality between WW and WD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GLO-Roots for <italic>Brachypodium</italic> and tomato</title><p>To examine the general applicability of the GLO-Roots system for other species, we introduced LUC2o-expressing reporters into the model grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> and the crop plant <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> (tomato). <italic>Brachypodium</italic> is well suited to the GLO-Root system because, like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, its small size allows mature root systems to be studied in relatively small soil volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pacheco-Villalobos and Hardtke, 2012</xref>). <italic>LUC2o</italic> driven by the <italic>ZmUb1</italic> promoter was introduced into <italic>Brachypodium</italic> using the pANIC vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mann et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Brachypodium</italic> roots showed a distinct architecture from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> marked by prolific development of secondary and tertiary lateral roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Roots, however, are highly diverse in the biology they perform and a multi-dimensional understanding of root systems, which incorporates differences in signaling, metabolism, and microbial association as well as structure, may provide a clearer understanding of the degree to which sub-functionalization of the root system plays a role in important processes such as acclimation and efficient resource acquisition.</p><p>We have developed tools in GLO-Roots that allow for tracking multiple aspects of soil physicochemical properties and root biology simultaneously. Using GLO-Roots, we are able to map in 2D coordinates the soil physical properties such as soil moisture together with root architecture traits such as directionality, growth rates, and gene expression levels. All this information is aggregated in layers for each x, y coordinate. Using GLO-RIA, we integrate this multilayer information, leveraging our ability to simultaneously and seamlessly investigate root responses to environmental stimuli such as soil-moisture content. Luciferases that emit light at different wavelengths allow for constitutive and regulated promoters to be studied together. Introduction of luciferase reporters into microbes provides an additional layer of information that is a readout of the association between organisms and how this might be affected by environmental conditions. The flexibility of the GLO-Roots system may enable additional dimensionality to our understanding of root biology. Other physical properties such as CO<sub>2</sub> or pH mapping in rhizotrons have already been enabled by using planar optodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blossfeld et al., 2013</xref>). It may be possible to engineer LUX-based reporters in microbes that are responsive to extracellular metabolites, creating microbial biosensors, and integration of such tools may enable root-exudation and nutrition to be analyzed in soil. Split-luciferase reporters have been engineered that allow bi-molecular interactions to be studied. Finally, molecular sensors analogous to Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors, termed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shaw and Ehrhardt, 2013</xref>), may allow metabolite tracking dynamically through the root system. With additional innovation in the development of luciferase reporters, the GLO-Roots system will likely expand the repertoire of biological processes that can be studied over an expanded range of developmental time points and environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Enhanced root growth and gravitropism may constitute an avoidance mechanism used during water-deficit stress</title><p>It has been proposed that plants with steep root systems will be better able to tap into deep water resources and thus perform better under water deficit. For example in rice, the IR64 paddy cultivar shows shallow root systems in upland fields, whereas Kinandang Patong, an upland cultivar, is deeper rooting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). Plants maintain a number of regulatory pathways that mediate changes in physiology during WD. Enhanced growth of root systems has been well characterized in field-grown plants; however, this has not been recapitulated in studies of gel-grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. Thus, it has been unclear whether <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> simply responds to WD differently. Our results here show that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> does indeed maintain a classical WD response that expands the root system and directs growth downward. Interestingly, under our stress regime, we did not observe a significant decrease in the relative water content of shoot tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD19-data">Figure 6—source data 5</xref>), suggesting that the changes in root architecture were sufficient to provide access to deep water and prevent dehydration. Such changes in root growth are likely regulated through systemic and local signaling that involve auxin signaling but acts independently of known pathways that control moisture-directed root growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Perspectives and conclusions</title><p>Understanding plant biology requires a sophisticated understanding of how environmental stimuli affect the form and function of plants as well as an understanding of how physiological context informs such responses. Environmental conditions are at least as complex as the plants they affect. Plant roots are exposed to a variety of environmental signals that change in time and space at very different scales that are integrated at the whole-plant system. It is an important challenge in biology to develop methods of growing and studying plants that present such stimuli in a manner that the plant is likely to encounter in nature. After all, the plants we study have evolved to survive through mechanisms that have been selected, over evolutionary time, in nature. It will be interesting for future studies to determine how other environmental stimuli affect root growth using GLO-Roots and whether these responses differ between accessions of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Identification of the genetic loci responsible for phenotypic variation in adult root phenotypes may identify the molecular basis for adaptive variation that exists in this species and potentially identify loci that are useful for breeding efforts needed for the next green revolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth system</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Rhizotrons and growth system fabrication</title><p>Rhizotrons are composed of two sheets of 1/8′′ abrasion resistant polycarbonate plastic (Makrolon AR (R)) cut to size using a water jet (AquaJet LLC, Salem, OR), two acrylic spacers cut using a laser (Stanford Product Realization Lab), two rubber U-channels cut to strips 30-cm long (McMaster Carr Elmhurst, IL, part # 8507K33), and two sheets of black 0.030′′-thick polypropylene sheets (McMaster Carr part # 1451T21) cut with a straight-edge razor blade.

Using an electric paint gun, a fine mist of water is applied to the bare polycarbonate sheets. Then, using a 2-mm sieve (US Standard Sieve Series N° 10) a fine layer of PRO-MIX(r) PGX soil (Premier Tech, Canada) is applied. Excess soil is discarded by gently tapping the plastic against the table in a vertical position. Water is sprayed again onto the soil, then a second layer of Pro-MIX is applied as before. For P deficiency experiments, soil supplemented with 1 ml of 100 μM P-Alumina (control) and 0-P-Alumina (P deficient) was used. To prevent the soil from falling out of the bottom opening, a 3 × 6 cm piece of nylon mesh or paper towel is rolled into a 1-cm wide tube and placed at the bottom side of the rhizotron. The spacers are removed and replaced by clean spacers. The two faces of the rhizotron are carefully joined together and two rubber U-channels slipped on to clamp all pieces together.

Your Tools and Resources article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the system is new and exciting, and potentially offers new opportunities for imaging roots growing in soils. However, the agreement was that the data do not yet adequately demonstrate the fundamental soundness and technical details of the system. Additionally, the inclusion of many brief examples of potential biological applications has resulted in an overly long manuscript and in several instances, the biological data are apparently derived from measurements of single plants which leads to questions about the rigor of the experimentation.</p><p>When revising the manuscript, your goal should be to generate a focused manuscript that describes a rigorously-tested system and includes a smaller selection of biological applications to illustrate and highlight the potential of GLO1. Significant revision will be required.</p><p>Please note, in principle, the reviewers are excited about GLO1 but it is possible that enthusiasm for the paper will decrease when key issues such as the dynamic range of the luminescence detection, the spatial resolution of the extracted structures, and the degree of automation/throughput achievable with the platform are clarified.</p><p>1) The authors over-emphasize the differences between GLO1 and methods widely used in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> research. This theme of contrast with gel-based methods, which dominates the overly-long Introduction and reemerges regularly gives the manuscript a forced-defensive feel. This should be modified. The emphasis should be on how GLO1 works and what it can measure.</p><p>2) The emphasis on the differences between GLO1 and other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> growth methods also makes the authors draw some misguided interpretations. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, a large amount of gene expression data was obtained to determine if plants grown in a GLO1 setup were in a similar or different ‘state’ compared to plants grown in gels or pots. PCA shows results from plants grown in GLO1 and pots group together, and separately from the two gel-based experiments (which included MS or 25% MS salts). The authors are technically justified to conclude that GLO1 plants are more like pot-grown plants than like gel-grown plants, and they are free to view one as more ‘natural’ than the other. But the data more naturally support a different narrative. Within-treatment variation (variation between biological reps) is far greater than differences between gel and soil. (The spread of PC1, which explains 75% of the variance, is from -10 to 10 regardless of growth method or whether the samples were harvested at night or day.) Separation in PC2 supports the point the authors choose to make, which could be due entirely to MS salts being in the gels but not the soil. (MS contains 40 mM potassium nitrate, so it is not surprising that gene expression differs from soil-grown plants.) The authors should focus on explaining their method and its special features well. The readers will realize GLO1 is interesting and it is different but they will want to know how it works, how reliable and reproducible are the results, and what special studies it enables. Removing panels D-I from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and panel A from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> could make an effective introduction to the method with one figure.</p><p>3) The spatial resolution of the images is low, approximately 72 microns per pixel. A root is therefore 1-2 pixels wide as the authors note. This raises questions. First, how much wider is the luminescence signal? From the images shown, it is not possible to determine how far it spreads, but it must spread because it is unlikely that a single-pixel signal would be detectable in the images shown. If the luminescence signal is typically 5 pixels wide or 10, can parallel roots be distinguished? It is essential to include a rigorous assessment of the resolution. Is the resolution sufficient to images of microbes or to distinguish lateral root primordia?</p><p>4) Technical details concerning registration of the images from the two cameras are very unclear and must be provided. In the subsection “Image Preparation”, it is stated that images from the two cameras must be registered (though that standard image analysis term is not used) in order to create a continuous view. The steps taken sound like an affine transformation was applied, but it is also possible that a person is manually doing the shifting by eye. A one-pixel error is equivalent to shifting the image the distance of a root thickness. Is it true that each time point for each rhizotron requires manual registration of the images from two cameras? If not manual, how accurate is the registration method? If manual, how long does it take to process a single experiment?</p><p>5) The majority of the figures in the manuscript show nice images of roots (or videos of root growth) and changes in architecture can be seen. However, relatively little quantitative data is extracted from these images and in most figures, only root angle or depth/length ratios are shown. Is the software capable of extracting additional parameters typically used to describe root architecture? The full capabilities should be described and limitations should be acknowledged. Similarly, can differences in intensity of the luciferase signal corresponding to differences in promoter activity be resolved? What is the dynamic range?</p><p>6) The measure of root system “directionality” based on a Sobel filter is interesting but not adequately described. The y-axis of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is labeled “counts”. What is being counted and how can there be fewer than one of them? It would be expected that the area under the curves (frequency histograms?) would increase with time as more and more elements or segments detected by the Sobel operator were counted, but instead the area appears constant over time. This is one example of the lack of replication in the biological examples. The average results shown appear to be from one time series of one plant rather than multiple individual plants.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is not possible to tell whether the directionality results are the averages of 9-12 plants or only apply to the representative images shown. Can average directionality be computed? The directionality measure may be a valuable feature of the GLO1 images if appropriately described, rigorously tested and if average directionality is computed. If not, then the software is doing only very basic analyses.</p><p>7) The biological examples should focus on those that show the unique features of GLO1 and in each case, the experiments should be replicated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the salt stress data appear to be derived from a single plant over time. These results should be replicated. In Figure 10, it is not clear that the gray scale intensity/water content calibration process can be applied to an image containing a root. The lightness attributed to dry pixels could be coming directly or indirectly from optical effects of the root. It is an interesting idea, but many more controls are needed. If these cannot be added, it would be better to exclude this example.</p><p>8) The title poorly matches this methods paper. The heading “GLO1: a semi-automated luminescence imaging system for rhizotrons” would be a much better title. Or, “GLO1: a luminescence imaging system for semi-automated analysis of plant root system form and gene expression”.</p><p>9) Overall, the text should be modified to make it more concise and accurate. For example, the section “GLO1: a semi-automated luminescence imaging system for rhizotrons” uses “depth” and “thick” to mean the same thing. It could be rewritten as “Apparently, the soil sheet is thick enough to block portions of the root system but thin enough to ensure its continuous structure could be compiled from opposite face views”. Additionally, please avoid making global statements that are not entirely accurate (for example, “Current image analysis algorithms are optimized for roots that are continuously visible, since they are designed to work with images of roots grown in transparent media or on paper”). There are some excellent tools for measuring roots in soil.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “GLO-Roots: an imaging platform enabling multidimensional characterization of soil-grown roots systems” for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the revisions have improved the manuscript, however, new experimental methods and software require solid validation and this is still lacking. It is essential to validate the data generated by GLO-RIA to a known ground truth, for example, a 3D printed model of a root system with known architecture. Alternatively, comparisons to manual measurements of the root system (root growth, directionality) or to measurements obtained through another independent approach could be used to validate data from GLO-RIA. The following papers provide examples of validation approaches (Topp et al., PNAS, 2013, 110(18): E1695-E1704, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/33">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/33</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/26/figure/F6">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/26/figure/F6</ext-link>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07597.058</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors over-emphasize the differences between GLO1 and methods widely used in</italic> Arabidopsis <italic>research.

After repeating the analysis using data normalized with housekeeping genes (dCT values) we observe a very clear separation in PC1 between plants grown in soil (rhizotrons and pots) and plants grown in MS. This first component explains 42% of the total variance. We apologize for making this error in the initial analysis. With the current analysis, we believe it is especially clear that substantial differences in gene expression exist for soil and gel-grown root systems. We have tried to emphasize in the text the main point of this experiment, which is to show that aspects of root biology that are of interest to the field at large show distinct differences between experimental conditions and that GLO-Roots provide a more pot-like environment.</p><p><italic>3) The spatial resolution of the images is low, approximately 72 microns per pixel. A root is therefore 1-2 pixels wide as the authors note. This raises questions. First, how much wider is the luminescence signal? From the images shown, it is not possible to determine how far it spreads, but it must spread because it is unlikely that a single-pixel signal would be detectable in the images shown. If the luminescence signal is typically 5 pixels wide or 10, can parallel roots be distinguished? It is essential to include a rigorous assessment of the resolution</italic>. <italic>Is the resolution sufficient to images of microbes or to distinguish lateral root primordia?</italic></p><p>When roots are grown in plates, and therefore both the bright field and the luminescent image can be acquired and the diameter of a root easily compared, we observe a 15% spread of the signal. Assuming that a typical root is around 140 µm, then a typical root would be around 2 pixels wide and the signal would spread another 0.30 µm, making for a total width of around 2.3 pixels. In adult root systems grown in rhizotrons, we observe an average root width (using the luminescence signal) of around 3.2 pixels. So assuming a similar root width in adult root system and in young seedlings this would suggest a signal spread of around 1 extra pixel. This would mean that the system would be able to distinguish two individual roots separated by around 70 um.</p><p>At the current focal distance, the resolution is enough to distinguish lateral root primordia. See, for example new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and 6H</xref>.</p><p>The resolution is not sufficient to resolve individual bacteria, which are about 1 micron in length; if an individual bacterium were bright enough, it would appear as a single bright pixel. Since the soil was treated with bacteria and the entire soil isn't luminescent, it is more likely that we are not imaging single bacteria but rather colonies or biofilms consisting of many bacteria.</p><p><italic>4) Technical details concerning registration of the images from the two cameras are very unclear and must be provided. In the subsection “Image Preparation”, it is stated that images from the two cameras must be registered (though that standard image analysis term is not used) in order to create a continuous view.

If not manual, how accurate is the registration method? If manual, how long does it take to process a single experiment?</italic></p><p>Registration and combination of the front, back, top, and bottom images is done automatically via an ImageJ macro as a preliminary step for image analysis. The macro automatically flips, rotates and translates the different images according to precise measurements previously obtained manually in the system. Since the relative distances of the two cameras and the rhizotron holder do not change, these operations can be automatically applied to all the images. We did not included the macro in the original version, but it is now included in the Github repository:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rr-lab/GLO-Roots/blob/master/gloria/gloroot_combine.ijm">https://github.com/rr-lab/GLO-Roots/blob/master/gloria/gloroot_combine.ijm</ext-link></p><p><italic>5) The majority of the figures in the manuscript show nice images of roots (or videos of root growth) and changes in architecture can be seen. However, relatively little quantitative data is extracted from these images and in most figures, only root angle or depth/length ratios are shown. Is the software capable of extracting additional parameters typically used to describe root architecture? The full capabilities should be described and limitations should be acknowledged</italic>.</p><p>Yes, there are additional data that can be extracted from the images. We chose to show the basic ones but others were included in the Github repository. A table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), describing the extracted variables, has been added to the manuscript.</p><p>With regard to directionality, GLO-RIA allows automatic partition of the image in quadrants (or rectangles) enabling the comparison of the directionality at different depths, or regions of the root system. A good example of this capability was originally shown in Figure 9—figure supplement 1 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6–figure supplement 4</xref>). All this data is already included in the Github repository. See for example results for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rr-lab/GLO-Roots/blob/master/figures/figure_3/data/high-root-data-dir.csv">https://github.com/rr-lab/GLO-Roots/blob/master/figures/figure_3/data/high-root-data-dir.csv</ext-link></p><p>It is also worth noting that in the Root Reporter plugin, a different approach is used to calculate directionality. Here, once the different segments of the root system are identified, a direction value is obtained based on the vector traced between the origin of the segment and the end point. This allows pairing of segment direction data with soil moisture values or gene expression data.</p><p>Based on the root shape defined when the root area is calculated, different types of shape descriptors can be quantified. GLO-RIA can automatically quantify Elliptic Fourier Descriptors, example here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rr-lab/GLO-Roots/blob/master/figures/figure_3/data/high-root-data-efd.csv">https://github.com/rr-lab/GLO-Roots/blob/master/figures/figure_3/data/high-root-data-efd.csv</ext-link>. It can also extract any number of pseudo-landmarks defined by the user. Both datasets can be used for further shape and morphometric analyses, depending on the user’s needs and requirements. We did not further analyze these data, but we now show root shape analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of the new version of the manuscript.</p><p>The main limitation of GLO-RIA is its inability to reconstruct the topological links between the roots due to interruptions in root segments caused by soil particles. A statement of this limitation has been added to the main text.</p><p><italic>Similarly, can differences in intensity of the luciferase signal corresponding to differences in promoter activity be resolved? What is the dynamic range?</italic></p><p>Changes observed in luciferase intensity will depend on the changes in the transcript abundance driven by the promoter used. In our system, we typically observe higher expression of <italic>UBQ10:LUC2</italic> in the root tips. On a typical root system of a plant expressing different reporters, we can observe gray intensity values ranging from 500 to 8,000. The cameras we use are able to capture up to 64,000 gray levels, so we are well within the range to acquire even more intense signals. We have quantified the pattern of expression along the first 0.5 cm of root tips of plants expressing various reporters (UBQ10, ZAT12 and DR5), to show differences in patterns of expression and overall intensity values. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. DR5 expression is higher in the root tip and its range of intensity values ranges between 200 and 600 (dynamic range = 3), while ZAT12 and UBQ10 shows intensity values between 200 and 8000 (dynamic range = 40) and intensity is more spread along the root. These data and a description of the dynamics range measured has been added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The measure of root system “directionality” based on a Sobel filter is interesting but not adequately described. The y-axis of the plots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref> <italic>is labeled “counts”. What is being counted and how can there be fewer than one of them? It would be expected that the area under the curves (frequency histograms?) would increase with time as more and more elements or segments detected by the Sobel operator were counted, but instead the area appears constant over time. This is one example of the lack of replication in the biological examples. The average results shown appear to be from one time series of one plant rather than multiple individual plants</italic>.</p><p>Directionality is calculated as follows:</p><p>After the number of direction bins (we normally use bins of 2°) is defined by the user, a 5x5 sobel operator is used to derive the local gradient orientation. This orientation is then used to build the histogram by assigning the square of the orientation into the appropriate bin. Instead of representing the total counts at each orientation, a relative value is calculated by dividing the individual values at each bin by the total sum of the histogram (and multiplying by 100). This is why the area under the curve does not change with increasing number of segments in older roots.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, only one plant is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, but the results shown in panels C and D are the average of a representative experiment with three plants. This was not indicated in the figure caption, but we have amended this. Raw images for this experiment were uploaded to Dryad and the original data was included in the Github repository (and now associated with the figure).</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, it is not possible to tell whether the directionality results are the averages of 9-12 plants or only apply to the representative images shown. Can average directionality be computed? The directionality measure may be a valuable feature of the GLO1 images if appropriately described, rigorously tested and if average directionality is computed. If not, then the software is doing only very basic analyses</italic>.</p><p>Yes, the values shown are the average of 9-12 plants per accession (raw images of all the plants were uploaded to Dryad) and the average can be easily computed. The original data for this image is provided in the Github repository and now associated with the image.</p><p><italic>7) The biological examples should focus on those that show the unique features of GLO1 and in each case, the experiments should be replicated. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, the salt stress data appear to be derived from a single plant over time. These results should be replicated</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the time-series data for brevity and we only show the initial time point before doing the salt addition.</p><p><italic>In Figure 10, it is not clear that the gray scale intensity/water content calibration process can be applied to an image containing a root. The lightness attributed to dry pixels could be coming directly or indirectly from optical effects of the root. It is an interesting idea, but many more controls are needed. If these cannot be added, it would be better to exclude this example</italic>.</p><p>To test the possibility that roots could be contributing to the lightness of the soil, we have compared the gray values of soil with no roots with those with roots. To do this we sampled several parts of different rhizotrons under both well watered and water deficit conditions. The results show no differences in gray level intensity between parts of the rhizotrons with roots or without roots.

The heading “GLO1: a semi-automated luminescence imaging system for rhizotrons” would be a much better title. Or, “GLO1: a luminescence imaging system for semi-automated analysis of plant root system form and gene expression”.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestion, however, we think the following title may be more appropriate:</p><p>“GLO-Roots: an imaging platform enabling multidimensional characterization of soil-grown roots systems”.</p><p><italic>9) Overall, the text should be modified to make it more concise and accurate. For example, the section “GLO1: a semi-automated luminescence imaging system for rhizotrons” uses “depth” and “thick” to mean the same thing. It could be rewritten as “Apparently, the soil sheet is thick enough to block portions of the root system but thin enough to ensure its continuous structure could be compiled from opposite face views”</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the text accordingly in the revised manuscript to follow this recommendation.</p><p><italic>Additionally, please avoid making global statements that are not entirely accurate (for example, “Current image analysis algorithms are optimized for roots that are continuously visible, since they are designed to work with images of roots grown in transparent media or on paper”). There are some excellent tools for measuring roots in soil</italic>.</p><p>We have deleted this sentence in the new version.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers agree that the revisions have improved the manuscript, however, new experimental methods and software require solid validation and this is still lacking. It is essential to validate the data generated by GLO-RIA to a known ground truth, for example, a 3D printed model of a root system with known architecture. Alternatively, comparisons to manual measurements of the root system (root growth, directionality) or to measurements obtained through another independent approach could be used to validate data from GLO-RIA. The following papers provide examples of validation approaches (Topp et al., PNAS, 2013, 110(18): E1695-E1704</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/33">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/33</ext-link> <italic>and</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/26/figure/F6">http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/26/figure/F6</ext-link><italic>).</italic></p><p>We agree that validation of GLO-RIA would benefit from the analysis of ground truthed images. We now include additional GLO-RIA validation using two approaches. First, we manually quantified individual lateral root angles (measurements performed as marked in blue in the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>) in a set of 15 images (not originally part of the data set used in the manuscript) and calculated an average lateral root angle per root system. This value was compared with mean directionality values obtained using GLO-RIA. We also compared the manually measured root system width and depth with the same values obtained using GLO-RIA. To further extend the comparison of actual lateral root angles with the output of the directionality algorithm in GLO-RIA, we used ArchiSimple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pagès et al., 2014</xref>) to generate a set of 1240 contrasting root systems that we used as ground truth models. Images of these root systems were then measured in GLO-RIA and compared to the actual root angles defined by ArchiSimple.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07597.059</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07597.059">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07597.059</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07597-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>As you can see from the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, we observed strong correlations for all three parameters tested (root system width, depth and directionality) between the manual quantification and the GLO-RIA quantification as well as between the computationally generated root models with known root angles and the GLO-RIA quantification.</p><p>We also now include examples of directionality color-coded root systems as measured by GLO-RIA for both a real root system and an ArchiSimple generated root model.</p><p>The validation provides strong evidence that the image analysis methods developed in our manuscript are accurate in their estimation of important root parameters, in which we have characterized environmental and genetic variation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
