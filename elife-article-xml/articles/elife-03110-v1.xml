Using chromosomally integrated fluorescence reporter transgenes, we demonstrate a new recombinogenic activity of AID leading to intra- and intergenic deletions via homologous recombination of sequence repeats. Repeat recombination occurs at high frequencies even when the homologous sequences are hundreds of bases away from the positions of AID-mediated cytidine deamination, suggesting DNA end resection before strand invasion. Analysis of recombinants between homeologous repeats yielded evidence for heteroduplex formation and preferential migration of the Holliday junctions to the boundaries of sequence homology. These findings broaden the target and off-target mutagenic potential of AID and establish a novel system to study induced homologous recombination in vertebrate cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03110.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03110.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03110.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mutation can be harmful because changes to genes can disrupt vital processes or even cause diseases such as cancer. However, some genetic mutations can also be beneficial. Cells of the immune system, for example, need to create antibodies that attack a huge diversity of invading microbes. To do this, immune cells introduce changes into their genes to increase the diversity of the proteins that make up the antibodies.</p><p>An enzyme called AID is thought to play a crucial role in increasing the diversity of our antibodies by changing specific letters of the genetic code. Now, Buerstedde et al. have shown that the AID enzyme can also cause sections of DNA to be deleted from the genome.</p><p>Buerstedde et al. constructed pieces of DNA that include, in order, a gene that makes cells glow red, a gene that makes cells resistant to an antibiotic, and a gene that could make cells glow green. However, the very start of the ‘green’ gene was missing, which meant that it was switched off. Stretches of DNA were repeated in front of the ‘red’ and ‘green’ genes in some of the ‘constructs’. After inserting this DNA into cells from chickens or mice, most cells glowed red, but some started to glow green instead. Green cells were killed by the antibiotic; and were only seen when cells carried the constructs with the repeating DNA. Cells that lacked the AID enzyme only glowed red, regardless of which DNA construct they carried.</p><p>Buerstedde et al. showed that AID causes the DNA constructs to align and re-arrange at the repeated sequences. As such, when the cells divide and their DNA is separated and packaged into newly formed cells, the DNA between the repeating sequences can be deleted. Thus, cells started to glow green because the ‘on’ switch at the start of the red gene ended up at the start of the green gene when the region in between was deleted. This also explains why green cells always died when exposed to the antibiotic, because this deletion removed the resistance gene too.</p><p>Buerstedde et al. suggest that when a cell attempts to correct the errors caused by the AID enzyme changing the letters in the DNA, it actually can trigger the exchange and deletion of repeated sequences. Future work is now needed to understand how this new role for the AID enzyme is regulated, and whether this role beneficial or harmful to the immune cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03110.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03110.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>AID</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buerstedde</surname><given-names>Jean-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schatz</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intra- and intergenic deletions by repeat recombination broaden the mutagenic potential of the activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is essential for all types of B cell-specific immunoglobulin (<italic>Ig</italic>) gene diversification—somatic hypermutation (SH), gene conversion (GC), and class switch recombination (CSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Revy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arakawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2002</xref>). AID likely initiates these processes by the deamination of deoxycytidines to uracils, as inactivation of the <italic>DNA Uracil Glycosylase</italic> (<italic>UNG</italic>) gene changed the SH spectrum at C/G bases toward transitions and impaired GC and CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Noia and Neuberger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saribasak et al., 2006</xref>). Abasic sites resulting from the excision of AID-induced uracils are most likely removed by the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masani et al., 2013</xref>), but how the nicked DNA strands are further processed to initiate alternatively CSR, GC, or SH is poorly understood.</p><p>AID-dependent double-strand breaks—believed to be generated by deamination of nearby cytidines on both strands of sequence repeats within switch regions—have been detected during CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wuerffel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petersen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rush et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schrader et al., 2005</xref>). These breaks are normally joined by non-homologous end joining leading to the deletion of the intervening DNA sequence, but erroneous repair may lead to chromosomal translocations (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boboila et al., 2012</xref>). It is uncertain, however, whether double-strand breaks routinely accompany SH, since breaks within hypermutating V segments were subsequently found to be AID independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Papavasiliou and Schatz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bross and Jacobs, 2003</xref>). Similarly, it remains unclear whether GC is initiated by a double strand-break or by a single-strand nick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yabuki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nakahara et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have suggested that AID-mediated DNA lesions could be repaired by homologous recombination. Phosphorylated AID was reported to interact with Replication Protein A (RPA), a protein also required for recombination, which then recruited AID to single-stranded DNA and facilitated the deamination of cytidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2005</xref>). The RPA that accumulated at sites of AID-mediated DNA damage was subsequently shown to be associated with the RAD51 recombination protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamane et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting the formation of homologous recombination intermediates. Notably, inhibition of homologous recombination decreased the viability of B cells expressing AID and induced widespread double-strand breaks and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasham et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The chicken B-cell line DT40, easily modified by targeted gene integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buerstedde and Takeda, 1991</xref>), is a useful model to study AID-mediated GC and SH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Noia and Neuberger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa and Buerstedde, 2009</xref>). DT40 modifies its rearranged <italic>Ig</italic> light chain gene primarily by uni-directional gene conversion using nearby <italic>pseudo-V</italic> genes as conversion donor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buerstedde et al., 1990</xref>). However, GC decreases and SH increases if homologous recombination is impaired by inactivation of RAD51 paralogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sale et al., 2001</xref>), upon deletion of the upstream <italic>pseudo V</italic> genes that act as GC donor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arakawa et al., 2004</xref>) or following inactivation of the <italic>UNG</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saribasak et al., 2006</xref>). SH of the <italic>Ig light chain</italic> gene, as well as a green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgene were found to be strongly increased in the presence of a nearby Diversification Activator (DIVAC) sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blagodatski et al., 2009</xref>). It was recently shown that this DIVAC consists of the chicken enhancer and enhancer-like elements and that it can be replaced by the <italic>human Ig lambda</italic> (<italic>hIgλE)</italic> and <italic>Ig heavy intron</italic> (<italic>IgHiE</italic>) enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buerstedde et al., 2014</xref>). CSR has been extensively studied using the murine B cell line CH12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Whitmore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kinoshita et al., 1998</xref>). This model system responds to the appropriate stimulation by increasing both Ig switch region transcription and AID expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>) and by recombining its endogenous Ig heavy chain locus or transfected switch region constructs by CSR.</p><p>While AID has been known to induce homologous recombination in the form of unidirectional gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arakawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2002</xref>), there was previously no direct evidence that AID could mediate more complex rearrangements of sequence repeats. Using both DT40 and CH12 cells, we demonstrate here that AID can induce homologous recombination of repeats (RR) leading to frequent deletions between direct repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single red fluorescence protein (RFP) reporters</title><p>Transfection of GFP-based hypermutation reporter constructs into DT40 suggested that in rare instances in which transgenes had undergone multi-copy integration there was frequent copy number contraction during cell clone expansion (data not shown).

FACS analysis of subclones of the transfectants revealed a trailing cloud of cells with decreased red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>).

RR mediated deletions could be visualized after chromosomal integration of fluorescent reporter constructs by virtue of changes in the fluorescence profiles of individual cells within expanding cultures. Deletions occurred at high frequencies in different sequence contexts and in both the chicken DT40 and the murine CH12 cell lines. Interestingly, transfectants of DT40 recombined the duplicated <italic>RSV</italic> promoters and <italic>tdT</italic> repeats as frequently by RR as they inactivated the RFP genes by somatic hypermutation (SH). Although DT40 diversifies its <italic>Ig</italic> genes by gene conversion (GC), an artificial homeologous sequence upstream of the <italic>tdT</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> genes was recombined more often by RR than it was modified by GC. Similarly, class switch recombination (CSR) active CH12 cells rearranged a construct containing duplicated <italic>RSV</italic> promoters and intronic switch regions as often by RR as by CSR. AID-induced RR does not seem to involve error prone DNA synthesis because precise deletions, but no non-templated nucleotide changes, were encountered in a large number of recombinant sequences. Our data indicate that AID-mediated RR can be a remarkably efficient process.</p><p>To explain RR, we propose that the single strand nick—believed to occur after the excision of an AID-induced uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>)—is further processed into a homologous recombination intermediate. This could either be a single strand gap generated by nuclease mediated resection of the nicked strand (Model 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>) or a double strand break believed to occur when the replication fork collapses at the site of the unrepaired single strand nick within one of the template strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kowalczykowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petermann and Helleday, 2010</xref>) (Model 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G–K</xref>). Since recombination occurred at high frequency between the <italic>RSV</italic> repeats, which are upstream of the transcription start site and hence likely to be hundreds of bases away from the peak of AID-induced cytidine deamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saribasak et al., 2006</xref>), both models invoke substantial DNA resection to expose single stranded DNA distant from the nicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,I</xref>). The fact that RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hakim et al., 2012</xref>) as well as RPA together with RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamane et al., 2013</xref>) accumulated at multiple chromosomal positions within activated murine B cells in an AID-dependent fashion is consistent with the formation of recombination competent nucleoprotein filaments. Later stages of the models postulate heteroduxplex DNA and Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E,I</xref>), which are consistent with the sequence analysis of homeologous repeat recombinants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Nevertheless, the choice, validity, and details of the two alternative models remain speculative. Further insight into the RR reaction will likely be provided by the analysis of constructs containing inverted repeats and the behavior of constructs in cells with specific recombination and repair factor deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Willis et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03110.012</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Models for AID induced Recombination of Repeats (RR) assuming initiation of homologous recombination by a single strand gap or a double strand break.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The diagrams show two neighboring genes containing direct sequence repeats marked in red and brown.

For example, it could be responsible for V gene replacements that are not associated with cryptic V(D)J signal recognition sequences, as these were observed in AID expressing germinal center B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darlow and Stott, 2005</xref>). Similar to RR, GC, which diversifies the rearranged Ig genes of B cells in chickens and many mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reynaud et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler 1998</xref>), requires the interaction of nearby homeologous sequences on the same chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arakawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sale, 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, the two processes might involve the same intermediates leading to sequence alignment and strand invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref>) and later diverge when the Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>) are resolved by cleavage during RR, but by convergent branch migration during GC. How GC and RR are controlled during Ig repertoire development remains unresolved. Both of the fluorescent reporter genes in our constructs were transcribed and expected to accumulate AID induced nicks which might facilitate RR. On the contrary, the pseudo V genes within the chicken Ig loci are unlikely to be transcribed, and the absence of transcription or their less accessible chromatin configuration may favor GC.</p><p>While possibly involved in the repair of AID-induced DNA damage, RR is also likely to add to the mutation signature of AID by introducing deletions and inversions of repetitive sequences. AID expressing B cells are prone to transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robbiani and Nussenzweig, 2013</xref>) and mutation signatures of APOBEC homologues are found in the genomes of many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic>-acting sequences that activate SH in nearby transcribed sequences and which have been termed DIVersification ACtivators (DIVACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buerstedde et al., 2014</xref>), strongly stimulated the frequency of RR, revealing an additional risk to genome integrity posed by DIVAC-like sequences outside of the <italic>Ig</italic> loci. However, RR-mediated deletions were also detectable after transfection of ‘no DIVAC’ containing control constructs (e.g., R2 events arising from the RSV_tdT_RSV substrate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Thus, AID and perhaps other cytidine deaminases represent a general threat to transcribed regions of the genome via multiple mechanisms including RR, as reported here. Given the highly repetitive nature of mammalian genomes, even a low level of RR could significantly contribute to genome instability and B cell transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of RFP and dual fluorescence reporter constructs</title><p>The <italic>RSV</italic> promoter, <italic>GFP</italic>, <italic>IRES-Bsr</italic>, and <italic>SV40</italic> polyA sequences used for the RFP gene expression cassettes and the <italic>hIgλE</italic> and <italic>hIgHiE</italic> DIVACs had been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buerstedde et al., 2014</xref>).

Despite likely suboptimal excitation of tdT by the 488 nm laser, the red fluorescence of tdT expressing cells was very bright, causing difficulty in displaying positive and negative cells on the same screen. FACS settings were optimized for the analysis of either tdT or DsR expressing cells and then consistently used for the analysis of respective primary transfectants and subclones.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The first author of this manuscript has previously identified a unique enhancer, DIVAC, which increases activated-deaminase (AID)-dependent mutagenesis (PLOS Biol 2014). The current manuscript uncovers another and unexpected function of AID as well as for DIVAC. The work here shows that they collaboratively promote reciprocal recombination between two homologous sequences. Remarkably, they are very frequently subjected to reciprocal recombination, even though the two homologous sequences are relatively short, only up to 1kb, and localized at a distance of several-kb. The finding significantly contributes to the understanding of AID-mediated mutagenesis involving repeat sequences. The authors carefully designed experiments, did an impressive amount of work, and confirmed reproducibility of data using various recombinant plasmids. We therefore recommend publication in a high profile journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>, if appropriate revision is done, particularly on the model figure.</p><p>Our major concern is the model for reciprocal recombination shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. The authors propose that single-strand breaks (step 4) triggers end-resection (step 5) and subsequent strand invasion into homologous sequences (step 6). Given the extremely quick repair of single-strand breaks in mammalian cells, it seems unclear that a single-strand breaks could be efficiently resected and stimulate reciprocal recombination. Another possibility is that abasic sites (step 3) stall DNA replication: replication stalling may be released by template switching to adjacent homologous sequences. The manuscript should be published soon if the authors discuss other possibilities for initiation of reciprocal recombination by replication blockage at AID-induced DNA damage sites. A balanced model might consider the one proposed and others. In any case, if the authors want to stick with only their own speculative ideas they must address the following.</p><p>As the authors referenced, there is some evidence that HR may be initiated by an SSB as well as by double-strand breaks (DSBs), although the mechanism has yet to be worked out. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>(5), what enzyme would resect a nick and, if the nick is resected, what is left over to carry out the homology search? That is only one strand would make a D-loop upon invasion and this would be an unusual structure to resolve. It may be that a helicase would be a more likely player. Also, for a large single-strand gap initiated by a SSB, the complementary strand is still intact, so what would prevent DNA ligase from filling in the single-strand gap instead of the cell initiating a homology search? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>(7), most models I have seen for double Holliday require second-strand invasion, which cannot occur if you only have a SSB. The events observed seem like they may still be accounted for by conversion of a SSB to a DSB, perhaps during replication over the nick leading to fork collapse. If this occurred, repair may be favored by HR due to the cell being in S-phase and may preferentially repair with nearby sequences due to the large number of AID-initiated nicks, since nicks have been shown to stimulate repair of DSBs.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The authors define reciprocal homologous recombination events as GC without cross over. The word “reciprocal” connotes an exchange of genetic data with no net loss whereas most of the events described are non-conservative deletions.</p><p>2) In the graphs of the FACS data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig5">Figures 1, 2, 3, and 5</xref>, is it possible to perform an analysis (t-test, Mann-Whitney) on the data to determine if there is statistical significance?</p><p>3) In the text, it is stated that the “two ATG” cassette was added for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> substrate, but it is also shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> substrate. Is it in both?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>(2) in appears that some of the intermediate red population is overlapping with the R3 gated population.</p><p>5) Since this is a study on recombination, it is unclear why the authors chose to continue using the tdT reporter with a direct repeat when the DsR appears to work just as well without the added variable of deletion events. Especially since the 2nd population of supposed single RFP seems quite sizable in the FACS dot blots. The results may lend to easier interpretation with the DsR construct.</p><p>6) The presence of the blasticidin seems like it would enable the authors to determine the frequency of deletion events. While this would limit the number of detectable events compared to FACS, it could complement the FACS data and report the number of viable cells that survive deletions.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> the primary transfectant (Lane 1-4) produces both the 2.5 and 1.7 kb fragment for the 1/3 pair and the major products for the 1/4 and 1/5 pair seem to correspond to a deletion of the cassette. Is the cassette that unstable or could it be that some of these are PCR products are artifacts? For example, a downstream RSV amplified by primer 4 could anneal with the upstream RSV amplified by primer 1 leading to the amplification of a smaller product. This could be an issue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> as well. Southern blots may be the only way to absolutely confirm these proposed recombination products.</p><p>8) How long are the Smu and Salpha sequences described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>?</p><p>9) The fact that the cassette was randomly integrated into CH12 cells and that the results were variable makes it difficult to interpret the results of this experiment. While HR can occur in CH12 cells, CSR has shown to occur by NHEJ. That the experiments are not performed in the context of the switch region using switch promoters also make the interpretation and biological significance difficult to interpret.</p><p>10) Could loss of R3 cells and blasticidin resistance in some of the CH12 cells also be explained by NHEJ that joins the DNA so that the genes are not in frame with their start codons?</p><p>11) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> switch regions are difficult to amplify through, even with a high-fidelity polymerase, so Southern blots may again be the best way to confirm the proposed substrates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03110.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Our major concern is the model for reciprocal recombination shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>.

Based on the comments of the reviewers and editors, we have substantially revised the manuscript and the figures. The one major criticism of the manuscript related to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) for how AID induces deletion between repeats by homologous recombination. The comments were insightful and prompted us to revise the single strand nick/gap version of the model (so that now, initial strand invasion is mediated by the intact DNA strand) and to add an alternative, replication-induced double strand break version of the model. We have also rewritten the paragraph of the Discussion dealing with the models. We believe that it will be valuable to present both models given the uncertainty of how these AID-induced events occur: as noted in the review “there is some evidence that HR may be initiated by an SSB as well as by double-strand breaks (DSBs)”.</p><p>In response to the minor comments we have:</p><p>- changed the term ‘Reciprocal Homologous Recombination’ into ‘Homologous Recombination of sequence Repeats’ (leading to a change in the title of the manuscript and further changes throughout the manuscript)</p><p>- added information about the position of the ATG start codons for the constructs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></p><p>- added the sizes of the switch regions</p><p>- simplified and better explained the naming of the constructs.</p><p>We share the view that PCR products of repetitive sequences can be difficult to interpret. However, since the identity for the bands, thought to represent the different types recombinant sequences, was verified by subcloning and sequencing, we feel that Southern blot analyses would add little and unduly delay publication of the manuscript. We also note that a preponderance of smaller PCR products indicative of deletion (such as those with pairs 1/4 and 1/5) could be due largely or entirely to preferential amplification of smaller PCR products at the expense of the full-length products. We believe that the combination of PCR, sequencing, and FACS data provides a clear picture of the frequency of the various events, and that a more detailed analysis taking advantage of blasticidin resistance would not substantially add to this.</p><p>Also, since our results, relying on the medians of large numbers of subclones from multiple independent transfectants and often multiple similar constructs, show clear-cut differences to support the main conclusions of the study, we have not added further statistical analysis.</p><p>Regarding the CH12 experiments, they were not designed to provide an analysis of class switch recombination (as was done by others some years ago using similar switch substrates) but rather to test the hypothesis that AID could also induce homologous recombination of sequence repeats in a mouse cell line that differed considerably from the chicken DT40 line. Inclusion of switch sequences provided a useful internal control and point of reference for interpreting the homology directed deletions.</p><p>Finally, regarding our use of tdT-containing constructs (instead of DsR) for most of the experiments, we do not feel that this choice limits any of the conclusions, and it certainly emphasizes the abundance of AID-mediated homologous recombination between sequence repeats.</p></body></sub-article></article>
