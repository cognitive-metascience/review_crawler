One reason might be that neural circuits contain hidden variability that becomes relevant only when those individuals are challenged by injury. We found that in the mollusc, <italic>Tritonia diomedea</italic>, subtle differences between animals within the neural circuit underlying swimming behavior had no behavioral relevance under normal conditions but caused differential vulnerability of the behavior to a particular brain lesion. The extent of motor impairment correlated with the site of spike initiation in a specific neuron in the neural circuit, which was determined by the strength of an inhibitory synapse onto this neuron. Artificially increasing or decreasing this inhibitory synaptic conductance with dynamic clamp correspondingly altered the extent of motor impairment by the lesion without affecting normal operation. The results suggest that neural circuit differences could serve as hidden phenotypes for predicting the behavioral outcome of neural damage.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02598.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02598.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02598.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The outcome of a traumatic brain injury or a stroke can vary considerably from person to person, making it difficult to provide a reliable prognosis for any individual person. If clinicians were able to predict outcomes with better accuracy, patients would benefit from more tailored treatments. However, the sheer complexity of the mammalian brain has hindered attempts to explain why similar damage to the brain can have such different effects on different individuals.</p><p>Now Sakurai et al. have used a mollusc model to show that the extensive variation between individuals could be caused by hidden differences in their neural networks. Crucially, this natural variation has no effect on normal behavior; it only becomes obvious when the brain is injured. The experiments were performed on a type of sea slug called <italic>Tritonia diomedea</italic>.</p><p>When these sea slugs encounter a predator they respond by swimming away, rhythmically flexing their whole body. This repetitive motion is driven by a specific neural network in which two neurons—called a cerebral 2 (C2) neuron and a ventral swim interneuron—play important roles. Both of these neurons are quite long and they run alongside each other in the brain, with the ventral swim interneuron being activated by signals sent from the C2 neuron at multiple ‘synaptic connections’ between the two.</p><p>Sakurai et al. showed that the strength of the connections between the C2 neuron and the ventral swim interneuron varied substantially between animals. However, despite this variation, the sea slugs still performed the same number of whole-body flexions as they swam.</p><p>Sakurai et al. then made a lesion to the brain, which removed about half of the connections between the C2 neuron and the ventral swim interneuron. This meant that the response of the sea slugs to predators depended on the strength of the remaining connections between the two neurons. Sakurai et al. found that the responses of some sea slugs were only mildly impaired, whereas others were severely impaired. This showed that although variations in the strength of the individual connections had no effect on swimming behavior of normal sea slugs, the same variations had a substantial effect when the brain was damaged. Moreover, by creating computer-generated synapses between the C2 neuron and the ventral swim interneuron, Sakurai et al. were able to change the level of impairment.</p><p>These findings suggest that the variability in human responses to brain injury could be due to hidden differences at the neuronal level. In everyday life, these differences are unimportant and individuals are able to function in similar ways in spite of subtle differences in their neuronal configurations. However, when the brain is damaged, the differences become more important. This suggests that certain configurations within neuronal networks are more resistant to brain damage than others.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02598.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02598.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Tritonia diomedea</kwd><kwd>individual variability</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>neural injury</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>dynamic clamp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1120950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Paul S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brains and Behavior Seed Grant Program, Georgia State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Paul S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6-FY14-441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>Paul S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Animal-to-animal variability in neural circuit elements is often hidden under normal conditions, but becomes functionally relevant when the system is challenged by injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that individual animals can exhibit similar behaviors while differing substantially in the properties of the neurons and synapses underlying those behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calabrese et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Norris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roffman et al., 2012</xref>). The consequences of such hidden variability in neural circuits have not been addressed. One possible consequence is that it impacts the behavioral susceptibility of the animal to trauma. It has been noted that individual people differ from one another to such an extent that it can impair the ability to predict outcomes in cases of traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hukkelhoven et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lingsma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forsyth and Kirkham, 2012</xref>) or stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cramer, 2008a</xref>). Such variability can be hidden under normal conditions but cause differential survival of individuals in the face of critical challenges. In this study, we report that differences in synaptic properties, which were of no consequence under ordinary conditions, caused different outcomes when the circuit was challenged with an injury.</p><p>With recent advances in detection techniques, there has been a growing awareness that axonal injury in the white matter plays a complex role in disruption of neural networks underlying higher brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schiff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kinnunen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Squarcina et al., 2012</xref>). However, there are technical difficulties in manipulating specific neural circuit elements and providing precisely controlled lesions in the mammalian brain. In this study, we use a nudibranch mollusc, <italic>Tritonia diomedea</italic>, in which a neural circuit for rhythmic swimming behavior is widely distributed in the brain. The <italic>Tritonia</italic> swim central pattern generator (CPG) consists of three neuronal types: DSI, C2, and VSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which form a network oscillator circuit that produces the rhythmic bursting activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) underlying production of the rhythmic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Getting, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katz, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2009</xref>). C2 and VSI both send axons through one of the pedal commissures, Pedal Nerve 6 (PdN6), which connects the two pedal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previously, we reported that disconnecting this commissure blocks or seriously impairs the swimming behavior and the motor pattern underlying it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</xref>). In this study, we found substantial individual variability in the synaptic actions of C2 onto VSI, which correlated with variability in the susceptibility of the behavior to disruption following disconnection of PdN6. Such individual variability in neural circuit elements was hidden under normal conditions, but became functionally relevant only when the system was challenged by injury.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02598.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Tritonia</italic> swim central pattern generator.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram of the swim central pattern generator (CPG).

Subtraction of the C2-evoked inhibition of VSI significantly increased the number of VSI bursts per swim episode in 6 out of 9 preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A<italic>iii</italic>,C<italic>i</italic></xref>). The swim motor pattern was lengthened approximately 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C<italic>i</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> D.C.), causing an upward shift in the plot comparing the number of VSI bursts with and without dynamic clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C<italic>ii</italic></xref>). Under such conditions, all VSI bursts contained orthodromic action potentials in all 16 preparations. Thus, with PdN6 intact, additional synaptic inhibition from C2 to VSI did not affect the number of bursts in the motor pattern; it acted like a hidden change in the circuit. In contrast, subtraction of the inhibitory conductance extended the motor pattern by causing more orthodromic spiking.</p><p>When PdN6 was blocked, addition of the artificial C2 to VSI synaptic inhibition further decreased the number of VSI bursts per swim episode, making the preparation more susceptible to disconnection of PdN6. When the dynamic clamp was turned on, it decreased the number of VSI bursts from four to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A<italic>ii</italic></xref>). The number of C2 bursts was largely unaffected, probably because the artificial conductance was applied to only one of bilateral VSI pair and C2 is electrically coupled to its contralateral counterpart. On average, without dynamic clamp, blocking PdN6 caused a 25% decrease in the number of VSI bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B<italic>i</italic></xref>, PdN6 blocked). When the dynamic clamp was turned on, this became an approximate 60% decrease compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B<italic>i</italic></xref><italic>, D.C.</italic>). Thus, after PdN6 disconnection, addition of inhibitory synaptic current significantly decreased the number of bursts. Plotting the numbers of VSI bursts with dynamic clamp against the numbers of bursts without dynamic clamp shows that all but two of the 18 preparations fell below the unity slope line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B<italic>ii</italic></xref>). Thus, artificial enhancement of C2-to-VSI inhibition made the swim motor pattern more susceptible to disruption caused by PdN6 disconnection.</p><p>If the extent of motor impairment by PdN6 disconnection were proportional to the extent of C2-evoked synaptic inhibition of VSI, then decreasing the delayed inhibitory component through subtraction (see ‘Materials and methods’) ought to prevent the motor impairment. Indeed, subtracting the inhibition from C2 to VSI mitigated the effect of disconnecting PdN6. When the dynamic clamp was turned on, the decreased number of VSI bursts was restored from 27.7% below the control swim motor pattern to 3.3% above the control, a significant shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C<italic>i</italic></xref>). The effect of subtracting the inhibition tended to be more effective in the more vulnerable preparations, which increased the number of bursts by one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C<italic>ii</italic></xref>). Thus, subtracting the inhibitory component of the C2 to VSI synapse restored the impaired swim motor pattern after PdN6 disconnection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the escape swimming behavior of <italic>Tritonia</italic> is normally very robust with little variability among individuals, we found that there was an increase in the variability of the behavior after lesion of a central commissure, PdN6, which connects the two pedal ganglia.

Stroke can also cause axonal lesions in subcortical white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bamford et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sozmen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blasi et al., 2014</xref>). Disruption of axonal pathways that link nodes in the distributed brain networks would cause motor deficits and cognitive/learning disabilities, which are commonly seen in children with cerebral palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Riddle et al., 2012</xref>). However, case-by-case differences in the extent of lesion are a major problem in assessing the outcome of injury with regard to lesion types and locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Saatman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bigler et al., 2013</xref>), which also involve the extent of secondary responses such as inflammation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lenzlinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Woodcock and Morganti-Kossmann, 2013</xref>). Moreover, in mammalian systems, experimental manipulation of neural circuit elements is difficult because of enormous number of neurons with the same or similar functions working as a cluster. Thus, it has been difficult to study how inter-individual differences in neural network properties affect the individual differences in susceptibility to a lesion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Variability in susceptibility to injury arises from differences in the inhibitory synaptic component</title><p>The variation of susceptibility to a neural lesion appeared to arise from differences in the synaptic action from neuron C2 to VSI in the swim CPG. The difference was hidden under normal conditions. C2-evoked excitation of VSI is thought to be essential for initiating the ventral phase of each swim cycle during the swim motor pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Getting, 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calin-Jageman et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Getting (1989a)</xref> suggested that C2 excites VSI via direct synaptic action, but we found that the excitation of the proximal VSI process was mainly caused by a bombardment of recruited EPSPs that overrode the direct synaptic action of C2 onto VSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the polysynaptic recruitment did not appear to play a major role in causing the individual differences in the extent of motor impairment after PdN6 disconnection. Rather, it was the inhibitory component of the direct synaptic action by C2 onto VSI that was more significant in predicting the susceptibility to the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In Hi-Di saline, the C2-evoked synaptic potential in the proximal region of VSI can be detected from the cell body as a slow membrane potential change with an initial depolarization and a later hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Getting, 1989c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calin-Jageman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</xref>). Stronger inhibition would counteract the depolarizing effect of recruited polysynaptic EPSPs in VSI and hence make the system more susceptible to loss of the distal spike initiation zone. Synaptic recruitment and concurrent actions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses have been shown to provide flexibility in neural network outputs in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McLean et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dougherty and Kiehn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kiehn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Artificially increasing the extent of inhibition from C2 to VSI in the pedal ganglion, using the dynamic clamp technique, caused the motor pattern to become more susceptible. Importantly, it did not affect the production of the motor pattern with PdN6 intact. This shows that this site of variability is not critical to the animal's behavior under normal conditions, but it becomes critical when challenged by lesion. Thus, this synaptic difference serves as a hidden phenotype that predicts the susceptibility of the neural circuit to disruption.</p><p>Subtracting the C2 to VSI inhibition using dynamic clamp partly rescued vulnerable preparations from the effects of the lesion. This further supports the role of this synapse in determining the susceptibility. Subtraction also caused an increase in the number of bursts per swim episode prior to the lesion. This is likely because artificial reduction of the inhibitory synaptic conductance would enhance C2-evoked depolarization through bombardment of recruited EPSPs, which would make the proximal spike initiation zone of VSI more excitable. This enhanced VSI bursting may have a cascading effect in swim motor pattern generation; by spiking more, VSI would decrease the burst duration in C2 and DSI, which may lead toward generating more burst cycles by releasing less serotonin in each burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fickbohm and Katz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Katz et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The capability of spike initiation in the proximal region determines the susceptibility</title><p>The difference in the synaptic action in the pedal ganglia may affect the direction of spike propagation between them.

In the mammalian brain, there is a general acknowledgement of variability. Individual variability in the susceptibility to neural damage may be attributed to substantial variation in the brain function and anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cramer, 2008a</xref>). For example, the map of motor cortex is actually the population mean; among individuals there is substantial variation in the relationship between brain function and brain anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Whitaker and Selnes, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rademacher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Van Essen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cramer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cramer, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Walhovd et al., 2014</xref>).

The inability to predict the outcome of neuronal damage is a serious impediment towards developing effective treatments or prophylactic measures. There is also growing concern regarding inter-individual variability in the efficacy and reliability of brain stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lopez-Alonso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, neural circuits in invertebrate systems are composed of relatively small numbers of neurons. In such systems, individual identified neurons often play critical roles and researchers have taken advantage of the simplicity and reproducibility of the connectivity. The number, location, and anatomy of individual neurons are very similar among individuals and their synaptic connections are often drawn by connecting one neuron to the next. However, recent results in several labs have shown that there is considerably more nuance to this view of uniformity than initially appreciated. For example, in the snail respiratory CPG, it was shown there is individual variability at a specific synapse due to distinct activation of two different dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magoski and Bulloch, 1999</xref>). In the stomatogastric nervous system of crabs, it was suggested that similar neuronal firing patterns could be obtained from neurons with different compositions of ion channels and that different network configurations could produce similar patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Golowasch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, it was shown that the properties of neurons vary substantially even though the overall behavior of the network is constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>). In the leech heartbeat CPG, it was found that there is considerable variability among individuals in the strength of synaptic connections among interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Norris et al., 2011</xref>). Despite such animal-to-animal variability, the CPGs produce the same or similar functional outputs. Interestingly, it has been recently shown in the crab stomatogastric nervous system that the bursting activities of circuit neurons showed different susceptibility to extremely high temperature, but such differences were hidden at temperatures within the physiological range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). A modeling study further demonstrated that different sets of network parameters could underlie differential sensitivity of neural circuit to extreme temperatures, but are “good enough” to produce robust bursting activities under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rinberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have shown that in <italic>Tritonia</italic>, the C2 to VSI synapse serves as a hidden phenotype that helps predict the outcome of this particular lesion. Thus, it is possible that a better understanding of the nature of variability in neural circuits could lead to the discovery of a wider range of hidden phenotypes that predict a variety of conditions and allow them to be treated effectively. Variability even in well-defined circuits indicates that there are many solutions to generating a simple function. These solutions might not all be equivalent; under different circumstances, such as injury, one solution might be superior to another.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What causes synaptic variability?</title><p>The causes for the individual synaptic differences in <italic>Tritonia</italic> are not known. It is possible that the synapses differ because of prior experience or that the synapses change autonomously over time. Such fluid neuronal network structure has been suggested in many studies on both mammals and invertebrates. In the mammalian cortex and spinal cord, trial-to-trial variability in the size and/or pattern of the activated neuronal population has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). This indicates that continuous changes in functional connectivity within the motor pools and in their activation patterns might underlie such variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cramer, 2008a</xref>). In invertebrates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magoski and Bulloch (2000)</xref> showed that specific synapses in the snail respiratory CPG constantly change in sign and that even the valence of synaptic transmission can be modulated by environmental and neurohumoral conditions.</p><p>It is equally possible that the differences in synaptic properties between individuals are caused by genetic differences in this wild-caught population. If the differences are genetic, then they could form the raw material for natural selection to act upon while the behavior remains constant. Such variability, which is neither useful nor injurious, can be hidden in normal life but cause differential survival of individuals when challenged by new conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darwin, 1876</xref>). Although the experimental procedure of blocking the brain commissure is far from a natural stress to the nervous system, our results shed light on how neural circuits can contain hidden variability, which may lead to differential survival under changing conditions including injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal surgery</title><p>Specimens of the nudibranch, <italic>Tritonia diomedea</italic>, were obtained from Living Elements Ltd.

For behavioral tests of lesions, we employed the same procedure as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</xref>). Animals were placed for 1 hr in ice-chilled artificial seawater (Instant Ocean Salt Water, Miami, USA) containing 0.1% 1-Phynoxy-2-propanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73a">Redondo and Murray, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101a">Wyeth et al., 2009</xref>). A 2-cm incision was made in the skin between the rhinophores to expose the brain. In the experimental animals, the pedal commissure, which is also known as Pedal Nerve 6 or PdN6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100a">Willows et al., 1973</xref>), was cut near the right pedal ganglion with fine scissors, whereas in the sham controls, PdN6 was exposed but not cut. The skin incision was stitched with silk thread and sealed with ‘cyanoacrylate glue’ (Ethyl Cyanoacrylate, WPI, Sarasota, USA).</p><p>Animals with lesions were paired with sham-operated animals for the behavioral assay. The observer was blind to the condition of each animal in a trial. The swim was induced by applying 5 M NaCl solution (0.5 ml) to the dorsal body surface, and the number of swim cycles was counted from complete ventrally directed body flexions. A retraction of the body without a body flexion in response to the stimulus was considered as a swim failure. The number of body flexions during the escape behavior was measured three times before the surgery (16 ± 1, 12 ± 1 and 2 ± 1 hr prior to the commissure transection) and once after the surgery (2 ± 1 hr).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Isolated brain preparations</title><p>Before dissection, the animal was chilled to 4°C in the refrigerator. The brain, consisting of the fused cerebropleural and pedal ganglia, was removed from the chilled animal and immediately pinned to the bottom of a Sylgard-lined chamber (1 ml) where it was superfused with saline at 4°C. Physiological saline composition was (in mM): 420 NaCl, 10 KCl, 10 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH. 7.4. The cell bodies of the neurons were exposed by removing the connective tissue sheath from the surface of the ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100a">Willows et al., 1973</xref>).

A suction electrode fabricated from a pulled, fire-polished, borosilicate glass tube (i.d., 1.0 mm; o.d., 1.5 mm) was placed in the <italic>en passant</italic> configuration on PdN6. In this study, the other pedal commissure, Pedal Nerve 5 (PdN5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100a">Willows et al., 1973</xref>) was cut in all isolated brain preparations during dissection. Cutting it after the dissection had no apparent effect on the swim motor pattern (N = 6).</p><p>Neurons were identified by soma location, electrophysiological monitoring of axonal projection (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), coloration, synaptic connectivity, and activity pattern at rest and during the swim motor program as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Getting, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1983b</xref>). There are three types of CPG neurons: Dorsal Swim Interneurons (DSIs, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuronbank.org/Tri0001043">http://www.neuronbank.org/Tri0001043</ext-link>), Cerebral Neuron 2 (C2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuronbank.org/Tri0002380">http://www.neuronbank.org/Tri0002380</ext-link>), and Ventral Swim Interneuron-B (VSI-B, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuronbank.org/Tri0002436">http://www.neuronbank.org/Tri0002436</ext-link>). For simplicity, we will refer to VSI-B as VSI for this paper. C2 and DSI have cell bodies on the dorsal surface of the cerebral ganglion and project their axons toward the contralateral pedal ganglion, whereas VSI has its cell body on the ventral side of the pleural ganglion and projects its axon toward the ipsilateral pedal ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To record from both C2 and VSI, the brain was twisted around the cerebral commissure as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Getting (1983b)</xref>.</p><p>The axons of C2, DSI and VSI exit the pedal ganglion through one of two commissural nerves (PdN5 and PdN6) and reach the other pedal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Newcomb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hill and Katz, 2007</xref>). To identify neurons, the swim motor program was evoked by stimulating body wall nerve PdN3 with a train of voltage pulses (5–15 V, 1.5 msec) at 5 Hz for 3 s via a suction electrode. Unilateral electrical stimulation of PdN3 is sufficient to elicit the bilaterally symmetric swim motor pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Electrical stimuli were given at intervals of greater than 10 min to avoid habituation of the swim motor pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frost et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In the isolated brain preparation, PdN6 was functionally disconnected by either physical transection or by blocking impulse propagation with TTX (1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>M) in a suction pipette that contained the commissure. There was no statistical difference between cutting and pharmacological disconnection in either the number of bursts or the intra-burst spike frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</xref>). In this study, both procedures were referred to as PdN6 disconnection.</p><p>When TTX was used, blockade of axonal impulses in PdN6 was confirmed by examining the change in the impulse waveform recorded on the commissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, insets). Under control conditions, the impulses were triphasic, with two downward phases (arrowheads) and a positive deflection between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, PdN6 intact). When the action potentials were blocked inside the pipette, the impulses became biphasic with a downward deflection followed by an upward deflection, suggesting that the impulses came into the pipette and were blocked inside it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, PdN6 blocked; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sakurai and Katz, 2009b</xref>).</p><p>In some experiments, the bathing medium was switched to saline containing a high concentration of divalent cations (Hi-Di saline), which raises the threshold for spiking and reduces spontaneous neural firing. The composition of the Hi-Di saline was (in mM): 285 NaCl, 10 KCl, 25 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 125 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sakurai and Katz, 2003</xref>).

To test C2-evoked synapses, a standard stimulation was used; C2 made to fire at 10 Hz using repeated injection of 20 ms current pulses. Axoclamp-2B amplifiers (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA) were used for all electrophysiological experiments. Recordings were digitized at 2–6 kHz with a 1401plus A/D converter from Cambridge Electronic Design (CED, Cambridge, UK). Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Spike2 software (CED) and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA).</p><p>A cluster of two or more action potentials with intervals of less than 1 s was considered as a burst.

Care was taken not to include stimulus artifacts. EPSPs smaller than 0.1 mV were excluded from the analysis. No polysynaptic IPSPs were seen in VSI when C2 was stimulated. We did not distinguish between electrical or chemical synapses in this study. To measure the direct synaptic action of C2 onto VSI, Hi-Di saline was used to remove polysynaptic input.

Specifically, working with the escape swim CPG of the mollusk Tritonia diomedea they show individual variation in the response of intact animals or isolated nervous systems to cutting/blockade of the commissural nerve PdN6. They then show that the impairment brought on by the injury correlates inversely with the strength of an identified inhibitory synapse in the CPG network. Further they show that Dynamic Clamp addition or subtraction of this synapse can predictably reverse or enhance the response to disconnecting of PdN6.</p><p>The paper is highly interesting and innovative and provides a mechanistic explanation to why there are individual variations in the response of the nervous systems to injury. It should be of wide interest to the neuroscience community.</p><p>The three reviewers are from somewhat different backgrounds and have different overlapping expertise, and they have reached a consensus view that the paper with proper revision would have considerable significance. While the different reviews reflect the differing backgrounds and expertise for the reviewers, they all agree that four major revisions are needed.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) There is concern that the authors have not made a compelling case for the broader impacts of their work. They state that their findings have implications for traumatic nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative diseases but fail to make a strong link. The broader impacts of their work might be enhanced by relating their findings more directly to the burgeoning literature on animal-to-animal variability in the nervous system. A stronger case should also be made for the connection between synaptic variability and impairment caused by lesions in Discussion.</p><p>2) The data on the direction of spike propagation in VSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>–figure supplement 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) where presented appear as digressions. Some of this information necessary for the Discussion can come by citing previous work or new results summarized without data. Perhaps limit the data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and place it after current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> Supplement, where it makes logical sense. One could argue then that preps with strong inhibition (C2 to VSI ipsilateral) should have fewer orthodromic bursts and those with fewer orthodromic burst should be more susceptible to PdN6 disconnection. When presented up front there is no context for the direction of propagation in VSI and one starts to focus on the wrong things; i.e., not on synaptic interactions. Figure 13 is used simply to summarize the results, but it could be used to offer a clearer explanation (or proposed hypothesis) for the role of the direction of propagation, and its transition, in the observed phenomenon.</p><p>Related to this issue are observations made in Sakurai A, Katz PS. J Neurosci. 2009 Oct 21;29(42):13115-25. In that paper the authors showed an orderly transition from orthodromic to antidromic from the beginning to the end of the motor pattern. Here this order is not mentioned, only the prevalence of anti vs ortho spikes. Is this order somehow related to the more direct correlation of impairment and inhibitory synaptic strength? If so, how? The Figure 11 legend states that all preparations treated with dynamic clamp inhibition showed antidromic spikes but only a fraction that were not treated. This observation should be explained with reference to Figure 13.</p><p>3) The paper is somewhat tedious to read because there is so much data presented. The authors are to be commended for being thorough, but there is a possibility of losing the big picture in the details of the data. One potential solution would be to reduce the number of correlograms. If susceptibility and impairment are well defined and rigorously separated then it might be possible to eliminate all the correlograms where the number of VSI bursts are considered and only present those where impairment is considered. The deleted data could simply be mentioned in the text rather than presented as supplemental data.</p><p>4) It would strengthen the paper if the authors formally defined susceptibility and impairment as it related to their experiments and used these terms restrictively; i.e., specifically non-synonymously. There is some concern that the term cryptic is used somewhat misleadingly and could be dropped.</p><p>The primary reviews (major concerns) are provided to the authors so that they can gain some insight into the consensus presented above. There are some additional insightful comments in these concerns that the authors should consider but they should focus on the consensus.</p><p>Other issues to address:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>The authors describe experiments showing that individual variation in the strength of a key inhibitory synapse in a CPG circuit predicts the response of the individual to a specific injury to the network.

The writing is concise and clear, perhaps too concise, and the Discussion (the strongest part of the manuscript in terms of writing) is very illuminating. I encourage the authors to delete some of the extraneous data on spike direction in VSI and to add more explanation of the other data. There are scores of correlograms presented and oodles of statistics that make the text tedious without more rationale and explanation.</p><p>The paper is highly interesting and innovative and provides a mechanistic explanation to why there are individual variations in the response of the nervous systems to injury.

The authors analyzed the influence of axon transection on the generation of rhythmic activity in a central pattern generating network for a simple mollusk motor behavior. Importantly, this network is one of the few examples across animal kingdom for which sufficient information exists about network topology with respect to single neurons involved. The authors analyze the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic actions of C2 onto VSI neurons in the swim network of the nudibranch Tritonia before and after the lesion of their axons connecting two separated areas of synaptic interaction. From the results it becomes clear that it is the relative strength of synaptic inhibition from C2 to VSI in one of the two areas that determines the sensitivity of the whole circuit towards inactivating the second area of interaction. To test this hypothesis dynamic clamp technique is employed to introduce artificial synaptic interactions between the C2 and the VSI. The results favor the hypothesis. The study provides evidence that contrary to the robust and predictable performance of a neural network in an organism there exists substantial inter-individual variability in a task specific tuning of topological and cellular properties. The study has been conducted in a thorough way, incl. data evaluation and statistics. I have the following issues that need the attention of the authors in order to clarify their findings:</p><p>1) I read the reasoning of the authors that their results may be also interesting in the light of searching for causal origins in traumatic nervous system injuries (title and P2) and neurogenerative diseases (P13, bottom). In its present form this link appears indirect to me: How similar are network damages between stroke patients on the microlevel compared to the system studied? Which kind of traumatic brain injury would be comparable to axon lesions?</p><p>2) The authors report data on the analysis of the synaptic influences of the C2 on the VSI neuron. The presented data raise some questions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8-9</xref> C2 stimulation of some seconds induces very long lasting excitation in VSI neurons. Which neurons are generating the late excitation? From the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> the appearance of EPSPs in VSI neurons independent from activity in C2 is difficult to be explained. Are there other neurons are intercalated between C2 and VSI? Most of the long lasting late depolarization is not related to C2-activity. This prompts the question what these data contribute to the question in focus, i.e. how the weighting between spatially separated excitatory and inhibitory interactions between the C2 and the VSI neuron may contribute to the observed phenomenon.

When that zone is eliminated, the other spike initiation zone takes over and it is very variable. Nevertheless, when the nerve is disconnected a large number of excitatory inputs that normally drive the bursting activity are lost and thus the conditions are not comparable. The inhibitory synapse revealed after nerve blockade may be modulated and thus serve a significant role under normal (connected) conditions, which are not elicited under the present experimental conditions. Additionally, the section 'Variation in neural circuits' in the discussion attempts to place the results of this work in the context of animal-to-animal variability recently described in a number of preparations.

They state that their findings have implications for traumatic nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative diseases but fail to make a strong link. The broader impacts of their work might be enhanced by relating their findings more directly to the burgeoning literature on animal-to-animal variability in the nervous system. A stronger case should also be made for the connection between synaptic variability and impairment caused by lesions in Discussion</italic>.</p><p>In the Introduction and Discussion, we have expanded our discussion with regard to white matter injury. Such injury causes loss of higher level functions such as cognition and language abilities, which are distributed over multiple areas in the brain by disrupting functional connections of the network. This is somewhat equivalent to the lesion we are studying here because we specifically blocked axonal spike propagation through a specific commissure that also connects disparate brain areas. A difference is that this lesion is very specific and the neurons are identified so that we can directly study the effect on behavior.</p><p><italic>2) The data on the direction of spike propagation in VSI (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>–figure supplement 1 and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>) where presented appear as digressions. Some of this information necessary for the Discussion can come by citing previous work or new results summarized without data. Perhaps limit the data to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>and place it after current</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref> <italic>Supplement, where it makes logical sense. One could argue then that preps with strong inhibition (C2 to VSI ipsilateral) should have fewer orthodromic bursts and those with fewer orthodromic burst should be more susceptible to PdN6 disconnection. When presented up front there is no context for the direction of propagation in VSI and one starts to focus on the wrong things; i.e., not on synaptic interactions. Figure 13 is used simply to summarize the results, but it could be used to offer a clearer explanation (or proposed hypothesis) for the role of the direction of propagation, and its transition, in the observed phenomenon</italic>.</p><p>We have moved the figure of variable spike propagation to later in the paper and removed plots with non-significant linear regression.</p><p><italic>Related to this issue are observations made in Sakurai A, Katz PS. J Neurosci. 2009 Oct 21;29(42):13115-25. In that paper the authors showed an orderly transition from orthodromic to antidromic from the beginning to the end of the motor pattern. Here this order is not mentioned, only the prevalence of anti vs ortho spikes. Is this order somehow related to the more direct correlation of impairment and inhibitory synaptic strength? If so, how? The Figure 11 legend states that all preparations treated with dynamic clamp inhibition showed antidromic spikes but only a fraction that were not treated. This observation should be explained with reference to Figure 13</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out about the temporal order of the direction of spike propagation. We added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>–figure supplement 1) that shows how the percentage of antidromic (or orthodromic) spiking changed during the swim episode and how likely they were eliminated after PdN6 block. There were more bursts with antidromic spikes later in the swim motor pattern and they were more likely to be eliminated by lesion than orthodromic bursts.</p><p><italic>3) The paper is somewhat tedious to read because there is so much data presented. The authors are to be commended for being thorough, but there is a possibility of losing the big picture in the details of the data. One potential solution would be to reduce the number of correlograms. If susceptibility and impairment are well defined and rigorously separated then it might be possible to eliminate all the correlograms where the number of VSI bursts are considered and only present those where impairment is considered. The deleted data could simply be mentioned in the text rather than presented as supplemental data</italic>.</p><p>We substantially reduced the number of plots, especially those with no significant linear correlation. We also changed the order of figures for <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments; now results from intact brains come first followed by results from brains with the lesion.</p><p><italic>4) It would strengthen the paper if the authors formally defined susceptibility and impairment as it related to their experiments and used these terms restrictively; i.e., specifically non-synonymously. There is some concern that the term cryptic is used somewhat misleadingly and could be dropped</italic>.</p><p>We have included these definitions in the beginning of the Results section:“In this study we use the term “impairment” to mean a decrease in the number of body flexions swim episode or in the number of VSI bursts per swim motor pattern and the term “susceptibility” for the likelihood of being impaired upon lesion or blockade of a commissure.” We reconsidered the word cryptic and changed it to “hidden”.</p><p><italic>The primary reviews (major concerns) are provided to the authors so that they can gain some insight into the consensus presented above. There are some additional insightful comments in these concerns that the authors should consider but they should focus on the consensus</italic>.</p><p><italic>Other issues to address:</italic></p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The authors describe experiments showing that individual variation in the strength of a key inhibitory synapse in a CPG circuit predicts the response of the individual to a specific injury to the network. Specifically, working with the escape swim CPG of the mollusk Tritonia diomedea they show individual variation in the response of intact animals or isolated nervous systems to cutting/blockade of the commissural nerve PdN6. They then show that the impairment brought on by the injury correlates inversely with the strength of an identified inhibitory synapse in the CPG network. Further they show that Dynamic Clamp addition or subtraction of this synapse can predictably reverse or enhance the response to disconnecting of PdN6</italic>.</p><p><italic>The paper is nicely illustrated and all necessary data are presented; in fact one might argue that too much data is presented. The writing is concise and clear, perhaps too concise, and the Discussion (the strongest part of the manuscript in terms of writing) is very illuminating. I encourage the authors to delete some of the extraneous data on spike direction in VSI and to add more explanation of the other data. There are scores of correlograms presented and oodles of statistics that make the text tedious without more rationale and explanation</italic>.</p><p><italic>The paper is highly interesting and innovative and provides a mechanistic explanation to why there are individual variations in the response of the nervous systems to injury. It should be of wide interest to the neuroscience community</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this praise.

In its present form this link appears indirect to me: How similar are network damages between stroke patients on the microlevel compared to the system studied? Which kind of traumatic brain injury would be comparable to axon lesions?</italic></p><p>We expanded our discussion of the types of lesions in mammalian systems that would be equivalent to the lesion we are studying here. It turns out that in stroke and trauma, much of the damage is to fibers of passage, which connect disparate brain areas. In this system, we are specifically severing axons of neurons that also connect disparate brain areas. An important difference is that this lesion is very specific and the neurons are identified so that we can directly study the effect on behavior.</p><p><italic>2) The authors report data on the analysis of the synaptic influences of the C2 on the VSI neuron. The presented data raise some questions. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9"><italic>Figures 8-9</italic></xref> <italic>C2 stimulation of some seconds induces very long lasting excitation in VSI neurons.

From the scheme in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref> <italic>the appearance of EPSPs in VSI neurons independent from activity in C2 is difficult to be explained. Are there other neurons are intercalated between C2 and VSI? Most of the long lasting late depolarization is not related to C2-activity. This prompts the question what these data contribute to the question in focus, i.e. how the weighting between spatially separated excitatory and inhibitory interactions between the C2 and the VSI neuron may contribute to the observed phenomenon. This is in particular relevant, because experiments were conducted, in which and polysynaptic interactions were excluded by means of high-divalent cation saline</italic>.</p><p>We have attempted to explain these recruited EPSPs better. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>–figure–supplement 1, we draw a simple circuit diagram explain how intercalated neurons could explain their appearance. The reason that we discuss these data in this study is that at first glance, this polysynaptic excitation might account for the individual variability. Instead, it turns out that it is the inhibition of VSI by C2 that prevents this recruited excitation from causing proximal excitation of VSI that is the most important.</p><p><italic>3) The authors analyze the amplitude of the EPSPs (e.g. Figure9).

It is simply the case that animals differ in the extent to which the proximal synapse is inhibitory. If it more inhibitory, it prevents the local recruitment of excitatory inputs onto VSI by C2.
