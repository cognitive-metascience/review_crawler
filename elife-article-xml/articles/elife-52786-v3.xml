However, there are downsides associated with the need to provide a substrate to these reporters, including its high cost and non-uniform tissue penetration. In this work we reconstitute a fungal bioluminescence pathway (FBP) <italic>in planta</italic> using a composable toolbox of parts. We demonstrate that the FBP can create luminescence across various tissues in a broad range of plants without external substrate addition. We also show how our toolbox can be used to deploy the FBP <italic>in planta</italic> to build auto-luminescent reporters for the study of gene-expression and hormone fluxes. A low-cost imaging platform for gene expression profiling is also described. These experiments lay the groundwork for future construction of programmable auto-luminescent plant traits, such as light driven plant-pollinator interactions or light emitting plant-based sensors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals have evolved the capacity to produce light from chemical reactions. For example, an enzyme known as luciferase in fireflies produces light by acting on a molecule called luciferin.</p><p>Scientists have identified the enzymes that drive several of these systems and used them to build reporters that can study the activity of genes in the tissues of plants and other lifeforms over space and time. However, these reporters often require chemicals to be added to the tissues to produce light. These chemicals tend to be expensive and may not penetrate evenly into the tissues of interest, limiting the potential applications of the reporters in research studies.</p><p>Recently, it has been discovered that fungi have a bioluminescence pathway that converts a molecule known as caffeic acid into luciferin. Caffeic acid is a common molecule in plants, therefore, it is possible the fungal bioluminescence pathway could be used to build reporters that produce light without needing the addition of chemicals.</p><p>Now, Khakhar et al. have inserted the genes that encode the enzymes of the fungal bioluminescence pathway into tobacco plants. The experiments found that this was sufficient to turn caffeic acid into molecules of luciferin which are able to produce light. Inserting the same genes into several other plant species, including tomatoes and dahlias, produced similar results. Further experiments showed that the fungal bioluminescence pathway can be used to build reporters that monitor the activity of plant genes throughout living tissues and over a period of several days as well as examine the response to plant hormones.</p><p>Alongside studying the activities of genes in plants, Khakhar et al. propose that the toolkit developed in this work could be used to generate plants with luminescence that can be switched on or off as desired. This could have many uses including helping plants attract insects to pollinate flowers and building plant biosensors that emit light in response to environmental signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bioluminescence</kwd><kwd>luciferase</kwd><kwd><italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic></kwd><kwd>hormone reporters</kwd><kwd>expression reporter</kwd><kwd>plant synthetic biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007249</institution-id><institution>University of Minnesota</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grand Challenges Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khakhar</surname><given-names>Arjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM079712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Nayoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003627</institution-id><institution>Rural Development Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJ013386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Nayoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0018277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Starker</surname><given-names>Colby G</given-names></name><name><surname>Chamness</surname><given-names>James C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fungal bioluminescence pathway can be reconstituted in planta to create luminescence in many plant species without external substrate addition, and be used to design customizable reporters of gene-expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bioluminescence is used by a diverse set of organisms to achieve a broad range of goals, such as attracting mates, scaring off predators and recruiting other creatures to spread spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shimomura, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wainwright and Longo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Verdes and Gruber, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Labella et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanism of light emission is broadly conserved: an enzymatic oxidation reaction by a luciferase enzyme turns a luciferin substrate into a high energy intermediate, which decays to produce light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shimomura, 2006</xref>). Several different luciferin substrate-luciferase enzyme pairs have been described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Oba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schultz et al., 2018</xref>). Researchers have leveraged some enzymes, such as the firefly and Renilla luciferases, to build reporters to study gene expression in plants and other eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Khakhar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wend et al., 2013</xref>). These reporters have a high signal to noise ratio because plants produce effectively no background bioluminescence signal.</p><p>Additionally, thanks to its water-soluble luciferin substrate, firefly luciferase can be used to visualize dynamic changes in gene expression in plants in a non-invasive manner, theoretically enabling whole-plant time lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Khakhar et al., 2018</xref>). However, current bioluminescent reporters do present some significant challenges, which has limited their broad application for macro scale visualization of gene expression. One major challenge is uniform delivery and penetration of the luciferin substrate, especially in adult plant tissues. Some luciferins, such as coelenterazine â the substrate for Renilla luciferase â are non-water soluble and cannot be used for imaging without cell-lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wend et al., 2013</xref>). The luciferin for firefly luciferase, D-luciferin, is water soluble and can be topically applied to whole plants or delivered through watering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">RellÃ¡n-Ãlvarez et al., 2015</xref>). However, uniform substrate delivery is challenging to achieve, making it difficult to disambiguate whether an absence of bioluminescent signal is due to low luciferase expression or poor substrate delivery. Additionally, the relatively high cost of D-luciferin (up to several hundred dollars per gram) makes continuous whole-plant imaging a prohibitively expensive practice.</p><p>To avoid the need to deliver the luciferin substrate, an optimal solution would be to engineer plants such that the substrate is produced in every cell. Krichevsky et al. demonstrated one approach to achieve this by incorporating the lux operon from the prokaryote <italic>Photobacterium leiognathi</italic> into the chloroplast genome in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krichevsky et al., 2010</xref>). While auto-luminescence was observed, this approach is extremely challenging to extend to other plants due to the technical challenges of plastid transformation. Plastid localization is necessary, as the luciferin substrate produced by this pathway is toxic in some eukaryotic systems when nuclearly encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hollis et al., 2001</xref>). In their 2018 paper, Kotlobay et al. identified a fungal bioluminescence pathway (FBP) consisting of a set of three genes sufficient to convert caffeic acid, a common plant metabolite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kotlobay et al., 2018</xref>), into a luciferin molecule. The paired luciferase, <italic>Luz</italic>, can oxidize the luciferin and generate a bioluminescent signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kotlobay et al., 2018</xref>). This pathway can be nuclearly encoded, overcoming the challenges associated with plastid transformation. Additionally, the luciferase produces light in the green spectrum, which minimizes absorption by the predominant plant pigment, chlorophyll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaskova et al., 2017</xref>). This also makes it spectrally separable from the other major luciferase-based reporters, such as firefly luciferase, enabling the parallel deployment of both these reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaskova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this report we sought to reconstitute the FBP in planta and to test if natively produced caffeic acid could be channeled to generate bioluminescence. We also tested whether the FBP functioned across plant species, and if it could be used to study spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. Further, we describe a toolkit of reagents to easily generate FBP-based reporters. We demonstrate how this toolkit can be deployed to generate programmable auto-luminescence patterns in planta and to build plant-based biosensors with luminescent outputs that do not require external substrate addition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of the fungal bioluminescence pathway in planta</title><p>To test if the fungal bioluminescence pathway described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kotlobay et al.

We chose <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> because <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> infiltration provides an easy way to transiently express genes. We synthesized codon-optimized versions of the three genes necessary to convert caffeic acid into 3-hydroxyhispidin: 4â²-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (<italic>NPGA</italic>) from <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, hispidin-3-hydroxylase (<italic>H3H</italic>) from <italic>Neonothopanus nambi</italic>, and a polyketide synthase (<italic>Hisps</italic>) also from <italic>N. nambi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kotlobay et al., 2018</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These DNA sequences were domesticated to remove commonly used type II-S restriction enzyme recognition sites, and made compatible with the MoClo plasmid assembly kit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Engler et al., 2014</xref>). This kit enables rapid swapping of promoters and terminators to create custom expression cassettes, which can be easily assembled into a single T-DNA with a one-step GoldenGate reaction. Together, our new components comprise a toolbox of vectors to construct FBPs for constitutive or spatio-temporally regulated auto-luminescence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The fungal bioluminescence pathway creates auto-luminescence when transiently or stably expressed.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Schematic of the chemical reactions driving the generation of auto-luminescence in planta.Â Caffeic acid produced by the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway is converted to Hispidin by <italic>Hisps</italic> once it is post-translationally activated by <italic>NPGA</italic>.

leaves were imaged three days after delivery of the FBP via Agrobacterium infiltration, significant bioluminescence was observed over background at the site of infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C,D</xref>). This demonstrates the pathway can produce bioluminescence using natively synthesized caffeic acid. Comparing luminescence from leaves with the complete pathway versus controls with missing pathway enzymes, a bioluminescence signal was only observed with the complete pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). This indicates no native enzymes are expressed at functional levels in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves that could complement the functions of the FBP enzymes absent in these incomplete pathways. We also observed no bioluminescence from confluent cultures of Agrobacterium carrying the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), implying the observed bioluminescent signal was not from expression of this pathway in Agrobacterium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Incorporation of spent luciferin recycling pathway prolongs transient auto-luminescence</title><p>In their paper, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kotlobay et al., 2018</xref>). also describe an additional enzyme, caffeylpyruvate hydrolase (<italic>CPH</italic>), which recycles the spent luciferin, caffeylpyruvic acid, back to the substrate for the pathway, caffeic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We reasoned that incorporating this enzyme into our reconstituted pathway would create a stronger bioluminescence signal, due to a higher substrate concentration, and potentially prolong the presence of transient bioluminescence from Agrobacterium infiltration. To test this hypothesis, a new pathway was built with all the enzymes described above and an additional expression cassette for <italic>CPH</italic>. When we compared luminescence from Agrobacterium infiltrated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves, we observed approximately equal signals at four days, consistent with initial saturating substrate conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). At later time points we saw higher mean luminescence signal from leaves infiltrated with the <italic>CPH</italic> containing pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that when the substrate is limited, the presence of a recycling pathway improves the bioluminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Based on these results, all further experiments used FBPs including the recycling enzyme, <italic>CPH</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stable integration of the fungal bioluminescence pathway creates auto-luminescent plants</title><p>Our experiments thus far implied that auto-luminescent plants could be created by stably integrating expression cassettes for the three enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway, <italic>NPGA</italic>, <italic>H3H</italic>, and <italic>Hisps</italic>, the recycling pathway, <italic>CPH</italic>, and the fungal luciferase, <italic>Luz</italic>. We used the FBP characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (FBP-6) to generate a stable transgenic line of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. When luminescence was characterized in plants on rooting medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>) or soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B</xref>), we observed auto-luminescence throughout the plant. Stronger signals were observed in the root tips and shoot apical meristem, consistent with a higher density of cells in these tissues. Younger leaves also seemed to have lower luminescence than older leaves, indicating there is some developmentally consistent heterogeneity in luciferin substrate biosynthesis, potentially due to variation in caffeic acid availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). These results demonstrate it is possible to create sustained auto-luminescence by generating plants with stably integrated FPBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expression of a caffeic acid biosynthesis pathway increases luminescence</title><p>Caffeic acid is a requisite intermediate of lignin biosynthesis and is thus ubiquitous in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Davin and Lewis, 1992</xref>). However, caffeic acid levels may vary between tissues and under different environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mitiouchkina et al., 2019</xref>) This variation could complicate deployment of FBP reporters for gene expression. One solution might be to constitutively express enzymes that synthesize caffeic acid from a widely available plant metabolite. To test this, we built a T-DNA to constitutively express the <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic> tyrosine ammonia lyase and two <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase components (HpaB, HpaC). Together these enzymes are known to catalyze caffeic acid synthesis from tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kotlobay et al., 2018</xref>). Upon infiltration of this construct into leaves of a <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> line stably expressing the FBP, a significant increase in bioluminescence signal was observed compared to empty vector controls infiltrated in parallel on different sections of the same leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Auto-luminescence in different plant species</title><p>While <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> is an excellent model for prototyping, FBP should work in any plant species as long as appropriate promoters and terminators are used to express the pathway enzymes and as caffeic acid is ubiquitous in higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Davin and Lewis, 1992</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we tested the FBP in multiple plant species that were amenable to Agrobacterium infiltration. We performed transient Agrobacterium-based delivery of the FBP into the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and the crop plant <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> (tomato) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). We observed robust auto-luminescence signal over background in the cotyledons of treated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We also performed Agrobacterium infiltrations of the leaves of the ornamental plant, Dahlia, and again observed auto-luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, we explored if the FBP was functional in petals, as luminescence in this tissue has future applications in floriculture as well as for engineering plant-pollinator interactions. Agrobacterium infiltrations with the FBP of petals from <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (periwinkle), <italic>Petunia hybrida</italic>, and three different varieties of <italic>Rosa rubiginosa</italic> (Rose) resulted in auto-luminescence in all flowers with a range of intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also observed that the signal dropped off within a day of the flowers being detached from the plant body, whereas it persisted when the flowers remained connected to the plant body. This might mean some of the pathway substrates or co-factors are trafficked from source tissues; however, more tests are required to confirm this hypothesis.

The approach also does not suffer from the issues associated with current bioluminescent reporters, including substrate application and non-uniform substrate penetration. To validate that the FBP can be used to study spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression, we built a pathway variant in which <italic>Luz</italic> expression was driven by the promoter of the <italic>ODORANT1</italic> (<italic>ODO1</italic>) gene from petunia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fenske et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Van Moerkercke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Verdonk et al., 2005</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This gene has been previously characterized in petunia with a firefly luciferase reporter, where its expression was observed only in the flowers. <italic>ODO1</italic> expression was also shown to be diurnal, peaking in the evening at the transition of day to night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fenske et al., 2015</xref>). We used Agrobacterium infiltration to deliver two versions of FBP to petunia flower petals: one with <italic>Luz</italic> expressed from the <italic>ODO1</italic> promoter (pODO1), and the other with <italic>Luz</italic> expressed from the constitutive 35S promoter. We then performed time course imaging of detached flowers. In the flowers treated with the pODO1<italic>:Luz</italic> we observed an increase in luminescence in the evening at the transition between day and night, a trend not seen in the 35S<italic>:Luz</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>).</p><p>Visualizing multiple diurnal oscillations in flowers is technically challenging, as the auto-luminescence signal only lasts approximately one day after the flower is separated from the plant body, a requirement for mounting in the imaging platform. To overcome this limitation, we infiltrated two sets of flowers 24 hr apart and then harvested tissue and began time course imaging on the same day. In this way we were able to quantify luminescence signal from the pODO1<italic>:Luz</italic> and p35:<italic>Luz</italic> constructs over a two-day period post-infiltration. We observed the expected luminescence signal peak at the transition between day and night both one and two days after infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), with a diminishing signal over time, which can be explained by the gradual loss of T-DNA expression over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Norkunas et al., 2018</xref>) and gradual senescence of the detached flower. In contrast, the p35S:<italic>Luz</italic> controls showed an initial increase over time until maximal T-DNA expression was reached â crucially, not at the day-night transition â followed by a steady decrease, again attributed to T-DNA loss and senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). When we plot the time at which we observe peak luminescence signal in these time course experiments, we observe that the signal from the pODO1:<italic>Luz</italic> constructs peak around the expected time, at the transition of day to night, in contrast to the p35S controls, which do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). At 1 day post infiltration this trend is visible but not significant, potentially due to the initial variability in Agrobacterium delivery and associated expression of the delivered genes, but by two days post infection we see a significant difference between the time of peak signal of pODO1:<italic>Luz</italic> and the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This difference in the temporal pattern of luminescence between pODO1:<italic>Luz</italic> and p35S:<italic>Luz</italic> indicates that the observed diurnal oscillations are not due to natural variation in the availability of caffeic acid, and highlights the importance of running parallel constitutive promoter controls for proper interpretation of FBP reporters. These results demonstrate that the FBP can be used in a similar fashion to firefly luciferase to study spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression, but without requiring substrate addition. The experiments also serve as proof-of-concept that, by using an appropriate set of promoters to drive the pathway genes, an FBP can be programmed to generate specific spatio-temporal patterns of auto-luminescence in stable transgenic lines for synthetic biology applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Visualizing hormone signaling dynamics in planta</title><p>Hormones coordinate diverse aspects of plant metabolism and development by carrying information from cell to cell across tissues and organ systems in the plant.

One set of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants was not watered for several days whereas another set was kept well-watered. The pRAB18 driven FBP was delivered to leaves of these plants via Agrobacterium infiltration. Leaves were then detached and imaged over time; however, leaves from the unwatered plants were allowed to desiccate further, while the other set was kept moist. We expected that as the leaves dried, they would begin to produce ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ramachandra Reddy et al., 2004</xref>), leading to an increase in luminescence. In fact, we observed a significant increase in luminescence in desiccating leaves, up to levels of the unwatered p35S:<italic>Luz</italic> positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We did not see a similar increase in signal from pRAB18 driven FBP in leaves that were kept moist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We repeated the experiment without detaching the infiltrated leaves from the plant body and again observed an increase in luminescence in the leaf infiltrated with pRAB18 driven FBP on the unwatered plant over time, as compared to the watered plant control, which showed no increase in luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>).

The substrate independence of the FBP makes it more economical than other bioluminescent systems. However, the high cost and small chamber size of commercially available luminescence imaging setups make running multiple experiments in parallel cost prohibitive: such commercial systems can exceed $100,000 USD. To address this challenge, we leveraged a wealth of open-source software and off-the-shelf hardware components to design and build a low cost, modular platform for bioluminescence imaging. Our platform uses a Raspberry Pi single board computer as a controller for a DSLR camera, outfitted with a macro lens and mounted in either a dark room or pop-up plant growth tent. The code used for controlling customized still and time-course imaging with this platform, as well as the image processing pipeline, is available on Github (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The entire cost comes to less than $2,500, the bulk of which is for the camera and lens; substituting an entry-level DSLR and kit lens would bring the cost below $2000. Programmatic control of the setup can be conducted directly on the Pi, or from any networked computer.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Components for DSLR-Based Imaging Platform.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Source</th><th valign="top"/><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">Hardware</td></tr><tr><td>RaspberryPi 3 Complete Starter Kit</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-starter-kit.html">CanaKit</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$75</td></tr><tr><td>Canon EOS 80D DSLR</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-80d">Canon</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$1100</td></tr><tr><td>Canon AC adapter and DC coupler</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1278814-REG/canon_ac_e6n_ac_adapter_and.html">B and</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1278814-REG/canon_ac_e6n_ac_adapter_and.html">H Photo</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>EF 100 mm f/2.8 Macro Lens</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/macro/ef-100mm-f-2-8-macro-usm/ef-100mm-f2-8-macro-usm">Canon</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>Tripod</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-60-Inch-Lightweight-Tripod-Bag/dp/B005KP473Q?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&amp;tag=duckduckgo-d-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B005KP473Q">Amazon</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$25</td></tr><tr><td>Controllabe 4-Outlet Power Relay</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2935">Adafruit</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$25</td></tr><tr><td>Jumper cables</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-CP-004-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1543964906&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;keywords=jumper+cables+female+to+female&amp;psc=1">Amazon</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td>Pop-up plant growing tents</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/Zazzy-Plant-Growing-Hydroponic-Indoor/dp/B074J3P3NX/ref=sr_1_3?crid=31HIRIJ6Q6JQM&amp;keywords=zazzy+plant+growing+tents&amp;qid=1565145613&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=zazzy+pl%2Caps%2C233&amp;sr=8-3">Zazzy</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>$153</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Software</td></tr><tr><td>RPi.GPIO</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/">https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>Free</td></tr><tr><td>gphoto2</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gphoto.org/">http://gphoto.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>Free</td></tr><tr><td>ImageJ</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>Free</td></tr><tr><td>ffmpeg</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ffmpeg.org/">https://ffmpeg.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>Free</td></tr><tr><td>Python wrappers</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/craftyKraken/P4">https://github.com/craftyKraken/P4</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>With programmatically controlled long exposures and a tripod stabilizer, the DSLR camera provides high resolution and detail for macroscopic plant subjects under multiple light conditions, and sufficient sensitivity to capture the bioluminescence signal from stable or transient expression of the FBP. We do observe higher levels of thermodynamic noise than with cooled CCD camera setups, but this is easily filtered using open-source software such as ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For comparison, a side-by-side example is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The same periwinkle petal infiltration was imaged under first the CCD camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and then the DSLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The DSLR captured high resolution, true color images under both the light and dark conditions, while showing similar light sensitivity to the reporter.</p><p>In contrast to all-in-one tabletop chamber systems, our setup with a dark room or pop-up tent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Katagiri et al., 2015</xref>) permits imaging of much larger plants and flexible positioning of the camera relative to the subject. For example, we took images of flower petal infiltrations on intact rose bushes a meter in height. These features make our platform a compelling alternative to commercially available systems at a fraction of the cost. We used this platform to capture high-resolution images of various plant subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), and to perform time-course imaging for an FBP under an <italic>AtRAB18</italic> drought-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>). These results illustrate how our platform, in conjunction with the FBP, enable low cost bioluminescence reporting for dynamic biological phenomena.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we demonstrate that the FBP can convert a common plant metabolite, caffeic acid, into a luciferin and use it to produce robust luminescence in planta. We go on to show how the FBP is a useful addition to the bioluminescent reporters available for plants. Because it emits in the green spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaskova et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Luz</italic> should be spectrally separable from firefly luciferase, permitting parallel deployment. Our observation that incorporating the recycling pathway prolongs the luminescent signal suggests an avenue to enable long term imaging without substrate depletion in stable lines. This may also explain why we observed stronger luminescence in infiltrated tissue than in the stable transgenic line. However, this might also be due to overexpression of the enzymes from high-copy delivery of the T-DNAs in our transient leaf infiltration assay. Thus, further optimizing the expression of the enzymes in the FBP might be another avenue to increase the luminescence. Such re-engineering can easily be implemented with our FBP toolkit, thanks to modular design and assembly within the MoClo system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Engler et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our observations from transient expression of a caffeic acid biosynthesis pathway in stable transgenic lines expressing the FBP highlight increasing the available caffeic acid in target tissues as another potential avenue for increasing the strength of auto-luminescence generated by the FBP. In the future this pathway might be used in conjunction with the FBP to create reporters that are more robust against natural variation in caffeic acid biosynthesis.</p><p>Transient expression assays demonstrate that the FBP functions in a broad range of plant species. With the recent development of rapid morphogen-mediated plant transgenesis protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lowe et al., 2018</xref>), we believe FBP-based biosensors and reporters can be extended across a range of plants for long term visualization of gene expression. This extensibility to a broad range of plants makes this approach to auto-luminescence superior to the existing transplastomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Krichevsky et al., 2010</xref>), as plastid transformation is technically challenging and currently limited to species such as tobacco and a few related <italic>Solanaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rigano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results with the pODO1 driven <italic>Luz</italic> in petunia flowers demonstrate how the FBP can be used to study the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression, reporting the same patterns of gene expression as a firefly luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fenske et al., 2015</xref>), but without the requirement for substrate addition. Compared to these previously published luciferase reporters, which are typically provided an excess of substrate during application, we observe a lower amplitude response with our FBP reporters, which rely on an endogenously synthesized luciferin substrate. This highlights the scope for additional reporter optimization by increasing the pool of available substrate, potentially through manipulation of caffeic acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Further characterization of the stability of the Luz protein will be needed to determine the temporal resolution of FBP-based reporters. However, the data presented here do show that our FBP reporters can be used to visualize changes in gene expression that occur on the timescale of hours. The development of stable FBP transgenic lines here and in parallel work by Mitiouchkina et al. demonstrate how our FBP tools could be applied in the future to visualize gene expression in various tissues over the lifetime of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mitiouchkina et al., 2019</xref>), and thus lower the cost of performing these types of experiments. Further, the data show how by swapping promoters in the pathway, spatio-temporal patterns of auto-luminescence can be programmed into plants for synthetic biology applications. In its natural context, the FBP is used by fungi to generate luminescence to lure insects that spread their spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>). It may then be possible to engineer plants with sufficiently bright auto-luminescent flowers to attract nocturnal insects, and thereby drive novel plant-pollinator interactions. Bioluminescent flowers would also have relevance for designer floriculture, and might serve as a visually compelling demonstration of the power of synthetic biology to the public. We plan to generate stable FBP petunia lines and explore this avenue of research further in the future.</p><p>The data we present using the pRAB18-driven <italic>Luz</italic> to track drought stress via ABA signaling demonstrates how the FBP could be used to build biosensors for internal or external signals by driving genes in the pathway with synthetic promoters. In the future, stable lines generated with similar constructs could be deployed to monitor the environmental impact on plants at field scales. These biosensors would have an output more easily visualized than fluorescent reporters, have a high signal to noise ratio, and be cost effective due to their substrate independence. Thanks to the ease of promoter swapping in our FBP toolkit, this approach could be easily extended to build biosensors for a range of different phytohormones, environmental cues like light, or synthetic signaling systems for basic science and translational applications.</p><p>Besides the substrate costs, the high cost of commercially available bioluminescence imaging systems restrict access to luminescence-based reporters. We demonstrate how commercially available photography equipment and open-source software can be used to set up a relatively low-cost, modular and programmable luminescence imaging platform. Coupled with the substrate independence of the FBP, this will broaden access to these tools to lower resource settings, and enable scalable application of these reporters. We hope the work presented here will serve as a first step for the creation of novel bioluminescence-based tools in plants for basic science discovery and synthetic biology enabled applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>FBP plasmid construction</title><p>The various FBP-encoding T-DNA constructs characterized in this work were built using a two-step process. First, base plasmids containing an expression cassette were built for each of the five enzymes in the FBP. These base plasmids were designed with promoters for either constitutive or tissue/time-period specific expression of the FBP, sourced either from the MoClo toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Engler et al., 2014</xref>) or amplified from genomic or plasmid DNA with primers adding the appropriate BsaI restriction enzyme recognition sites.

customizable auto-luminescent luciferase-based reporters in plants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Amasino as Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>First, the reasons we think this is an interesting Tools and Resources article. Bioluminance-based reporters have proven extremely useful for non-invasive and dynamic imaging of plant gene expression. One of the most powerful features of luminance reporters, as opposed to fluorescence reporters, is zero background. However, luminance reporters, such as luciferase, require a chemical substrate to generate light. Some substrates, such as D-luciferin are water soluble and can be applied to whole plants by watering, but these substrates are quite expensive, limiting the practicality of repeated imaging and longer-term dynamic studies. In addition, there can be questions about the contributions of differences in gene expression as opposed to differential substrate penetration in variation of signal strength. One solution to these challenges is to introduce a biochemical pathway to synthesize the luciferase substrate in planta from endogenous metabolites, has been done recently for the substrate of firefly luciferase in Nicotiana. However, this pathway requires transformation into plastids to be operational, which is challenging to do in most plants. Here the authors take advantage of a recently described fungal bioluminance pathway (FBP) that can be expressed in the nucleus and which utilizes a common plant metabolite, caffeic acid, to synthesize the substrate for the fungal luciferase <italic>Luz</italic>. They demonstrate that this complete pathway can be reconstituted in stable transgenic plants and can utilize native caffeic acid to generate luminance, improve the output by engineering a recycling pathway for the Lux substrate, show that the pathway can operate successfully in several plant species (most by transient expression), demonstrate utility of the tool for studying variance in gene expression over space and time, and report a versatile molecular toolkit for making luminance reporters. In addition, the authors develop and demonstrate a low-cost imaging platform utilizing consumer cameras and very inexpensive computational hardware for conducting bioluminance experiments, potentially enabling this technology for a wider range of users.</p><p>However, to be most useful to the scientific community there are several issues that need to be better addressed before we can accept your paper as discussed below.</p><p>You argue convincingly for the potential applications of your approach to luminescence imaging, but need to also clearly discuss the limitations and drawbacks-clarify what the technology will not be immediately useful for and the drawbacks of using this pathway as opposed to using exogenous luciferin as substrate for luciferase based reporter studies.</p><p>For example, you note that unlike luciferin delivery, which would not have even delivery across cells and tissues, your system will be in every cell and therefore be an improvement (Introduction). However, would not uneven distribution of the substrates for your luciferin biosynthetic cycle would lead to artefactual variation on top of any reporter dynamics being detected Also, uneven expression of the enzymes would lead to the same type of problems.</p><p>A complement to discussing possible limitations would be a more careful characterization of individual plants imaged with sufficient resolution to judge spatial heterogeneity. A time-lapse experiment to judge temporal heterogeneity in the stable transgenics would also be valuable.</p><p>Finally, regarding &quot;Similar patterns of expression are observed in root tips of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> with constitutively expressed firefly luciferase,&quot; you should compare your luminescence to that of published luciferase reporters provided with luciferin so if arguing similar patterns you can show the supporting results at higher resolution in the stable tobacco transgenics.</p><p>Related to the above point, although the ability to use endogenous caffeic acid is a boon for reducing costs and enabling longer and more detailed dynamic studies, there remain questions about the possible variance in caffeic acid availability over tissues and time, and how such variance might affect experimental outcomes and interpretation.

If substrate is limiting, such variation would be convolved with changes in reporter protein levels. Addition of substrate recycling helps assure higher substrate levels and is an important addition to the toolkit.

The data in 3C have 7 repeats, which is far better, but do not show a control for the promoter used (like 35S). So both experiments are incomplete.
