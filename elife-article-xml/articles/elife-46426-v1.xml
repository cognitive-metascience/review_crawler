Tooth root shapes are finely tuned to provide precise occlusal support to facilitate the function of each tooth type. However, the mechanism regulating tooth root patterning and development is largely unknown. In this study, we provide the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme determines patterning and furcation formation during dental root development in mouse molars. Mechanistically, an antagonistic interaction between epigenetic regulators Ezh2 and Arid1a controls Cdkn2a expression in the dental mesenchyme to regulate dental root patterning and development. These findings indicate the importance of balanced epigenetic regulation in determining the tooth root pattern and the integration of roots with the jaw bones to achieve physiological function. Collectively, our study provides important clues about the regulation of organogenesis and has general implications for tooth regeneration in the future.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46426.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Different teeth have different numbers of roots.

The tooth root is essential for these functions because it anchors the tooth to the jaw bone. During mastication, the root transmits and balances occlusal forces to the jaw bone through the periodontal ligament (PDL). The neurovascular bundle, which supplies blood flow, nutrition, and sensation to our teeth, also runs through the tooth root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The loss of a functional root therefore reduces bone support to the tooth and adversely affects function of the dentition. Understanding how this organ patterning is determined will also provide information about organismic fitness through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Irvine and Harvey, 2015</xref>). Teeth are the most common primate fossil remains due to their resistance to degradation; thus, morphological analysis of the tooth root can also provide critical clues about hominid evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Emonet et al., 2014</xref>). For example, a reduction in the number of premolar roots can be observed already in early hominins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Emonet and Kullmer, 2014</xref>). Neanderthal molars show elongated root trunks and apically positioned root furcations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kupczik and Hublin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macchiarelli et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, investigating root development offers unique insights into organogenesis and human evolution.</p><p>Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are required for root development and integration with the jawbone. The tooth root begins to develop with the guidance of a bilayered structure called Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath (HERS). The cranial neural crest cell (CNCC)-derived mesenchyme forms the dental papilla and dental follicle. The mesenchyme of the apical papilla interacts with the inner layer of HERS and differentiates into odontoblasts that form dentin. The dental follicle also interacts with HERS and eventually produces the cementum, PDL, and adjacent alveolar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of the interaction between HERS and the dental papilla or dental follicle leads to root development defects. For instance, if there is a disturbance to the developing HERS, differentiation of root odontoblasts will be compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). HERS has been considered critical for determination of the tooth root number. It develops tongue-shaped epithelial protrusions (known as the epithelial diaphragm) that join horizontally to form a bridge, called the furcation, which constitutes the base of the pulp cavity and divides the roots. After the furcation forms, the apical growth of HERS drives root development in multi-rooted teeth, just as it does in single-rooted teeth. The different orientations of HERS in different types of teeth contribute to the formation of two-rooted lower molars, three-rooted upper molars, and single-rooted incisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms involved in HERS regulation of furcation development remain unknown. Although previous studies have shown that changes in cell proliferation activity in the dental mesenchyme can lead to furcation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fons Romero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sohn et al., 2014</xref>), it is not clear whether the instructions that ultimately determine root furcation development and number reside in the dental mesenchyme or epithelium.</p><p>Recently, multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in the processes of root initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaqeeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ono et al., 2016</xref>), but how the number of tooth roots is determined remains unknown. Ezh2 is the enzymatic subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a complex that methylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) to promote transcriptional silencing. Polycomb proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of chromatin regulators that serve to establish and maintain epigenetic memory during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). Previous reports have indicated that craniofacial bone and cartilage formation are not detectable after loss of Ezh2 in neural crest cells, indicating a critical role for Ezh2 in the determination of the osteochondrogenic lineage during craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwarz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The function of Ezh2 has recently been reported to be antagonized by other epigenetic factors. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes remodel nucleosomes and modulate gene transcription. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, antagonism between polycomb and SWI/SNF complexes has been shown to regulate gene expression during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kennison and Tamkun, 1988</xref>). In humans, PRC2 and SWI/SNF complexes also antagonize each other during tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kadoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kadoch et al., 2017</xref>). For example, Ezh2 inhibition leads to regression of ovarian tumors with mutations in Arid1a (a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bitler et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether and how these two opposing epigenetic regulating complexes regulate developmental patterning and morphogenesis in mammals still remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we found that loss of Ezh2 in the tooth mesenchyme dramatically affects root patterning by transforming multi-rooted mouse molars into single-rooted ones, indicating a critical role for Ezh2 in determination of the molar root number via regulation of furcation development. In contrast, root furcation development was delayed after loss of Ezh2 in the epithelium and was unaffected after loss of Ezh2 in odontoblasts, suggesting that regulation of furcation development is determined through a mesenchymal signal. Significantly, Ezh2 and Arid1a work antagonistically to control Cdkn2a expression to coordinate furcation development and determine the root number. Our results have shown for the first time that the antagonistic interaction between Ezh2 and Arid1a plays a key role in regulating organogenesis in mammals. These findings provide a new understanding of the mechanism governing molar root number determination and may lead to applications for tooth regeneration in the future. Given that Neanderthal molars have long root trunks and delayed furcation formation in comparison to those of modern humans, our study highlights the significance of epigenetic regulation for the patterning of organs during human evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme plays a key role in root patterning and furcation formation during molar root development</title><p>Ezh2 is a key enzyme of the PRC2 complex that is responsible for trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27Me3). In order to investigate the role of Ezh2 in epigenetically regulating root patterning during tooth morphogenesis, we first analyzed the expression pattern of Ezh2 in developing molars. We found that Ezh2 is widely expressed in the dental epithelium, dental follicle, and dental papilla of control mice prior to root development initiation at the newborn stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). H3K27Me3 was detectable in a similar pattern to that of Ezh2 in control mice, consistent with Ezh2’s execution of a PRC2-dependent function during molar development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

During the formation of branched organs, the mesenchyme can instruct the epithelium to form branching patterns. For example, various types of signaling in the mesenchyme, including WNT, hedgehog (HH) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), play important roles in regulating branch patterning and morphogenesis in the salivary gland, kidney and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu and Werb, 2008</xref>). Similarly, epithelial-mesenchymal interaction is also crucial for tooth root patterning and morphogenesis. Previous studies have suggested that the pattern of HERS growth may correlate with the number, length, and shape of roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumakami-Sakano et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, HERS provides instructive signals that contribute to the induction of dental mesenchyme differentiation, suggesting that it functions as a signaling center to guide root formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>). For example, HERS-derived TGFβ/BMP signaling regulates root dentin formation through Nfic expression in the dental mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that the pattern of the cervical epithelial diaphragm may guide furcation formation, and signals from HERS may have a critical impact on determination of the root number. For instance, the Eda pathway is specifically active in HERS in mouse molars. Cell proliferation activity is altered in the dental mesenchyme in <italic>Eda</italic> mutant molars with delayed furcation formation, suggesting that epithelial-derived signals may regulate furcation development through epithelial-mesenchymal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fons Romero et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have begun to explore the role of the dental mesenchyme in regulating root patterning and furcation development. The directionality of HERS growth may be regulated by differential proliferation of mesenchymal cells in furcation-forming and root-forming regions, which in turn determines root number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sohn et al., 2014</xref>). However, the key determinant for root patterning remained unknown.</p><p>In this study, we found that loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in the tooth mesenchyme transformed multi-rooted molars into single-rooted ones in the mouse, suggesting the significance of the dental mesenchyme in regulating root pattern and furcation development. In contrast, loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in the dental epithelium resulted in delayed furcation development without affecting root patterning. These data suggest that signals from the mesenchyme, rather than the epithelium, are the driving force behind tooth patterning. It is possible that loss of Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme affects the growth of HERS through mesenchymal-epithelial interaction. This is highlighted by the phenotype in which the epithelial diaphragm fails to fuse at the future furcation site in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Previous studies have also highlighted that root defects are mainly related to signaling alterations in the mesenchyme rather than the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, in humans, mutations adversely affecting the dental mesenchyme are closely associated with tooth root defects. For example, dentinogenesis imperfecta type I (attributed to mutations in <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic>) and dentinogenesis imperfecta type II (caused by mutations in <italic>DSPP</italic>) both involve root defects. Furthermore, X-linked hypophosphatemia (linked to mutations in <italic>PHEX</italic>), which results in hypomineralized dentin and enlarged pulp cavities, results in a phenotype similar to taurodontism without apical displacement of the furcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Taking all these lines of evidence together, we conclude that mesenchyme-derived signals are the key determinant of root patterning.</p><p>It is interesting to note that dental cusp and root patterning can be regulated independently because loss of Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme does not adversely affect dental cusp patterning though it results in a root patterning defect. Importantly, alveolar bone formation is intimately linked to root patterning and development. It is well known that proper integration between the dental root and alveolar bone is of paramount importance for our dentition. Future study will allow us to investigate whether there are common or predetermined progenitor cells that contribute both to root and alveolar bone formation. Osr2-Cre is active in the dental mesenchyme including both the dental follicle and dental papilla. The dental follicle gives rise to periodontal tissues such as alveolar bone and PDL, which have a critical impact on tooth root development and tooth eruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takahashi et al., 2019</xref>), implying the interaction between periodontal tissue and tooth root development. In our study, loss of alveolar bone and PDL in the mouse molar correlated with the observed root furcation defect. However, whether the alveolar bone and PDL defects are primary malformations or the result of root furcation defect still needs to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Epigenetic factors in regulating organ patterning and development</title><p>Although various signaling pathways have been reported to play crucial roles in organ patterning and morphogenesis, such as BMP, TGFβ, WNT, FGF, and HH, the function of epigenetic regulation in organ patterning is largely unknown. The antagonism between PRCs and SWI/SNF complexes is crucial in both development and disease. For example, SWI/SNF antagonizes Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression and suppresses Cyclin E transcription, arresting the cell division of myogenic precursors during muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel, 2015</xref>). In human malignant rhabdoid tumors, loss of SMARCB1 (a subunit of SWI/SNF) leads to Polycomb-mediated repression of genes that suppress proliferation; when SMARCB1 is re-expressed, Polycomb is removed from the chromatin and DNA methylation is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kadoch et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is virtually no information on how PRCs and SWI/SNF exert epigenetic control over organ patterning and development in mammals. In this study, we found that antagonistic interaction between Ezh2 and Arid1a is indispensable for tooth root furcation patterning. Interestingly, Ezh2 represses the Hox gene family, and many Hox genes can suppress osteochondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Creuzet et al., 2002</xref>). In particular, cells in pharyngeal arch one and the anterior domains of neural crest cells (NCCs) do not express Hox genes, thus enabling the cartilage and bony elements of the face to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Minoux et al., 2017</xref>). Although migration of NCCs and their localization to target structures are not impaired by loss of Ezh2, craniofacial osteochondrogenesis is suppressed in <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwarz et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we found that loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in the dental mesenchyme also affected dental follicle-derived tooth root-supporting tissue including PDL and alveolar bone, likely through overactivation of Hox genes, indicating that the differentiation of dental follicle-derived cells is also Ezh2-dependent.</p><p>A previous study has shown that inhibition of Ezh2 methyltransferase activity can inhibit tumor cells in an <italic>Arid1a</italic>-mutated model, highlighting the antagonism of Ezh2 and Arid1a in tumor formation. Interestingly, Arid1a knockdown does not affect Ezh2 expression, and the antagonism between Ezh2 and Arid1a occurs on the functional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bitler et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in our study, we found that loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> does not affect Arid1a expression but instead works antagonistically with Ezh2 to control the furcation pattern, possibly via regulation of Cdkn2a, suggesting Ezh2 may antagonize Arid1a on the functional level in this domain as well. Cdkn2a is a well-known cell cycle inhibitor. Previous studies have shown that Cdkn2a is involved in cell cycle regulation in various physiological process as a downstream target of PRC2. For example, Cdkn2a serves as a cell cycle regulator downstream of Ezh2 in a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim and Roberts, 2016</xref>). In our study, Cdkn2a is likely the master cell cycle regulator that controls the root furcation development via regulating the cell proliferation activity in the root apical region. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of the fine-tuned balance between antagonistic epigenetic regulators Ezh2 and Arid1a in tooth root patterning and development.</p><p>From an evolutionary perspective, our results clearly demonstrate that epigenetic regulation plays a key role in dental root patterning and development. Neanderthal molars have a taurodont phenotype with a longer root trunk than the ones seen in anatomically modern humans and show late bifurcation or trifurcation of the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macchiarelli et al., 2006</xref>). In our study, loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> in the tooth epithelium recaptures the taurodont phenotype, indicating the potential role of epithelial Ezh2 in human evolution. Importantly, it has been suggested that the root attachment area is adaptively linked to the differing occlusal loads and mechanical resistance levels of foods eaten by mammals. For instance, primates that eat hard substances exhibit larger root surface areas than those that feed on less mechanically resistant foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kupczik and Hublin, 2010</xref>). Some of the ways by which selective mechanisms may have operated to maximize root surface area are to increase the number of roots or lengthen the root, thus stabilizing the dentition. The well-separated dental roots offer improved stability for our dentition within the jawbones in modern humans. Collectively, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in determination of tooth root patterning and development can therefore provide critical clues about human evolution, as well as potential therapeutic approaches to tooth regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (M. musculus)</td><td><italic>Arid1a<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No. 027717;

In the manuscript, the authors provide the first evidence of how epigenetic mechanisms regulate tooth root formation. Overall, the study is well designed and the hypothesis supported by solid in vivo evidence based on numerous transgenic mouse models. The major findings have general impact to the field of developmental biology. However, several issues need to be addressed as described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Molar dental epithelium diaphragm was shown to be arrested in the <italic>Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mutant mice. However, only mesenchyme proliferation or apoptosis was analyzed (Figure 3). What was the impact upon the epithelium proliferation? What was the cause of epithelium recession? In regards to loss or delay of alveolar bone (Figure 3 alveolar bone), it is not clear if this is primary to the tooth root defects or secondary as this was not determined. Some detailed discussion on this should be added in lieu of the brief short paragraph in the Discussion section. Loss of the PDL is due to mesenchyme ablation of Ezh2, but could they be linked?</p><p>2) The authors showed that maxillary molars presented similar root fusion phenotypes in the <italic>Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mutant mice. Were the maxillary molar phenotypes also rescued in the <italic>Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup>; Arid<sup>f/+</sup></italic> mutant mice? What are the phenotypes of <italic>Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup>; Arid<sup>f/f</sup></italic> with Arid being completely knocked out? The observed rescue by a single mutant allele of Arid1a is fascinating but the authors should state whether they observe a phenotype in Arid1a -/-roots.</p><p>3) In Figure 4, type I collagen was used as a marker for PDL, which is not appropriate. Type I collagen labels both PDL and alveolar bone. It would be better to use periostin as a marker to analyze the PDL defects. It is not clear if the same molar (first or second is compared in G vs. I) or is it the orientation of the section that is confusing? If so please orient the section so they all look the same.</p><p>4) In Figure 7, expression of Cdkn2a in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup>; Arid<sup>f/+</sup></italic> mutant mice was only analyzed with immunohistochemical staining, which is not sufficient. It will be necessary to perform either western blot or real-time PCR to confirm.</p><p>5) Since the study focusses on epigenetic modifications mediated by Ezh2 it would be interesting to investigate the whole genome status of H3K27Me3 binding sites in wildtype, Ezh2 and Arid1a rescued root mesenchyme. Although I appreciate this may take some time I believe the authors should be given the opportunity to add this data since it will greatly increase the significance of the study. For example, it will be very interesting to know the epigenetic status of the Eda and Arid1a loci.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46426.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Molar dental epithelium diaphragm was shown to be arrested in the Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup> mutant mice.

Because <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> is only active in the dental mesenchyme, the epithelial phenotype is secondary to the defect in the mesenchyme. We have added further information in the Discussion section about the potential relationship between periodontal tissue, including alveolar bone and PDL, and the furcation defect:</p><p><italic>“Osr2-Cre</italic> is active in the dental mesenchyme including both the dental follicle and dental papilla. The dental follicle gives rise to periodontal tissues such as alveolar bone and PDL, which have a critical impact on tooth root development and tooth eruption (Takahashi et al., 2019), implying the interaction between periodontal tissue and tooth root development. In our study, loss of alveolar bone and PDL in the mouse molar correlated with the observed root furcation defect. However, whether the alveolar bone and PDL defects are primary malformations or the result of root furcation defect still needs to be further investigated.”</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46426.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46426-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors showed that maxillary molars presented similar root fusion phenotypes in the Osr2-Cre;Ezh2<sup>f/f</sup> mutant mice.

Unfortunately, although we appreciate this suggestion we were unable to do this for the compound mutants because we could not collect enough DNA within the two-month revision time frame. We have shown that the Hox genes and Cdkn2a are in the H3K27Me3 binding sites, in consistent with our RNA sequencing data. However, there are no binding sites in the Eda and Arid1a loci (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>).
