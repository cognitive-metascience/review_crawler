composed of keratinocytes. Here, we sought to define the role that keratinocytes play in touch sensation in vivo and ex vivo. We show that optogenetic inhibition of keratinocytes decreases behavioral and cellular mechanosensitivity. These processes are inherently mediated by ATP signaling, as demonstrated by complementary cutaneous ATP release and degradation experiments. Specific deletion of P2X4 receptors in sensory neurons markedly decreases behavioral and primary afferent mechanical sensitivity, thus positioning keratinocyte-released ATP to sensory neuron P2X4 signaling as a critical component of baseline mammalian tactile sensation. These experiments lay a vital foundation for subsequent studies into the dysfunctional signaling that occurs in cutaneous pain and itch disorders, and ultimately, the development of novel topical therapeutics for these conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31684.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin is the largest sensory organ of the body, and the first point of contact with the outside world.

In mutant mice whose cells can be ‘switched off’ by a certain light, artificially deactivating these cells makes the animals less able to respond to tactile stimuli. Further experiments show that when pressure is applied onto the skin, the surface skin cells release a chemical messenger, which then binds specifically to the nerve cells. When the messaging molecule is experimentally destroyed or prevented from attaching to the nerve cell, the mice react less to non-painful and painful touch. This means the cells at the surface of the skin detect tactile signals from the environment and then communicate this information to the nerve cells, where it is taken to the brain.</p><p>Disrupted communication between the cells in the outer layer of the skin and the nerve cells is found in painful and itchy skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Knowing how these two types of cells normally work together may help with finding new pain and itch treatments for these skin disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tactile</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>cell sniff</kwd><kwd>purinoceptors</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS040538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stucky</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS070711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stucky</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008980</institution-id><institution>Medical College of Wisconsin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advancing a Healthier Wisconsin Endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stucky</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marvin Wagner Endowed Professorship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stucky</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Keratinocytes are critical for normal innocuous and noxious touch through their mechanically evoked ATP release and subsequent signaling to P2X4 channels on sensory neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral sensory neurons detect external stimuli and transmit this information to spinal cord and brainstem circuits. Despite their location below the epidermal surface, convention proposes that cutaneous sensory nerve terminals are the exclusive transducers of mechanical stimuli. This concept has recently been challenged by data that demonstrate epidermal Merkel cells’ responsiveness to mechanical stimuli and subsequent signaling to sensory neurons, two processes that are essential for two-point touch discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, Merkel cells constitute only a small portion (3–6%) of total skin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moll et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fradette et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halata et al., 2003</xref>), whereas keratinocytes, which have traditionally been known for their roles in barrier formation and protection rather than sensory transduction, comprise 94–97% of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuchs, 1995</xref>). However, keratinocytes are closely apposed to sensory nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Löken et al., 2009</xref>) and are constantly exposed to external mechanical forces in the environment like brushing and pressure from stimuli like clothing, objects and other living organisms. Previously, it was demonstrated that isolated keratinocytes directly respond to mechanical probing by increasing intracellular calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goto et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, keratinocytes can release many neuroactive substances including ATP, calcitonin gene-related peptide β (CGRPβ), acetylcholine, glutamate, epinephrine, neurotrophic growth factors, and cytokines among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). In co-cultures of keratinocytes and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes evokes inward currents in adjacent sensory neurons, presumably through release of one of the aforementioned metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klusch et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that sensory neurons may not be the sole transducers of mechanical stimuli, but rather may collaborate with other cell types such as keratinocytes to initiate or amplify somatosensory signals to sensory neurons.</p><p>Here, we sought to define the role of keratinocytes in mechanotransduction by utilizing cell-specific optogenetic approaches during evoked and non-evoked behavioral testing. We found that these epidermal cells are critical for innocuous and noxious touch detection. Using ex vivo sensory fiber recording techniques and pharmacological approaches, we identified ATP as a key signaling molecule released by keratinocytes in response to mechanical stimulation. Finally, we used novel sensory neuron-specific knockout mice to demonstrate that mechanically induced ATP release is functionally coupled to the activation of P2X4 receptors on sensory neurons. These data are the first to identify purinergic signaling as a critical component of innocuous and noxious skin mechanotransduction, specifically in the context of non-neuronal to neuronal cellular communication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of keratinocytes reduces mechanical responsiveness</title><p>We first sought to determine whether keratinocytes have a functional role in sensing touch.

However, this investigation stopped short of investigating the contributions of keratinocytes to tactile behavioral responses in vivo. Therefore, we created a mouse line that selectively expresses GFP-tagged Archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch) in K14-expressing epidermal cells (<italic>K14Cre</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Arch/Arch</italic> (Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>K14Cre<sup>-</sup> Arch/Arch</italic> (Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup>) littermate controls) and tested whether keratinocytes have a functional role in sensing innocuous or noxious touch in vivo. When Arch is activated by amber light (peak photocurrent between 550 and 600 nm), it pumps protons out of the membrane, thereby hyperpolarizing the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we activated Arch via transdermal light stimulation to inhibit epidermal cells in vivo.</p><p>To confirm that <italic>Arch</italic> expression was restricted primarily to epidermal cells, we evaluated GFP expression patterns in glabrous hindpaw skin sections. As expected, GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>) overlapped substantially with K14-positive epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>) in Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but not in Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Because keratinocytes migrate from the basal to superficial epidermal layers in a temporal fashion, GFP expression was found throughout all layers, and was not restricted only to the basal keratinocyte layer where K14 expression is found.</p><p>We next assessed whether the Arch expressed in keratinocytes was functional. Whole cell current clamp recordings were performed on keratinocytes isolated from glabrous hindpaw skin of Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> and Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> mice in order to measure amber light (590 nm)-evoked changes in membrane potential. During light stimulation, Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> keratinocytes exhibited hyperpolarized membrane potentials, as compared to no light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Light stimulation had no effect on the membrane potential of keratinocytes from Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To determine whether optogenetic inhibition affects the mechanical responsiveness of keratinocytes, we recorded membrane voltage in Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> cells during focal stimulation and light exposure. Analogous to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the membrane voltage of Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> keratinocytes depolarized in a graded manner upon mechanical stimulation, and 590 nm light significantly reduced the overall level of depolarization at each force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Hyperpolarization of keratinocytes significantly lowered the membrane potential even with mechanical stimulation, thus indicating that hyperpolarization can inhibit evoked signaling processes in keratinocytes.</p><p>To determine whether inhibition of K14-expressing cells affects animals’ behavioral sensitivity to tactile stimuli, the glabrous hindpaw skin was briefly exposed to 590 nm light before (1 min) and during mechanical stimulation. Thresholds for tactile detection were measured using von Frey filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dixon, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>). Keratinocyte inhibition significantly elevated mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds in Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> animals compared to Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), reflecting decreased tactile sensitivity. Similar exposure to 490 nm light, a wavelength incapable of activating Arch, had no effect on mechanical thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Responses to repeated suprathreshold tactile stimuli were tested by applying a 3.61 mN filament 10 times to the plantar hindpaw and quantifying frequency (%) of withdrawal responses. The 590 nm light caused Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> animals to be less responsive to repeated probing than their Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Control light (490 nm) had no effect on the mechanical responsiveness of the Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> or Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Although light pretreatments were given for 1 min before application of evoked stimuli for ease of stimuli administration, light pretreatment was not necessary to induce the behavioral mechanical inhibition, as 590 nm light treatment delivered simultaneously with the mechanical stimuli elicited the full effect of inhibition that was observed with pretreatment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether inhibition of K14-expressing cells also affects responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. The tip of a spinal needle was used to poke the hindpaw 10 times; responses were characterized as normal (innocuous, simple paw withdrawal), noxious (licking, flicking and elevating the paw for extended periods of time), or null (no response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moehring et al., 2016</xref>). Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> animals exposed to 590 nm light exhibited significantly fewer noxious and innocuous responses, and a concomitant increase in null responses to the needle poke compared to Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup>controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Exposure to the control 490 nm light had no effect on the responses subtype distribution in either genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Importantly, the behavioral changes observed in response to the 590 nm light were not a result of temperature changes in the hindpaw skin as neither 590 nm nor 490 nm light altered the temperature in the hindpaw skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Next, to determine whether keratinocyte inhibition affects ongoing behaviors, the Arch-K14 cohorts were tested in a non-evoked place preference assay. Animals were allowed to freely explore a two-chamber box, where the floor of one chamber floor was illuminated with 595 nm light and the other was illuminated with 460 nm light. Neither Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> nor Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> animals preferred either chamber when the lights were on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that the inhibition of keratinocytes and other epidermal cells alone does not evoke aversive or pleasant sensations in the animals. Together, these results demonstrate that epidermal K14-expressing cells play a key role in detecting evoked innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Optogenetic activation of keratinocytes causes attending responses</title><p>Since light-induced inhibition of epidermal cells reduced the animals’ baseline sensitivity to evoked mechanical stimuli, we performed complementary experiments to determine the effects of light-induced activation of K14-expressing epidermal cells using light-sensitive Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR), which depolarizes cells when activated by 450 – 500 nm light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>).

In addition to optogenetic inhibition, we also tested the converse experiment by co-culturing ChR-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> keratinocytes with P2X2-GFP<sup>+</sup> HEK-293 cells.

Light-induced 490 nm depolarization was sufficient to elicit inward currents in an intensity-dependent manner, whereas no depolarization occurred with 590 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

To explore this question, we used the tibial nerve ex vivo preparation, which mirrors the anatomical location of mechanical stimuli applied in the behavioral assays. We first recorded from C-fibers because C-fiber terminals are closely apposed to keratinocytes and non-peptidergic C-fibers project most superficially in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zylka et al., 2005</xref>). The isolated glabrous skin of the tibial nerve preparation was exposed to apyrase or PBS in the bath. Overall, C-fibers treated with apyrase fired significantly fewer action potentials in response to a series of increasing forces than those treated with PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Examples of C-fiber action potentials in the presence of apyrase or PBS are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. Apyrase had no effect on the mechanical thresholds as evaluated by von Frey filaments (PBS: 5.88 ± 5.88 mN, apyrase: 5.88 ± 5.88 mN; median ± interquartile range; Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.60) or conduction velocity (PBS: 0.55 ± 0.22 m/s, apyrase: 0.53 ± 0.24 m/s; mean ± SEM; unpaired t-test, p=0.79) of C-fibers. We next tested myelinated slowly adapting (SA) Aδ and Aβ-fibers, which are typically found slightly deeper within the keratinocyte layers of the epidermis. Apyrase significantly reduced the number of mechanically evoked action potentials fired in both SA-Aδ and SA-Aβ-fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and I</xref>). Example traces of Aδ and Aβ-fiber action potentials show that apyrase decreases the number of action potentials fired in response to increasing forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and J</xref>). Like C-fibers, apyrase had no effect on the mechanical thresholds of Aδ-fibers (PBS: 4.00 ± 2.82 mN, apyrase: 4.00 ± 2.82 mN; median ± interquartile range; Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.70) or Aβ-fibers (PBS: 4.00 ± 2.82 mN, apyrase: 4.00 ± 5.19 mN; median ± interquartile range; Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.80) as measured by von Frey filaments, or the conduction velocities of Aδ-fibers (PBS: 7.28 ± 0.47 m/s, apyrase: 6.60 ± 0.55 m/s; mean ± SEM; unpaired t-test, p=0.36) or Aβ-fibers (PBS: 17.71 ± 2.87 m/s, apyrase: 14.31 ± 0.81 m/s; mean ± SEM; unpaired t-test, p=0.25). Furthermore, in order to ensure that apyrase would not directly alter membrane excitability of sensory neurons, lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from naive animals were isolated and current clamped in the presence of a high concentration of apyrase or vehicle. Apyrase treatment did not alter the rheobase (current required to elicit one action potential) values as compared to the PBS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, apyrase treatment did not alter the resting membrane potential of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that cutaneous ATP signaling is essential for normal behavioral responses to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli and is required at cutaneous terminals for afferent firing elicited by mechanical stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Degradation of ATP mirrors behavioral responses during optogenetic inhibition of K14-expressing cells</title><p>We have thus far discovered that: (1) inhibition of keratinocytes decreases innocuous and noxious touch responses, (2) mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes releases ATP, and (3) degradation of ATP in skin decreases mechanical sensitivity at the behavioral and afferent levels. We next asked whether keratinocytes are the major source of ATP released from the skin upon mechanical stimulation. The combined apyrase treatment and 590 nm light inhibition of K14-expressing epidermal cells had no additive effect on behavioral mechanical thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), or on responses to repeated suprathreshold stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) when compared to vehicle with 590 nm light. This suggests that K14-expressing cells are the major source of ATP in skin. Importantly, the mechanical thresholds and suprathreshold responses in apyrase-treated animals (in every genotype and light condition) were not different from the Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> PBS treated 590 nm light condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup> animals injected with apyrase had significantly higher paw withdrawal thresholds than P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup> animals injected with PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). However, apyrase treatment had no additional effect on mechanical withdrawal thresholds in P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup> animals; apyrase treatment had the same effect in both P2X4 expressing and P2X4 sensory neuron mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Similarly, apyrase had no effect on P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup> animal responsiveness to repeated suprathreshold stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) or the noxious needle assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), but did reduce the responses in P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup> littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that either pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of P2X4 channels specifically from sensory nerve terminals is sufficient to fully decrease the baseline mechanical sensitivity to both innocuous and noxious force.</p><p>Since the <italic>Advillin</italic>-driven knockout of P2X4 reduced innocuous and noxious mechanical sensitivity, we next asked whether mechanically evoked action potential firing of peripheral sensory neurons was also affected. Single nerve recordings from the ex vivo tibial nerve preparation revealed that C-fibers from P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup> animals had overall significantly reduced firing rates as compared to P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Furthermore, the action potential firing rate of slowly adapting myelinated Aδ and Aβ-fibers in response to increasing mechanical stimuli was also decreased overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and E</xref>). Example traces for Aδ and Aβ-fibers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and F</xref>. In contrast to the apyrase studies where mechanical thresholds of fibers were measured via traditional von Frey filaments, here we utilize a newly designed custom feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator which applied a force ramp of 0 to 100 mN to determine mechanical thresholds. Remarkably, C-fiber, Aδ-fiber and Aβ-fibers from P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup> animals had significantly higher action potential thresholds than their wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–I</xref>). Of note, we have never before found such a major shift in von Frey threshold at the single fiber level for any knockout or injury model in skin nerve recordings by using von Frey filaments. These data indicate that P2X4 on sensory neuron terminals participates in setting the threshold for mechanical firing of multiple classes of cutaneous sensory neurons. Conduction velocities were not altered by the knockdown of P2X4 in any fiber type; C-fibers (P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup>: 0.72 ± 0.28 m/s, P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup>: 0.76 ± 0.27 m/s mean ± SEM; unpaired t-test p=0.565), Aδ-fibers (P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup>: 3.64 ± 1.91 m/s, P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup>: 3.88 ± 2.29 m/s; mean ± SEM; unpaired t-test p=0.661) or Aβ-fibers (P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup>: 12.87 ± 2.67 m/s, P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup>: 12.76 ± 2.98 m/s; mean ± SEM; unpaired t-tests, p=0.913). Together, these data identify sensory neuron P2X4 as a key target of the ATP released from keratinocytes in response to both noxious and innocuous touch and show that sensory neuron-expressed P2X4 is essential for setting both the threshold for initiating mechanical firing and for regulating the firing frequency to suprathreshold sustained stimuli in several classes of slowly adapting sensory neurons in the skin.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31684.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The knockdown of P2X4 in <italic>Advillin</italic>-expressing neurons significantly decreases afferent firing and elevates mechanical action potential thresholds of slowly adapting (SA) C-fibers, SA-Aδ and SA-Aβ-fibers.</title><p>Recordings were made from tibial skin-nerve preparations of P2X4-AdvCre<sup>-</sup> and P2X4-AdvCre<sup>+</sup> animals.

For such a ubiquitous phenomenon, it is surprising that so little is known about the mechanism underlying how these signals are conveyed from skin impact to the brain. Conventional theories of touch biology indicate that sensory neuron terminals are the initial and exclusive responders to harmless and painful touch. However, here we offer a paradigm shift to this dogma of somatosensory mechanotransduction. We show that keratinocytes, which cover the entire body and are the first cells to contact physical stimuli, are indispensable for normal innocuous and noxious touch sensation. Mechanistically, keratinocytes communicate with sensory nerve terminals via ATP release, which then activates P2X4 receptors on sensory neurons to signal both innocuous and painful touch perception from the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31684.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram depicting the proposed mechanism for ATP release induced by mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes and its interaction with P2X4 on sensory nerve endings.</title><p>Touching of the skin, and therefore the mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes, elicits release of factors such as ATP, which in turn, acts on P2X4 and possibly other receptors on sensory neurons found within the epidermis, thereby causing action potential firing in the neurons and downstream effects leading to touch perception.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31684-fig9-v2"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Keratinocytes are essential for detecting gentle and painful touch in normal skin</title><p>Our study builds on the elegant ex vivo findings of Bambauer and colleagues (2015) to demonstrate the tactile function of keratinocytes in the awake, behaving animal. Specific optogenetic inhibition of epidermal cells in Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> mice elevated the behavioral tactile thresholds, dampened the responses to suprathreshold innocuous force, and blunted the responses to noxious pin prick, indicating that keratinocytes have a major role in conveying a broad range of innocuous and noxious mechanical information to the CNS. Although this optogenetic silencing probably inhibited Merkel cells, which also express <italic>Keratin14</italic>, the contribution from this cell type to the overall behavioral observations is likely small since Merkel cells comprise only a very small portion (3–6%) of epidermal cells located in the glabrous or hairy skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moll et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fradette et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Halata et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, the K14 epidermal cell inhibition in vivo is largely mediated by keratinocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Keratinocyte activation elicits attending and ‘grooming’ behaviors</title><p>Complementary experiments, where keratinocytes were selectively activated by Channelrhodopsin in ChR-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, showed that specific keratinocyte activation caused animals to attend or ‘groom’ in response to the light-illuminated body regions by wiping of the face or front paws in both the evoked behavior and non-evoked place preference assay. While both assays reveal attending and grooming-like behaviors, there are also major differences in the types of behaviors observed. The light-evoked behavior from focal hindpaw stimulation appears to be nocifensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pang et al., 2015</xref>), with behaviors mimicking those observed in experiments utilizing optogenetic activation of TRPV1<sup>+</sup> sensory neurons, which causes nocifensive behaviors as well as place aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaudry et al., 2017</xref>). However, in our hands, the place-preference assay did not cause a place aversion in the ChR-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> animals, and the attending behaviors elicited by the 460 nm floor light are most reminiscent of paresthesia-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kahn Safdar et al., 2012</xref>). Further experiments must be done to determine the repertoire of sensations elicited during these interesting behaviors. Since the same set of epidermal cells are activated by 460 nm light in both assays, we believe the discrepancies in these two behavioral assays are due to different light power intensities and consequently, different levels of keratinocyte depolarization (75.2 μW LED floor in the place preference assay vs. 25 mW laser in the hindpaw light-evoked assay, a 333-fold difference in light intensity). This hypothesis is further supported by findings in our ChR cell sniff assay where P2X2 expressing HEK-293 cells exhibit intensity-dependent increases in inward currents in response to light stimulation of ChR-expressing keratinocytes, indicating an intensity-dependent release of ATP by keratinocytes. These data show that keratinocyte depolarization alone is sufficient to cause attending behaviors in freely moving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Native keratinocytes depolarize in response to mechanical stimuli</title><p>It may be surprising that keratinocyte function in vivo can be modulated by optogenetic manipulation of the membrane because these cells do not fire action potentials. However, we show here that primary keratinocytes from adult glabrous skin do depolarize upon mechanical stimulation in an indentation-dependent manner. Moreover, Arch inhibition during focal mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes significantly reduced the overall level of depolarization at each indentation. Conversely, we show that ChR activation directly elicits inward currents in P2X2 expressing HEK-293 cells, thereby showing that the depolarization of keratinocytes is sufficient to release ATP. Other reports using keratinocyte cell lines show that keratinocytes can depolarize or hyperpolarize in response to changes in extracellular ionic gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wohlrab et al., 2000</xref>), exhibit increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goto et al., 2010</xref>), and express voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, as well as Transient Receptor Potential channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Denda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caterina and Pang, 2016</xref>).

We found at the cellular, tissue and behavioral levels evidence that ATP is released from keratinocytes in response to mechanical stimulation of the skin. Experiments utilizing ex vivo glabrous hindpaw skin show that mechanical stimulation elicits reproducible and graded ATP release, and experiments employing a cell sniff assay verify that keratinocytes are specifically responsible for the ATP release, which occurs in an indentation- and voltage-dependent fashion.</p><p>To complement the ATP release studies, we tested the converse by degrading ATP using the enzyme apyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Palygin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palygin et al., 2017</xref>). Apyrase decreased innocuous and noxious mechanical responses in evoked behavior assays in vivo, reduced mechanically evoked action potential frequencies for all primary afferent fiber types (C, Aδ and Aβ-fibers) tested in skin-nerve recordings, and diminished inward currents in P2X2 expressing HEK cells during mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that graded ATP signaling is essential for the transmission of mechanically relevant information between keratinocytes and sensory neurons. While platelets, fibroblasts and neurons also release ATP and are present in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukami and Salganicoff, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grierson and Meldolesi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lazarowski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbracchio et al., 2009</xref>), it is unlikely that ATP stores from these cells are critical for mechanotransduction since in vivo apyrase treatment did not amplify the effects of specific optogenetic inhibition of keratinocytes. Together, these data indicate that during mechanical stimulation (1) ATP is a key signaling molecule released from keratinocytes, and (2) keratinocytes are the predominant source of ATP that is released.</p><p>Additionally, our findings in the Archaerhodopsin cell sniff assay coupled with the data showing that keratinocytes depolarize in an indentation-dependent manner in response to mechanical stimulation, argue that the release of ATP from keratinocytes in response to mechanical stimuli is largely voltage-dependent, thereby, pointing towards a vesicular release mechanism for ATP. Other studies utilizing normal human epidermal keratinocytes suggest that that ATP can be released via a calcium-dependent vesicular mechanism and/or non-vesicular mechanism via connexin hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harden and Lazarowski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lazarowski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2013</xref>).

Our studies estimate the amount of ATP release to be in the micromolar range, which is an amount sufficient to activate most P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobson et al., 2002</xref>); however, the levels of ATP we measured are likely underestimations given that both keratinocytes and sensory neurons express ectonucleotidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazarowski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zylka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sowa et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sowa et al., 2010b</xref>). Additionally, it is possible that ATP is focally released in high concentration pocket ‘domains’ between the sensory neuron and keratinocyte cell membranes, and therefore, the ATP concentrations that occur in those localized signaling regions might be much higher than the generalized levels we measured in our assays. Although there are a number of P2X channels that have been shown to be expressed by sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>), we chose to investigate P2X4 because it is the most highly expressed P2X receptor on sensory neurons and because of its relatively equal expression on both light touch and nociceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, both pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of P2X4 in sensory neurons reduced tactile thresholds, blunted suprathreshold responses, and dampened responses to noxious pin prick. Accordingly, activation of P2X4 via a positive allosteric modulator decreased mechanical thresholds, and increased responses to suprathreshold stimuli, but had no effect in P2X4-deficient mice. Furthermore, the ablation of P2X4 in sensory neurons decreased mechanical responsiveness of primary afferent fibers in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation, as reflected by both significantly elevated thresholds and decreased afferent firing, especially at the higher intensity stimulus for all slowly adapting fiber types tested. These data indicate that the ATP released from keratinocytes is most likely signaling to P2X4 receptors on sensory neurons.</p><p>Peripheral inhibition of P2X2 and P2X3 receptors, which are also highly expressed on sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>) and have been shown to be involved in various pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Novakovic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cockayne et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">North, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernier et al., 2017</xref>), had no effect on baseline tactile thresholds or responses to a suprathreshold stimulus. Furthermore, in vivo degradation of ATP had no additional behavioral effect in sensory neuron-specific P2X4 knockout mice, therefore indicating that ATP signaling occurs mainly through P2X4 receptors on sensory neurons. It may be surprising that P2X4 was identified in our study as the key target of mechanically released ATP. However, purinergic signaling appears to be more multifaceted than would be expected by simply determining the probability of ATP binding via EC<sub>50</sub> values because (1) receptors can also exist in heteromeric confirmations and (2) P2 receptors have been shown to have complex response patterns, where rather than having distinct individual roles, different P2 receptors have been shown to work in concert through having both additive and inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xing et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Keratinocyte-sensory neuron signaling serves as an potentiator of touch transduction</title><p>Sensory neurons are intrinsically capable of sensing mechanical stimuli via the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels found on their terminals.

Furthermore, in addition to ATP, keratinocytes can release a variety of chemical factors such as CGRPβ, β-endorphins, endothelin-1, neurotrophins, and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2013</xref>), all of which can activate receptors on sensory nerve terminals. However, our data utilizing Arch-inhibition in combination with apyrase shows that ATP most likely is the major molecule released from keratinocytes upon innocuous and noxious touch at baseline in non-injured skin. However, after skin injury or disease, it is possible that one or more of these factors potentiates signals after injury in addition to ATP. If true, this injury-induced augmentation of keratinocyte communication could provide sensory neurons with numerous opportunities for initiation and amplification of signaling mechanisms that underlie pain, itch or dysesthesia in the setting of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Keratinocytes communication is not fiber type specific</title><p>Through the use of a glabrous skin-tibial nerve preparation, we show that either ATP hydrolysis or genetic knockdown of P2X4 in sensory neurons diminishes mechanically evoked activity in all primary afferent fiber types tested. It should be noted that the dampening of the afferent firing rate was much more prominent in the genetic P2X4 mutant model than in the experiment where apyrase was applied to the receptive fields via bath exposure. Moreover, effects on mechanical thresholds of fibers were observed in the genetic P2X4 mutants but not in the apyrase experiments. We believe that the lesser effect in the apyrase experiment is most likely due to the apyrase enzyme, which is diluted in aqueous buffer, not being able to penetrate and fully distribute within the tissue to the receptive terminals of sensory neurons. Nonetheless, in both the P2X4 mutant and apyrase teased fiber experiments, there were effects on all fiber types studied including slowly adapting Aβ, Aδ and C-fibers. These data indicate that keratinocytes are not only communicating with the more superficial non-peptidergic C-fibers (i.e. MrgD<sup>+</sup>/IB4<sup>- </sup>binding C-fibers), but also signaling to the deeper-projecting peptidergic C-fibers, Aδ-fiber nociceptors and slowly adapting Aβ-fibers that mediate light touch, all of which are closer to the dermal-epidermal border in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zylka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Le Pichon and Chesler, 2014</xref>).

Consequently, these data together indicate that keratinocyte signaling is essential in potentiating signals of many fiber subtypes and that keratinocyte-sensory neuron communication is not a fiber-type-specific phenomenon.</p><p>Another interesting and novel finding is that all fiber types tested in P2X4 sensory neuron knockout animals also show elevated action potential thresholds, indicating decreased mechanical sensitivity at the terminal receptive field of single fibers. We have never before observed significant, potentially biologically relevant changes in fiber mechanical thresholds in any genetic mutant or injury study. The most parsimonious reason for this novel difference is that instead of using von Frey filaments as we have always done in the past, we utilized a new custom-designed feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator probe to exert a continuous force ramp from 0 to 100 mN perpendicularly to each fiber’s skin receptive field. The surface area of the new stimulator probe utilized to exert this force is flat, circular and larger (0.8 mm diameter; approximately 2–4 times larger) than the tip of a typical von Frey filament which is small and pointed (4 mN: 0.19 mm diameter; 6 mN: 0.25 mm diameter). Thus, the new probe used for the ramp may stimulate the receptive field more evenly and consistently than the von Frey filament tip which may have sharper edges that deliver more punctate stimuli to the receptive field and activate the fiber at lower thresholds. This idea is generally supported by previous evidence that cutaneous sensory terminals are finely tuned to detect and encode the edges of objects touched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wheat and Goodwin, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Foundation for future studies on tissue injury or disease</title><p>This is the first study that establishes a clear role for keratinocyte-initiated purinergic signaling in mechanotransduction at the cellular, tissue and behavioral levels.

Many other skin disorders, such as dermatitis and psoriasis, are characterized by altered keratinocyte function and signaling, and also share cutaneous pain as a common debilitating symptom that leads to severely decreased quality of life in affected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Man, 2011</xref>). If mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia can effectively be treated at the site of pain (i.e. the skin, via interfering with keratinocyte-sensory neuron communication), it would allow for easy, non-invasive treatment options that avoid the central nervous system-mediated side effects of most current pain treatments, including opioid analgesic drugs. Our current study encourages further exploration into ATP and P2X4 as valuable targets for novel topical analgesics and antipruritics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th><bold>Additional information</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(C57BL/6J)</td><td valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Jackson Stock #: 000664 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(K14Cre)</td><td>K14Cre</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">B6N.Cg-Tg(KRT14-cre)1Amc <break/>(Jackson stock #: 018964) <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:018964">IMSR_JAX:018964</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(Archaerhodopsin3 fl/fl)</td><td>Arch</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Ai35D (B6;129S-Gt(ROSA) <break/>26Sor<sup>tm35.1(CAG-aop3/GFP)Hze</sup>/J <break/>(Jackson stock #: 012735) <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012735">IMSR_JAX:012735</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(Channelrhodopsin2 fl/fl)</td><td>ChR</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Ai32 (B6;129S-Gt(ROSA) <break/>26Sor<sup>tm32(CAG-COP4+H134R/EYFP)Hze</sup>/J) <break/>(Jackson stock #: 007909) <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007909">IMSR_JAX:007909</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(TdTomato fl/fl)</td><td valign="bottom">tdTomato</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">Ai14;

Lasers were coupled to an optical fiber with a fiber coupler which was held 6–8 cm below the hindpaw. Behaviors were recorded during each 6 min optical stimulation period; videos were analyzed offline by an experimenter blinded to both genotype and treatment. Behaviors were timed and classified as follows: noxious (biting, licking hindpaw), front paw noxious (biting, licking front paw), and null response. Notably, animals also often attended to their front paw, even though that was not the target of the light stimulation; this occurred because as animals were attending to their hindpaw they often lifted the hindpaw and held it in both forepaws, thereby also exposing the forepaw to the light stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Pharmacological treatment during behavioral testing</title><p>Apyrase (0.4 units Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis MO) or vehicle (PBS, Gibco) was injected into the plantar surface of the hindpaw 45 min prior to testing.

We chose to use the tibial nerve because it innervates a majority of the glabrous skin of the mouse hindpaw, which was tested in all behavior assays. Animals were briefly anesthetized and then sacrificed via cervical dislocation. The leg of the animal was then shaved with commercial clippers, and the glabrous skin and tibial nerve was quickly removed and placed in a heated (32 +- 0.5˚C), oxygenated bath consisting of (in mM): 123 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 glucose, 7.5 sucrose 9.5 sodium gluconate and 10 HEPES. The buffer pH was then adjusted to a pH of 7.45 +- 0.05. Either PBS or 40 units of apyrase were added to the bath where the skin was kept (experimenter was blinded to the treatment group). To keep the skin in place it was pinned down with insect needles, and the tibial nerve was placed in a chamber with a mirror plate. The nerve end was kept on the mirror plate surrounded by mineral oil while it was being teased into small fascicles. These small bundles were then placed on the recording electrode and a blunt glass probe was used to mechanically stimulate the preparation in order to find receptive fields of single afferent fibers. Fibers were characterized based on their shape and conduction velocities: C-fibers &lt; 1.2 m/s; Aδ-fibers 1.2–10 m/s; and Aβ-fibers for conduction velocities over 10 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koltzenburg et al., 1997</xref>). Of note, in the glabrous skin-tibial nerve preparation, all Aδ fibers we encountered were slowly adapting, and the majority of Aβ fibers we encountered were slowly adapting. Thus, only slowly adapting afferents were included in this study. To determine action potential firing thresholds, von Frey filaments were utilized in apyrase experiments. However, action potential thresholds in P2X4-AdvCre experiments were determined using a continuous force ramp from 0 to 100 mN utilizing a new custom designed feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator. Once a fiber was identified a baseline recording of their firing activity was recorded for 2 min. Next, a feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator was placed over the receptive field to stimulate it with increasing forces. For apyrase studies, the receptive field was stimulated with 20, 40, 75, and 110 mN for 12 seconds for C-fibers and for Aδ-fibers and Aβ-fibers with 25, 40, 75, 110, and 150 mN for 12 seconds. For P2X4-AdvCre experiments a new custom designed closed-loop feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator was used, which consists of three motorized and linear stages (T-LSM200A, Zaber Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) configured as a Cartesian (x,y,z) gantry. Using an ultra low force transducer (F30, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) mounted to the vertical, z-axis of this gantry, mechanical stimulations (2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100 and 150 mN for 10 seconds) of the receptive field were performed. To prevent sensitization and desensitization of the fiber, a 1 min interval was given between the different forces. Data was recorded via Labchart (ADInstruments; Colorado Springs, CO).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ex vivo measurements of ATP release from skin</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>ATP biosensors</title><p>Purine biosensors (Sarissa Biomedical Limited, Conventry, England) were used in a dual simultaneous amperometric recording set up. A null probe lacking the enzymatic biolayer was used to control for non-specific recordings including artifacts from skin movement, temperature, and pH. The second probe was a platinum microelectrode ATP biosensor covered in an ultrathin biolayer containing two enzymes, glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase. The former enzyme converts extracellular ATP and glycerol into ADP and glycerol-3-phosphate; these products are subsequently converted to glycerone phosphate and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the latter enzyme. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is ultimately detected via oxidation of the electrode. These ATP sensors respond rapidly (10–90% rise in &lt;10 s) and in a linear manner to physiologically relevant ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Llaudet et al., 2005</xref>). During data collection, the biosensors were connected to a multi-channel potentiostat and recording system (Digi-Ivy, Inc., Austin, TX). Microelectrodes were calibrated to known ATP concentrations before and after each experiment in physiological buffer consisting of (in mM): 123 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 glucose, 7.5 sucrose 9.5 sodium gluconate, 10 HEPES and 2% glycerol, pH 7.45 ± 0.05. To increase sensitivity, biosensors were cycled from −500 mV to +500 mV at a rate of 100 mV/s for 10 cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zappia et al., 2016</xref>). The sensors were polarized to +600 mV relative to an Ag/AgCl potentiostat reference electrode that was placed onto the skin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Mechanical stimulation of isolated skin</title><p>Glabrous paw skin was excised from the hindpaw without muscle, tendons, or blood vessels attached. Skin was stabilized with an anchor grid on Sylgard-coated petri dishes (184 silicone elastomer base; Dow corning corporation, Midland, MI). The biosensor probe tips (50 μm diameter, 500 μm length) were bent so that the sensing portion could be laid flat against the inner surface of the excised glabrous skin. Skin was then mechanically stimulated using calibrated von Frey filaments ranging from 1.6 to 84.8 mN force. During each 10 second stimulation period, the appropriate filament was applied rapidly and repeatedly (15–20 applications). Sixty seconds passed between each stimulation period. Fresh oxygenated buffer was applied every 15 min. To quantify ATP release, null probe traces were first subtracted from ATP probe traces for a given stimulation period. Resulting values were extrapolated from calibration response ratios generated with known ATP concentrations. utilizing Origin 5.0, and the area under the curve for each trace and mechanical stimulation was determined to evaluate total ATP release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell lines</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>HEK293 cell culture</title><p>HEK-293T cells were purchased and certified from ATCC (ATCC, Gaithersburg, MD).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Derek Moliver (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study explores the role of keratinocytes in tactile sensation using multiple approaches including optogenetics, electrophysiology, biochemistry and behavioral assessments. Prior work using optogenetic approaches has shown that keratinocytes play a role in modulating sensory functions. However, identifying chemical messenger(s) and receptors that are involved in keratinocyte-mediated modulation of sensory function provide new insights into this area. The results support a modulatory role of keratinocytes in mechanosensory transduction and implicate ATP as a mediator of keratinocyte-to-sensory neuron signaling, with P2X4 receptors in sensory neurons conveying this response.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers are overall enthusiastic about the work, they have reached a consensus about a number of major concerns. Whether the paper is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> will depend on the authors' responses to these concerns.</p><p>1) Keratinocytes are not excitable cells, and the optogenetic methods used to hyperpolarize or depolarize keratinocytes may not mimic physiological responses of keratinocytes to mechanical forces acting on the skin. Therefore, the use of optogenetic methods in non-excitable cells needs to be justified. Can tactile stimulation of keratinocytes elicit membrane depolarization in these non-excitable cells? Does release of ATP from keratinocytes depend on keratinocyte depolarization?</p><p>In addressing this issue, the authors should discuss supporting evidence indicating expression of voltage-gated Na and Ca channels in keratinocytes and their functional significance (e.g., citing the work of Frank Rice et al.), as well as their capacity for Ca-dependent vesicular and non-vesicular release, including mechanically induced release. This work has been ongoing for several years in the purinergic field (e.g., Ken Harden Lab). The reviewers agree that a combination of additional experiments and proper review of the literature are needed to address this issue.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows a critical series of experiments that test the role of endogenously released ATP from keratinocytes and P2X receptors on primary afferents in transduction. In addition to apyrase, pharmacological experiments with P2X receptor antagonists (e.g. blockers for P2X4 and P2X3 receptors) should be tested to confirm P2X receptor subtypes that are involved. P2X4-/- mice should also be used in these experiments. Also, regarding the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, average firing frequencies plotted in the graphs (C, E, G) show modest changes following the apyrase treatment, whereas the representative traces on the right (D, F, H) show examples that are quite dramatically different from controls. The authors should show more representative traces for these apyrase experiments.</p><p>3) Control experiments need to be done to determine specificity of the agents (apyrase, 5-BDBD, IVM) used in behavioral studies. The authors should determine whether high concentrations of these drugs may directly affect membrane excitability of sensory neurons. Additional controls for specificity of apyrase in particular would be a welcome addition to this study. It would also be helpful to provide some background on other efforts to use apyrase to block ATP signaling in the literature.</p><p>4) Interpretation of the behavioral results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is perplexing, as wiping and biting are widely considered nocifensive behaviors, but conditioned place aversion was not induced by laser stimulation. These findings also appear at odds with recent work from Caterina and colleagues (Pang et al.), which needs to be discussed. Given this, and the extensive expression of P2X and excitatory P2Y receptors on cutaneous nociceptors, it is therefore difficult to rule out a nociceptive basis for the behavioral results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In line with the stimulation of C-fibers reported here and the cited results of Beaudry et al., it is worth mentioning that Baumbauer et al. (cited elsewhere in the text) demonstrated activation of physiologically-identified nociceptors as well as other fiber types in response to optogenetic stimulation of keratinocytes. Can the authors discuss these discrepancies?</p><p>Other points to address:</p><p>1) How do the authors explain the long latency (avg 46 seconds) to elicit behavioral responses following keratinocyte activation? Is keratinocyte-to-sensory neuron transmission a sufficient mediator of sensory neuron activation or is it permissive? Does the long latency for behavioral responses following light stimulation support the latter? Please discuss.</p><p>2) Related to the above, the optogenic inhibition experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> used light stimuli that were applied a minute before and during the mechanical stimulus. Why one minute before? Does inhibition only at the time of mechanical stimulation attenuate behavioral responses? And what is the effect of light stimulation in Arch-K14 mice on the physiological response properties, as measured in the apyrase experiments?</p><p>3) The absolute ATP concentrations are likely to be rough approximations and likely underestimates, given that both keratinocytes and sensory neurons are coated with ectonucleotidases. Please discuss in terms of the measured concentrations, compared to reported EC50 values for P2X receptors.</p><p>4) Related to major point 4 above, if ATP is indeed released from keratinocytes in response to innocuous tactile stimuli, then according to the authors' model a gentle touch would be expected to activate nociceptors and evoke pain because nociceptive afferents express P2X receptors and can be excited by ATP. This is obviously not the case under normal conditions. Please discuss.</p><p>5) The authors cite a paper showing that P2X4 receptor mRNA is expressed in most of sensory neurons. However, several previous studies showed that functional P2X receptors in DRG neurons are mainly P2X3, P2X2+3 receptors as determined by electrophysiological approaches. These P2X receptors are often co-localized with TRPV1 receptors in nociceptors. ATP-evoked currents mediated by P2X4 receptors have not been emphasized in those prior studies. Please discuss these points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31684.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the reviewers are overall enthusiastic about the work, they have reached a consensus about a number of major concerns.

The reviewers agree that a combination of additional experiments and proper review of the literature are needed to address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added several pieces of key additional data to address this point.</p><p>a) “Can tactile stimulation of keratinocytes elicit membrane depolarization in these non-excitable cells?”</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. To address this question, we performed patch clamp recordings from adult mouse keratinocytes in current clamp mode, and stimulated those with increasing focal mechanical force (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This data demonstrates that keratinocytes do depolarize in a graded manner in response to increasing focal indentation.</p><p>b) “…the use of optogenetic methods in non-excitable cells needs to be justified.”</p><p>We further conducted patch clamp recordings (in current clamp mode) from Arch-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> keratinocytes with mechanical stimuli in the presence and absence of 590 nm light to activate Archaerhodopsin. The 590 nm light hyperpolarized keratinocytes at baseline and at every focal indentation from 0.84 to 5.88 µm (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). We believe that this data justifies the use of optogenetics to modulate the membrane potential of keratinocytes.</p><p>c) “Does release of ATP from keratinocytes depend on keratinocyte depolarization?”</p><p>With this question, the reviewers raised a very interesting point. To answer this question, we measured ATP release in P2X2-transfected HEK293 cells that were co-cultured with ChR-K14Cre<sup>+</sup> keratinocytes in the cell sniff assay. We exposed the co-cultured cells to either 590 nm light (Arch activation) or 490 nm light (ChR activation) at different power intensities. The negative control 590 nm did not elicit a current in P2X2-GFP<sup>+</sup> HEK-293 cells, which reflects the absence of ATP release from keratinocytes under resting conditions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). In contrast, all 490 nm light intensities tested elicited inward current in P2X2-GFP<sup>+</sup> HEK-293, reflecting ATP release from keratinocytes in response to depolarization. Furthermore, the current magnitude P2X2-GFP<sup>+</sup> HEK-293 cells was light-intensity dependent such that more intense light elicited a greater current. These data indicate that ATP release from keratinocytes is elicited by depolarization in a stimulus-dependent manner. In addition, we also measured ATP a cell sniff assay with Arch-expressing keratinocytes in response to mechanical stimulation with the 590 nm light on or off.

To address it, we tested the effects of P2X2 and P2X3 by injecting the antagonist NF 110 (intraplantar) which inhibits P2X3 at a low concentrations (500 nM) and inhibits both P2X2 and P2X3 at a high concentrations (5 mM) in behavioral assays that measured mechanical thresholds and responses to suprathreshold force. Neither concentration had any effect on mechanical thresholds or responses to suprathreshold stimuli after 60 minutes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

To address this point, keratinocytes from naïve adult wild type mice were co-cultured with P2X2-transfected HEK-293 cells, and were mechanically stimulated in the presence of apyrase or vehicle in the cell sniff assay. Apyrase nearly abolished the inward currents in P2X2-GFP<sup>+</sup> HEK cells in response to mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), thereby suggesting that apyrase in fact degraded the ATP released upon mechanical stimulation from keratinocytes.</p><p>Furthermore, we now include citations regarding the specificity of apyrase for ATP hydrolysis (Palygin et al. 2015; Palygin et al. 2017)in the Materials and methods as follows:</p><p>“Apyrase (0.4 units Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis MO) or vehicle (PBS, Gibco) was injected into the plantar surface of the hindpaw 45min prior to testing.

These findings also appear at odds with recent work from Caterina and colleagues (Pang et al.), which needs to be discussed. Given this, and the extensive expression of P2X and excitatory P2Y receptors on cutaneous nociceptors, it is therefore difficult to rule out a nociceptive basis for the behavioral results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In line with the stimulation of C-fibers reported here and the cited results of Beaudry et al., it is worth mentioning that Baumbauer et al. (cited elsewhere in the text) demonstrated activation of physiologically-identified nociceptors as well as other fiber types in response to optogenetic stimulation of keratinocytes. Can the authors discuss these discrepancies?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that these behavioral results are perplexing. We have included 9 new figure panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> (increased the number of animals), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and H</xref>) that specifically address these questions.</p><p>a) Why are nociceptive responses observed, but conditioned place aversion did not occur?</p><p>We are aware of the studies from the Albers and Caterina labs where keratinocytes were shown to have a role in nociceptor activation as well as A-fiber activation. We are also aware of the discrepancies in our data where in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> we observe apparent nociceptive responses to K14-ChR activation, but alternatively do not observe place preference avoidance to the 460 nm floor in K14-ChR mice <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>. Instead of the nociceptive responses we see responses such as “grooming” and face wiping that more closely mimic animals that are experiencing paresthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) (thanks to Dr. Ken Allen (Veterinarian at MCW) who helped us interpret the behaviors). We think the differences in these two behavioral assays are due to differences in the power intensity level used in either assay. In the assay measuring the evoked response to light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) where apparent nociceptive responses were observed, the 473 nm power was significantly more intense at 25mW. In the place preference assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), where grooming and face wiping were observed without aversion, the 460 nm floor intensity was only 75.2 µW, a 333-fold intensity difference. New data on the differential effects of 490 nm light intensity are apparent in the ChR cell sniff assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Therefore, a likely explanation is that the 460 nm floor with 75.2 µW power intensity is not strong enough to elicit enough ATP release to cause aversion to that side of the chamber. Another reason could be that in the assay measuring evoked responses, the 473 nm laser (25 mW power) was pulsed at 10 Hz (pulsing light stimulus), whereas the place preference floor LED lights were on throughout the entire 30 min while the animals were tested (i.e. a sustained light stimulus). This likely can also lead to differences in behaviors because when the light is pulsed, it is likely that ATP release is elicited in bursts, where peak intensities could be different; conversely, in with the sustained stimulus, the ATP release would most likely be sustained. Unfortunately, due to the lack of technical capabilities of the LED floor lights, we were unable to pulse the LED floor lights at the same 10Hz pulse as used in the evoked behavior assay.</p><p>b) To further address whether keratinocyte contribute to nociceptive responses, we performed additional experiments using a noxious mechanical assay where the plantar hindpaw is stimulated with a spinal needle tip. Indeed, 590 nm light activation of K14-Arch mice significantly reduced the noxious as well as innocuous responses and concomitantly increased null responses as compared to the 490 nm control light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Likewise, we now show that peripheral apyrase reduces the noxious and innocuous responses and increases null responses to needle probing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Combination of both 590 nm activation of keratinocytes and apyrase elicited no additional effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), as was observed for the likely innocuous mechanical assays of withdrawal threshold and suprathreshold response. In order to determine whether the mechanically-released ATP from keratinocytes is acting on P2X4 sensory neurons in response to noxious stimuli, we tested the needle assay in P2X4-sensory neuron deficient mice. Indeed, the noxious as well as innocuous mechanical responses were decreased in the P2X4-sensory neuron deficient mice, whereas the null responses increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Finally, to determine whether P2X4 channels are specifically mediating these effects, we tested the P2X4-sensory neuron deficient mice in combination with apyrase injection; and found no additive effect of apyrase treatment and knockdown of P2X4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). These results suggest that ATP release from keratinocytes does not only mediate innocuous mechanical responses, but also noxious mechanical responses via P2X4 signaling on sensory neurons.</p><p>c) We have Discussed these new data in light of previous literature (including the Caterina and Albers studies) in the Discussion section: subsection “Keratinocyte activation elicits attending and “grooming” behaviors”; as well as subsection “Keratinocytes communication is not fiber type specific”, first paragraph.</p><p>Other points to address:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) How do the authors explain the long latency (avg 46 seconds) to elicit behavioral responses following keratinocyte activation? Is keratinocyte-to-sensory neuron transmission a sufficient mediator of sensory neuron activation or is it permissive? Does the long latency for behavioral responses following light stimulation support the latter? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a perplexing delay. We do not have a definitive answer; however, two possibilities are as follows: A potential reason is that the ATP concentration released from keratinocytes in vivo increases over time in the tissue before the nerve terminal receives a sufficient ATP concentration to be activated. It is plausible that keratinocyte depolarization does not evoke the same amount of ATP release as mechanical stimulation, therefore it needs to build up in the skin before the sensory nerve terminal is activated.</p><p>We believe that ATP is a potentiator rather than an initiator of action potential firing in response to mechanical stimulation of the skin. ATP is not likely required for the initiation of the sensory neuron response to occur, because mechanical responses still do occur even in the presence of keratinocyte-inhibition, ATP hydrolysis, or deletion of sensory neuron P2X4. However, in each of these situations, the mechanical responses of the sensory neurons are muted. Thus, the most parsimonious explanation is that the ATP released from keratinocytes serves as a potentiator of neuronal responses.</p><p>We have added information into the discussion on ATP likely being a potentiator of mechanical responses in the subsection “Keratinocyte-sensory neuron signaling serves as an potentiator of touch transduction”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above, the optogenic inhibition experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> used light stimuli that were applied a minute before and during the mechanical stimulus. Why one minute before? Does inhibition only at the time of mechanical stimulation attenuate behavioral responses? And what is the effect of light stimulation in Arch-K14 mice on the physiological response properties, as measured in the apyrase experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this question. We have included this test in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>.</p><p>We chose to apply the stimulus for 1 minute to make the evoked behavioral assays more convenient to perform as well as to be certain that all of the animals had at least a minimally sufficient amount of light exposure. That said, to specifically address this question we tested whether pre-light exposure was necessary by turning on the 590 nm light at the same time as the mechanical stimulus was delivered, to the best of our human abilities. To our relief, there were no differences in the inhibitory effects on behavior when light and stimuli were delivered simultaneously compared to when animals were pretreated with light for 1 minute before stimuli were delivered to the skin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The absolute ATP concentrations are likely to be rough approximations and likely underestimates, given that both keratinocytes and sensory neurons are coated with ectonucleotidases. Please discuss in terms of the measured concentrations, compared to reported EC50 values for P2X receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the ATP concentrations reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> are most likely rough approximations of the actual ATP concentrations that occur in the keratinocyte-sensory neuron interface upon mechanical stimulation, where nerve terminals are buried deep within the skin. As the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref> suggest, the ATP signal was short in duration and quickly degraded upon release. This is most likely due to the ectonucleotidases expressed on keratinocytes and sensory neurons (Zylka et al. 2008; Sowa, Taylor-Blake, et al. 2010; Sowa, Voss, et al. 2010; Beckenkamp et al. 2014) as the reviewers suggest. Furthermore, the ATP concentrations reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C (5-35</xref> µM) are calculated from the area under the curve of the traces (i.e. the area measured encompassed 60 seconds of the recording), and do not correspond to the peak value of ATP release. The P2X2 receptors used for the estimation of ATP concentrations in the cell sniffer assay have an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 1400 nM (rat P2X2 in xenopus oocytes) (Jacobson et al. 2002), and the mechanical stimulation of keratinocytes was sufficient to cause inward currents in the P2X2-GFP<sup>+</sup> HEK293 cells. The EC<sub>50</sub> values of ATP for P2X receptors vary from low nanomolar to high μM concentrations. The concentrations of ATP released obtained from our experiments (5-35 µM) are sufficient to activate most P2X receptors including P2X4 (EC<sub>50</sub> 500 nM) (Jacobson et al. 2002). While according to EC<sub>50</sub> values P2X4 is one of the less potent homomeric P2X channels, the native physiological estimation is complicated by the fact that P2X receptors often exist in heteromeric confirmations (i.e. P2X2/3) and reports of the EC<sub>50</sub> for P2X2/3 receptors are challenging to find. Thus, it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from these numbers. Further, although this is speculative, it is possible that ATP is focally released in high concentration pocket “domains” between sensory neurons and keratinocytes. This would lead to higher ATP concentrations in those localized signaling regions than the generalized ATP concentrations we measured in our assays and could lead to differential activation of P2X receptors on specific nerve terminals.</p><p>We have added text on this point to Discussion:</p><p>“The keratinocyte-released ATP must be acting through a specific receptor or set of receptors on sensory nerve terminals in order to convey the innocuous and noxious touch signal(s) to the spinal cord. […] Additionally, it is possible that ATP is focally released in high concentration pocket “domains” between the sensory neuron and keratinocyte cell membranes, and therefore, the ATP concentrations that occur in those localized signaling regions might be much higher than the generalized levels we measured in our assays.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to major point 4 above, if ATP is indeed released from keratinocytes in response to innocuous tactile stimuli, then according to the authors' model a gentle touch would be expected to activate nociceptors and evoke pain because nociceptive afferents express P2X receptors and can be excited by ATP. This is obviously not the case under normal conditions. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this concern, in order to address if keratinocytes mediate more than innocuous tactile sensations we tested animals in nociceptive assays and added those to the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and H.</p><p>Thanks to the careful critique from the reviewers of the manuscript, we also evaluated keratinocyte contributions to nociceptive responses. As described in major point 4b), 590 nm light activation of Archaerhodopsin significantly reduced the noxious as well as innocuous responses while concomitantly increasing null responses as compared to the 490 nm light control and to the Arch-K14Cre<sup>-</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Similarly, ATP hydrolysis and P2X4 knockdown decreased both innocuous and noxious responses while increasing the null responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition to that, our data shows that ATP is the major molecule released from keratinocytes in response to noxious touch, because we do not observe any additive effects with Arch inhibition and ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further we do not see any additive effects in ATP hydrolysis and P2X4 genetic ablation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), thereby indicating that ATP released upon noxious touch is most likely acting on P2X4 on sensory neurons.</p><p>While our data shows that ATP is important in both innocuous and noxious touch responses, we also have several pieces of evidence that indicate that ATP release is concentration dependent according to intensity of mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C, H and I</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as well as dependent on the light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Therefore, we believe that lower intensity mechanical stimuli would elicit release of lower levels of ATP and activation of touch receptors, whereas higher intensity force would elicit greater ATP and activation of nociceptors. It is likely that a summation of EPSPs occurs at the sensory nerve terminal levels, therefore once more ATP binds to more receptors, nociceptive responses would ensue. Therefore, it is possible that lower levels of ATP release will not cause the same downstream effects on the “postsynaptic” sensory nerve terminals as higher levels of ATP binding to the sensory nerve terminals, where summation could occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors cite a paper showing that P2X4 receptor mRNA is expressed in most of sensory neurons. However, several previous studies showed that functional P2X receptors in DRG neurons are mainly P2X3, P2X2+3 receptors as determined by electrophysiological approaches. These P2X receptors are often co-localized with TRPV1 receptors in nociceptors. ATP-evoked currents mediated by P2X4 receptors have not been emphasized in those prior studies. Please discuss these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two figure panels to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to address P2X2 and P2X3 receptor involvement at baseline mechanotransduction.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that P2X4 receptors to this point have not been investigated under baseline conditions. However, we show via pharmacological and genetic knockdown of P2X4 specifically in sensory neurons, that inhibition or knockdown of this ion channel leads to significant mechanical deficits in the animals at baseline. Furthermore, to this date P2X2 and P2X3 receptors also have not been shown to be involved in baseline sensation. To address the involvement of P2X2 and P2X3 subtypes, we performed behavioral experiments using NF 110, which at a lower concentration (500 nM) targets P2X3 receptors, and at a higher concentration (5 mM) targets both P2X2 and P2X3. We show that neither dose affects paw withdrawal thresholds or responses to a suprathreshold stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) after 60min and included the 30 and 120min data above under major concern 2a). Therefore, it is unlikely that these two receptor subtypes play a significant role in the baseline effects of mechanotransduction that we are investigating in the current study.</p><p>In other fields, P2 receptors have been shown to have complex response patterns, and rather than having distinct individual roles, P2 receptors can work in concert with both additive and inhibitory interactions (Xing et al. 2016). P2X2/3 receptors have been shown to be involved in injury conditions, where total ATP concentrations are likely higher than in acute mechanical stimulation of the non-injured skin. Therefore, it is possible that P2X4 and P2X2/3 receptors can play differential roles in naïve tissue versus injured tissue, and this may depend on the ATP concentrations present in pocket “domains” of the extracellular space in between keratinocytes and sensory neurons.</p><p>We added discussion material on this point as follows:</p><p>“Although there are a number of P2X channels that have been shown to be expressed by sensory neurons (Kobayashi et al. 2005), we chose to investigate P2X4 because of its equal expression on both light touch and nociceptive neurons (Kobayashi et al. 2005). […] However, purinergic signaling appears to be more multifaceted than would be expected by simply determining the probability of ATP binding via EC<sub>50</sub> values because 1) receptors can also exist in heteromeric confirmations, and 2) P2 receptors have been shown to have complex response patterns, where rather than having distinct individual roles, different P2 receptors have been shown to work in concert through having both additive and inhibitory interactions (Xing et al. 2016).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
