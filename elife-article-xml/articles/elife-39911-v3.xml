A limitation in yeast lifespan studies has been the difficulty of separating old cells from young cells in large quantities. We engineered a new platform, the Miniature-chemostat Aging Device (MAD), that enables purification of aged cells at sufficient quantities for genomic and biochemical characterization of aging yeast populations. Using MAD, we measured DNA accessibility and gene expression changes in aging cells. Our data highlight an intimate connection between aging, growth rate, and stress. Stress-independent genes that change with age are highly enriched for targets of the signal recognition particle (SRP). Combining MAD with an improved ATAC-seq method, we find that increasing proteasome activity reduces rDNA instability usually observed in aging cells and, contrary to published findings, provide evidence that global nucleosome occupancy does not change significantly with age.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATAC-Seq</kwd><kwd>rDNA</kwd><kwd>transposons</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Calico Life Sciences LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hendrickson</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name><name><surname>Soifer</surname><given-names>Ilya</given-names></name><name><surname>Wranik</surname><given-names>Bernd J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Griffin</given-names></name><name><surname>Robles</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Gibney</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name><name><surname>McIsaac</surname><given-names>R Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or thedecision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new technology for obtaining aged yeast cells helps reveal a striking connection between aging, slow growth, and stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a multifactorial process characterized by loss of homeostasis, reduced fitness, and increased risk of death. In people, aging is the primary risk factor for a myriad of ailments including dementia, cancer, and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niccoli and Partridge, 2012</xref>). Across different organisms, aging is influenced by both environmental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chetty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McIsaac et al., 2016</xref>) and genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenyon, 2010</xref>); defining a quantitative systems-level understanding of the molecular changes that cause aging remains an open problem.</p><p>The unicellular eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (budding yeast), which typically produces ~25 daughter cells before dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>), has enabled several insights into the cellular aging process via a combination of cell biological, genetic, and genomic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>). For example, instability at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, which contains ~100–200 tandemly repeated copies in the genome, can result in the formation of rDNA extra-chromosomal circles (ERCs), and is is a major determinant of yeast replicative lifespan (RLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stumpferl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2017</xref>). A single-nucleotide polymorphism that reduces the rate of origin firing at the rDNA locus increases rDNA stability, and thereby increases RLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foss et al., 2017</xref>). In a seemingly unrelated pathway, a decrease in vacuolar acidity early in a mother cell’s life promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and limits her lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). Likewise, caloric restriction-mediated life extension, acting through the homeostatic regulator <italic>GCN4</italic>, is a well-studied yeast RLS intervention that is broadly phenocopied by perturbations that inhibit translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steffen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mittal et al., 2017</xref>). In a step towards a systems-level understanding of the genetic determinants of cellular aging, RLSs of &gt;4500 gene deletions were recently measured using microdissection to physically separate daughter cells from mother cells and manually counting the number of divisions before mother cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>). Even still, no unifying model has coalesced from these disparate observations. The rarity of old mother cells in mitotically growing populations and the large number of cells required for genomic and biochemical assays has hampered our ability to dynamically monitor genomic changes in aging cells that would aid in building and testing explanatory models of aging.</p><p>With currently available technology, obtaining large numbers of old mother cells requires physical separation by magnetic cell sorting, which can be combined with daughter-cell-killing genetic programs to increase the average age and purity of purified populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2015</xref>). Profiling aging population<italic>s densely</italic> across multiple ages or broadly across genotype and environment can be improved with fluidic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>). To our knowledge, no genomic assay (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) has been published on strains harboring longevity-associated mutations as they age. Identifying molecular changes, and perhaps ultimately distinguishing different ‘trajectories’ cells take as they age, would be improved with new methods that enable rapid purification of large quantities of replicatively aged cell populations.</p><p>Here, we introduce a robust methodology, utilizing miniature chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2013</xref>), for purifying populations of aged yeast cells that is both easily scalable and highly flexible with respect to environmental condition and strain background. With this approach, the fluidic setup is straightforward, no genetic engineering of strains is required, and the cells are aged in a near-constant environment with fresh media continuously provided. Applying next-generation sequencing-based approaches, we profile chromatin and transcriptome changes (using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq) in replicatively aging yeast cells. Comparing our data to the literature, we were able to verify some observations of aging cells, challenge a prominent dogma, and identify several features specific to aging cells. Consistent with previous findings, we observe a clear connection between aging, slow growth, and stress. Contrary to previous findings, we find evidence that a global increase in DNA accessibility is not necessarily a general feature of aged cells. We explore the relationship between accessibility and instability at the rDNA locus and find a novel connection between proteasome activity and regulation of rDNA and nucleolar morphology with age. Collectively, we expect the genomic datasets and technological developments presented herein to accelerate systems-level studies of cellular aging in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Miniature-chemostat aging devices (MADs) enable the enrichment of large numbers of replicatively aged yeast cells</title><p>To collect pure populations of aged mother cells, we first labeled the cell walls of exponentially growing cells with biotin and grew them ~12 hr overnight in liquid cultures before capturing biotinylated cells with magnetic streptavidin beads, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Pre-growth in liquid culture after the biotin labeling improved the uniformity of the number of beads per cell, as compared to cells that were conjugated to beads immediately following biotin labeling. Following bead binding, the labeled mothers were loaded into our modified ministat culture vessel (~30–40 mL volume; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for details) surrounded by custom-sized neodymium ring magnets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ring magnets are an important component of the system because they enable an even distribution of magnetically labeled mother cells along the glass walls of the MAD (i.e. they help minimize clumping). Peristaltic pumps were employed to provide aging cells with fresh media flow and to wash away progeny. The optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of the culture media within the MAD was kept at less than 0.15 to ensure that pH and glucose remained constant in the vessels (data not shown). Mother cells were harvested by first removing the MAD culture vessels from the magnets, washing cells in growth media to remove contaminating daughter cells, and purifying mother cells with a large magnet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>).

As a starting point, we validated the MAD method by testing if we could recapitulate the salient features of the aging yeast transcriptome. We leveraged the ministat scalability to purify mothers over a dense aging time course, collecting aged cells from five separate ministats loaded from the same pre-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

It is worth noting that we used an extensive catalog of <italic>full-length</italic> yeast transcripts (ORFs and non-coding RNAs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lardenois et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Ares, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yassour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagalakshmi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yassour et al., 2009</xref>]), including 5’ and 3’ UTR regions, for mapping sequencing reads. Strikingly, some of the most upregulated transcripts were those arising from the rDNA locus, specifically from the Sir2p-silenced non-transcribed regions (NTS1 and NTS2). Transcription at the non-transcribed sequence (NTS) locus is an aberrant Pol II event (almost undetectable in log phase culture) that has been previously shown to increase with age and ERC accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi and Ganley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saka et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed gene sets that are differentially expressed as a function of increasing age for enrichment of a variety of functional annotations using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dennis et al., 2003</xref>]). We found numerous significantly enriched terms related to metabolism, oxidoreductase activity, stress, and mitochondrial proteins amongst the genes whose expression increases with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source Data 1</xref>). Genes downregulated with age were enriched for multiple terms, including ribosome biogenesis, rRNA processing and translation as well as a host of other terms related to general cellular anabolic function (tRNA synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, mRNA transport, exosome activity) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source Data 1</xref>). In general, these results are consistent with previous reports that the aging transcriptome shares a high degree of similarity to that of induction of the environmental stress response (ESR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lesur and Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yiu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamei et al., 2014</xref>).

Thus, we highlighted ESR-independent transcripts and processes that happen earliest in our time course as prospective initiating agents of yeast replicative aging. As such, we isolated and analyzed age-induced gene clusters that were relatively depleted of ESR-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> red bars, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source Data 1</xref>). Strikingly, this group of genes was highly enriched for TY transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source Data 1</xref>). Although age-dependent increases in transposon expression have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patterson et al., 2015</xref>), here we show that it is one of the earliest and strongest age-related changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source Data 1</xref>). We also found multiple transcripts arising from the non-transcribed spacer region (NTS) of the rDNA repeat enriched within this gene set as well as genes known to be involved with response to replicative stress and DNA damage (<italic>RNR3</italic>, <italic>IRC4</italic>) raising the possibility that rDNA instability and extrachromosomal rDNA circle (ERC) formation are very early events in the yeast aging process.</p><p>The carbon source-responsive zinc-finger transcription factor, <italic>ADR1</italic>, was among these genes and was previously reported to be an early-age transcriptional responder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamei et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>ADR1</italic> has also previously found to be involved in regulating gluconeogenesis during the diauxic shift, raising the possibility that <italic>ADR1</italic> has a role in regulating the age induced transcriptional shift towards gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wierman et al., 2017</xref>).

Interestingly, we also found that non-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right panel) typically fell into the age-induced clusters, similar to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).

However, a universal increase in transcription with age <italic>cannot</italic> explain numerous induced genes that are highly expressed and functionally related. The tendency of low abundance and silenced transcripts to increase with age might be explained by the decrease in exosome components we observed, as well as a decline in mRNA degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and decreasing transcriptional fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).

Contrary to a previously published aging transcriptomic dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>), our data indicate that universal up-regulation of gene expression is not a general feature of aging cells. We suggest that this discrepancy may partially be due to batch effects in the previously published data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The aging transcriptome is highly correlated across a mutant panel</title><p>Although multiple wild-type strains have been transcriptionally profiled during the aging process, to our knowledge, the aging transcriptome of mutants has not been studied.

Since we observed discordant trends for the SRP protein component mRNAs and <italic>SCR1</italic> (non-coding RNA), as well as an increase in expression of SRP clients, we looked for a signature of ER stress in our expression data. Genes involved in ER-associated protein degradation, specifically the members of the Cdc48p-Npl4p-Ufd1p segregase complex, were upregulated with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, orange dots) and are not canonical ESR genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Proximity to telomeres correlates with age-dependent increases in gene expression</title><p>Clustering analysis revealed that genes positioned in subtelomeric regions are more likely to increase with age than to decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We looked at rate of change with age for every gene versus the distance in base pairs from the telomeres for each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). We found that genes located in subtelomeric regions are more likely to increase in expression with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Given the link we observed between increases in gene expression with age and increased expression as a function of slow growth and stress discussed above, we next asked if the observed age-dependent upregulation of sub-telomeric gene expression was also similarly connected. We plotted the GRS versus distance from the telomeres and found that indeed, subtelomeric genes as a group have a negative GRS and thus increase in expression as a function of slower growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Evidence that global nucleosomal occupancy does not decrease with age</title><p>Having characterized the aging transcriptome across a panel of strains, we sought to thoroughly characterize age-dependent changes in chromatin structure. ATAC-seq is an assay for measuring chromatin accessibility and nucleosomal occupancy and positioning by counting insertions of Tn5 transposase in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). We used ATAC-seq to examine changes in the chromatin structure during yeast aging. We extracted transposase insertions from end points of ATAC-seq fragments and counted the number of insertions at each genomic location as a proxy of chromatin accessibility. To correct for variable sequencing depth and different amounts of rDNA between samples, insertion counts were normalized so that the total number of non-ribosomal, non-mitochondrial, uniquely mapped insertions was the same between samples. Precision of high-resolution analyses of chromatin structure is sensitive to read depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schep et al., 2015</xref>), and therefore we sequenced each sample deeply, requiring at least 25 million uniquely mappable ATAC-seq fragments per sample.</p><p>It was recently suggested that old cells have a globally lower nucleosomal occupancy that could result in permissive transcription and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). Since that study was limited to very old cells, we used ATAC-seq data to look for changes in nucleosomal occupancy as a function of time and in different genetic backgrounds. Nucleosomes protect DNA from transposition by Tn5, resulting in depletion of Tn5 insertions in a region of about 140 bases around the centers of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>). These regions became more accessible in a sample from the old cells, consistent with global loss of nucleosomes. We noticed, however, that ATAC-seq samples from the old cells contained a higher level of background insertions. For instance, mid-gene bodies that are normally inaccessible to ATAC-seq became uniformly more accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This led us to examine an alternative hypothesis, that the non-specific background signal was uniformly higher in the samples from the old populations, leading to an apparent gain of accessibility in nucleosomal regions. Consistent with this hypothesis, the accessibility of canonically open nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, since our data was normalized in a way that every sample has the same number of ATAC-seq insertions, increased insertions in the closed regions ‘compete’ with the insertions in the open regions, resulting in an appearance of decreasing accessibility of the open regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39911.026</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Global nucleosome occupancy remains nearly constant with aging.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Tn5 insertion density around well-positioned nucleosomes (<bold>A</bold>) and 1000 bases downstream of TSS (<bold>B</bold>) at 14 hr, 55 hr and 55 hr after treatment with PMA.

Naked DNA from dead cells has been a prominent confounder in microbiological studies as extracellular DNA can remain stable for days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>). DNA from the dead cells loses its chromatin structure, yielding an ATAC-seq signal that is virtually uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because the number of dead cells recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) increases with age, we hypothesized that the non-specific background in the ATAC-seq signal could rise because of the contamination by dead cells in old cultures. Since dead cells lose their membrane integrity, their DNA can be made inert to the ATAC-seq amplification by pre-treatment with intercalating agent propidium monoazide (PMA). PMA selectively enters dead cells and upon photo-activation binds covalently to DNA, strongly inhibiting its amplification in subsequent PCR reactions. Testing the efficacy of PMA treatment in yeast on heat-killed cells revealed that PMA can effectively remove the ‘dead cell’ signature from mixed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We, therefore, compared ATAC-seq signal with and without pre-treatment of the sample with PMA.</p><p>Strikingly, addition of PMA decreased the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA in the old sample to the level observed in the young sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and this PMA-dependent decrease in accessibility was specific to the old cells (&gt;30 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Further, chromatin structure around promoters became virtually indistinguishable from that of the young cells and the non-specific background in the gene bodies decreased to the level of the young cells, consistent with a significant presence of the DNA from the dead cells in the old-cell samples.</p><p>To quantitatively measure the effect of age on nucleosomal occupancy, we used NucleoATAC to measure nucleosomal occupancy around the well-positioned nucleosomes in areas of open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schep et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, without PMA treatment, average nucleosomal occupancy declined with age. This decline in occupancy, however, nearly disappeared when the samples were treated with PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

These findings were further supported by comparing occupancy of the PMA-treated daughter cell fraction (flow-through) to that of the middle aged and old mother cell fractions in three biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Significant technical challenges have impeded the collection of adequate numbers of viable aged cells for genomic or biochemical assays, much less aged cells across multiple environments and genotypes. The extant systematic genomic research in yeast aging has been restricted to a handful of strains under similar conditions. Here, in order to fully leverage the environmental and genetic flexibility of yeast as an RLS model, we introduce the MAD platform as an effective methodology for aging large numbers of yeast cells in a wide variety of genetic background and environments.</p><p>We found in our analysis of the transcriptional response to aging that a dominant feature is the activation of the ESR, characterized by the induction of stress response factors and a repression of ribosome biogenesis programs. A previous study provided evidence that deleting both of the primary ESR-related transcription factors, <italic>MSN2</italic> and <italic>MSN4</italic>, does not reduce RLS on rich medium (where all of the amino acids are provided); it was also found that these same transcription factors are required for lifespan extension under conditions of lowered glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medvedik et al., 2007</xref>). Prior work has also identified a transcriptional connection between the ESR and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lesur and Campbell, 2004</xref>). Here, we demonstrate the strength of that relationship as evidenced by the marked correlation between the rate that a gene changes with age, and the dependence of that gene’s expression on growth rate. Currently, we favor a model in which the concordance we observe follows from a cascade of cellular decline that results in age-associated slowing of growth, which is consistent with reports of age-dependent reductions in single-cell budding rates measured in microfluidics devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To highlight potential candidates responsible for age-induced ESR, we isolated stress-independent aging signatures by selecting genes that are not annotated as canonical ESR genes and whose expression is minimally dependent on growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Analysis of these genes revealed an early induction of aberrant transcription of the NTS region of the rDNA locus, transposon upregulation, an oxidative stress response, a clear increase in the expression of SRP clients, and a cell wall integrity/ER stress signature that is independent of the ESR and GRS. Notably, we found evidence for all of these signatures in our mutant panel, albeit a much-attenuated transposon induction in the <italic>sir2</italic>∆ strain. Determining exactly how each of these events are interdependent versus distinct, and which might be causative, will require further study, presumably at the single-cell level.</p><p>It was previously shown that sub-telomeric regions are fast-evolving and the genes therein are enriched for being related to stress, cell surface properties, and carbohydrate metabolism, all of which are enriched functional annotations in our pan-aging gene expression signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). Those authors speculated that the high evolvability of subtelomeric regions permits rapid adaptation to novel stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). From our analysis, close proximity to a telomere also increases the likelihood of age- and stress-dependent gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). Whether this telomere position effect is due to a catch-all stress response that manifests with age, or perhaps an aging-specific redistribution of sirtuin proteins, remains an open question.</p><p>Histone mRNAs and proteins have been reported to decline with replicative age in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pal et al., 2018</xref>). This observation, in tandem with a systematic measurement of nucleosome occupancy, have accreted into a model wherein the reductions in histone protein lower the number of functional nucleosomes. The loss of nucleosomes is then purported to result in the erosion of appropriate transcriptional control which manifests as a universal upregulation of all transcripts. Combining a modified ATAC-seq protocol with MAD-purified old cells, we provide evidence that a global increase in DNA accessibility is not a general feature of aged cells. Importantly, we only observed a measurable increase in accessibility and decrease of occupancy at nucleosomes <italic>without</italic> the addition of the chemical agent PMA, which renders genetic input from dead cells inert.

Through comparison to other ATAC-seq datasets, we hypothesize that in an aging yeast population, a smaller fraction of cells are in S-phase and thus depleted for active replication, resulting in the observed decline in accessibility at origins of replication.</p><p>Changes in the rDNA stability with age manifest as ERC formation, which may be a common cause of replicative senescence in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> across numerous strain backgrounds and environments. Using our ATAC-seq data, we found, as expected, WT cells experience an increase in copy number of rDNA repeats that are asymmetrically retained. Likewise, we found an exaggerated and attenuated phenotype for <italic>sir2</italic>∆ and <italic>fob1</italic>∆ cells, respectively. We also found that the aged <italic>ubr2</italic>∆ rDNA profile phenocopies that of <italic>fob1</italic>∆, an unexpected result given that <italic>UBR2</italic> is believed to confer longevity through proteasome activation independently of <italic>FOB1</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic>. Overall, these results are consistent with the known roles of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>FOB1</italic> and provide provocative evidence that <italic>UBR2</italic> is involved in ERC formation/rDNA stability.</p><p>In the future, our expectation is that combining the MAD platform with single-cell analysis could be especially informative. MAD provides the means to obtain aged cells, which can then be investigated with sequencing and optical methods; indeed, it is our expectation that single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq could facilitate the identification of distinct aging trajectories where subtle causative changes can be distinguished from unsubtle stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bendall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>), making it easier to separate cause from effect. Additionally, technical improvements (such as being able to directly conjugate beads to yeast cell walls or reducing the variance in the ages of purified cells) could better facilitate detection of temporal differences between mutant strains, especially at older ages. In conclusion, by enabling the collection of multiple data modalities at different ages, genotypes, and environments, the MAD platform provides a powerful new paradigm for systems-level studies of cellular aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Assembly of MADs</title><p>Individual MADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> are modified versions of ministats originally developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2013</xref>).

The loading port with male luer cap can be used to deliver drugs or other additives as well as for the inoculation of seed culture. A Teflon cap (Zera Development, SBT003Rev01; materials from McMaster-Carr, 8546K17) with a silicone gasket (Zera Development, SBT004Rev01; materials from McMaster-Carr, 1460N25) is used for positioning of the needles and airtightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell preparation for aging in MADs</title><p>Cultures of desired strains were grown overnight at 30°C with shaking (180–200 rotations per minute [RPM]) and harvested at OD<sub>600</sub> &lt; 0.2 by next morning (early log phase). Upon cells reaching the desired OD<sub>600</sub>,EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (ThermoFisher cat# 21338) was removed from −20°C freezer and equilibrated to room temperature during cell washing and preparation. For one MAD, 4 OD<sub>600</sub> units of cells were washed twice in PBS + 0.25% PEG3350 at 1500 g for 5 min at room temperature. During the second wash the NHS-LC-LC-Biotin was weighed out (0.5 mg per OD unit of cells) and re-suspended in 0.5 mL of PBS. Final washed cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS and combined with NHS-LC-LC-Biotin in PBS for a final reaction volume of 1 mL. The labeling reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature with rotation followed by a 2x wash in PBS with 0.25% PEG3350, as above. Biotin-labeled cells were resuspended in growth media and grown under normal liquid culture conditions (30°C with shaking at 180–200 RPM) for 10–14 hr. At time of seeding, the number of labeled cells was determined using a Beckman Coulter Counter. In general, 4 OD<sub>600</sub> units of cells produces between 130 and 170 million cells with variation arising from differences in strain size and cell loss during washing. Cultures were seeded such that the cell density at time of collection would not exceed an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.3.</p><p>Prior to cell collection, magnetic streptavidin beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 ThermoFisher cat# 65001) were removed from 4°C storage, washed twice with 1 mL of growth media, and re-suspended in 20 mL of growth media.

Well-mixed cells from the overnight culture (original mothers + all progeny) were collected for assays (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) as the ‘log phase’ sample.</p><p>Beading reactions were carried out by combining 20 mL of washed beads with 20 mL of re-suspended cells in a 50 mL falcon tube and rotating at room temperature for 15 min. Beaded mother cells were collected by placing the beading reaction on magnet (DynaMag−50 Magnet ThermoFisher Cat#12302D) for 5 min. Supernatant (daughter cells) were carefully removed and discarded. Remaining beaded mother cells were washed 2x in 40 mL of growth media and re-suspended in a final volume of 1 to 2 mL of growth media. Beading efficiency was checked and cells counted under microscope with hemocytometer. Generally, beaded cells have between 1 and10 beads per cell with an average of ~5 and recovery is usually around 75–90% of seeded mothers. It is worth noting that keeping the bead-to-cell ratio at &lt;20:1 is important; increasing the number of beads per cell can greatly inhibit growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Before loading into MAD a sample of the beaded mothers was also collected for assays.</p><p>For MAD loading, ministats were removed from magnets, the air pumps were set to lowest setting, and the effluent port was pulled far above media level. Beaded mothers were loaded through luer needle entry port using a 1000 µL micropipette. The loaded ministat was placed on magnet, and cells were allowed to bind for 10 min before restarting of pumps (50 RPM; flow rate ~25 mL/hr.) and air flow (25–33% of max output;~1 PSI).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Matt Kaeberlein as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the potential importance of this report both as a new method for studying yeast aging through enrichment for old mother cells and for the large genomics data sets that are generated. The MAD system provides an exciting, robust new tool that will be highly sought after by many labs across yeast aging field. The authors demonstrate that their new tool is highly capable, and facilitates robust acquisition of high quality data. For these reasons, the manuscript is well suited as a Tools and Resources article, and this will be an exciting advancement for the aging field. There were some significant concerns raised, however, about the lack of detail provided to allow replication by other groups and several places where the data appear to be over-interpreted. The authors are asked to carefully consider these comments and submit a revised version that (1) provides sufficient information on both the methodology used and the data generated and (2) addresses caveats and limitations to the data in the text. While some suggestions are made for additional lines of experimentation, these are not absolutely required, so long as the limitations to the current data set are appropriately noted. It is essential, however, that the procedures must be explained in sufficient detail that others with expertise would be able to build and operate the device, and a plan for sharing raw data must be explicitly included.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The method is not described in sufficient detail for other labs to replicate. The authors need to carefully go through their manuscript and ensure that a reasonably competent yeast lab would be able to construct and utilize one of their devices to reproduce the studies described here. They should include a new section with detailed instructions on how to build and run their system. This should include a list of all materials needed including vendors for non-ubiquitous pieces of lab equipment, technical details of operation (flow rates of air (not &quot;minimum&quot;, but actual flow rates), etc.), relevant sizes of parts (size of magnets, diameter of tubing, etc.), as well as the optimization data that they must have collected to settle on their current operational methods (purity levels of mothers cells/doubling times, etc. for different sized magnets, different flow rates, different tube sizes, different starting cell counts, etc.) Videos would be optimal. Detailed information about the media used in each experiment are also important for others to be able to replicate these results or to understand potential sources of variation if some of these observations are not seen in other studies.</p><p>2) While the large data sets are impressive, the raw data appears to be lacking. Apparently, only spreadsheets where lists of significantly differently expressed genes or significantly opened/closed genes are presented. The authors should present expression levels or open/close for all transcripts/genes at all timepoints for all strains. There is no mention of uploading raw data to the GEO database. That should also be done to allow others to fully explore their data. Optimally the authors could put together a simple website where people can type in their gene of interest and then it outputs the results in a text table and a graph for all the different genotypes. At a minimum, all of the data needs to be uploaded somewhere, perhaps with a GitHub project to provide some basic scripts for processing.</p><p>3) There are several places where the authors make fairly strong claims that are not sufficiently supported by the data or by alternative methods of analysis. In these cases, the authors should either appropriately note the limited nature of the data or consider taking additional alternative approaches (e.g. single cell imaging by microfluidics, RT-qPCR, etc.). These include:</p><p>3A) Nucleosome occupancy with age (&quot;Global nucleosomal occupancy does not decrease with age&quot;). Although I agree that it's plausible that the nucleosome decrease with age is an artifact of dead cells like they discuss, I'm not so sure that they can make that claim so strongly. I really like their PMA method, but Figure 4C doesn't seem to quite so strongly support their claim. In particular, the 30h and 44h timepoints even with PMA look to have reduced nucleosome occupancy. This may or may not be significant, but they claim it isn't because the 55h timepoint looks like young cell occupancy again. It could be though, that subsets of cells age differently and that cells that lose nucleosome occupancy die younger, so the only old cells still alive by the last timepoint are those that don't experience nucleosome loss. Related to this, I would like to see them plot mean nucleosome occupancy in addition to median. On the single cell level the median cell at any timepoint looks &quot;younger&quot; than the mean because the old cells then die shortly thereafter and are removed from the population. I think that this could be happening with their nucleosome data.</p><p>3B) It was not clear if the authors were able to exclude the contaminating young cells reported in Figure 2—source data 1 from their RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis. If not, the high levels of contaminating young cells in the old cell samples is a bit concerning. If I am interpreting the results correctly, the very old cell populations analyzed by these methods contained 20-40% daughter cells. To confirm that their data isn't confounded by the newly developed method and/or daughter cell contamination, the authors could utilize parallel approaches to confirm hits from their RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets. For example, the authors could utilize a microfluidic device to analyze individual gene expression changes by monitoring fluorescence intensity of GFP being driven by a variety of promoters from genes identified as up or downregulated in the authors' datasets.</p><p>3C) Related to the previous point, the authors often draw conclusions from changes in RNA abundance, without confirming results with another approach. For example, the authors conclude based on RNA-seq data that the SRP is down in old cells. They then hypothesize, based on this observation and the increased expression of many secretory proteins and <italic>SCR1</italic>, that old cells likely have a problem with the SRP complex and ER protein translocation/translation efficiency. The authors could include additional assays to test this model. For example, are SRP subunit protein levels lower in aged cells by western blot or fluorescent microscopy? Can the authors detect differences in ER translocation ability in aged cells, or translation rates of individual proteins? Without confirming the SRP results with other techniques, it seems a bit premature to draw any conclusions about ER protein translocation in aging cells.</p><p>3D) The authors conclude that the large majority of gene expression changes in aged cells results from the ESR. While it is convincing that many genes known to be core ESR genes are altered in aged cells, the authors could test this hypothesis more directly by confirming that this transcriptional response is altered in mutant cells lacking transcriptional regulators of the ESR. Also, out of curiosity, are ESR mutants short lived?</p><p>3E) Sequencing the rDNA gives extremely variable results +/- 50% compared with CHEF gels. The authors make statements like &quot;<italic>sir2∆</italic> cells had slightly more (~20%) relative rDNA copy number than WT at young ages (Figure 6A, B) but higher ATAC-seq coverage (2-fold), suggesting that during exponential growth, the difference between the strains is driven by bona fide differences in accessibility rather than by copy number.&quot; It would be more definitive to run a few CHEF gels to validate the sequencing results.</p><p>3F) The device or their technique seems to be unable to enrich cells above an average 19-20 divisions. This may contribute their inability to measure increased viability in aged long-lived strains and their inability to see more significantly bud scars in those long-lived strains. This seems troubling because one of their main conclusions is that the aging expression changes in long-lived strains is not much different that wild-type. Perhaps this is an artifact of their inability to see old cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39911.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The method is not described in sufficient detail for other labs to replicate.

This should include a list of all materials needed including vendors for non-ubiquitous pieces of lab equipment, technical details of operation (flow rates of air (not &quot;minimum&quot;, but actual flow rates), etc.), relevant sizes of parts (size of magnets, diameter of tubing, etc.), as well as the optimization data that they must have collected to settle on their current operational methods (purity levels of mothers cells/doubling times, etc. for different sized magnets, different flow rates, different tube sizes, different starting cell counts, etc.) Videos would be optimal. Detailed information about the media used in each experiment are also important for others to be able to replicate these results or to understand potential sources of variation if some of these observations are not seen in other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the above comments, and we agree that more detail on how to build/run the system (including materials [with vendor information and specs]), as well as some data from optimization experiments are required. In the Materials and methods, we’ve added a new section called “Assembly of MADs” that includes much of the information listed above. We’ve added new supplemental figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3) that include renderings of 3D-printed posts and magnetic spacers complete with dimensional information, respectively. Figure 1—figure supplements 4 and 5 were added and include schematics of the bubble cage and custom caps, respectively. Most importantly, we have included the specific materials used for construction of each custom component of the system, as well as part numbers so that the custom components can be readily purchased by labs looking to implement this technology. An excerpt from the Materials and methods is shown below:</p><p>“A stainless steel (type SST316; materials from McMaster-Carr, 89495K425 and 9298K12) bubble cage (Zera Development, SBT001Rev01 and SBT002Rev01) is used to guide air bubbles to the center of the vessel so they don’t dislodge the bead-labeled mother cells from the glass wall (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). […] A Teflon cap (Zera Development, SBT003Rev01; materials from McMaster-Carr, 8546K17) with a silicone gasket (Zera Development, SBT004Rev01; materials from McMaster-Carr, 1460N25) is used for positioning of the needles and airtightness (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).”</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, flow rate information has been added to the Materials and methods (we typically run the devices at a dilution rate of ~25 mL/hr). We’ve also added the specific media formulations in the Materials and methods (including catalog numbers) and included additional optimization-related data in Figure 1—figure supplement 6 (which shows that keeping the bead-to-cell ratio under 20:1 is very important to not inhibit growth in the MAD). It is worth noting that the utilization of ring magnets, which allows the experimenter to distribute mother cells on the glass wall (so they don’t clump), is an important experimental detail that we have now included in the main text: “Ring magnets are an important component of this system because they enable an even distribution of magnetically-labeled mother cells along the glass walls of the ministat (i.e., they help minimize clumping).”</p><p>Finally, we’ve added an eleven page supplemental document (Supplementary file 1) that includes detailed instructions for building/operating the MAD system, as well as a Figure 1—source data 1, which includes ordering information for more than 45 components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the large data sets are impressive, the raw data appears to be lacking. Apparently, only spreadsheets where lists of significantly differently expressed genes or significantly opened/closed genes are presented. The authors should present expression levels or open/close for all transcripts/genes at all timepoints for all strains. There is no mention of uploading raw data to the GEO database. That should also be done to allow others to fully explore their data. Optimally the authors could put together a simple website where people can type in their gene of interest and then it outputs the results in a text table and a graph for all the different genotypes. At a minimum, all of the data needs to be uploaded somewhere, perhaps with a GitHub project to provide some basic scripts for processing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we are in complete agreement: making both the raw and processed data useful/accessible to the community is important. To this end, we have uploaded all of the raw data to GEO (<underline>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118581</underline>). To the text, we’ve also added the statement “RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data were deposited with the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with accession GSE118581.” We have included the processed RNA-seq data for all genes and for all of the time courses shown in the paper (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2). For ATAC-seq, we decided to only include the bins with significant changes in Dataset 3 because there are literally millions of unchanging bins. We provide all of the ATAC-s data in bigWig format in GEO to make it easy for researchers to explore their favorite genomic regions in a genome browser such as IGV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are several places where the authors make fairly strong claims that are not sufficiently supported by the data or by alternative methods of analysis. In these cases, the authors should either appropriately note the limited nature of the data or consider taking additional alternative approaches (e.g. single cell imaging by microfluidics, RT-qPCR, etc.). These include:</p><p>3A) Nucleosome occupancy with age (&quot;Global nucleosomal occupancy does not decrease with age&quot;). Although I agree that it's plausible that the nucleosome decrease with age is an artifact of dead cells like they discuss, I'm not so sure that they can make that claim so strongly. I really like their PMA method, but Figure 4C doesn't seem to quite so strongly support their claim. In particular, the 30h and 44h timepoints even with PMA look to have reduced nucleosome occupancy. This may or may not be significant, but they claim it isn't because the 55h timepoint looks like young cell occupancy again. It could be though, that subsets of cells age differently and that cells that lose nucleosome occupancy die younger, so the only old cells still alive by the last timepoint are those that don't experience nucleosome loss. Related to this, I would like to see them plot mean nucleosome occupancy in addition to median. On the single cell level the median cell at any timepoint looks &quot;younger&quot; than the mean because the old cells then die shortly thereafter and are removed from the population. I think that this could be happening with their nucleosome data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the above suggestion and agree that one of the caveats with bulk methods is our inability to disprove that particular cells that die at younger ages could do so through lost nucleosomes. In this paper we focused on examining a specific hypothesis: that the <italic>average</italic> nucleosomal occupancy of old cells is lower than in young cells. We provide evidence that at least a major part of this decrease is a result of increased concentration of the dead cells. We have modified our language accordingly, and the title of the section in the main text now reads “Evidence that global nucleosomal occupancy does not decrease with age.” As the reviewer suggested, we’ve included a new figure of mean occupancy versus time (Figure 4—figure supplement 3), which shows similar results to the median occupancy versus time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3B) It was not clear if the authors were able to exclude the contaminating young cells reported in Figure 2—source data 1 from their RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis. If not, the high levels of contaminating young cells in the old cell samples is a bit concerning. If I am interpreting the results correctly, the very old cell populations analyzed by these methods contained 20-40% daughter cells. To confirm that their data isn't confounded by the newly developed method and/or daughter cell contamination, the authors could utilize parallel approaches to confirm hits from their RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets. For example, the authors could utilize a microfluidic device to analyze individual gene expression changes by monitoring fluorescence intensity of GFP being driven by a variety of promoters from genes identified as up or downregulated in the authors' datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we agree – one of the issues at the very late time points is the increased presence of daughter cells in the samples. To address this, we collected pure daughter cell fractions from the effluent of one of the MAD runs and performed RNA-seq. As now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, the daughter cell gene expression signature cannot account for the majority of the aging signature we see in the MAD. Interestingly, there is a cluster of genes that gets repressed with age and then returns to baseline. While the repression is clearly age-associated, we can now attribute the nonlinearity in the response (i.e., the return to baseline) to contaminating daughter cells. We’ve added the underlined text to the Results section: “We found that a feature of the aging transcriptome is the activation of the ESR (i.e., almost all ESR-induced genes were upregulated with age and almost all ESR-repressed genes were down-regulated [Figure 2]). This signature, even at later time points (where the purity of mother cells decreases), cannot be explained by newly produced daughter cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3C) Related to the previous point, the authors often draw conclusions from changes in RNA abundance, without confirming results with another approach. For example, the authors conclude based on RNA-seq data that the SRP is down in old cells. They then hypothesize, based on this observation and the increased expression of many secretory proteins and SCR1, that old cells likely have a problem with the SRP complex and ER protein translocation/translation efficiency. The authors could include additional assays to test this model. For example, are SRP subunit protein levels lower in aged cells by western blot or fluorescent microscopy? Can the authors detect differences in ER translocation ability in aged cells, or translation rates of individual proteins? Without confirming the SRP results with other techniques, it seems a bit premature to draw any conclusions about ER protein translocation in aging cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, and intended to point this out as an example of a hypothesis that could be generated from our data to showcase the utility of the MAD, rather than as a result. In the results, we now highlight the observations we made from analyzing our genomics datasets: that SRP clients tend to increase expression with age; that SRP subunits tend to decrease in expression in age; that we see increased <italic>SCR1</italic> RNA at older ages; and that ER stress components tend to increase in expression with age. We also performed an informatic analysis of the deleteome dataset from Holstege (Cell, 2014) and found that the negative correlation between expression of SRP components and SRP clients can be found there as well. We have rewritten the section to emphasize these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3D) The authors conclude that the large majority of gene expression changes in aged cells results from the ESR. While it is convincing that many genes known to be core ESR genes are altered in aged cells, the authors could test this hypothesis more directly by confirming that this transcriptional response is altered in mutant cells lacking transcriptional regulators of the ESR. Also, out of curiosity, are ESR mutants short lived?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the above comment, which encouraged us to perform a literature search. We found one paper showing that <italic>msn2∆msn4∆</italic> strains are actually not short-lived on rich medium. However, an intact ESR is required for lifespan extension in conditions where glucose is lowered from 2% to 0.5%. Our current view is that the ESR is a consequence, rather than a cause, of aging. We’ve included these findings in the Discussion:</p><p>“A previous study provided evidence that deleting both of the primary ESR-related transcription factors, <italic>MSN2</italic> and <italic>MSN4</italic>, does not reduce RLS on rich medium (where all of the amino acids are provided); it was also found that these same transcription factors are required for lifespan extension under conditions of lowered glucose [Medvedik et al., 2007]. […] Currently, we favor a model in which the concordance we observe results from a cascade of cellular decline that results in age-associated slowing of growth, which is consistent with reports of age-dependent reductions in single-cell budding rates measured in microfluidics devices [Jo et al., 2015].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3E) Sequencing the rDNA gives extremely variable results +/- 50% compared with CHEF gels,. The authors make statements like &quot;sir2∆ cells had slightly more (~20%) relative rDNA copy number than WT at young ages (Figure 6A, B) but higher ATAC-seq coverage (2-fold), suggesting that during exponential growth, the difference between the strains is driven by bona fide differences in accessibility rather than by copy number.&quot; It would be more definitive to run a few CHEF gels to validate the sequencing results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we have decided to remove the above statement from the text. We have re-written the above paragraph to read, “We looked at rDNA ATAC-seq coverage in <italic>fob1∆</italic> and <italic>sir2∆</italic> mutants, which repress and promote ERC formation, respectively. […] However, in looking at age-related increases at this locus in <italic>sir2∆,</italic> relative rDNA copy number increased by ~10-fold and ATAC-seq signal only increased by twofold at older ages; one interpretation of these data is that an initial open chromatin state may promote instability/higher copy number with age.”</p><p>Additionally, we have shortened the next section, and conclude with the following: “Compared to young cells, old cells from all genotypes showed nucleolar enlargement (Figure 7). However, the observed increases were clearly more pronounced in WT and <italic>sir2∆</italic> than in <italic>ubr2∆</italic> and <italic>fob1∆</italic>, similar to what was seen in the qPCR and ATAC-seq assays.”</p><p>One goal with these three experiments (qPCR, ATAC-seq, cell biology) is to show that we get similar results across very different data types and to demonstrate one of MAD’s most useful features: the ability to observe the segregation patterns (at the genomic level) between mother cells and their daughters (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3F) The device or their technique seems to be unable to enrich cells above an average 19-20 divisions. This may contribute their inability to measure increased viability in aged long-lived strains and their inability to see more significantly bud scars in those long-lived strains. This seems troubling because one of their main conclusions is that the aging expression changes in long-lived strains is not much different that wild-type. Perhaps this is an artifact of their inability to see old cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and while the age-dependent changes are very similar, we do see some differences; for example, in <italic>ubr2∆</italic>, we see chronic activation in the gene expression of proteasome genes. However, the most dominant feature in both <italic>fob1∆</italic> and <italic>ubr2∆</italic> cells is increased rDNA stability, which we confirmed with three independent assays. It is worth pointing out that while the median ages at later time points were ~20 divisions, we were able to purify cells that were quite a bit older (25-30 divisions). That being said, we agree that the similar aging expression profiles might result, in part, from (1) the ESR dwarfing more subtle expression differences, (2) the large variance in ages at later time points and (3) an inability to get pure populations of the very oldest cells, which may reveal distinct expression signatures.</p><p>We’ve added the following sentence to the last paragraph of the Results section: “Additionally, technical improvements (such as being able to directly conjugate beads to yeast cell walls or reducing the variance in the ages of purified cells) could better facilitate detection of temporal differences between mutant strains, especially at older ages.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
