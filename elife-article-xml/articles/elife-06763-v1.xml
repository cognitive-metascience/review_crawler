The yeast metalloprotease Wss1 clears chromatin-bound sumoylated proteins. Wss1 and its mammalian analog, DVC1/Spartan, belong to minigluzincins family of proteases. Wss1 proteolytic activity is regulated by a cysteine switch mechanism activated by chemical stress and/or DNA binding. Wss1 is required for cell survival following UV irradiation, the smt3-331 mutation and Camptothecin-induced formation of covalent topoisomerase 1 complexes (Top1cc). Wss1 forms a SUMO-specific ternary complex with the AAA ATPase Cdc48 and an adaptor, Doa1. Upon DNA damage Wss1/Cdc48/Doa1 is recruited to sumoylated targets and catalyzes SUMO chain extension through a newly recognized SUMO ligase activity. Activation of Wss1 results in metalloprotease self-cleavage and proteolysis of associated proteins. In cells lacking Tdp1, clearance of topoisomerase covalent complexes becomes SUMO and Wss1-dependent. Upon genotoxic stress, Wss1 is vacuolar, suggesting a link between genotoxic stress and autophagy involving the Doa1 adapter.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06763.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06763.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06763.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA repair is essential for cell survival. Every time DNA is damaged, several protein complexes sense the damage and act to repair it. These complexes need to be carefully regulated. One way this is achieved is by the addition of molecular tags that change the activity of these complexes. Sumoylation is one such modification, which involves the addition of a bulky molecular tag called SUMO.</p><p>Sumoylation during DNA damage is known to regulate the precise assembly and activity of the repair complexes. This modification is reversible and when the DNA repair is completed, the SUMO tags are removed and the repair complexes are disassembled. A protein called Cdc48 was known to work together with other molecules to clear SUMO-modified complexes from the DNA after the repair is complete. But it was unclear how this occurred and what roles other proteins played in the process.</p><p>Balakirev et al. now analyze the detailed workings of another protein called Wss1 and how it contributes to SUMO processing in yeast cells. The experiments show that Wss1 helps to remove the SUMO-modified complexes from the DNA by forming a complex with Cdc48 and the Cdc48-adaptor protein Doa1. Wss1 is a protease, an enzyme that can break down proteins, but it is inactive under the normal conditions inside a cell. Wss1 is found in the cell's nucleus (which contains most of the cell's DNA) until it senses DNA damage, which it does by recognizing damage-specific forms of DNA (such as single stranded DNA) and the SUMO tag.</p><p>Balakirev et al. found that Wss1 binds to the site of DNA damage and lengthens the SUMO tag. This indicates that Wss1 can also act as a ligase—an enzyme that helps to assemble polymeric SUMO. The polymeric SUMO in turn leads to the accumulation of more Wss1 and activates its protease activity. The protease cleaves the associated proteins in the repair complex, thus helping to extract the SUMO-modified proteins from the DNA. DNA damage also results in the transfer of Wss1 into a compartment inside the cell, called a vacuole. This suggests that autophagy—a mechanism used by cells to break down damaged cellular components—is one way that proteins are removed from the nucleus.</p><p>Together, Balakirev et al.'s findings reveal a previously unknown role for Wss1 and introduce us to another level of control in the DNA damage response. The next challenges will be to identify specific cellular components involved in transporting Wss1 to the vacuole and to examine whether this mechanism is conserved with a human version of Wss1, the Spartan/DVC1 protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06763.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06763.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>SUMO metabolism</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>poly SUMO</kwd><kwd>Cdc48</kwd><kwd>Doa1</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM030308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Keith D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM09329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Keith D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Wss1 is both a metalloprotease and SUMO ligase found in association with Cdc48 and Doa1 and accumulating in the vacuole upon DNA damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintenance of genome integrity is essential for cell survival and faithful transfer of genetic information. Eukaryotic cells evolved a DNA damage response (DDR) to sense, evaluate, and repair chromosome and DNA lesions or to direct cells for destruction when the harm is irreparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>). This dynamic process is under precise spatiotemporal control, requiring posttranslational modifications (PTM); phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and sumoylation, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Polo and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Compared to phosphorylation, bulky modifications with ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO provide additional scaffolding for regulation of composition, function, and stability of protein assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson and Durocher, 2013</xref>). Both modifiers are conjugated to target proteins by the concerted action of activating enzymes (E1), conjugating enzymes (E2) and ligases (E3) and both form chains through repeated cycles of self-conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>). The effects of modification depend on its position on the target protein, chain length, and type of lysine (K) linkage. Conjugation is reversible; specific proteases ensure regeneration of the modifier pool and regulate the PTM by reversing the modification, or remodeling the chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eletr and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ub and SUMO are involved in the displacement of proteins from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson and Durocher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaz et al., 2013</xref>). Assembly of repair complexes during genotoxic stress requires clearing the damaged and stalled chromatin components from the site of DNA damage. During or at the completion of repair, the assembled repair complexes must be disassembled. Ub-dependent protein degradation by the 26S proteasome is a major mechanism of protein clearing, involving Cdc48-promoted disassembly of chromatin-bound complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaz et al., 2013</xref>). Cdc48, an AAA-ATPase chaperone long-thought to be Ub-specific, also interacts with sumoylated substrates via one of its multiple cofactors, Ufd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nie et al., 2012</xref>). This interaction is required to protect cells from Topoisomerase (Top1)-induced DNA damage. The Cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4 complex is also targeted to sumoylated Rad52 and negatively regulates its interaction with Rad51, inhibiting excessive recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergink et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, Cdc48 plays a central role in DDR, acting as a Ub and SUMO-dependent segregase assembling and disassembling macromolecular complexes.</p><p>Other DDR components such as SUMO-targeted Ub ligases or STUbLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sriramachandran and Dohmen, 2014</xref>) exhibit dual specificity. STUbLs bind to sumoylated and poly-sumoylated proteins via SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) and catalyze their ubiquitylation. Sumoylated–ubiquitylated substrates may then be degraded by the proteasome. Cdc48 may also function parallel to STUbLs in another partially redundant pathway since SUMO binding by Cdc48 becomes essential in cells with STUbL mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nie et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Wss1 may also be required for clearance of SUMO conjugates in the absence of functional STUbL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mullen et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>). Wss1, Weak Suppressor of <italic>smt3-331</italic>, is a suppressor of the temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) phenotype produced by an L26S SUMO mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggins et al., 2001</xref>) and is implicated in the response to genotoxic stress through unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Neill, 2004</xref>). Bioinformatics suggested that Wss1 belongs to a new family of metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>). Recent work demonstrated that it is a DNA-dependent protease involved in repair of DNA–protein crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). These authors also showed that Wss1 is important for cell survival upon topoisomerase 1 (Top1)-inflicted DNA damage. Notably, this function of Wss1 is assisted by Cdc48.</p><p>Here, we show that Wss1 is a SUMO-specific Cdc48 cofactor involved in clearing high molecular weight SUMO conjugates (HMW-SUMO). Important novel observations demonstrate that Wss1 binds SUMO and has both SUMO ligase and latent metalloprotease activities; is regulated by a cysteine switch mechanism that can be activated by chemical stress and/or DNA binding; forms a ternary complex with Cdc48 and Doa1 that exhibits specificity for SUMO and promotes binding of HMW-SUMO to Cdc48; is an inactive metalloprotease under normal conditions and promotes poly-sumoylation of proteins with which it interacts, including Cdc48; is accumulated within nuclear foci and its metalloprotease activity is activated upon genotoxic stress; is accumulated in the vacuole during stress, suggesting an intriguing link between SUMO-dependent DDR and vacuolar degradation. These studies confirm and extend those of Stingele et al. and suggest a unique model of environmental switching of Wss1 from a ligase to a protease in response to DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro properties of WSS1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Wss1 is a SUMO-binding protein</title><p>Wss1 is predicted to be a metalloprotease, the prototype of the WLM superfamily of proteins (Wss1-like metalloproteases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>).

Additional motifs are two Cdc48-binding sequences (SHP and VIM), and a putative SUMO-interacting motif, SIM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Another SIM, SIM1, is located just upstream of SIM2 and is also present in all 12 proteins. Finally, these modeling results suggest that the N-terminal region of Wss1 might adopt a beta-grasp fold characteristic of SUMO and Ub (data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06763.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wss1 is a SUMO-targeted metalloprotease.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of Wss1 protein.

Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Wss1 and mutants were expressed in bacteria and their interaction with SUMO-beads was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The beads bound HA-Wss1, suggesting a direct interaction with SUMO. Mutation of the conserved H and E residues of the WLM active site (WLM*) did not affect binding, but deletion of SIM2 (ΔSIM2), mutations in SIM1 (SIM1*), or both (SIM1*; ΔSIM2) resulted in a significant decrease in binding. Complete inhibition of Wss1 binding to SUMO was only achieved by triple mutation (SIM1*; ΔSIM2, WLM*) suggesting that all these elements are involved in the interaction with SUMO. This was further confirmed by the observation that both N-terminal (Wss1 1–188, containing WLM and SHP) and C-terminal (Wss1 189–269, bearing the VIM and SIMs) fragments of Wss1 were retrieved on SUMO beads. The interaction was specific because it was inhibited by free SUMO in solution and not by Ub.</p><p>Because Wss1 was reported to be Ub/SUMO isopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mullen et al., 2010</xref>) and the WLM domain contributes to SUMO binding, we hypothesized that WLM might bind the carboxy-terminus of SUMO. To test this we synthesized a new ligand, SUMO-PA, where C-terminal Gly was replaced by amino-methyl-phosphonic acid (‘Materials and methods’). Replacement of the C-terminal carboxyl by phosphonic acid should strengthen the coordination of the active site Zn, stabilizing a complex between metalloprotease and peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mucha et al., 2010</xref>). The SUMO-PA ligand was then linked to beads and used to measure Wss1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further increase the selectivity, pull-downs were done in the presence of 1% Tx-100 to attenuate the hydrophobic SIM-SUMO interaction. Under these conditions no Wss1 was bound to SUMO, while SUMO-PA beads still retrieve significant amount of the protein. Pointing to the role of Zn, the binding to SUMO-PA was inhibited by o-phenanthroline (OPA) and WLM* mutation, while ablation of SIMs had only a minor effect. Thus, the WLM domain appears to bind the C-terminus of SUMO and introduction of the phosphonic acid moiety enhances this interaction. The double SIM mutant showed diminished binding and the N-terminal-Wss1 fragment didn't bind SUMO-PA at all, indicating that SIM-SUMO interaction still contributed to the binding. On the other hand, the phosphonic acid moiety alone was not sufficient to insure binding since no Wss1 was retrieved with Ub-PA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The presence of multiple SIMs in Wss1 suggests that it might have higher affinity for polysumoylated substrates. Indeed amylose pull-down experiments with recombinant MBP-Wss1 demonstrated that Wss1 preferentially binds HMW-SUMO chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Both SIM1* and ΔSIM2 mutation inhibit binding of SUMO chains, whereas mutation in WLM domain has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Wss1 metalloprotease is activated by ssDNA</title><p>Recombinant Wss1 lacks protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>), possibly due to improper protein folding or a specific cofactor requirement. Because we observed that GFP-Wss1 formed nuclear foci (see below) and others have reported activation by DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>), we examined whether Wss1 protease activity can be triggered by nucleic acids and other negatively charged macromolecules. Recombinant Wss1 was purified under denaturing conditions and refolded in the presence of heparin, SDS, plasmid DNA, or ssDNA.

The oligomers are thiol-sensitive suggesting that they are disulfide linked (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> below). We hypothesize that in Wss1 protein, the active site Zn is linked to a cysteine residue, which is released by OPA and promotes the formation of intermolecular crosslinks. This observation raises an interesting possibility that Wss1 is regulated by a cysteine-switch mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakraborti et al., 2003</xref>). The metalloproteases regulated by a cysteine-switch mechanism can be activated by thiol-reacting reagents. By screening a panel of different electrophiles, we found that thiram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balakirev and Zimmer, 1998</xref>), a compound that reversibly modifies cysteine residues, efficiently induces Wss1 self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, the cleavage pattern was the same as in refolding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thiram belongs to the thiuram disulfide class of reactive compounds that modify protein sulfhydryl groups via thiol-disulfide exchange reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neims et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vallari and Pietruszko, 1982</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because thiram also inhibited OPA-induced Wss1 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), it seems that it targets the same cysteine residue that is involved in Zn binding.

Displacement of the cysteine from the active site Zn induces autoproteolytic cleavage and may serve to release an inhibitory protein fragment. Wss1 has three cysteine residues, two of which, though located within the WLM domain, are far from the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, their orientation suggests that they may form a disulfide bridge, though the estimated distance of 5.6 Å implies a conformational change would be necessary. The third cysteine, C226, is located in a negatively charged C-terminal part of the protein that was released by self-cleavage. This residue is conserved within the WLM family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and is a perfect candidate for the regulatory cysteine. Unfortunately, we were unable to produce soluble C226S protein, probably because of rapid auto-proteolysis of this construct. To examine the role of V189-cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in C-terminal fragment release and activation of Wss1, we produced a Wss1 mutant where the GKG residues preceding V189 were replaced by AQA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Upon thiram treatment, the AQA mutant efficiently self-processed, though producing different proteolytic fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result suggests that the primary sequence within this protein region is not essential for Wss1 activation.</p><p>To further address the role of the cysteine-switch mechanism in the DNA activation pathway, we examined the effect of different thiols on DNA-dependent Wss1 self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While thiram greatly accelerated this reaction, thiols, particularly 10 mM glutathione, significantly inhibited DNA-induced Wss1 proteolysis. This result implies that, in cells, spontaneous activation of Wss1 by DNA may be inhibited by intracellular/nuclear thiols. Conversely, oxidative damage would be expected to deplete thiols and increase ssDNA lesions, resulting in activation of the latent protease activity of Wss1.</p><p>DNA may activate Wss1 in two ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). First, interaction of a positively charged WLM domain with DNA may induce conformational changes facilitating displacement from the active site of the negatively charged C-terminal peptide bearing the inhibitory cysteine. Additionally, DNA may facilitate Wss1 oligomerization and greatly promote proteolysis ‘in-trans’. Both processes may be linked in a ‘cooperative mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The initial activation events seem to be rate-limiting in the DNA-dependent pathway and may account for an observed lag phase in Wss1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed thiram greatly accelerates DNA-dependent Wss1 proteolysis suggesting a cooperative interaction between ‘<italic>in-cis</italic>’ and ‘<italic>in-trans</italic>’ cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Wss1 processes poly-SUMO chains</title><p>Because it has been reported that Wss1 is a SUMO isopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mullen et al., 2010</xref>) and we observed that it binds specifically polysumoylated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we examined whether it disassembles SUMO chains. Preformed chains were incubated with Wss1 in the presence of DNA or thiram, and the reaction products were analyzed by anti-SUMO western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While there was a reduction in the apparent molecular weight of the chains, we did not observe accumulation of low molecular weight SUMO species expected from chain disassembly and seen with Ulp1. Also, in contrast to Ulp1, Wss1 failed to cleave a SUMO1-FP isopeptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geurink et al., 2012</xref>) and was unable to process a linear His6-Ub-SUMO-HA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that Wss1 is not an isopeptidase. Instead, we found that Wss1 treatment increases the intensity of high molecular weight SUMO able to penetrate the separating gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because this reaction coincided with auto-proteolysis of Wss1 and was suppressed by OPA, it was probably catalyzed by Wss1 metalloprotease activity. Thus, it is likely that Wss1 proteolysis generated SUMO species that more easily entered the gel matrix and produced an apparent increase in SUMO signal.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the proteolysis reaction by SDS-PAGE with coomassie staining, providing a better estimate of the protein quantity than western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bottom panel). Wss1 was activated by thiram and its proteolytic activity was compared with SUMO isopeptidase Ulp1. Notably, Ulp1 cleavage clearly showed that the majority of HMW-SUMO species did not enter the gel and accumulated on the well bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 8). Wss1 treatment produced a distinct smear on the top of the gel suggesting more SUMO species entered the gel matrix. This corroborates the western blot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top panel). The time course of HMW-SUMO processing was similar to Wss1 auto-proteolysis, both being inhibited by OPA. Interestingly, SUMO chains accelerated thiram-induced Wss1 auto-proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lane 2 and lane 6). Thus, similarly to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) HMW-SUMO stimulates Wss1 cleavage, perhaps by promoting Wss1 oligomerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>Wss1 has a SUMO ligase-like activity</title><p>Wss1 has been reported to trim Ub from STUbL substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mullen et al., 2010</xref>) so we asked if expression of Wss1 reduced the levels of ubiquitylated SUMO conjugates. Indeed, expression of Wss1 reduced the amount of ubiquitylated SUMO species in the cell but this reduction was independent of its metalloprotease active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the effect of Wss1 on levels of ubiquitylated SUMO conjugates could be due to competition with STUbL for binding of SUMOylated proteins.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that Wss1 promoted sumoylation of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This effect was reproduced in vitro, where substoichiometric amounts of recombinant Wss1 catalyzed formation of SUMO chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In parallel, we observed that recombinant Wss1 and the WLM* mutant auto-sumoylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Because the reaction was SIM-dependent, it is likely that this E3-like ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) results from the juxtaposition of an E2∼SUMO thiol ester and an acceptor SUMO due to polyvalent SUMO binding by Wss1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merrill et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The WLM* mutant that is unable to bind Zn repeatedly showed higher SUMO ligase activity compared to WT protein. To see whether the release of Zn increases sumoylation, we produced Wss1 apoprotein by OPA titration and analyzed its auto-sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Increasing OPA concentration promotes sumoylation of WT-Wss1. This effect was not due to stimulation of SUMO E1–E2 enzymes because OPA did not increase the sumoylation of the WLM* mutant. At 3 mM OPA, WT, and WLM* formed a similar level of SUMO conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). It seems therefore that extraction of Zn from metalloprotease active site somehow promotes Wss1-dependent sumoylation. Although the mechanism of this effect is not completely clear, it could be explained by our finding that OPA induces Wss1 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The oligomers can be seen by non-reducing gel electrophoresis and disappear in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) suggesting that they are disulfide linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These data suggest that in the absence of Zn the regulatory cysteine 226 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) induces intermolecular disulfide crosslinks, multiplication of SUMO-binding sites and increase in SUMO ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our structural and biochemical analysis suggest that Wss1 is a SUMO-targeted minigluzincin-like metalloprotease that is regulated by a cysteine-switch mechanism. In its latent form, Wss1 binds and promotes SUMO chain elongation, while upon activation by DNA binding the enzyme self-cleaves and is capable of processing HMW-SUMO. Thus, Wss1 may function by synthesizing and/or binding and processing polysumoylated substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vivo activities of WSS1</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Wss1 forms a SUMO-specific ternary complex with Cdc48 and Doa1</title><p>To further understand the regulation of ligase and protease activities of Wss1, we identified its cellular partners.

Doa1 is a Cdc48 cofactor that binds the C-terminus of the chaperone through its PUL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullally et al., 2006</xref>). Because both Cdc48 binding motifs of Wss1, SHP, and VIM, should interact with the N-terminal domain of Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanzelmann and Schindelin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stapf et al., 2011</xref>), we asked whether Wss1, Doa1, and Cdc48 form a ternary complex.

This was confirmed by anti-TAP western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Sumoylation of Cdc48 by Wss1 required the SIM2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Wss1 mutants deficient in Cdc48 binding (R218/219S and F2R, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>) failed to sumoylate Cdc48, yet still produced HMW-SUMO conjugates. This finding suggests that sumoylation by Wss1 is E3-like and requires specific Wss1/substrate interactions. These cellular results were confirmed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) where Cdc48, but not Doa1 were sumoylated by Wss1 and the proteolytic mutant WLM*.

Although similar amounts of HMW-SUMO conjugates were isolated from an F2R strain, it did not contain sumoylated Cdc48, confirming that Wss1 must bind Cdc48 to catalyze its sumoylation. Isolation of Cdc48-TAP complexes with IgG agarose also retrieved HMW-SUMO conjugates. These conjugates were specifically eluted from the IgG agarose by TAP-tag cleavage with TEV protease suggesting that these proteins were bound to Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Upon addition of cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis, there was a progressive decrease in very-HMW-SUMO in the <italic>WSS1</italic> strain accompanied by an increase in intermediate-HMW-SUMO, while the SUMO conjugates of type III showed only slight decline. After 2 hr, only a small decrease in total SUMO conjugates had occurred (20%). In contrast, in the <italic>wss1Δ</italic> strain, very-HMW-SUMO was the most stable SUMO pool, while the other conjugates showed a gradual decrease resulting in a 54% decrease in total SUMO conjugates at 2 hr.</p><p>These data show that, when expressed from its endogenous loci, the protease activity of Wss1 processes specific very-HMW-SUMO and minimizes SUMO degradation. Increasing Wss1 expression using an exogenous promoter may shift cells toward degradation of all SUMO species. Interestingly, neither <italic>ts</italic>-suppression nor clearing of HMW-SUMO by Wss1 require binding to Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Thus, Wss1 acts as a HMW-SUMO-processing protease in <italic>smt3-331</italic> but not in the <italic>SMT3</italic> strain. Several observations suggest that the proteolytic activity of Wss1 might be specifically activated in <italic>smt3-331</italic> cells. Thus, we found that in <italic>smt3-331</italic> strain the level of exogenously expressed HA-Wss1 and, particularly, HA-WLM* protein was greatly decreased in <italic>WSS1</italic> compared to <italic>wss1Δ</italic> cells pointing to a mechanism involving Wss1-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Assuming similar rates of transcription, the massively higher level of ΔSIM2-Wss1 observed in the steady state suggests that this degradation was SUMO dependent. Therefore, consistent with our observations in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), Wss1 appears to undergo autoproteolytic activation and degradation stimulated by interaction with HMW-SUMO. Corroborating this conclusion, Wss1 protein was destabilized in <italic>smt3-331</italic> compared to <italic>SMT3</italic> cells and its degradation depended on the presence of the native protease and SIM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the same time, we found that <italic>wss1Δ</italic> increased the level of Cdc48 protein in <italic>smt3-33</italic>1 mutant, but not in <italic>SMT3</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In complementation assays, only WT Wss1 was able to reduce the level of Cdc48 protein in <italic>wss1Δ</italic> cells. These data suggest that Wss1 degrades itself and Cdc48 in <italic>smt3-331</italic> cells, and that this activity requires its protease domain, SUMO-interaction and Cdc48 binding. Because Wss1 binding to Cdc48 is not required for <italic>ts</italic>-suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), the degradation of Cdc48 by WT-Wss1 seems to be a sort of collateral damage induced by activation of the Wss1 protease by increased HMW-SUMO in <italic>smt3-331</italic> cells. Loss of Cdc48 itself would be detrimental to the cell and the lack of this degradation in F2R-Wss1 could explain why F2R-Wss1 is a better <italic>ts</italic>-suppressor than WT Wss1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06763.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Wss1 protease is activated by DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wss1 degradation is stimulated by DNA damage. <italic>WSS1</italic> and <italic>wss1Δ</italic> cells (<italic>smt3-331</italic>, BY4742, and BY4742 + 0.2 μg/ml 4-NQO) were transformed with HA-Wss1 constructs (<italic>pYEPGAP-URA3</italic> vector) and grown at 30°C.

All Wss1 constructs, except ΔSIM2, co-purified with SUMO-conjugates. Interestingly, all Wss1 complexes, except the F2R mutant (which cannot bind Cdc48) also contained ubiquitylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, middle panel). Because the presence of Ub-conjugates correlated with Cdc48 binding, we assume that these species were bound to Cdc48. The WLM* complex showed the highest level of ubiquitinylated species. Previous study proposed that Wss1 cleaves mixed Ub-SUMO chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mullen et al., 2010</xref>), perhaps explaining the higher level of Ub conjugates in the protease-deficient WLM* complex. However, like others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>) we could not detect such activity in Wss1 complexes using a specific Ub-SUMO substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). On the other hand, as WT and ΔSIM2 complexes had the similar level of Ub-conjugates, it seems that the majority of these species were not sumoylated and interacted with Wss1 primarily through Cdc48. Cdc48 and Wss1 were partially fragmented in WT and <italic>Δ</italic>SIM2, but not WLM* cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>To directly measure Wss1-catalyzed proteolysis of these sumoylated proteins, we examined the stability of Cdc48, Wss1, and sumoylated proteins in purified WT and WLM* complexes. Similarly to what we observed for in vitro-processing of SUMO chains by recombinant Wss1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the isolated WT protein complex accumulated sumoylated species of intermediate size as a result of the proteolysis of HMW-SUMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Proteolysis was likely not the result of cysteine, serine, or threonine proteases because of the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in the lysis buffer and the lack of inhibition by PMSF. In contrast, OPA inhibited SUMO processing, suggesting that metalloprotease activity is involved. In the WLM* complex, an intense ladder of sumoylated protein was present and no degradation of sumoylated species was observed. Notably, both Cdc48 and Wss1 are processed in the WT complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) in a reaction inhibited by OPA, but not by NEM or PMSF. Neither Cdc48 nor Wss1 proteolysis were affected by MG132 proteasome inhibitor, again pointing to metalloprotease activity. The degradation of Cdc48 coincided with the stepwise truncation of Wss1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), reminiscent to what we observed with recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The size of the primary N-terminal Wss1 fragment (25 kD) corresponded to cleavage at V189 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The 25 kD N-terminal fragment underwent further truncation to a 20-kD protein. Sequence analysis suggests that this corresponds to cleavage near the GG sequence in the SHP box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the WLM* mutant remained stable over time, it seems that this proteolysis was a result of Wss1 self-processing and reflected initial steps of protease activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakraborti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomis-Ruth, 2003</xref>). As both Wss1 cleavage sites are conserved in WLM family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>), this may represent a general regulatory mechanism employed by WLM proteases. Wss1 self-cleavage produces an N-terminal activated protease and a C-terminal protein fragment which contains SIMs and VIM motifs and probably still bridges Cdc48 and SUMO-substrates. These mechanisms could serve for spatiotemporal control of the substrate processing, especially if the proteolytic fragments remain associated.</p><p>Altogether, these data demonstrate that DNA damage or a defective SUMO pathway triggers the activation of Wss1 metalloprotease resulting in Wss1 self-processing and degradation of associated proteins. Because Wss1 proteolysis in the cell is SUMO dependent, Wss1 acts as a SUMO-targeted metalloprotease.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-5"><title>Wss1 protects cells from Top1-induced toxicity in the absence of Tdp1</title><p>What are the specific polysumoylated substrates processed by Wss1?

Neither they, nor we, can confirm the SUMO- or Ub-isopeptidase activity previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mullen et al., 2010</xref>), and it seems plausible that it resulted from co-purified deubiquitinating enzymes. Our structural analysis suggests that WLM domains share similar structural organization with minigluzincin proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lopez-Pelegrin et al., 2013</xref>) and SprT enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, see below).</p><p>Recombinant Wss1 produced in bacteria is largely insoluble. When purified under native conditions, soluble protein shows SUMO ligase activity (see below) while protease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) required denaturation and refolding of inclusion bodies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al. (2014)</xref> reported that the protease activity of Wss1 is activated in vitro by any DNA longer than 16 bp. We too see activation by DNA, albeit only when ssDNA is present. We assume that differences in the refolding conditions lead to these subtle differences in the activity of recombinant protein. However, it is important to note that Wss1 protease activity is normally latent, but activated by genotoxic stress in cells.</p><p>Our principal insight into the Wss1 mechanism comes from the finding that the protease is regulated by a cysteine-switch mechanism. We demonstrated that Wss1 proteolysis can be activated by thiol-modifying reagents such as thiram and APMA as well as by ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, polySUMO binding enhances the proteolysis of recombinant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and SIM2 is required for both Wss1 and Cdc48 cleavage under conditions of stress. Thus, binding to DNA is not absolutely required for Wss1 proteolytic activity. Moreover, our observations that Wss1 can process itself, sumoylated proteins and Cdc48 demonstrate that Wss1 substrates are not limited to DNA-bound proteins, as previously suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al. (2014)</xref>. DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and SUMO chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) may play a cofactor role by inducing Wss1 oligomerization and bringing together the protease and its substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our data in vitro and in vivo strongly suggest that polysumoylated proteins are the substrates for Wss1. Although the exact mechanism of how Wss1 processes SUMO conjugates remains unclear, one possible scenario may be the activation of metalloprotease and cleavage within a hinge region of the polysumoylated proteins. Alternatively, our finding that Wss1 binds to SUMO-PA, self-cleaves at C-terminus and produces a ladder of proteolytic fragments upon activation by ssDNA may suggest that it functions as a SUMO-targeted carboxypeptidase.</p><p>Even more surprising was our finding that Wss1 promotes SUMO chain formation in vitro and in unstressed cells, acting as a SUMO ligase. Wss1 shows a preference for binding polysumoylated ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), sumoylates itself and associated cellular proteins, changes the global sumoylation pattern, and partially restores SUMO-conjugates in a <italic>siz1Δ</italic> strain. Sumoylation depended on tandem SIMs at the C-terminus of Wss1 and is probably the result of juxtaposed SUMO binding sites that bring SUMO thiol ester in proximity to an acceptor SUMO. Interestingly, among other known non-canonical SUMO E3-ligases, including RanBP2, polycomb Pc2, topors, Slx5, and Rad18, all, except RanBP2, catalyze sumoylation by SIM-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merrill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker and Ulrich, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the oligomerization of Wss1 may also play an important role in SUMO ligase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The extension of a SUMO-chain by Wss1 may signal assembly of Wss1 complexes required for substrate processing, as well as target these complexes to specific cellular locations. Notably, the sumoylation of Cdc48 was shown to induce its translocation from nucleus to membranous cytoplasmic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makhnevych et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the role of SUMO binding is controversial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al. (2014)</xref> suggested that SUMO binding is dispensable for Wss1 function although they did not demonstrate Wss1 proteolysis in the cell. We show that Wss1-dependent proteolysis is activated under conditions that damage DNA and is SUMO dependent. Although we too observed that Wss1-ΔSIM2 could suppress CPT sensitivity of <italic>wss1Δ tdp1Δ</italic> cells, competent SUMO binding is required for the clearing of HMW-SUMO conjugates as well as Wss1 targeting to <italic>tdp1Δ</italic>-induced foci. Moreover, because cellular Wss1-ΔSIM2 remained stable under various DNA-damaging conditions, it seems that SUMO binding is essential for Wss1 auto-proteolysis as well. The partial effects seen with SIM mutants may be masked by the fact that, as we have shown, the WLM domain also contributes to SUMO binding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Wss1, Cdc48, Doa1, and SUMO-dependent DDR</title><p>We find that full-length Wss1 interacts with Cdc48 ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), supporting a role for Wss1 in removing sumoylated proteins from the chromatin. Wss1 contains VIM and SHP Cdc48-binding motifs, conserved within the WLM family. Moreover, the incidence of other Cdc48-relevant interaction domains in WLM members indicates that these proteins might also be Cdc48 partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyer et al., 2004</xref>). Our structural analysis demonstrated that both VIM and SHP motifs contributed to Cdc48 binding, suggesting a bipartite interaction mechanism, a characteristic mode of binding of common Cdc48 adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruderer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>). We also found that Wss1 specifically binds another Cdc48 cofactor, Doa1, and forms a ternary 1:1:1 Cdc48/Wss1/Doa1 complex. Although Doa1 and Cdc48 have been considered to be Ub specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullally et al., 2006</xref>), we demonstrated here that Wss1 redirects the Doa1/Cdc48 complex to SUMO substrates.</p><p>Another Cdc48 complex, Cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4, binds mixed Ub-SUMO substrates and assists STUbL in SUMO-dependent Top1cc repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nie et al., 2012</xref>).

Indeed, their response to various genotoxic threats places Wss1 and STUbL in the same ‘nucleotide-excision-repair’ (NER) epistasis group.

Both Wss1 and STUbL are involved in Top1cc repair in the absence of Tdp1, pathways shown to be NER-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vance and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heideker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). Although the function of Wss1 and STUbL in NER is unclear, it may be required to reduce the size of NER substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). NER cannot process DNA adducts containing proteins larger than 16 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakano et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2009</xref>), while the size of Top1 protein exceeds 90 kDa. Wss1 and STUbL may also act by removing stalled sumoylated NER enzymes in addition to NER substrates. Recent data demonstrate that DNA damage induces extensive sumoylation of multiple NER components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cremona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>). Although it was suggested that SUMO assists the assembly of repair complexes, in some cases sumoylation promotes protein dissociation and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardeland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez-Miranda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sarangi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Wss1 and STUbL pathways may direct substrates to different downstream degradation events, orchestrated by different Cdc48 complexes. The major degradative machineries of the cell are the proteasome and the vacuole/lysosome, Cdc48 being implicated in both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). Chromatin-associated proteolysis involving STUbL pathways has been linked mostly to the Cdc48/Ufd1/Npl4 complex and the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sriramachandran and Dohmen, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, autophagy is implicated in Wss1-mediated processes; a third of our best-rated MS hits were proteins associated with vesicle transport and the vacuole, indicating a possible role of Cdc48/Wss1/Doa1 complex in vacuolar degradation. Doa1 has been implicated in regulation of two main vacuolar pathways, autophagy and vesicle sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ossareh-Nazari et al., 2010</xref>). We have demonstrated that various genotoxic conditions induce accumulation of Wss1 within the vacuole. Moreover, under genotoxic stress Wss1 was found associated with autophagic vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm and on the vacuolar membrane. Because autophagy is one of the DDR activated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dotiwala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vessoni et al., 2013</xref>), our data suggest an intriguing possibility that Cdc48/Wss1/Doa1 mediates degradation of sumoylated chromatin substrates via specific autophagic mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A model for the role and regulation of Wss1 in DDR</title><p>Our data suggest a model for the SUMO-dependent extraction of proteins from chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). DNA lesions induce exposure of ssDNA and sumoylation of nearby chromatin-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>). Thus, exposure of ssDNA and/or initial sumoylation of proteins at the sites of DNA damage could provide binding sites for Wss1. Its intrinsic ligase activity could then sumoylate other proteins, extending SUMO chains, become proteolytically activated. Wss1 would also recruit Doa1/Cdc48 to disassemble proteins from the damage site(s) and target the complexes to the vacuole. The proteolytic activation of Wss1 both down regulates Wss1 mediated action and fragments other proteins to induce their dissociation. Thus, we propose that autophagy processes poor proteasome substrates formed as a result of DNA damage, that is, protein–protein and protein–nucleic acid crosslinks, irreversibly trapped enzymes and abnormal nucleic acid intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, STUBL could be recruited to ubiquitinate chromosomal lesions that have not been repaired and recruit Doa1/Ufd1/Npl4 to chaperone ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06763.033</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>SUMO-dependent extraction of proteins from the chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ssDNA-activated SUMO E3 ligase sumoylates DNA-bound protein and induces its dissociation.

Wss1 is targeted to sumoylated protein via its SIMs and promotes extension of SUMO chain that in return could further stimulate Wss1 accumulation and oligomerization at the site of DNA damage (Wss1 foci). Binding to ssDNA and oligomerization triggers metalloprotease activity of Wss1 and initiates substrate processing. The process is assisted by Cdc48 and Doa1 and finally ends in the vacuole.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06763.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06763.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06763-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Higher eukaryotes: DVC1/Spartan</title><p>Wss1 shows structural and functional similarity to DVC1/Spartan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), a protein from higher eukaryotes that brings Cdc48 to stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mosbech et al., 2012</xref>). Like Wss1, DVC1/Spartan protects cells from UV damage, probably by removing promiscuous TLS-polymerases from the chromatin. DVC1/Spartan has a putative metalloprotease domain SprT appended to a SHP motif, a PCNA-interacting PIP box and a Ub-binding Zn-finger domain UBZ4. No proteolytic activity has been observed for the proteins of the SprT family, yet the putative protease active site is essential for DVC1/Spartan function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in DVC1/Spartan SprT domain result in genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lessel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maskey et al., 2014</xref>) and have recently been linked to a new progeroid syndrome with early onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lessel et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis suggests that the structure of SprT is very similar to the WLM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, DVC1/Spartan has several cysteine residues, one of which, conserved C205, seems not to be involved in disulfide bonds and is a potential candidate for protease regulation by a cysteine-switch mechanism. Thus, DVC1/Spartan may also be a functional protease that assists Cdc48 in removing chromatin components upon DNA damage stress. While Wss1 is targeted to SUMO, DVC1/Spartan binds PCNA and Ub, reflecting probably the differences in DDR regulation in higher and lower eukaryotes. Notably, in DVC1/Spartan from <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and other species PIP box is replaced by SIM upstream of UBZ4 domain, while some WLM proteins have both SIM and NZF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that these proteins could have dual Ub-SUMO binding specificity and that in higher eukaryotes the SIM function is substituted by PIP motif.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, this work confirms and extends the elegant findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al.

It reveals the regulation of Wss1 activity by a cysteine-switch mechanism, demonstrates a ternary complex of Wss1 with Cdc48 and Doa1 that exhibits specificity for SUMO, and promotes binding of HMW-SUMO to Cdc48, describes for the first time the SUMO ligase activity of Wss1, and demonstrates that Wss1 moves from nuclear foci to the vacuole during stress, reinforcing numerous intriguing links between SUMO-dependent DDR and vacuolar degradation. Finally, Wss1 proteolytic activity may be downregulated by auto-proteolysis to terminate the stress-activated proteolysis by Wss1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast techniques and genetic manipulations</title><p>Strain construction, cell growth, yeast transformation, spotting assay followed standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guthrie and Fink, 2002</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript extends the recent work by Stingele et al. in analyzing the function of Wss1 during DNA damage and repair events. Both by in vivo and in vitro experiments show that Wss1 promotes SUMOylation and is also responsible for clearing high molecular weight SUMO conjugates by forming a ternary complex with Cdc48 and its adaptor Doa1. The study systematically characterized the SUMO binding by Wss1 in an elegant way especially analyzing the contribution of WLM domain towards SUMO binding. Wss1 can bind to poly SUMO conjugates and also act as a SUMO ligase to promote SUMO chain formation. Proteolytic activity of Wss1 was tested in vivo and once again they showed that the metalloprotease activity is indeed SUMO-dependent during genotoxic stress. In addition, Wss1 is localized in vacuoles upon genotoxic stress in a SUMO-dependent manner indicating to the link between SUMO-dependent DDR and autophagic events.</p><p>There are three major points that should be addressed before the manuscript is acceptable for publication:</p><p>1) The analysis of the protease activity. The authors mention reported isopeptidase activity of Wss1 towards Ub-SUMO linkages, and state that they cannot see isopeptidase activity. However, the authors test the activity of Wss1 in vitro only towards a peptide-linked fusion construct (i.e. not an isopeptide). These experiments were also done in absence of DNA, which they show activates the protease. The fact that the WLM catalytic domain contributes to SUMO binding, recognizes the C-terminus of SUMO, and binds very nicely to a novel activity-based SUMO-PA probe suggest that Wss1 may be a deSUMOylase. This is somewhat suggested by cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5 and 6</xref>). In principle, testing deSUMOylase activity (against an isopeptide bond) should be a straightforward experiment that may put to rest some of the apparent issues in the literature. For this SUMO-FP reagents could be utilized.</p><p>2) Wss1 as a SUMO ligase. The authors surprisingly show that Wss1 contains E3 ligase activity, and this depends on functional SIMs in Wss1. By over expressing various Wss1 mutants and interacting partners Wss1 contributes to their SUMOylation. Their model seems to be that the two SIMs act in an E3-like fashion. If this was the case, why is the C-terminal fragment of Wss1 inactive in ligase assays? Also, why are other proteins with multiple SIMs, such as RNF4, not also SUMO ligases? It would be very satisfying to see additional residues in Wss1 be involved in ligase activity.</p><p>3) The authors claim that Wss1 is involved in vacuolar degradation during DDR events. The authors should provide more direct evidence about the link between Wss1 and vacuolar degradation, e.g. the authors should show the co-localization of Wss1 and Doa1 or Cdc48 in the presence of 4-NQO. Secondly, they should test if any other component of the DDR is found in the vacuole in the presence or absence of Wss1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Wss1 metalloprotease partners with Cdc48/Doa1 in processing genotoxic SUMO conjugates” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Readers may not be familiar with the structure and mechanism of thiram, which should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>2) The authors leave the reader with a discussion of a protease activity towards SUMO that is not a deSUMOylase (isopeptidase) activity, yet still ‘processes’ SUMO chains, based on gel analysis. It should be mentioned somewhere that the mechanism, site and products of processing are unclear.</p><p>3) Cdc48 is a hexamer. It is unclear what the authors mean by a 1:1:1 complex – please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06763.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The analysis of the protease activity.

In principle, testing deSUMOylase activity (against an isopeptide bond) should be a straightforward experiment that may put to rest some of the apparent issues in the literature. For this SUMO-FP reagents could be utilized</italic>.</p><p>We performed the experiments proposed by the reviewers.</p><p>First of all, we established the conditions to produce active recombinant Wss1 metalloprotease. This led us to the discovery of cysteine-regulation (cysteine switch) mechanism and the fact that DNA is not required for Wss1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2 fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplements 1-3</xref>). In these experiments, self-cleavage of the protease is a measure of the activation of Wss1 protease.</p><p>We too were surprised that isopeptidase activity was not demonstrable with the activated Wss1 protease. Binding to SUMO-PA may simply mean that the metal site is nearby to the SUMO binding site, not necessarily that it is catalytically involved as an isopeptidase.</p><p>We examined the active Wss1 for cleavage of three different SUMO substrates: polySUMO-chains (multiple iso-peptide bonds), SUMO1-FP substrate (monoSUMO fluorescent iso-peptide substrate) and linear His6-Ub-SUMO-HA (peptide-linked fusion construct). The proteolysis by Wss1 was compared with SUMO-isopeptidase Ulp1, and Ub-isopeptidase Usp2 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data suggest that Wss1 is not a SUMO-isopeptidase but rather processes polySUMO chains, probably due to metalloprotease activity in a hinge region of the polySUMO conjugates.</p><p><italic>2) Wss1 as a SUMO ligase. The authors surprisingly show that Wss1 contains E3 ligase activity, and this depends on functional SIMs in Wss1. By over expressing various Wss1 mutants and interacting partners Wss1 contributes to their SUMOylation. Their model seems to be that the two SIMs act in an E3-like fashion. If this was the case, why is the C-terminal fragment of Wss1 inactive in ligase assays? Also, why are other proteins with multiple SIMs, such as RNF4, not also SUMO ligases? It would be very satisfying to see additional residues in Wss1 be involved in ligase activity</italic>.</p><p>A priori, the presence of multiple properly oriented SIMs may be sufficient to confer SUMO ligase-like activity to a protein. For Slx5, the yeast RNF4 homolog, such activity has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ii et al., 2007</xref>), even though the physiological relevance of this finding is unclear. Interestingly, among other known non-RING SUMO E3-ligases – including RanBP2, polycomb Pc2, topors, and Rad18 – all, except RanBP2, catalyze sumoylation by SIM-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merrill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker and Ulrich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perry et al., 2008</xref>). We discuss this now in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, the C-terminal fragment of Wss1 was indeed inactive in ligase assays. Our data and the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stingele et al. (2014)</xref> suggest that Wss1 protein is prone to oligomerization and this may be important for regulation of the protein ligase function. Although we didn’t address this question in detail, it seems plausible that, like for some other metalloproteases, the protease domain itself oligomerizes. Oligomerization increases the number of SUMO-binding sites and hence may further promote SUMO ligase activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). Corroborating this conclusion we found that induction of Wss1 oligomerization by OPA treatment stimulates its auto-sumoylation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Finally, It may be that the SUMO binding by WLM is necessary to form a functional catalytic site, especially since SIMs present such a small interacting surface and may not be able to properly orient the SUMO for optimal catalysis.</p><p><italic>3) The authors claim that Wss1 is involved in vacuolar degradation during DDR events. The authors should provide more direct evidence about the link between Wss1 and vacuolar degradation, e.g. the authors should show the co-localization of Wss1 and Doa1 or Cdc48 in the presence of 4-NQO. Secondly, they should test if any other component of the DDR is found in the vacuole in the presence or absence of Wss1</italic>.</p><p>Because of time and space constraints we were unable to complete the requested studies. We agree with the reviewers that this point is not developed (and we emphasize this in the text). However, we feel that the questions asked by the reviewers are important enough that they should be addressed in depth in a dedicated independent study, rather than appended to this manuscript.</p><p>We think it is important to include these preliminary findings because they point to an entirely new aspect of Wss1 function that could have profound importance. Our observations are that: (1) Three different genotoxic stresses (UV, <italic>smt3-331</italic>, tdpΔ) all resulted in accumulation of Wss1 in the vacuole; (2) A third of the highest-ranked proteins associated with Wss1 were proteins associated with vesicle transport and vacuole; (3) The major Wss1 interactor, a Cdc48/cofactor Doa1 complex, is unequivocally involved in regulation of two main vacuolar pathways, autophagy and vesicle sorting. This demonstrates that there is a significant connection between Wss1 function and this organelle, seemingly in response to DDR and other stressors.</p><p>We feel there is little mechanistic detail to be gained from the simple co-localization studies requested. It is already known that DDR induces autophagy and DDR components are degraded by the vacuole/lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dotiwala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vessoni et al., 2013</xref>), and that sumoylated Cdc48 is targeted to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makhnevych et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it may not be surprising that Wss1 complexes with Doa1 and Cdc48 would co-localize with substrates in the vacuole.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) Readers may not be familiar with the structure and mechanism of thiram, which should be discussed in more detail</italic>.</p><p>We added one phrase in the Results explaining that Th modifies proteins by thiol-disulfide exchange, as well as two supporting new references. We also added new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, which illustrates this mechanism.</p><p><italic>2) The authors leave the reader with a discussion of a protease activity towards SUMO that is not a deSUMOylase (isopeptidase) activity, yet still ‘processes’ SUMO chains, based on gel analysis. It should be mentioned somewhere that the mechanism, site and products of processing are unclear</italic>.</p><p>We have added several phrases in the Discussion outlining that, although the exact mechanism of how Wss1 processes SUMO conjugates remains unclear, one possible scenario may be the activation of metalloprotease and cleavage within a hinge region of the polysumoylated proteins. Alternatively, our finding that Wss1 binds to SUMO-PA, self-cleaves at C-terminus and produces a ladder of proteolytic fragments upon activation by ssDNA may suggest that it functions as a SUMO-targeted carboxypeptidase.</p><p><italic>3) Cdc48 is a hexamer. It is unclear what the authors mean by a 1:1:1 complex - please clarify</italic>.</p><p>Actually, that is why we inserted the pictograms of Cdc48 complexes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, where it is clear that 1:1:1 complex means 6:6:6 or one monomer of Wss1 per monomer of Cdc48.</p></body></sub-article></article>
