ON and OFF pathways, for example, encode increases or decreases of a stimulus from a common input. This ON/OFF pathway split is thought to occur at individual synaptic connections through a sign-inverting synapse in one of the pathways. Here, we show that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic process in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system. A pharmacogenetics approach demonstrates that both glutamatergic inhibition through GluClα and GABAergic inhibition through Rdl mediate ON responses. Although neurons postsynaptic to the glutamatergic ON pathway input L1 lose all responses in <italic>GluClα</italic> mutants, they are resistant to a cell-type-specific loss of <italic>GluClα</italic>. This shows that ON selectivity is distributed across multiple synapses, and raises the possibility that cell-type-specific manipulations might reveal similar strategies in other sensory systems. Thus, sensory coding is more distributed than predicted by simple circuit motifs, allowing for robust neural processing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49373.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We rely on our senses to capture information about the world around us. Sense organs convert sensory information – such as light or sound waves – into patterns of neuronal activity. In the mammalian retina, for example, specialized neurons called photoreceptors detect individual photons of light as they hit the back of the eye. The photoreceptors then pass on this information to neurons called bipolar cells for further processing.</p><p>During darkness, all photoreceptors release the same chemical signal onto bipolar cells, namely a molecule called glutamate. But bipolar cells respond to glutamate in different ways depending on which proteins are present in their outer membrane. So-called ON cells respond to glutamate by decreasing their activity, and thus effectively become more active when light levels increase. By contrast, OFF cells respond to glutamate by increasing their activity. This ON/OFF binary code enables later stages of the visual system to detect more complex visual features, such as shape and movement.</p><p>A new study in fruit flies, however, suggests that the ON/OFF code may be more complex than previously thought. While fruit fly eyes look very different to our own, the two have much in common. By studying fruit flies, researchers can also take advantage of a variety of genetic and pharmacological tools to manipulate cells and neuronal circuits.</p><p>Using such tools, Molina-Obando et al. show that the ON/OFF signal separation in fruit flies uses two different molecular mechanisms. The first involves a gene called GluCl-alpha, which encodes a receptor for glutamate. The second involves a gene called Rdl, which encodes a receptor for another brain chemical, GABA. Deleting the gene for GluCl-alpha from the entire fly brain prevented ON cells from responding to an increase in light levels. However, deleting this gene from specific ON cells alone did not. This suggests that flies can use more than one type of neuronal connection to detect an increase in light. Moreover, if one pathway fails, the other can take over. This makes the system more robust.</p><p>The results of Molina-Obando et al. are consistent with findings from anatomical studies that have mapped connections between neurons. Future studies should explore whether the same mechanisms exist in other sensory systems, and other animals. These experiments could take advantage of the molecular tools developed as part of the current work, which allow precise manipulation of neural networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>feature extraction</kwd><kwd>ON selectivity</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>GABAergic inhibition</kwd><kwd>glutamatergic inhibition</kwd><kwd>distributed coding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether SI 1991/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henning</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name><name><surname>Gür</surname><given-names>Burak</given-names></name><name><surname>Akhtar</surname><given-names>Junaid</given-names></name><name><surname>Silies</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB889, Project C08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Molina-Obando</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Vargas-Fique</surname><given-names>Juan Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fundamental visual computation, the establishment of ON selectivity, is established across distributed circuits, allowing for more robust and flexible coding than suggested by core circuit motifs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals rely on their sensory systems to process behaviorally relevant information. One common feature of sensory systems is the sequential processing of information to extract complex features from simple inputs. For example, in the visual system, photoreceptors detect light and then downstream neurons progressively extract distinct features, such as contrast, direction of motion, form, or specific objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gollisch and Meister, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Livingstone and Hubel, 1988</xref>). Sensory pathways diverge into pathways that become selective for increasingly specific features.</p><p>One prominent example is the split into ON and OFF pathways, where individual neurons become selective to either increases (ON) or decreases (OFF) in a signal. Such an ON/OFF dichotomy enables more efficient coding of stimuli in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gjorgjieva et al., 2014</xref>) and occurs across many different species and sensory modalities, such as vision, olfaction, audition, thermosensation, and electrolocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scholl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tichy and Hellwig, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Werblin and Dowling, 1969</xref>). Examples of how the split into ON and OFF pathways is implemented in sensory information processing have already been described. In the vertebrate retina, ON and OFF pathways split downstream of glutamatergic photoreceptors where ionotropic glutamate receptors on OFF bipolar cells maintain the sign of the response in the OFF pathway, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6, located on ON bipolar cells, inverts the sign in the ON pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koike et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vardi, 1998</xref>). In the olfactory system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, an odor response can be split into parallel pathways in which glutamate-gated chloride channels mediate the ON response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>). While these transformations are thought to occur at specific synapses, connectomics data reveals that neural circuits are intricate and that many of the possible neuronal connections are realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). This argues that important signal transformations might actually be distributed across wider circuit motifs.</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, ON and OFF pathways functionally split in the first order lamina interneurons, but the physiological specialization occurs one synaptic layer further downstream. In brief, information travels from the retina, which houses the photoreceptors, through three optic ganglia: the lamina, the medulla, and the lobula complex, comprising lobula and lobula plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Contrast is encoded by the transient response of photoreceptors, and downstream lamina neurons amplify the contrast-sensitive signal component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laughlin, 1989</xref>). Then, distinct ON and OFF pathways are required to detect contrast increments and decrements, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2014</xref>). In the lamina, L1 is the major input to the ON pathway, whereas L2 and L3 feed into the OFF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>). The assignment of L1, L2, and L3 to ON and OFF pathways originates from neuronal silencing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>). However, all lamina neurons receiving direct input from photoreceptors depolarize to the offset of light and hyperpolarize to the onset of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laughlin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uusitalo et al., 1995</xref>), thus passing on information about both ON and OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Voltage or calcium signals in most downstream medulla neurons then selectively report only one type of contrast polarity. The major ON pathway medulla neurons Mi1 and Tm3, for example, selectively respond with depolarization or an increase in calcium signal to ON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). In the OFF pathway, most neurons instead selectively respond to OFF stimuli, retaining the response polarity of their lamina inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, ON selectivity requires a sign inversion between the L1 input and its postsynaptic partners Mi1 and Tm3. Previous work suggested that the L1 input to the ON pathway is glutamatergic, whereas L2 and L3, the two major inputs to the OFF pathway, are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that glutamate might also be used as an inhibitory neurotransmitter to implement ON/OFF dichotomy in the fly visual system. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms implementing this signal transformation are not known in <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual circuitry.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49373.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ON pathway medulla neurons that receive graded, glutamatergic input.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the fly visual system, highlighting major neurons of the ON (colored) and OFF (gray) pathways.

In the ON pathway, L1 makes the largest number of synapses with the medulla intrinsic Mi1 neuron and the transmedullary Tm3 interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). However, L1 has many other outputs, and Mi1 and Tm3 many additional inputs, such as indirect L1 input via L5, or the GABAergic neuron C2, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, coding in the visual system could be distributed across parallel pathways. One synaptic layer downstream, Mi1 and Tm3 medulla neurons project to T4, the first direction-selective cells of the ON pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). This core visual circuit motif appears to be surprisingly resilient to perturbations. While genetic silencing of Mi1 or Tm3 leads to some deficits in ON edge motion detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2017</xref>), these flies are not ON motion blind, arguing that other neurons must also play a role in motion detection. Mi4 and Mi9 have now been added to the ON pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). These cell types are modulated by octopamine, but silencing Mi4 or Mi9 individually has only subtle phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Strother et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). In the OFF pathway, combinatorial block of more than one cell type aggravates behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>). This is also already true for the lamina neuron inputs L1, L2 and L3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silies et al., 2013</xref>). This could argue that individual neurons might have distinct, but overlapping tuning properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tuthill et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, encoding of a single aspect of a feature might already be distributed across parallel pathways.</p><p>Here, we show that ON selectivity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system is mediated by a glutamate-gated chloride channel, GluClα, and that all ON responses are lost upon pharmacological block or genetic loss of GluClα in the entire brain. At the same time, ON responses are robust to cell-type-specific perturbations of GluClα in individual neurons postsynaptic to L1, arguing for the existence of parallel functional pathways. Furthermore, we found that GABAergic inhibition also plays a role in mediating ON responses downstream of the glutamatergic L1 input. Together, our results indicate that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic computation that depends on both glutamatergic and GABAergic inhibition. This suggests that a seemingly simple computation can be implemented in a multisynaptic manner, allowing for greater functional robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ON pathway medulla neurons receive graded, glutamatergic input</title><p>To test if medulla neurons in the ON pathway receive glutamatergic input resembling the L1 response, we used the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richter et al., 2018</xref>). We selectively expressed iGluSnFR in the two major postsynaptic targets of L1: the medulla neurons Mi1 and Tm3. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we measured visually evoked responses on Mi1 and Tm3 dendrites reflecting their glutamatergic inputs in medulla layers M1 and M5. We also recorded iGluSnFR signals in the neurons’ output layer, M9/10. In M1 and M5, both Mi1 and Tm3 neurons showed an increase in iGluSnFR signal in response to light OFF and a decrease in iGluSnFR signal in response to light ON, showing that rectification happens downstream of the glutamatergic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These signals were of the same polarity as intracellular calcium signals recorded within the presynaptic L1 axon terminals, and of the opposite polarity to calcium signals in the same layers of Mi1 and Tm3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). In the proximal medulla (layer M9/10), Mi1 and Tm3 neurons showed weak iGluSnFR signals that increased in response to both light ON and OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This data shows that the major postsynaptic targets of L1 receive glutamatergic input that provides information about both ON and OFF signals, which is in line with graded inputs coming from the L1 input to the ON pathway. Other glutamatergic inputs might further shape medulla neuron properties in the proximal medulla.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ON responses are lost at PTX concentrations affecting GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and GluCls</title><p>We hypothesized that glutamatergic inhibition mediates the sign inversion between the dendritic extracellular glutamate signals and intracellular calcium or voltage signals measured in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>). Glutamatergic inhibition can be mediated either by metabotropic glutamate receptors or by ionotropic glutamate-gated chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cully et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parmentier et al., 1996</xref>). To determine which of these receptor types mediates ON responses, we recorded in vivo calcium signals in response to visual stimuli in the two major postsynaptic partners of L1 while pharmacologically inhibiting each of the two receptor classes. When flies expressing GCaMP6f in Mi1 neurons were shown 5 s full-field flashes, Mi1 showed a transient increase in calcium signals in response to the ON step that decayed to reach a plateau response within 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Bath application of 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethenyl) pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP), a selective blocker of metabotropic glutamate receptors, to the same flies did not reduce the responses to visual light flashes in Mi1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Before drug application, Tm3 responses to ON flashes showed a transient light response. Similar to Mi1, Tm3 responses were not affected by MPEP application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>We next applied picrotoxin (PTX), a drug that is known to inhibit glutamate-gated chloride channels at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cully et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etter et al., 1999</xref>), but which also affects GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at much lower concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takeuchi and Takeuchi, 1969</xref>).

Upon bath application of 100 μM PTX, visual responses were completely abolished in Mi1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, when we tested the effect of low concentrations (2.5 μM) of PTX, ON responses were also lost in Mi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test this effect more precisely, we used a range of PTX concentrations and observed a loss of visual responses at concentrations ranging from 2.5 μM to 100 μM PTX in Mi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When we performed the same experiments in Tm3, we again found all ON responses to be eliminated in 100 μM PTX and strongly reduced at low concentrations of PTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

When we measured flash responses in T4/T5 cells expressing GCaMP6f, these neurons hardly showed any response to full-field flashes before toxin application, due to surround inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>). Upon bath application of 2.5 μM PTX, these flash responses were disinhibited, and T4/T5 neurons responded with an increase in calcium signal to both light ON and OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2015b</xref>). Thus, T4/T5 neurons still show flash responses under conditions in which all responses of their predominant Mi1 and Tm3 inputs are abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). This suggests, that at least under low PTX concentrations, other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>) and a lack of local inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>) can contribute to T4 responses.</p><p>After increasing the concentration of PTX to 100 μM within the same fly, all ON responses were abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), showing that T4 no longer receives any functional inputs at high PTX concentrations.

Alternatively, if GluClα<sup>S278T</sup> was fully insensitive, this would further argue that PTX blocks other channels that are required for ON responses, and would thus underline the importance of Rdl.

Together, our data provides support for a combinatorial role of glutamatergic and GABAergic inhibition in mediating ON responses. Because of the glutamatergic L1 input, GluClα is likely to be the receptor on all neurons postsynaptic to L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

Because L1 is the major input to the ON pathway and is glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2011</xref>), all ON responses might still depend on <italic>GluClα</italic> at the first synapse postsynaptic to L1. This leads to the hypothesis that Mi1 or Tm3 responses would be lost in a full <italic>GluClα</italic> mutant background. To test this, we used a FlpStop allele inserted in the disrupting orientation. In this background, expression should be fully disrupted in all cells normally expressing <italic>GluClα</italic>.

Instead, Mi1 even showed a small and transient decrease in calcium signal in response to light ON, which could potentially be attributed to the additional presence of excitatory glutamate receptors or reveal inputs from the OFF pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Thus, normal ON responses are lost whenever <italic>GluClα</italic> function is disrupted in the entire visual system, but not when it is disrupted in a cell-type-specific manner. These data are further consistent with the results of pharmacological experiments in wild type and PTX-insensitive alleles.

Interestingly, the calcium signal even decreased, indicating inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,G</xref>). Inhibition was previously shown to be an important part of motion computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruntman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haag et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salazar-Gatzimas et al., 2016</xref>). This could argue that, in the absence of all ON inputs, feed-forward inhibition onto T4 is revealed. Alternatively, T5 neurons might have lost rectification and respond to ON with a decrease in calcium. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we recorded flash responses in layer M10 of the medulla. Here, T4 and T5 projections do not overlap and calcium signals will stem exclusively from T4 dendrites. We found that T4 dendrites also show a negative calcium signal in response to ON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,H</xref>), revealing that this inhibition is present in T4 neurons but masked in the presence of <italic>GluClα</italic>. Furthermore, there was an increase in calcium signal during OFF in T4 dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), suggesting a loss of <italic>GluClα</italic>-dependent inhibition that is normally active during OFF.

As expected from the major input to the ON pathway being glutamatergic, broad <italic>GluClα</italic> function is required for all ON responses in medulla neurons or downstream direction-selective cells. However, individual cell types downstream of the glutamatergic L1 input are resilient to a cell-type-specific loss of <italic>GluClα</italic>, demonstrating that ON selectivity is computed in a distributed manner. We further show that both the glutamate-gated chloride channel <italic>GluClα</italic> and the GABA-gated chloride channel <italic>Rdl</italic> are widely expressed in the visual system and together mediate ON responses. Thus, ON selectivity is a multisynaptic computation that is established across distributed circuits.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ON selectivity is mediated by both glutamatergic and GABAergic inhibition</title><p>Our work shows that visual responses in the first ON-selective neuron of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system uses a combination of <italic>GluClα</italic> and <italic>Rdl</italic> receptors. This reveals a new biophysical mechanism through which ON and OFF pathway dichotomy can be established. While pharmacology can be used to deduce the function of specific molecular mechanisms, these approaches are often not specific to one protein. GluCls and GABARs belong to the same receptor family of ligand-gated chloride channels and have closely related structure and phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynagh et al., 2015</xref>). All known noncompetitive antagonists like Picrotoxin, γ-HCH, dieldrin, EBOB and fibronil target both receptor types although the actions are weaker in GluCls compared to GABARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eguchi et al., 2006</xref>). Along these lines, PTX was thought to affect GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor at low concentrations, and additionally affect GluCls at high concentrations in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCavera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takeuchi and Takeuchi, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</xref>). Here, the use of PTX-insensitive alleles for glutamate and GABA-gated chloride channels allowed us to deduce that, in vivo<italic>, GluClα</italic> is already blocked by PTX at lower concentrations than previously thought, and that both <italic>GluClα</italic> and <italic>Rdl</italic> play critical roles for ON responses in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system. These pharmacogenetic experiments using toxin-insensitive alleles prove to be a powerful tool to unambiguously assign specific effects to individual channels.</p><p>One benefit of the use of two inhibitory transmitter systems might be the distribution of sensory coding across parallel synapses. GluClα and Rdl also appear to have very different channel dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cully et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ffrench-Constant et al., 1993</xref>). Interestingly, PTX-insensitive <italic>GluClα</italic> and <italic>Rdl</italic> alleles predominantly rescue different aspects of the visual responses. Whereas <italic>GluClα<sup>S278T</sup></italic> predominantly rescued the peak response in all medulla layers, <italic>Rdl<sup>MDRR</sup></italic> mainly rescued the plateau response. This is consistent with our results and with previous oocyte recordings revealing that GluClα is fast desensitizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cully et al., 1996</xref>). It is also consistent with in vivo recordings of inhibitory glutamate currents in the honeybee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbara et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, GABA receptors stay open throughout the period in which the transmitter is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ffrench-Constant et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, the use of different inhibitory receptors might allow different aspects of a temporally structured stimulus to be encoded. This is consistent with the finding that two different types of inhibition are also in place in the vertebrate retina. There, GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition diversify the response properties of bipolar cells through a direct influence on temporal and spatial features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franke et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While both receptors appear to be broadly expressed in many cell types of the visual system, they could be co-expressed with different transporters and channels, and interact with different molecular partners, further diversifying their role. Another common strategy to generate functional diversity is the bringing together of different receptor subunits with certain homology. Both mammalian GlyR and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can function as hetero-oligomers made up of different subunits and thus generating functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz, 1990</xref>). There are at least three different GluCl subtypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that can be combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cully et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horoszok et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, only one gene coding for a glutamate-gated chloride channel has been identified. Although alternative splicing and post-transcriptional modifications could alter channel function, all known isoforms are identical in their functional domains. However, heteropentameric channels composed of mixed Rdl and GluClα subunits have been suggested biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ludmerer et al., 2002</xref>). Such a potential presence of hybrid channels might also explain the higher in vivo sensitivity of GluClα to PTX in some cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, S7). Finally, two distinct inhibitory transmitter systems might be suitable for individual changes during evolution, allowing for adaptation to specific contextual constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ON selectivity is a multisynaptic computation</title><p>Our experiments revealed that <italic>GluClα</italic> is not exclusively required in a cell-autonomous manner for ON responses, since loss of <italic>GluClα</italic> function in Mi1 or Tm3 individually does not lead to a loss of ON responses. It is unlikely that this is due to an incomplete loss of function, since independent genetic tools (FlpStop and RNAi) that both disrupted <italic>GluClα</italic> expression substantially at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) gave the same result. Furthermore, the same FlpStop allele effectively abolished all ON responses when <italic>GluClα</italic> function was disrupted within its entire expression pattern. Additionally, a PTX-resistant Rdl channel can mediate ON responses in a PTX background, although L1 is not GABAergic. Together, these results suggest that ON selectivity is not a monosynaptic computation, but that parallel functional pathways can even compensate for the loss of the major synaptic connection that links L1 directly to Mi1 or Tm3. Thus, the emergence of ON selectivity is more distributed than suggested by minimal core circuit motifs. One synaptic layer further downstream, optogenetic activation of Mi1 and Tm3 most strongly contributes to T4/T5 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). However, our data further show that T4/T5 neurons still respond to ON stimuli when both Mi1 and Tm3 responses are completely blocked by PTX, arguing that other neurons also significantly contribute to T4/T5 responses under visual stimulation and suggesting that coding is again more distributed at this stage.</p><p>Based on connectomics, one can speculate about candidates for the implementation of these parallel circuit motifs between L1 and Mi1 and Tm3. The lamina neuron L5 and the GABAergic feedback neurons C2 and C3 receive L1 inputs and could be part of an interconnected local microcircuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>). Intercolumnar neurons, not present in the current connectome datasets, like Pm or Dm neurons, might also be involved and are likely glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raghu and Borst, 2011</xref>). In fact, there are close to 100 cell types in the visual system and ~60 medulla neurons, but their role is so far unknown. Sensory pathway splits in the periphery are one of the most fundamental steps in sensory processing. Turning this into a process that parallel pathways can achieve might make this important feature extraction step robust to perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>GluClα mutants reveal GABAergic inhibition onto T4 dendrites</title><p>T4 flash responses in a <italic>GluClα-</italic>deficient background show an increase in calcium signal during the OFF epoch and a decrease during the ON epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For a long time, the mechanisms that generate direction-selective responses in T4/T5 neurons were thought to rely on feedforward excitatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang and Clandinin, 2018</xref>). Recently, it was suggested that these direction-selective cells in the fly visual system also implement mechanisms that rely on null-direction suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haag et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salazar-Gatzimas et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas electrophysiological recordings showed inhibition in T4 when the trailing edge of the receptive field was specifically stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruntman et al., 2018</xref>), whole-cell recording experiments of T4/T5 neurons are daunting and this is the first time that calcium imaging data directly reveals inhibition in response to single ON flashes. Since glutamatergic inhibition via GluClα was disrupted in this experimental context, our data suggests that this is due to GABAergic inhibition. Several neuronal candidates could make inhibitory synapses onto T4 dendrites. Based on connectomics and neurotransmitter identity, neurons like Mi4, C3, CT1 or TmY15 give direct input and are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meier and Borst, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, this decrease in calcium signal in T4 might come from a lack of excitatory inputs in a GluClα mutant background. Interestingly, Mi1 and Tm3 themselves show inhibition in response to light when GluClα is blocked. However, this effect is more pronounced at their dendrites than in their output layer and shows different kinetics. Our work might thus help uncover a GABAergic inhibitory input to T4 that is more strongly apparent in the absence of Mi1 and Tm3 excitation, and could ultimately reveal the circuit implementation for the inhibitory component of T4/T5 receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salazar-Gatzimas et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, our data also reveals an increase in calcium during OFF stimulation. The major inputs to T4 are themselves rectified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>). However, rectification in T4 might not be purely inherited by its inputs but also further strengthened at the T4 dendrites. Our findings thus suggest that glutamatergic inhibition contributes to establishing or maintaining contrast selectivity in T4.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary advantages of glutamatergic ionotropic inhibition</title><p>Both <italic>GluClα</italic> and <italic>Rdl</italic> are ionotropic ligand-gated receptors. While ionotropic receptors also implement the ON and OFF pathway split in <italic>C. elegans</italic> chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>), examples in vertebrate vision, olfaction and gustation require metabotropic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandrashekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nei et al., 2008</xref>). Ionotropic receptors appear to be more common in insects than in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silbering and Benton, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, glutamate-gated chloride channels have independently arisen three times within invertebrate clades and are present in arthropods, molluscs and flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lynagh et al., 2015</xref>), arguing for a strong evolutionary benefit. Ionotropic receptors mediate rapid transduction events at scales smaller than a millisecond, whereas metabotropic ones are in the millisecond to second range and last longer, from seconds to several minutes, due to an enzymatic secondary cascade previous to channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shiells, 1994</xref>). The evolutionary choice of the specific glutamatergic inhibitory system needs to match the sensory processing speed required for accurate behavioral responses in these species. For example, at the photoreceptor level, invertebrate phototransduction is faster than vertebrate phototransduction thanks to sophisticated molecular strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardie and Raghu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katz and Minke, 2009</xref>). Also, the latency of olfactory sensory neurons responses in mammals is longer than that observed in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silbering and Benton, 2010</xref>). One advantage that metabotropic receptors have over ionotropic receptors is further amplification of the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shiells, 1994</xref>). The distributed circuit architecture proposed here might therefore strengthen signaling in a system that uses ionotropic signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Potential implications for sensory processing in other systems</title><p>Here we showed that ON selectivity is not a monosynaptic process as described in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Masu et al., 1995</xref>).

Embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach (DanKlorix) for 3 min, followed by washing in a buffer (100 mM NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100) for 3 min. Injections were done on a Nikon AZ100 microscope using a FemtoJet 4i (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The injection mix (20 µl) consisted of 10 µg of the FlpStop construct, 6 µg of helper DNA (pBS130 containing the PhiC31 integrase) and 4 µl of 5x injection buffer (25 mM KCl, 0.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, pH 6.8, 1% phenol red [Sigma Aldrich]).

In brief, the gRNA was cloned into a U6 promoter plasmid. Cassette-inverted PBacDsRed containing two PBac terminals, 3xP3-DsRed and two homology arms with point mutation S278T was cloned into pUC57-Kan as donor template for repair. GluClα-targeting gRNAs and hs-Cas9 were supplied in DNA plasmids, together with donor plasmid for microinjection into embryos of control strain w1118.

RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA quality was confirmed by the presence of both 18S and 28S ribosomal peaks and the lack of evidence of RNA degradation (RNA integrity number &gt;5) (Fragment Analyser, Agilent). cDNA synthesis was done using SuperScript VILO kit and master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the qRT-PCR, three biological and three technical replicates were used per genotype. For each sample, 1 µl of cDNA (1:8 dilution) was mixed with 7 µl H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 µl SYBR Green MM and 1 µl forward and 1 µl reverse primers for a given gene. Standard curves for every primer pair were taken at least once in each experiment. For run-to-run variations, each 96-well plate contained positive and negative controls in the same chosen dilution as the experimental samples. The qRT-PCR analysis software (Light Cycler 480) determined the Ct values for each technical replicate using the first peak of the second derivative method. The mean of three readings was used to estimate Ct values for each biological replicate. The Delta-Delta Ct method was used to calculate relative transcript levels: % Transcript difference = 2<sup>∧</sup>([Ct ND target gene – Ct ND reference gene] – [Ct D target gene – Ct D reference gene]). For presentation purposes, all observations were normalized to the mean transcript level of the WT genotype. The housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH2</italic> was used as reference gene for relative mRNA quantification of <italic>GluClα</italic> levels. Primers were designed to amplify a product spanning the two exons flanking the intron containing the FlpStop cassette, <italic>GluClα</italic> exons 18 and 19, resulting in a 137 bp long amplicon.

For experiments, toxin stock solutions were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and diluted to the appropriate concentrations in the calcium imaging solution. This solution was then used for a maximum of 3 days, stored at 4°C. All toxins were bath applied. No perfusion was used before or after toxin application.

To correct for motion artifact, individual images were aligned to a reference image composed of a maximum intensity projection of the first 30 frames. The average intensity for manually selected ROIs was computed for each imaging frame and background subtracted to generate a time-trace of the response. ROI identities were kept for matching identical ROIs before and after toxin application for paired analysis. All responses and visual stimuli were interpolated at 10 Hz and trial averaged. Neural responses are shown as relative fluorescence intensity changes over time (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>). The mean and the standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated across flies after averaging over ROIs for each fly. A two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test for paired or unpaired (independent) samples was used for statistical analysis between two groups. For comparisons between more than two groups in which one independent variable was manipulated (here: PTX concentrations), one-way ANOVA followed by two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple comparisons was used. For multiple comparisons between groups in which two independent variables were manipulated (here: PTX concentration and genotype), an unbalanced two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference Procedure for multiple comparisons was used.

Plateau responses were calculated as the difference between the mean response 500 ms before the onset of the stimulus and the mean of the last 500 ms of the stimulus epoch. Integrated responses were calculated as the sum of all values during the 5 s of the ON stimulus epoch. For Mi1 and Tm3, only ROI responses that were positively correlated with the stimulus (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient &gt;0) were used for subsequent analysis (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>). To discard noisy ROIs, a standard deviation threshold of 0.2 was set during the 2 s before the onset of visual stimulation. For pharmacological experiments, an absolute threshold of 0.5 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was used to identify well-responding ROIs. The identical ROIs were analyzed after toxin application (paired data). When control and experimental conditions were not paired, no threshold was applied. When experimental (and respective controls) conditions in preliminary data showed a full loss of response, no absolute threshold was applied and the recordings were obtained blinded to the experimenter. For T4/T5 single ROI responses, no correlation filter was applied since both response polarities were expected. For iGluSnFR recordings, only the response threshold was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Moving ON and OFF edges</title><p>To calculate ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, the mean of the last second of the intermediate gray epoch was used as F<sub>0</sub>.

Response amplitudes were calculated as the difference between the mean response 500 ms before the onset of the stimulus and the maximum during the stimulus epoch. The direction selectivity index was calculated as PD-ND/PD, where PD is the maximum response among all responses to the different directions of motion and ND is the response to the null direction of motion defined as 180° from the preferred direction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophysiological recordings of heterologously expressed GluClα constructs</title><p>For electrophysiological recordings, GluClα constructs (isoform O, NP_001287409) were heterologously expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: M Eugenia Chiappe (Reviewer #1); Kit Longden (Reviewer #2); Karin Nordström (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and, as the Reviewing Editor, I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Basically, the three reviewers were very positive about the paper and thought that it should be published. However, there are two important points that you should address before final acceptance of the manuscript:</p><p>– One is the writing of the paper. The reviewers made many suggestions as to how to improve it to make it clearer for its audience. It is complex material and you should make every effort to help the readers.

Heretofore, these mechanisms have been poorly understood. Using a clever combination of pharmacology, genetics and physiological tools, this study reveals that: 1) inhibitory signals triggered by glutamate underlie signal transformation, 2) both Gabaergic and Glutamatergic synapses contribute to signal transformation, and 3) although there is a direct inhibitory glutamatergic synapse between presynaptic lamina neurons and the medulla cells under study, activity through this synapse is not critical for ON selectivity. Rather, signal transformation depends on a cascade of multiple synapses that recruit gabaergic- and glutamatergic-based inhibitory activity.</p><p>Overall, the authors use a plethora of tools to address specific questions, which gives strength to the observations. However, in some cases, the description of the complex results is not very clear, is incomplete, or poorly discussed. This is important because the observations described in this study strongly suggest that early visual processing is organized in a distributed, multi-synaptic manner, expanding on the original idea of a monosynaptic functional organization. However, the interpretation of the complex results is not trivial, and in some cases, the lack of clarity in the text jeopardises the recognition of the value of the findings.</p><p>I think this study is valuable not only for the fly vision community, but also for the broader sensory neuroscience community. The combination of pharmacology with genetic-based channel perturbations in a cell-type specific manner was key to demonstrate the distributed functional organization. Since the separation of signal processing in &quot;ON&quot; vs &quot;OFF&quot; pathways are found in many sensory systems across species, the implication of these results go beyond the fly vision community, and reaches the sensory neuroscience community at large. For these reasons, I would support publication of this work. However, as mentioned above, I found the manuscript a bit difficult to read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General assessment and major comments</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the molecular mechanisms by which information is transmitted from the contrast encoding laminar monopolar cell L1 to medulla cells Mi1 and Tm3, two of the principal inputs to the direction-selective and ON motion-sensitive T4 cell. Their general strategy initially is to block channels using PTX and rescue function by expressing PTX resistant alleles. They find that low concentrations (5 μM) of PTX block both GABA_A and GluCla receptors (Figure 6). When PTX resistant Rdl alleles are expressed in Mi1 or Tm3, then the steady state response of these cells to ON contrast step changes is rescued (Figure 4). The authors then generate a PTX resistant GluCla allele, for which they are to be commended, and this rescues transient responses to ON contrast step changes (Figure 6). The Tm3 and Mi1 cells are situated in a network of cells including L5 and the GABAergic cells CT1 and C2, so it is entirely credible that L1 signals are polysynaptically communicated to Mi1 and Tm3 cells. In addition, they investigate the activity of T4 and T5 cells under PTX, and in flies with GluCla knocked out.</p><p>Overall, I found the manuscript ended well with a great Discussion. The molecular work was impressive and clearly a lot of work. The organization of the results included a lot of implicit reasoning and odd ways of revealing important data that made it difficult to follow. Overall, I was not convinced that establishing a polsynaptic connection between L1 and Tm3 or Mi1 was surprising, and that the paper did not capitalize on this work to understand what the different mechanisms contributed to the ON rectification computation. I think that with a different emphasis, I might have been very impressed with the data. The generation of the PTX-insensitive GluCla receptor allele has the potential to be very useful tool for other circuit dissections. Mainly I have many minor comments, which reflect my enthusiasm for the work.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>The first sentence of the second paragraph in subsection “ON responses are lost by PTX concentrations affecting GABAARs and GluCls” allow the reader to think that 100 μm PTX would block GABA_AR and GluCla and 5 μm PTX would block GABA_ARs alone. This allows one to think that GABA_Ars are required for normal glutamate signaling under 5 μm PTX in Figure 2. The data in Figure 6 indicates that GluCla's are blocked at 5 μm and the results should declare this right at the start. The inference from Figure 2 as given in the fourth paragraph is “that GABAA receptors might play an additional role” is therefore unfounded by this data, whether it turns out to be true or not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>&quot;ON selectivity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system…&quot; by Molina-Obando et al., is an excellent paper. In the paper, the authors show that ON-selectivity, via the L1 -&gt; Mi1/Tm3 pathway is mediated by both glutamatergic and gaba-ergic ionotropic receptors. In addition, they show that the Mi1/Tm3 input must come from more than L1, i.e. that it is multi-synaptic. The authors use an impressive array of techniques for showing this, including pharmacology, genetics, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, etc, etc. I recommend the paper to be published, as it will be interesting to anyone working on ON selectivity, not only in the fly visual system, but also in vertebrates and other senses.</p><p>Subsection “The sign inversion in the ON pathway is a multisynaptic computation that depends on GluClα” second paragraph, you refer to Figure S3G, but I think you mean S4G.

Your summary diagrams all imply that GABA must come from something else.</p><p>You switch between PTX concentrations without being too clear as to why – maybe just refer to Figure 2 as justification?

We also re-did the anti-GABA staining in a line that was specifically labeling L1 neurons, to demonstrate this more clearly, and again don’t see any GABA-staining in the L1 cell bodies, nor in the medulla neuropil containing the L1 terminals. L1 in fact does not express any major GABA synthesis enzymes, nor could GABA uptake from the extracellular milieu lead to GABA-release, because L1 also does not express the plasma-membrane GABA transporter Gat. VGaT alone (which is highly expressed in all neurons, as seen in Davis et al.) cannot account for GABA release, as this just accounts for vesicular uptake of GABA.

For instance, 100 μm PTX was previously used to block GluCls, whereas GABAARs are already blocked by lower concentrations of PTX (e.g. Liu and Wilson use 100 μm PTX to block GluCla and say “The concentration of picrotoxin we needed to achieve this level of blockade was higher than that needed to block GABA-gated chloride conductances in the same neurons”. Wilson and Laurent, 2005, state that “just 1 μm picrotoxin is sufficient to block 94.4% of the GABA-gated hyperpolarization in LNs”. In contrast, 21.1 μm PTX was needed to reduce the peak current amplitude of glutamate response of M. domestica GluCls to half (IC50), (Hirate et al., 2008). Furthermore, in this manuscript, it can be seen that 10 μm has a weaker effect on <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> GluCla than 100 μm PTX (oocyte data, Figure 5). Also, Fisher et al., 2015, used 5 μm PTX to block direction-selective responses in the visual system, and this effect could be rescued by the RdlMDRR insensitive allele, demonstrating specificity through the Rdl GABAAR in this context. Thus, the data shown in Figure 2 were precisely the data that suggested to us that “that GABAA receptors might play an additional role”, and lead us to further pursue the idea that GABAergic inhibition is also involved in mediating ON responses, which we confirmed by the use of the GABA insensitive RdlMDRR allele in Figure 4.</p><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means by “are required for normal glutamate signaling”. If the reviewer indeed meant glutamate signaling, we had shown that iGluSnFR signals are largely unaffected by 25 μm PTX (previous Figure S2). We now repeated these experiments at 5 μm and 100 μm PTX to better match other data in the paper and included them in a new Figure 2—figure supplement 2. We also added these data for Tm3 in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. If the reviewer instead meant “are required for normal ON responses”, then we would argue that this was exactly the objective that we were investigating here, and that these data thus allowed one to think that “GABAAR might play a role”.</p><p>We now expanded on the description of the previous literature on the different PTX concentrations used to make this clearer. “in vivostudies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> had previously used concentrations of 1-5 μM PTX to effectively block GABA-gated hyperpolarization in the olfactory system, and GABAergic inhibition in <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system neurons (Wilson and Laurent, 2005, Fisher et al., 2015). In contrast, 100 μM PTX was used to block GluCls in the olfactory system (Liu and Wilson, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>&quot;ON selectivity in the Drosophila visual system…&quot; by Molina-Obando et al., is an excellent paper.

We also added sentences at several places in the Results section, explicitly introducing why we did an experiment at a given PTX concentration.</p><p>We cannot really derive IC50, because PTX is unspecific, and we would measure confounding effects on GABAAR and GluCls. (Actually, when you squint at the Tm3 data in Figure 2, you might see that the PTX effect doesn’t appear to increase continuously, but rather step wise).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C and similar (the same format used throughout), you have 3 graphs with different y-axes, but it is not entirely clear how these 3 parameters were extracted.

This test is done in a heterozygous background (xxx <bold>/ +</bold>). Therefore, this is testing for both the efficiency of FlpStop and the efficiency of inversion. It is almost as good as it could be (50% mRNA levels).</p><p>In Figure 7G, the genome of the fly carries the FlpStop exon in the disrupting orientation. Here, we tested the heterozygous condition (FlpStop.D/+), which should be similar to elav&gt;&gt;Flp. A small discrepancy between panels A and G can potentially be accounted for by cells expressing GluCl, but not expressing elav&gt;&gt;Flp, or by non-complete inversion. Here, we also tested the full, homozygous mutant, by having the GluCla-FlpStop allele in trans to a deficiency. Strikingly, there is almost no mRNA in this condition.</p><p>We added a sentence to explain the latter case better: “To test this, we used a FlpStop allele inserted in the disrupting orientation. In this background, expression should be fully disrupted in all cells normally expressing GluClα.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7D, &quot;normalized to control&quot;, which is?</p></disp-quote><p>The controls were wild type flies.
