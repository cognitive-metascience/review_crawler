pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26362.001</object-id><p>The non-canonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway plays important roles in embryonic development, tissue formation and diseases. However, it is unclear how the Wnt ligand-stimulated, G protein-coupled receptor Frizzled activates phospholipases for calcium release. Here, we report that the zebrafish/human phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sec14l3/SEC14L2 act as GTPase proteins to transduce Wnt signals from Frizzled to phospholipase C (PLC). Depletion of <italic>sec14l3</italic> attenuates Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsive activity and causes convergent and extension (CE) defects in zebrafish embryos. Biochemical analyses in mammalian cells indicate that Sec14l3-GDP forms complex with Frizzled and Dishevelled; Wnt ligand binding of Frizzled induces translocation of Sec14l3 to the plasma membrane; and then Sec14l3-GTP binds to and activates phospholipase Cδ4a (Plcδ4a); subsequently, Plcδ4a initiates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) signaling, ultimately stimulating calcium release. Furthermore, Plcδ4a can act as a GTPase-activating protein to accelerate the hydrolysis of Sec14l3-bound GTP to GDP. Our data provide a new insight into GTPase protein-coupled Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling transduction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26362.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26362.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Sec14l3/SEC14L2</kwd><kwd>Wnt/Ca2+</kwd><kwd>GTPase protein</kwd><kwd>cell movements</kwd><kwd>embryos</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31522035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Shunji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31371460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Shunji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB945100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Shunji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011CB943800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Anming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sec14l3/SEC14L2 respond to upstream Wnt/Frizzled/Dvl stimulation to recruit and activate phospholipase Cδ4a (Plcδ4a) to further initiate calcium release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnt ligands, a large family of secreted lipoglycoproteins, control a large number of developmental events in animals, including cell fate, migration and polarity, embryonic patterning, organogenesis and stem cell renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>). Mammals express 19 Wnt members that bind to a corresponding receptor among 10 Frizzled (Fz) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niehrs, 2012</xref>). These receptors have a seven transmembrane span motif characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors, and, following binding of a Wnt ligand, activate different downstream pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semenov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). In the canonical Wnt pathway, Wnt signaling stabilizes cytoplasmic β-catenin and thereby promotes its nucleus translocation and accumulation to activate downstream target genes transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). Wnts also signal through at least two β-catenin-independent (non-canonical) branches, the Wnt/Planer Cell Polarity (PCP) and Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathways, during vertebrate development. They are both devoted to modulate cytoskeleton organization to coordinate or polarize cell convergent and extension movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kühl et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>). In the Wnt/PCP pathway, the monomeric small GTPases such as RhoA and Rac1 are required for transducing Wnt-Fz signaling to c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) to direct cell polarity and cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huelsken and Birchmeier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wodarz and Nusse, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway emerged with the observations that overexpression of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt5A and rat Fz2 in zebrafish embryos stimulated intracellular calcium flux and calcium-activated intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohn and Moon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slusarski et al., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1997b</xref>). It is demonstrated that pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein subunits, e.g., Gαo and Gαt, are required for transducing the specific Wnt-Fz-Dishevelled complex signals downstream to activate phospholipase C (PLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halleskog et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halleskog and Schulte, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). The activated PLC cleaves PIP<sub>2</sub>, a membrane-bound inositol lipid, into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP<sub>3</sub>). DAG stimulates protein kinase C (PKC) to induce ERK phosphorylation, while InsP<sub>3</sub> binds to its corresponding receptor on the ER membrane, opening calcium channels for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and increasing cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadamur and Ross, 2013</xref>). Besides regulating cytoskeleton organization, Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> also can influence CE movements through modulating calcium-dependent cell adhesion or dynamics of calcium storage and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kühl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slusarski and Pelegri, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tada and Heisenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wallingford et al., 2002</xref>). However, until now the interplay between Fz and heterotrimeric G/GTPase proteins in the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway is very controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it remains mysterious and debated about how to orchestrate the upstream Wnt/Fz stimulation with downstream PLC/Ca<sup>2+</sup> components.</p><p>In recent years, a number of Sec14-like proteins have been identified and characterized. It has been demonstrated that dysfunction of Sec14-like proteins would cause various human diseases, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ataxia, and retinal degeneration syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockcroft, 2012</xref>). Sec14-like proteins belong to atypical class III phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen-Baume et al., 2002</xref>) and consist of the versatile Sec14 domain associated with a GTPase motif of uncertain biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Habermehl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novoselov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merkulova et al., 1999</xref>). PITPs can transfer phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) between membranes, exchanging PI for PC and vice versa, in order to maintain balanced membrane lipid levels upon consumption of phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wiedemann and Cockcroft, 1998</xref>). Although it has been established that PITPs integrate the lipid metabolome with phosphoinositide signaling cascades intracellularly, only very few studies indicate that PITPs can respond to extracellular molecular cues to initiate intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauffmann-Zeh et al., 1995</xref>). So far, there is no evidence about the biological importance of the GTPase motif in the Sec14-like proteins, as well as the crosstalk between PITP family proteins and Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of the zebrafish Sec14l3 in embryonic development and the molecular mechanism of its action.

Compared to standard MO (std-MO)-injected embryos, embryos injected with sec14l3-MO1 displayed slower epiboly in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To substantiate the knockdown effect, we generated four <italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant lines by targeting the sequence around the translation start codon using transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The first line we obtained was <italic>sec14l3<sup>tsu-td10</sup></italic>, which carried a 10 bp deletion (−3 to +7). Some zygotic mutants (Z<italic>sec14l3</italic>) of this line survived to adulthood, allowing production of maternal (M<italic>sec14l3</italic>) and maternal-zygotic mutants (MZ<italic>sec14l3</italic>). In two-cell stage M<italic>sec14l3</italic> or MZ<italic>sec14l3</italic> embryos, <italic>sec14l3</italic> transcripts were almost eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which was likely due to unstable property of mutant mRNAs. Both M<italic>sec14l3</italic> and MZ<italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant embryos showed a slower epibolic process, which mimicked <italic>sec14l3</italic> morphants, whereas Z<italic>sec14l3</italic> embryos appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, the contribution of <italic>sec14l3</italic> to gastrulation cell movements is a strictly maternal-effect. Interestingly, this maternal effect lasted through larval stages as evidenced by a reduced body length in M<italic>sec14l3</italic> mutants compared with control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It appeared that cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in M<italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant embryos were unaffected, then we focused on the event of cell movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At the bud stage (about 10 hpf), M<italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant embryos had a broader and shorter embryonic axis, which was marked by the midline marker <italic>ntl</italic> and the neural plate border marker <italic>dlx3b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicative of impaired CE movements. Moreover, the defective CE movements of M<italic>sec14l3</italic> embryos were not caused by cell adhesion defects between envelop cell layer (EVL) and deep cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and could be rescued by <italic>sec14l3</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Maternal mutants of other <italic>sec14l3</italic> lines (<italic>sec14l3<sup>tsu-td4</sup></italic>, <italic>sec14l3<sup>tsu-td8</sup></italic> and <italic>sec14l3<sup>tsu-td9</sup></italic>), which were obtained later on, also exhibited similar phenotypes. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the maternal, but not the zygotic, contribution of <italic>sec14l3</italic> is critical for normal epiboly and CE movements during gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sec14l3 is required for Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling transduction</title><p>Since both Wnt/PCP and Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate cell movements during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niehrs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Webb and Miller, 2003</xref>), we then examined which pathway was affected in <italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant embryos. Results showed that Wnt/PCP signaling readout, the phosphorylated Jnk, p-Jnk(Thr183/Tyr185), was almost unaffected in M<italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant embryos, compared to wild-type embryos both at the same developmental stage and time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Human <italic>SEC14L2</italic>, rather than <italic>SEC14L3</italic>, is expressed in HEK293T and Wnt5-responsive PC3 cells, allowing easier examination of the effect of SEC14-like proteins on related signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ye et al., 2004</xref>).

Therefore, we speculate that Sec14l3/SEC14L2 may not be crucial for the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway.</p><p>Next, we used the calcium indicator protein GCaMP6 to visualize calcium transients by confocal microscopy in zebrafish embryos, according to the method reported by Slusarski et al.

We found that the frequency of calcium release was attenuated obviously in Msec14l3 mutant embryos either at the basal level or upon Wnt5b stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We therefore conclude that maternal Sec14l3 plays a role in Wnt ligand-dependent calcium release during embryogenesis. Similarly, Wnt5a-induced calcium signal in PC3 cells was also decreased when <italic>SEC14L2</italic> was knocked down by shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Thus, Sec14l3/SEC14L2 take part in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling transduction by promoting intracellular calcium release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sec14l3 forms complexes with Fz, Dvl and PLC</title><p>Fz, Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins and PLC are all implicated in Wnt-induced calcium release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kühl et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komiya and Habas, 2008</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We wondered whether Sec14l3 could associate with these proteins and performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) in mammalian cells.

Co-IP results revealed that Sec14l3 physically interacted with human DVL1, DVL2 or DVL3 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Used as a representative, Myc-tagged mDvl2 was determined to directly interact with GST-Sec14l3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). And in MCF7 cells, endogenous SEC14L2 interacted with DVL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, this interaction was further validated in zebrafish embryos by overexpressing xDvl2-Myc and Flag-Sec14l3 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Deletion analysis showed that the Sec14l3’s Sec14 domain, but neither the CARL-TRIO nor GOLD domain, was essential for interaction with mDvl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B and E</xref>). On the other hand, the DEP form of xDvl2, consisting of the DEP domain and the C-terminal region of xDvl2, was sufficient for the interaction with Sec14l3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested the physical interactions between zebrafish Sec14l3 and Plcδ family members, including Plcδ1a, Plcδ3b and Plcδ4a that are essential for PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis into DAG and InsP<sub>3</sub>.

Additionally, we also found their interaction in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Domain mapping analysis revealed that the CARL-TRIO domain and the GOLD domain of Sec14l3, unlike the Sec14 domain, were crucial for interaction with the N2 region of Plcδ4a, including the PH and the EF hand domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B,H and I</xref>). Therefore, Sec14l3 utilizes different domains to interact with xDvl2 and Plcδ4a.</p><p>To test whether Sec14l3, Fz and Dvl form a complex, we performed two-step Co-IP experiment. Results showed that hFz5-CT-Myc was present in the GST-Sec14l3-Dvl2-Flag complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting the presence of the hFz5/Dvl2/Sec14l3 ternary complexes. Furthermore, we found that mDvl2 was present in the Plcδ4a complexes, as well as in the Plcδ3b complexes, but absent in the Plcδ1a complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), which were similar to Sec14l3-Plcδ selective interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). DVL2 was also proved to interact with endogenous PLCδ4a in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, we found that different Wnt ligands stimulation could result in distinct calcium responses. Among of them, Wnt5a had a strong capacity to promote calcium release in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thrasivoulou et al., 2013</xref>]). Upon Wnt5a stimulation, mDvl2-Plcδ4a complex formation could be enhanced in PC3 cells, and knockdown of <italic>SEC14L2</italic> led to a drastic reduction of mDvl2-Plcδ4a complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating the presence of the mDvl2/Sec14l3/Plcδ4a ternary complexes.</p><p>Interestingly, Sec14l3-GFP could be co-immunoprecipitated with Sec14l3-Flag through its CARL-TRIO domain and GOLD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), suggesting oligomerization of Sec14l3.

PLC has been proposed to serve as a membrane attachment enzyme, which hydrolyzes many substrates such as PIP<sub>2</sub> without dissociating from the lipid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that Sec14l3 might be necessary for recruitment of Plcδ4a to the PM for executing function. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the subcellular localization of Plcδ4a upon overexpression of Sec14l3. Immunostaining results in MCF7 cells showed that Sec14l3 actually promoted the PM localization of Plcδ4a after co-transfection with hFz5 and mDvl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To determine which Sec14l3 domain(s) is/are critical for PLC recruitment, PM isolation assay was performed. In contrast to the cytoplasmic enrichment of Plcδ4a in rest cells, there was a substantial enrichment of Plcδ4a in the PM upon transfection with hFz5 or Rfz2 or both, which was enhanced by co-transfection with ΔGα or ΔG forms of Sec14l3, but not with ΔNG form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Rfz2-induced enrichment of Plcδ4a at the PM was inhibited in <italic>SEC14L2</italic> knockdown cells, which could be restored by overexpressing the full-length, ΔGα or ΔG form, but not ΔNG form, of Sec14l3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that both the TRIO-CARL domain and GOLD domain are required for recruiting Plcδ4a to the PM upon Wnt receptors stimulation. Particularly, different from the receptors stimulation, ΔG form is sufficient to block Wnt5a-induced Plcδ4a PM recruitment in PC3 cells, indicating a more important function of the C-terminal GOLD domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), which is consistent with the functional analysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Taken together, although Wnt5a ligand and its Fz receptors trigger Dvl2/Sec14l3-dependent Plcδ4a PM recruitment in a slightly different way, possibly due to the diverse functions of the C-terminal GOLD2 domain upon ligand stimulation, Sec14l3 is important for the PM translocation of Plcδ4a, which is mainly mediated by the C-terminal GOLD domain rather than the Gα subunit domain.</p><p>The next question is whether Sec14-like protein-mediated PM translocation promotes Plcδ4a binding to PIP<sub>2</sub>. To address this issue, we performed liposome binding assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, interaction between purified Plcδ4a protein and liposome-bound PIP<sub>2</sub> was detected following incubation with HEK293T control cell lysate; however, this interaction was significantly weakened when the <italic>SEC14L2</italic> knockdown cell lysate was used.

However, it is unresolved as to how Fz/Dvl couples with G/GTPase proteins in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sheldahl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aznar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>). In this study, we show that Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins can function as GTPase proteins in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. As modeled for Sec14l3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), Sec14l3-GDP can form complexes with Fz and Dvl; in respond to non-canonical Wnt stimulation, activated Sec14l3-GTP associates with and activates PLC at the PM, and promotes PLC-mediated PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis to generate second messengers that propagate the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling cascade. In zebrafish, depletion of maternal <italic>sec14l3</italic> impairs Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling transduction and consequently causes defective gastrulation cell movements. Our findings not only reveal a critical function for Sec14l3 in regulating Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, but provide a comprehensive view of mechanisms about GTPase proteins involvement during the signaling transduction, breaking the argument whether the 7-TM Fz can directly bind to and activate G proteins. We propose it is the GTPase proteins, Sec14l3/SEC14L2, other than the classical heterotrimeric G proteins, that can simultaneously bind to upstream Fz/Dvl and activate downstream PLC for signal propagation. Therefore, the function of Sec14-like proteins is not limited to regulate the exchange of membrane lipids.</p><p>The direct Fz-Sec14l3 interaction can also be interpreted as Sec14l3-mediated regulation at the receptor level, such as Fz internalization or recycling in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (data not shown), which needs to be further investigated. Although our clues so far can’t discriminate the transducer as a trimer or multimer, the organizer function of Sec14l3 in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> is recognizable. What’s more, it has been suggested that lipid transfer proteins may not simply function as diffusible vehicles mediating lipid transfer between membranes, but also devices of assigning PI lipids to various enzymatic reactions in a strictly regulated biological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mousley et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings disclose multifaceted functions of lipid transfer proteins such as Sec14l3 and fill an important gap in our understanding of how Wnt/Fz/Dvl transduce the signal to PLC for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p><p>Although Sec14l3 is initially identified as a member of PITP, its depletion does not cause PIP<sub>2</sub> or PIP<sub>3</sub> reduction at the PM both in zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells. Our studies demonstrate that the depletion of Sec14l3 leads to PIP<sub>2</sub> accumulation at the PM due to inefficient activation of PLC. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the involvement of Sec14l3 PI transfer activity in embryonic development because other PITP family members, such as Sestd1 and Sec14l1, are also highly expressed in zebrafish embryos (data not shown). Therefore, to investigate the intrinsic transfer activity of Sec14l3 during early embryogenesis, genetic analysis of double or triple mutants is necessary.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of our work is the discovery that the GTPase activity of Sec14l3 is critical for Plcδ4a activation. We find that Plcδ4a binds to Sec14l3-GTP with apparently higher affinity and functions as a Sec14l3-GAP protein. However, Sec14l3-GEF proteins remain unknown. Wnt receptor Fz is a kind of G protein-coupled receptors, which can act as GEF proteins for their cognate G proteins upon binding of a ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malbon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulte and Bryja, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dijksterhuis et al., 2014</xref>). We doubt that hFz5 or Rfz2 functions as the Sec14l3-GEF protein, because these Fz proteins show similar binding affinity towards GDP- or GTP-bound Sec14l3 and cannot accelerate the GTP uptake by Sec14l3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Considering that Fz receptors can activate Gαi proteins and enhance Wnt/PCP signaling via the Dvl-binding protein, Daple, a novel non-receptor GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aznar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishida-Takagishi et al., 2012</xref>), and Dvl2 does prefer to bind toward Sec14l3-GDP rather than Sec14l3-GTP in our hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>), we tend to believe that Dvl2 serves as a scaffolding protein to recruit an unknown Sec14l3-GEF, thereby enhancing Sec14l3-GTP formation. As for which is the particular GEF for Sec14l3 in Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling transduction, more studies are needed. Besides, with the aid of available configuration-specific Sec14l3-GTP antibody in the future, it will be of great interest to figure out the conformational switches <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In summary, this study sheds light on a unique feature of the Sec14l3 protein. Through its intrinsic GTPase activity, it is capable of tightly coupling phospholipase activation with the proximity of PLC to its substrate.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Hong Zhang (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

The authors show that Wnt5a stimulation induces the membrane recruitment of Sec14l3. The GDP-bound Sec14l3 has the potential to form a complex with Frizzled and Dishevelled, while Sec14l3-GTP preferentially binds and activates Plcδ4a to trigger calcium release through PIP2 signaling. The results suggest that Sec14l3 functions as a GTPase protein and is specifically required for Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, but not for Wnt/PCP signaling. Functional analyses in zebrafish indicate that maternal Sec14l3 is required for convergence and extension movements. Overall, these findings provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation and functional implication of the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway in cell movements during early development. They will be of great interest in the Wnt field. This manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after appropriate revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although Wnt5a stimulation or Frizzled/Dishevelled overexpression promotes Sec14l3 membrane recruitment, it is not clear whether this could switch the conformational change of Sec14l3, from the GDP-bound state to the GTP-bound state. Dishevelled binds preferentially GDP-bound Sec14l3, but there is no evidence showing that this interaction is necessary to convert Sec14l3 into an active state. Whether the formation of the Fz/Dvl/Sec14l3 complex is required to activate Sec14l3 needs to be addressed or discussed properly.</p><p>2) Sec14l3 utilizes distinct domains for physical interaction with Dvl and Plcδ4a, but which Sec14l3 domain interacts with the Fz C-terminal region is not clear. Except for the two conserved motifs (KTxxxW and S/TxV), the C-terminal region is very divergent between hFz5 and RFz2, and the RFz2 has a very short C-terminal region (26aa). It will be interesting to know how the Fz C-terminal region interacts with Sec14l3, or at least this aspect should be discussed.</p><p>3) Both knockdown and knockout of Sec14l3 affects convergence and extension movements, but Sec14l3 morphants and mutants also displays other early developmental defects, in particular, a very strong epiboly delay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). So, the possibility of an impaired cell adhesion between EVL and deep cells during epiboly cannot be excluded and needs to be discussed.</p><p>4) The interaction between Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Wnt/PCP pathways in convergence and extension needs to be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26362.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Although Wnt5a stimulation or Frizzled/Dishevelled overexpression promotes Sec14l3 membrane recruitment, it is not clear whether this could switch the conformational change of Sec14l3, from the GDP-bound state to the GTP-bound state.

One major obstacle is the lack of specific antibodies, which can recognize and distinguish Sec14l3-GDP from Sec14l3-GTP state. Considering that Dvl and Plcδ4a prefer to bind with GDP- and GTP- form of Sec14l3 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>), and GTPase activity of Sec14l3 is essential for activating Plcδ4a at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). We propose membrane-localized Sec14l3 somehow represents its active state, in GTP-bound form, while cytosol-localized Sec14l3 might be inactive, in GDP-bound state. As Wnt5a stimulation and Fz/Dvl overexpression can promote Sec14l3 membrane recruitment, it is likely that Fz/Dvl/Sec14l3 complex is required to activate Sec14l3. And actually, we have proved the existence of Fz/Dvl/Sec14l3 complex using sequential co-immunoprecipitation approach. In our experiments, HEK293T cell lysates transfected with Dvl2-Flag was incubated with GST-Sec14l3/GST and hFz5-CT-Myc proteins, and GST-Sec14l3/GST was immunoprecipitated (1st step co-IP). The co-IP components were then eluted with the reduced glutathione and immunoprecipitations were carried out for the second round using anti-Flag antibody (2nd step co-IP). Results showed that hFz5-CT-Myc was only found in the final elute of GST-Sec14l3 group, but not in the GST control group, indicating that Fz/Dvl/Sec14l3 are present in the same complex (New data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Certainly, it will be more convincing if we could compare conformations of Sec14l3 in the complex or alone, when their structures are available. The new data have been included in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Sec14l3 utilizes distinct domains for physical interaction with Dvl and Plcδ4a, but which Sec14l3 domain interacts with the Fz C-terminal region is not clear. Except for the two conserved motifs (KTxxxW and S/TxV), the C-terminal region is very divergent between hFz5 and RFz2, and the RFz2 has a very short C-terminal region (26aa). It will be interesting to know how the Fz C-terminal region interacts with Sec14l3, or at least this aspect should be discussed.</italic></p><p>We appreciate reviewers for this comment. To further explicate the interaction between Fz C-terminal region and Sec14l3, we mapped Sec14l3 domains after co-transfection of distinct Sec14l3 truncated forms with Rfz2-CT. It revealed that the N-terminal CARL-TRIO and C-terminal GOLD2 domains of Sec14l3 are required for this interaction (New data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This new data have been included in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Based on the fact that these two Fz C-terminals both interact with Sec14l3 and only these two conserved motifs (KTxxxW and S/TxV) along them, we’d like to speculate that these two conserved motifs may be also critical for the complex formation. To investigate how the Fz C-terminal region interacts with Sec14l3 in detail, more direct evidences could be acquired from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments, using synthetic peptides from Fz C-terminal region and purified Sec14l3 proteins. Furthermore, membrane phospholipids may also cooperate with Fz-Sec14l3 interaction to stabilize the complex at the plasma membrane, because Sec14l3 also can act as a lipid binding protein (data not shown). If proven true, the interaction between Fz and Sec14l3 will be quite similar with that of Fz and Dvl, which is also dependent on these two conserved motifs, as well as membrane acidic phospholipids (Simons et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2003, Umbhauer et al., 2000, Hering and Sheng, 2002).</p><p><italic>3) Both knockdown and knockout of Sec14l3 affects convergence and extension movements, but Sec14l3 morphants and mutants also displays other early developmental defects, in particular, a very strong epiboly delay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). So, the possibility of an impaired cell adhesion between EVL and deep cells during epiboly cannot be excluded and needs to be discussed.</italic></p><p>We appreciate reviewers for this comment. In order to examine the exact marginal positions of EVL and deep cells in <italic>sec14l3</italic> knockdown or knockout embryos, we performed immunostaining using phalloidin and DAPI. Our analyses indicated that, compared with control embryos, there is no significant difference in the distance between the marginal borders of the EVL and the deep cell layer in <italic>sec14l3</italic>morphant or M<italic>sec14l3</italic> mutant embryos (New data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, it seems that Sec14l3 has no obvious effect on cell adhesion between EVL and deep cells. We included this new data in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The interaction between Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Wnt/PCP pathways in convergence and extension needs to be discussed.</italic></p><p>We appreciate reviewers for this comment. Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Wnt/PCP signaling are classified into the non-canonical Wnt signaling, which is independent of β-catenin transduction. Although it is not yet clear to what extent the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PCP pathways overlap, several Wnts or Fz receptors/co-receptors can trigger both of them according to distinct contexts. Therefore, these two pathways are both devoted to modulate cytoskeleton organization to coordinate or polarize cell convergent and extension movements (Veeman et al., 2003, Yang and Mlodzik, 2015, De, 2011, Kohn and Moon, 2005). However, it seems that Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> functions through more possible ways, including regulating calcium-dependent cell adhesion, dynamics of calcium storage and release, or modulating both PCP and Wnt/β-catenin pathways (Kuhl et al., 2001, Slusarski and Pelegri, 2007, Tada and Heisenberg, 2012, Wallingford et al., 2002). In our case, knocking down <italic>sec14l3</italic> attenuates calcium release, but not phosphorylation level of <italic>Jnk</italic>, somehow indicating that Sec14l3 affects cell convergent extension movement mainly through regulating calcium waves. We introduced this part properly in our new version.</p></body></sub-article></article>
