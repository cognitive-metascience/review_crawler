Several studies have suggested that behavior during the immature larval stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development is influenced by pheromones, but none of these compounds or the pheromone-receptor neurons that sense them have been identified. Here we report a larval pheromone-signaling pathway. We found that larvae produce two novel long-chain fatty acids that are attractive to other larvae.

Two members of the <italic>pickpocket</italic> family of <italic>DEG/ENaC</italic> channel subunits (<italic>ppk23</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic>) are required to respond to these pheromones. This pheromone system is evolving quickly, since the larval exudates of <italic>D. simulans</italic>, the sister species of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, are not attractive to other larvae.

Larvae of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>—a species commonly studied in the laboratory—gather together when sharing a food source and then cooperate in a way that may increase how efficiently they feed. It has been proposed that pheromones coordinate this behavior, but no larval pheromones had been identified.</p><p>Mast et al. noticed that Drosophila larvae crawling on a surface tended to occupy areas where other larvae had crawled before. This suggested that larvae had left attractive chemicals on the surface. Mast et al. identified two such substances by analyzing the chemicals left on the surface and then by testing the response of larvae to each compound.</p><p>Ultimately, Mast et al. found that a single sensory neuron in the larva is responsible for detecting these attractive chemical signals. Furthermore, two genes called <italic>pickpocket23</italic> and <italic>pickpocket29</italic> control this response. These genes were previously known for their roles in detecting sex pheromones, and they are members of a diverse family of calcium channel subunits that are involved in detecting multiple ‘sensory modalities’ such as touch and taste. When either <italic>pickpocket23</italic> or <italic>pickpocket29</italic> are inactivated, larvae ignore the social cues left by their neighbors.</p><p>Mast et al. also looked for an evolutionary role for these pheromones. Larvae of a closely related fly species called <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> produce a subtly different blend of compounds to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and this blend is not attractive to any of the species tested. While <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> larvae were not attracted to the cues left by their own species, they were attracted to the pheromones produced by <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, indicating that they retain the sensory mechanisms to detect and respond to these pheromones. These results suggest that larvae experience a rapidly evolving, complex, pheromone-rich environment that may help them tailor their behavior to survive.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04205.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04205.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Drosophila sechellia</kwd><kwd>Drosophila simulans</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>pheromone receptor</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel pheromone/receptor neuron pair mediates attraction between <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, and evolved differences in pheromone signaling underlie changes in social behavior between drosophilid species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Different insect species use a diversity of pheromones to establish and organize their social encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlson and Lüscher, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shorey, 1973</xref>). For example, pheromones mediate courtship, aggression, alarm signaling, parental care, navigation, aggregation and many other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shorey, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">de Bruyne and Baker, 2008</xref>). While the use of chemical cues is widespread amongst insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Symonds and Elgar, 2008</xref>) and other taxa, including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulac and Torello, 2003</xref>), the majority of our understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms that mediate insect pheromone signaling has come from studies of a single species, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This is because many powerful genetic tools have been developed to study gene and neural circuit function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Most studies of pheromones in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have focused on pheromones related to sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahanukar and Ray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández and Kravitz, 2013</xref>). These studies have provided a rich mechanistic understanding of the receptor genes and sensory neurons that detect these cues, and of the circuit architectures that mediate these behaviors, linking the detection of specific molecules to appropriate behavioral outputs.</p><p>In contrast, pheromones that organize spatial behaviors like navigation or aggregation have been less intensively studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartelt et al., 1985</xref>), despite the fact that such pheromones are critical for the survival of many insects. For example, ants employ substrate-born pheromones to establish and maintain foraging trails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steck, 2012</xref>) and caterpillars use pheromones to organize mass migrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitzgerald, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2003</xref>). To date, it has not been possible to study such problems in <italic>Drosophila</italic> because no pheromones were known that exclusively mediate aggregation or trail following. Nonetheless, several previous studies have provided suggestive evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval behavior is influenced by social cues. First, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are robustly attracted to odors produced by other larvae in food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durisko and Dukas, 2013</xref>). Second, when in close proximity on a food source, larvae both aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durisko et al., 2014</xref>) and engage in a form of co-operative digging, which may effectively increase their rate of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, in natural conditions, where different species of drosophilids can be found sharing the same food resource, larvae preferentially pupariate with conspecific larvae and avoid pupariating with larvae of other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltramí et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these three phenomena, it has been proposed, may be mediated by chemical cues produced by larvae or by larval activity.</p><p>We have discovered an attractive pheromone-signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We discovered two novel pheromones—<italic>(Z)-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid and <italic>(Z)-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid—that larvae deposit on substrate and that act as larval attractants. We identified a larval chemosensory neuron that is responsive to these compounds and that is required for behavioral attraction to these pheromones. We found that, in addition to their previously described roles in sex-pheromone detection, two members of the <italic>pickpocket</italic> family of <italic>DEG/ENaC</italic> channel subunits, <italic>pickpocket23</italic> and <italic>pickpocket29,</italic> are required for detecting (<italic>Z)-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid and <italic>(Z)-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid. Finally, we have found evolved differences in the production of these pheromones in the genus <italic>Drosophila,</italic> which, along with a repellent cue, cause differences in larval social behavior between these species<italic>.</italic> Our work provides the first window into social signaling during the larval stage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and demonstrates that these mechanisms, and this social behavior, have evolved rapidly. Many insects employ fatty acid derived pheromones in the context of aggregation and navigation, and our work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> establishes a model system with which to further explore the sensory mechanisms and neural circuits that process this class of chemical cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Drosophila larvae deposit an attractive cue on substrate</title><p>In preliminary assays of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval behavior in dense populations, we noticed that larvae seemed to be attracted to regions of assay plates that had been occupied previously by other larvae.

Control larvae were attracted to low concentrations (50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup>) of (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid and (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid, but not to any other compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Larvae responded most strongly to pheromone concentrations of 50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and this effect decreased at higher concentrations. A similar phenomenon has been observed for pheromones in multiple other species where higher doses induce a less robust behavioral response, or even begin to elicit alarm or escape behaviors, compared with lower doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leal et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimizu et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, we assayed the larval response to an equimolar mixture ((25 fmol:25 fmol)/cm<sup>2</sup>) of the two compounds. Larvae were attracted to a blend of these compounds, but were less responsive to this mixture than to a presentation of each molecule alone, which suggests an interaction between the two pheromones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>). These results indicate that larvae deposit the two compounds (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid and (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid on substrate and that low concentrations of these compounds provide an attractive cue to other larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>R58F10</italic> neurons detect larval attractive pheromones</title><p>Many of the nine compounds identified in larval residue when tested alone at high concentrations (0.5 nmol/cm<sup>2</sup>) were at least mildly attractive to larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This concentration corresponds to the concentration of compounds in extract of larval residue generated by hundreds of individuals. Thus, in principle, many or all of these larval compounds might contribute to larval social behavior. To determine which, if any, of these compounds are detected by <italic>R58F10</italic> neurons, we tested the behavioral response of larvae to synthetic compounds with and without silenced <italic>R58F10</italic> neurons. Silencing <italic>R58F10</italic> neurons with tetanus toxin blocked larval attraction to (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid, (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid, and a mixture of the two pheromones, but had no significant effect on the response to the other compounds at 50 fmol/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,I</xref>).

Other groups have also found that expressing IMPTV can sometimes produce intermediate phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kain et al., 2013</xref>).

However, the genes and other genetic tools used to manipulate these sensory neurons are expressed broadly in multiple cell types and body regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2a">Weiss at al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starostina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2013</xref>), and some of these genes are required also for detecting aversive compounds other than pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2a">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ling et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the complicated pattern of central innervation from multiple cells types in the subesophagael zone and ventral nerve cord has made it difficult to identify the subset of these cells that are pheromone responsive, and to characterize the downstream circuits.</p><p>Our study directly links the detection of two novel contact-mediated pheromones—(<italic>Z</italic>)-5-tetradecenoic and (<italic>Z</italic>)-7-tetradecenoic acid—by the receptor neuron <italic>R58F10</italic> to larval attraction. Furthermore, because <italic>R58F10</italic> labels only a single pair of bilateral sensory neurons, our work provides the first clean entry point to determine how pheromones are processed in the subesophagael zone.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How and why has larval pheromone signaling evolved?</title><p>We found that compounds deposited by larvae of related species in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> subgroup differ in their attractiveness to other larvae. <italic>D. simulans</italic> has evolved in at least two ways. First, the reduced attractiveness of <italic>D. simulans</italic> is caused, at least in part, by a reduction in (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid production. Second, an unidentified repellent cue present in <italic>D. simulans</italic> residue blocks the attractive activity of the reduced levels of (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid, and may act through a (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid-dependent mechanism to block larval attraction to (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid. Interactions between pheromones that cause behaviorally antagonistic effects, such as we have observed, have been studied most intensively in the context of plume following during moth courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker, 2008</xref>). In many species, female moths release blends of volatile attractive pheromones to attract courting males. The major components of these blends are often shared in closely related sympatric species of moths, while these blends differ in minor components. These species-specific minor components can block the attraction of males to the blend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vickers and Baker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quero and Baker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lelito et al., 2008</xref>), a mechanism that likely reduces interspecific courtship. An alternative hypothesis that can explain the evolved difference in larval attraction that we observed is that larvae are exquisitely sensitive to the ratio of (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>5-tetradecenoic acid to (<italic>Z</italic>)<italic>-</italic>7-tetradecenoic acid. We believe that this explanation is unlikely, because, although the levels of both pheromones are reduced in <italic>D. simulans,</italic> the ratio of these two pheromones is not significantly different from the ratios observed in <italic>D. sechellia</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results illustrate how a relatively simple change in pheromone profiles can have a profound effect on the social behavior of a species.</p><p>It is not clear why <italic>D. simulans</italic> has evolved to be less attractive to other larvae. It is possible that <italic>D. simulans</italic> has evolved to avoid costs associated with generating aggregation cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wertheim et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2003</xref>). For example, aggregation could lead to an increase in intra-specific competition over food sources, which may outweigh the density-dependent advantage larvae experience while clustered. Alternatively, the costs associated with providing positional information by releasing pheromones, such as the increased risks of predation, parasitism, or even cannibalism by conspecific larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vijendravarma et al., 2013</xref>) might in some situations outweigh the benefits of aggregation. Finally, the geographic range of <italic>D. simulans</italic> is largely overlapping with other species in this subgroup, and larvae of different species can often be found exploiting the same resource. While <italic>D. simulans</italic> produces little (<italic>Z</italic>)-5-tetradecenoic acid or (<italic>Z</italic>)-7-tetradecenoic acid, it is still attracted to these molecules. When sharing habitat with heterospecific larvae, it is possible that <italic>D. simulans</italic> larvae could benefit from eavesdropping on aggregation signals produced by other species while avoiding the direct and indirect costs of producing these compounds themselves.</p><p>Organisms, such as nematodes, or life stages, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, that possess relatively simple behavioral repertoires may be thought to have relatively simple social lives. However, recent studies have revealed rich detail about their social environments. For example, nematodes produce a complex set of pheromone signals mediated by a diverse family of molecules called ascarisides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braendle, 2012</xref>). These molecules act to coordinate aspects of development and serve as both aggregation and dispersal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Srinivasan et al., 2012</xref>). Both the synthesis and behavioral responses to these pheromones are evolving rapidly, and may be adaptations related to ecological specialization of these nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braendle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choe et al., 2012</xref>). Our identification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval aggregation pheromones represents a similarly unexpected level of complexity in invertebrate behavior, and may be only the first example of multiple pheromones that mediate larval social experience in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and husbandry</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were maintained under standard laboratory conditions.

All video recordings were performed with SONY DCR-HC52 MiniDV Handycam Camcorders, backlit with a white lightboard. To measure the activity of larval residue, 100 mm × 15 mm polystyrene petri dishes (Fisher Scientific International, Inc., Hampton, New Hampshire) filled with 2% agarose were treated with a high density of larvae, nearly coating the entire surface for 30 min. The larvae were removed and discarded, and half of the larval-treated agarose was cut away and replaced with untreated 2% agarose. Single test larvae were deposited in the center of each prepared assay plate and their locations were recorded for 10 min. Larval positions were analyzed afterward by hand in 10 s intervals. To isolate and assay the activity larval extract, we treated pre-washed WHEATON Glass 20 ml Scintillation Vials with isolated larvae standardized by volume for 30 min. We removed the larvae and extracted the larval residue off the glass surface for 20 min with 2 ml (for behavioral assays) or 200 µl (for chemical analysis) solvent. To measure the activity of extracts, we coated half of an agarose petri dish with extract and half with solvent. We deposited a single larva in the center of each prepared assay plate and recorded their locations for 10 min. Larva positions were determined afterward by hand in 30 s intervals. To test the attraction of larvae to individual compounds, each synthetic compound was solubilized in acetone and deposited onto a Corning 245 mm Square BioAssay Dish filled with 2% agarose. We used a 16 square stainless steel stencil adhered to the agarose to print a checkerboard pattern of control and treated squares. The dimensions of each square was 25 mm × 25 mm.

The activity of pheromone-sensing neurons was performed on second instar larvae carrying two copies of the Janelia enhancer R58F10-GAL4 and two copies of 20XUAS-GCaMP6-S (the slow, sensitive variant). Larvae were isolated and washed as described above. Hydrophobic test compounds were mobilized in adult hemolymph saline (AHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2003</xref>) using detergent, CYMAL-7 (1.5 critical micelle count (CMC)) (Affymetrix; C327, Santa Clara, CA). Larvae were partially dissected in AHS and mounted on a custom-built, acrylic, 75 mm × 25 mm slide, with a 2 mm slot cut down the center for test compound delivery ending in a small reservoir. Larvae were positioned perpendicular to and facing the slot and loosely fixed into position with a 22 mm coverslip (Fisher Scientific; 12-542-B.) and the slide was flushed with AHS. GCaMP fluorescence was measured by scanning at 1 Hz on a Leica DM5500 Q Microscope using Leica Microsystems LAS AP software. Neurons were imaged for 30 s to establish baseline fluorescence, after which 200 µl AHS with 1.5 CMC CYMAL-7 (control) or AHS with 1.5 CMC CYMAL-7 and 1 nM test compound were gently injected into the central slot. Recordings continued for 150 s. Changes in fluorescence were calculated using MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox and Fiji. To calculate the appropriate concentrations of pheromone to test, we posited that the larva might detect molecules within 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in behavioral assays, and within 1 mm<sup>3</sup> around its terminal organ in calcium imaging experiments. We therefore estimate that 50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 nM amount to 3.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> molecules and 6.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> molecules, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Louis and A Gomez-Marin for advice with video analysis in MATLAB, T Oyama and J Truman for access to the image database of Janelia enhancer-GAL4 expression in larval brains prior to publication, and T Gonen and M Iadanza for advice on detergents.

This could be addressed by monitoring the response of all ppk23 neurons, or all sensory neurons in the head, to (Z) 5- and (Z) 7-tetradecenoic acid</italic>.</p><p>We are also curious about the other <italic>ppk23</italic>-expressing sensory neurons. First though, we would like to point out that we have not claimed that <italic>R58F10</italic> is the only sensory neuron responsive to these pheromones. Rather, in the Discussion we argue that because the single cell marked by <italic>R58F10</italic> is necessary for this behavior, this reagent provides a unique opportunity to dissect pheromone processing in the sub-esophageal zone of the brain. Nonetheless, we agree that testing other <italic>ppk23</italic> expressing neurons would be interesting. With our current calcium imaging setup, it is not possible to record from all chemosensory neurons, or from all <italic>ppk23</italic>-expressing neurons simultaneously. Therefore, we decided to focus on two sensory neurons most similar to <italic>R58F10</italic> that also innervate the dorsolateral terminal organ sensillum and that express <italic>ppk23</italic>. These neurons are marked by <italic>Gr33a-GAL4</italic>, they can be identified morphologically in our recording preparation, and their cell bodies are often adjacent in the dorsal organ ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Also, we demonstrated that these cells are not necessary for the described behavioral response to larval pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We cannot discriminate between these two cells, so we pooled the calcium imaging data from both.</p><p>Conservatively, we can conclude that at least one of these cells is responsive to these pheromones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). One or both of these cells may mediate other behaviors driven by (<italic>Z</italic>)-5-tetradecenoic acid and/or (<italic>Z</italic>)-7-tetradecenoic acid.</p><p>We also slightly amended the header at line 92 that read “A single receptor neuron is necessary to respond to the attractive pheromone.” Although technically correct, we were concerned that this statement might be misconstrued to mean that we are claiming that <italic>R58F10</italic> is the only sensory neuron necessary for this behavior. The header has been changed to “A single receptor neuron necessary to respond to the attractive pheromone”.</p><p><italic>2) Monitoring GCaMP responses to (Z) 5 and (Z) 7 in R58F10 cells in the ppk23 and ppk29 mutant would be useful to demonstrate that ppk23/29 is required for the cellular response to pheromones</italic>.</p><p>We agree that these experiments would strengthen our conclusion that ppk23 and ppk29 are required for R58F10, We agree that these experiments would strengthen our conclusion that <italic>ppk23</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic> are required for <italic>R58F10</italic> cells to detect these pheromones. We have therefore included the results of these experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4O and 4P</xref>. We find that <italic>R58F10</italic> cells mutant for either <italic>ppk23</italic> or <italic>ppk29</italic> do not respond to either compound.</p><p><italic>3) 1 nM concentrations are used in the GCaMP experiment in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>.

It would be helpful to perform a dose-response analysis with the GCaMP studies</italic>.</p><p>We tried to use similar amounts of pheromone in these two experiments, and we thank the reviewers for pointing out that we have not made this clear. The units we used to express the concentration of pheromone used in behavior and physiology experiments are different because in the behavior experiment the pheromone was spread across a small surface and in the GCaMP assay the pheromone was mobilized in solution. We estimate that the concentration of pheromone exposed to the larval dorsal organs is similar in the two experiments. If we posit that the larva detects molecules within 1 mm<sup>2</sup> around the dorsal organ in the behavior assay and within 1 mm<sup>3</sup> around the dorsal organ in the calcium imaging experiments, then the concentrations used—50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 nM—translate to 3.0x10<sup>8</sup> molecules and 6.0 x10<sup>8</sup> molecules, respectively. Again, we did not make this clear in the original manuscript, and we now mention this in the text: “We tested a range of pheromone concentrations estimated to encompass those encountered by larvae in the previously described behavioral assays” and include a fuller explanation in the Methods: “To calculate the appropriate concentrations of pheromone to tests, we posited that the larva might detect molecules within 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in behavioral assays, and 1 mm<sup>3</sup> around its terminal organ in calcium imaging experiments. With this estimate 50 fm/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 nM amount to 3.0x10<sup>8</sup> molecules, and 6.0 x10<sup>8</sup> molecules, respectively”. In addition, we agree that a dose-response analysis may be informative and we now show GCaMP results for three concentrations of pheromones spanning from 0.1 nM to 10 nM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) There is no</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4M</italic></xref><italic>, comparable to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4H</italic></xref><italic>, showing rescue of the ppk29 mutant</italic>.</p><p>We now include the results from this experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.
