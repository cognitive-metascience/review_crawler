Mapping out the neurons in the brain can reveal how different circuits contribute to an animal’s behavior. Yet, because the brains of mammals contain millions of neurons, these circuits are often difficult to untangle.</p><p>One way to tease apart circuits of neurons uses a technique called optogenetics, which involves manipulating the genes inside neurons such that the cells produce a light-sensitive protein and respond to blasts of light. The aim is to activate a specific neuron and then see which other neurons are activated shortly afterwards, revealing a connected circuit. However, exposure to light can be imprecise. Also, the neurons in the brain are so densely packed that the nerve endings from neighboring neurons often overlap without actually being connected. This makes it unclear if activated neurons are truly part of the same circuit or simply bystanders reacting to the same nearby blast of light.</p><p>To overcome this limitation, Baker et al. developed a new optogenetic approach with two important features. First, the approach makes use of a light-sensitive protein called channelrhodopsin that had been modified to confine it to the cell body of each neuron and exclude it from the nerve endings. Second, pulses of laser light were specifically shaped to target only the cell body of an individual neuron. Baker et al. show that this new method can activate neurons inside slices of mouse brain without affecting the neighboring neurons. This allowed circuits of neurons to be mapped in fine detail.</p><p>This new optogenetic method is expected to shed light on the patterns of nerve signals that contribute to animal behavior. The approach may also be modified to use other light-sensitive proteins or investigate how neural circuits are altered in animal models of human disorders like autism and schizophrenia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14193.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14193.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Florida Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name><name><surname>Elyada</surname><given-names>Yishai M</given-names></name><name><surname>Parra-Martin</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name><name><surname>Bolton</surname><given-names>M McLean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining spatial restriction of channelrhodopsin to the neuronal cell body with two photon excitation and calcium imaging will enable production of high resolution maps of neural circuitry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits is the physiological basis for the interpretation of sensory input and production of behavioral responses. Understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among the distinct types of neurons that comprise neural circuits is critical for elucidating circuit function and ultimately requires methods that can map functional connectivity with single-cell resolution. Optical activation of single neurons using two-photon excitation of caged neurotransmitters or optogenetic probes such as channelrhodopsin (ChR2) provides a powerful approach for assessing the synaptic connections of single neurons. In particular, optogenetic mapping utilizing ChR2 and the rapidly expanding family of opsin variants have increased the flexibility and precision of mapping paradigms. Variations in the single-channel properties of the opsins can be exploited to generate rapid action potential trains or sustained depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mattis et al., 2012</xref>), and new red-shifted variants have facilitated excitation deeper in tissue and have enabled simultaneous optical control of two distinct neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, genetic restriction of opsin expression using transgenic mouse lines enhances the ability to activate and assess the connectivity of specific cell types.</p><p>Despite the great potential of optogenetics for mapping the synaptic connections of single neurons, there are multiple issues that have limited its effectiveness. First, two-photon activation of single neurons with ChR2 is complicated by its kinetics and low single-channel conductance. A diffraction-limited spot does not activate sufficient channels simultaneously to reliably bring neurons expressing ChR2 to action potential threshold. Several solutions have been implemented to address this. Rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot across an opsin-expressing cell allows sufficient temporal integration to generate action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Packer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prakash et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rickgauer and Tank, 2009</xref>). Alternatively, scanless two-photon excitation by temporal focusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Oron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>) increases the number of simultaneously excited opsin molecules by expanding the beam in the imaging plane without sacrificing the optical sectioning of multiphoton microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Losonczy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>). The implementation of diffractive optical elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nikolenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Packer and Yuste, 2011</xref>) or spatial light modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dal Maschio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nikolenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Packer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2008</xref>) has also allowed for more complicated excitation profiles that encompass multiple spots around a cell, ensembles of neurons, or particular branches of dendritic trees.</p><p>While these approaches have made it possible to provide sufficient two-photon illumination to reliably drive action potentials, the ability to use optogenetic stimulation to selectively target single neurons remains challenging because the opsins are expressed throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields, generating a potential confounding source of light-induced electrical responses. For example, it can be difficult to know whether a recorded electrophysiological event is due to stimulation of a presynaptic cell or 'direct' stimulation of a portion of the recorded cell’s dendritic arbor. Although these possibilities can be distinguished by their kinetics, large amplitude direct responses may obscure simultaneous smaller synaptic events. This essentially leaves an indeterminate region of any circuit 'map' coinciding with the dendritic arbors of the recorded neuron, which can extend for 200 µm or more around the soma. In addition, the optogenetic approach could be compromised by unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons, which are known to respond to temporal focusing of two-photon excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Losonczy et al., 2010</xref>). Exclusion of opsins from axonal compartments has previously been achieved by fusing the opsin with targeting domains that bind to myosin Va motors necessary for transporting proteins into dendrites; one such motif from melanophilin is sufficient to exclude ChR2 from axons and enhance the resolution of neural circuit maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting ChR2 distribution, however, remains throughout the dendritic tree and thus does not solve the problem of undesired direct activation of a neuron’s processes while trying to stimulate other neurons in close proximity.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we combined temporal focusing with spatial confinement of ChR2 expression to the neuronal cell body and proximal dendrites. Our alternative targeting approach took advantage of the Kv2.1 potassium channel, which has a particularly unique localization to clusters at the neuronal soma and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trimmer, 1991</xref>) achieved through a 66-amino acid domain in its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lim et al., 2000</xref>) that drives its association with myosin IIb and specific post-Golgi transport vesicles destined for the somatic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, this targeting signal is sufficient to alter ChR2 trafficking in retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). We have employed this approach to target ChR2 to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons in somatosensory cortex and added a nuclear fluorescent tag to identify ChR2-expressing neurons for targeting a two-photon temporal focused mapping beam. We combined this soma-targeted ChR2 with verification of successful action potential generation with a genetically encoded calcium indicator in our mapping protocol. Our approach allows robust and precise activation of neurons in brain slices for the construction of functional synaptic connectivity maps with single-cell resolution without loss of information about local connections in the region of the dendritic arbor of the recorded neuron or inadvertent activation of axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We stimulated neurons expressing soma-targeted ChR2 in acute slices of mouse cortex using scanless temporal focusing (TF), which has been used successfully for optogenetic stimulation at high axial resolution in scattering tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Losonczy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>). TF uses a diffraction grating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to separate the spectral components of a pulsed laser beam, resulting in a temporally broadened pulse that is inefficient at excitation except at the focal plane, where the components are recombined. This yields a volume of excitation in which the diameter in the x-y plane and the thickness in the axial plane are controlled independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oron et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2005</xref>). We designed our excitation volume to approach the dimensions of a typical neuronal soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To restrict expression of ChR2 to the soma and proximal dendrites, we generated ChR2 fusion proteins by attaching a 65 amino acid motif from the Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel to the carboxy terminus of ChR2-EYFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lim et al., 2000</xref>). Nontargeted ChR2-EYFP fluorescence was distributed throughout the processes of dissociated cortical neurons that had been filled with a fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, targeted ChR2-EYFP-Kv2.1 was located primarily in the soma and excluded from the axon and distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14193.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of soma-targeted channelrhodopsin (ChR2).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence of ChR2-EYFP (green) in live dissociated cortical neurons that had been patched and filled with Alexa 594 dye (magenta) as visualized by two-photon microscopy.

The stimulation power for these experiments was determined independently for each neuron to be the minimum that elicited a single action potential in 10 out of 10 trials when the TF spot was placed directly over the soma; this value was 0.92 ± 0.24 mW/µm<sup>2</sup> for targeted ChR2 and 1.65 ± 0.26 mW/µm<sup>2</sup> for the nontargeted version, owing to the increased sensitivity of the targeted construct (see below). Dendrites were followed throughout the depth of the tissue and areas were selected for stimulation such that the dendrite was planar throughout the extent of the 10 µm TF disc. The TF-stimulated current declined ~10-fold at 50 µm from the soma with the targeted construct, versus two fold for the non-targeted construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; N=10 untargeted cells from four animals and N=13 targeted cells from six animals). The reduced dendritic ChR2 in the targeted construct opens up the possibility of using light stimulation with patch recording to identify synaptic currents that originate from nearby neurons. To illustrate this point, we compared the spatial distribution of direct currents recorded in Layer II/III pyramidal neurons in acute slices of somatosensory cortex expressing non-targeted and targeted constructs while sequentially stimulating points at 20 µm intervals over a 300 × 300 um grid surrounding the soma. Stimulation of cells expressing non-targeted ChR2-evoked currents up to 200 µm away from the neuronal soma, often delineating a pattern indicative of the dendritic arbor of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, cells expressing the targeted construct exhibited significant currents only when stimulated within the 25–50 µm immediately adjacent to the cell body. The lack of direct light-activated currents throughout much of the neuron’s dendritic field makes it possible to visualize synaptic currents that would be evoked by ChR2 activation of nearby presynaptic neurons, even those that lie within the neuron’s dendritic field.</p><p>In brain sections from mice injected with viruses encoding ChR2 constructs, examination of regions near the edge of the extent of virus-driven expression revealed markedly denser labeling of neuronal processes around a single-neuron expressing nontargeted ChR2 versus the area around several neurons expressing the targeted version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We also saw processes reminiscent of axons at distances of several hundred microns away from the cell bodies of conventional ChR2-positive neurons. To functionally characterize the extent of axonal opsin expression, we again patched layer II/III pyramidal neurons in acute coronal brain slices of somatosensory cortex and recorded light-activated currents in voltage clamp while stimulating multiple positions along putative axonal processes, which were distinguished by their thin profile, absence of spines, and presence of occasional varicosities. Although the amount of detected current decreased rapidly for both constructs as TF stimulation was moved along the axon, noticeable currents could be detected at distances of 50 µm or greater from the soma of cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In contrast, cells expressing targeted ChR2 demonstrated an 80% reduction of current when stimulating just 20 µm down the axon and significantly less current than cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 throughout its examined length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the targeted ChR2 also exhibited increased peak current amplitude in response to TF activation, presumably by concentrating channel density at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; from 308.3 ± 43.5 pA in 12 nontargeted cells to 760.5 ± 146.0 pA in 12 targeted cells at 3.63 mW/µm<sup>2</sup>; p<italic>=</italic>0.0101 for main effect of targeting by two-way repeated measures ANOVA), leading to an over three-fold reduction of the power required to reach action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; from 2.75 ± 0.31 mW/µm<sup>2</sup> in 17 nontargeted cells to 0.88 ± 0.23 mW/µm<sup>2</sup> in 19 targeted cells; p=8.028 × 10<sup>–5</sup> by Mann-Whitney U Test). At the threshold stimulation power for each cell, the amount of evoked current was similar between targeted and untargeted constructs (261.06 ± 31.62 pA for untargeted ChR2 and 222.70 ± 27.21 pA for targeted ChR2 p=0.3677 by two sample t-test), consistent with the observation that the targeting modification had no effect on rheobase, other intrinsic physiological parameters, or action potential properties in response to current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The ability to trigger action potentials at lower incident power, coupled with the somatic restriction of the targeted construct, should provide enhanced spatial and temporal resolution for mapping neuronal circuits. We measured the spatial resolution of action potential generation by moving the TF spot to different lateral and axial locations relative to a patched neuron expressing targeted ChR2 and examining the proportion of 10 trials that resulted in an action potential when using the threshold stimulation intensity. The full-width at half maximum of these measurements was 11.1 µm laterally and 23.3 µm axially (N=10 cells from 7 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Similar measurements using nontargeted ChR2 demonstrated resolution of 19.6 µm laterally and 36.2 µm axially (N=13 cells from 5 animals; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>); both curve fits were significantly different from the targeted ChR2 versions (p&lt;0.05 by F-test). In terms of temporal precision, the mean latency from light onset to generation of a single action potential in the above experiments was 38.98 ± 17.33 ms; the average jitter (defined as the standard deviation of the latency across the ten trials for a given cell) was 6.8 ± 2.1 ms. Increasing stimulation power beyond threshold provoked additional action potentials and eventually shortened the latency to first spike to 9.3 ± 1.8 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with reported values for stimulating cortical neurons with sculpted light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>). Targeted ChR2-expressing cells exhibited shorter action potential latencies than nontargeted ChR2 cells at equivalent stimulation intensity, consistent with latency being power-dependent and the earlier observation that targeted ChR2 is more sensitive. Although we concentrated efforts on longer stimulation pulses to increase the number of spikes and facilitate calcium imaging (see below), we verified the performance of targeted ChR2 under a shorter stimulation regimen. Temporal focusing pulses of 32 ms were effective at generating action potentials in opsin-expressing cells, and targeted ChR2 exhibited greatly enhanced photocurrents and lower power thresholds under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, the ability to reduce latency to less than 10 ms with increased power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that even shorter stimulation pulses may still be effective. Therefore, the combination of temporal focusing and soma-targeted ChR2 expression yields a highly reliable and spatially precise means to stimulate action potentials with somatic illumination.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14193.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Enhanced sensitivity and resolution with soma-targeted ChR2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evoked currents in acute slices in response to 150 ms TF stimulation of increasing intensity; targeted ChR2 exhibited significantly greater current (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, p=0.0101 for main effect of targeting, p=0.0056 for targeting × power interaction, *p&lt;0.05 Holm-Bonferroni post hoc test).

We generated a bicistronic adeno-associated virus (AAV) construct encoding targeted ChR2-Kv2.1 followed by a P2A ribosomal skipping sequence and a histone 2B-mRuby2 fusion protein to fluorescently label neuronal nuclei to identify cells for TF stimulation. We patched a cell in layer II/III, and then stimulated surrounding cells that had been identified by nuclear mRuby2 fluorescence. Action potential firing in a light-stimulated neuron was verified by an increase in the fluorescence signal measured with the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) expressed from a separate AAV construct. For these experiments, we used an average stimulation power (2.29 ± 0.55 mW/µm<sup>2</sup>) that, when combined with a 150 ms stimulation pulse, frequently led to trains of 2–4 action potentials in the patched cells and facilitated detection of larger calcium transients. We used an imaging power and dwell time that did not lead to action potential generation in any cells recorded, instead causing an average inward current of 29.5 ± 9.5 pA (N = 7 cells from 5 animals)—well below the average rheobase. The ability to identify a ChR2-Kv2.1-expressing neuron for TF stimulation by the presence of a fluorescent nuclear label and verify that the neuron has in fact been stimulated successfully by detecting calcium transients with GCaMP is a key advantage for the execution and interpretation of mapping experiments.</p><p>Excitatory synaptic connections were identified by the presence of GCaMP fluorescence increase in only the TF stimulated neuron and a reproducible inward current with appropriate synaptic delay, kinetics and reversal potential in the patched cell (see Materials and methods). To separate spontaneous currents occurring during the stimulation epoch from bona fide synaptic events, we also required occurrence of synaptic responses on multiple stimulus repetitions and with a post-stimulus onset jitter of less than 14 ms. A lack of connection was defined as failure to reach these criteria following the presence of a GCaMP6s response to light stimulation in a potential presynaptic neuron.</p><p>In a representative experiment, we identified 43 nuclear-labeled cells in a single axial plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), of which 35 cells yielded calcium transients in response to TF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Three of these 35 cells elicited reproducible postsynaptic responses in the recorded neuron when photostimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), exhibiting multiple currents consistent with the production of trains of presynaptic action potentials. Every connection detected was associated with an unequivocal calcium transient in only the stimulated neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In repeated experiments (seven neurons from five animals), another example of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, the average rate of detecting a calcium response to TF stimulation of a cell expressing the ChR2-Kv-P2A-H2B-mRuby2 bicistronic construct was 80.00 ± 2.60%. Given that the GCaMP6s is expressed by a separate AAV construct and coinfection is not necessarily 100%, the 'nonresponsive' cells may express insufficient GCaMP for detection of single action potentials. Indeed, we identified three reproducible postsynaptic events (out of 316 presynaptic stimulations) that could not be correlated with a calcium transient, perhaps again due to lower GCaMP expression in those neurons. Overall, the average connectivity rate was 10.27 ± 2.60% (27 connections out of 252 cells showing a calcium transient to photostimulation), which was not significantly different from our own results using paired recording (7 connections out of 115 cells; Fisher’s exact test, p=0.18).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14193.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Typical mapping experiment with action potential validation by GCaMP6s.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In acute slices expressing GCaMP6s (green) and targeted ChR2-P2A-H2B-mRuby2 (magenta), cells were identified for photostimulation based on nuclear mRuby2 fluorescence (yellow circles).

Although we were able to detect putative synaptic connections, they were frequently coincident with direct current responses indicative of stimulation of the patched cell’s dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Across the experiments, such direct responses occurred during stimulation of 28.75 ± 4.46% of the target cells within a single field of view. These direct responses were often large in amplitude and could easily obfuscate much smaller synaptic events associated with bona fide connections. Moreover, we also observed reproducible calcium transients in off-target cells when other target cells were being stimulated (note events in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> that lie off of the diagonal). These off-target responses occurred with a probability (the number of events divided by the number of target cells) of 15.17 ± 1.79% and likely result from unintentional stimulation of a ChR2-containing sensitive dendrite of one cell while intending to activate the soma of a separate cell. Consistent with this interpretation, these off-target calcium events were observed at a significantly lower frequency in experiments with the targeted opsin (5.42 ± 1.39%, p&lt;0.01 by two sample t-test). Moreover, the average distance between a cell exhibiting an off-target calcium transient and the intended target cell was greater with nontargeted ChR2 (40.6 ± 6.4 µm versus 18.9 ± 2.4 µm; p&lt;0.01 by two sample t-test), further suggesting that cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 were firing action potentials in response to unintended stimulation of distal dendrites. Our combination of TF and restricted ChR2 thus facilitated the mapping of local circuitry within the 300 µm surrounding a neuron without confounding signals from its dendritic arbor and with a higher throughput than that achieved with electrophysiological techniques alone.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14193.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Typical mapping experiment using nontargeted ChR2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In acute slices expressing GCaMP6s (green) and conventional ChR2-mRuby2, cells were identified for photostimulation based on responsiveness to widefield ChR excitation (yellow circles).

The spatially restricted ChR2 expression we describe allows unmasking of synaptic connections from neurons whose somata lie close to the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell and would have been occluded by direct activation of ChR2 on the dendrite. In addition, depletion of ChR2 from axons prevents inadvertent depolarization of boutons or fibers of passage that could compromise attempts to identify the source of a synaptic event. ChR2 harboring the Kv2.1 localization motif also showed enhanced sensitivity, which is of particular use in situations where excitation power is at a premium. Together these features of the soma-restricted construct significantly enhance the ability to map synaptic connections with single-cell resolution.</p><p>The development of spatially-restricted optogenetic constructs is probably one of the most effective means for achieving single-cell resolution in local circuit mapping experiments. This restriction requires the identification of a relatively small compartment near the neuronal soma characterized by selective expression of particular proteins with known motifs responsible for their localization. The distribution of particular voltage-gated potassium channels defines such a subcellular domain along the soma and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Trimmer, 2015</xref>), and the sufficiency of a short Kv2.1 C-terminal sequence for driving heterologous proteins to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lim et al., 2000</xref>) made this strategy ideal for restricting ChR2 expression. The only obvious alternative is restriction to the axon initial segment (AIS) mediated by an ankyrin G binding motif present in voltage-gated sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Garrido et al., 2003</xref>). Although incorporating this motif into ChR2 drives its localization to the AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), the resulting construct does not support light-generated action potentials under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>). Moreover, AIS-targeted ChR2 alters the intrinsic firing properties of retinal neurons, presumably by displacing endogenous voltage-gated sodium channels whose subcellular localization is also dependent on ankyrin G binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the Kv2.1 targeting strategy currently remains the optimal means of concentrating ChR2 such that action potentials will not be generated by TF stimulation of dendrites &gt;20 µm away from the soma. Indeed, this approach has been successfully used with opsins to artificially generate center-surround receptive fields in retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu et al. (2013)</xref> study showed functional restriction of opsins to the soma and proximal dendrites by examining receptive field responses to wide (200 µm) bars of one-photon light. We have now measured the somatic targeting at a finer scale, demonstrated two-photon excitation of targeted ChR2 that is enhanced relative to normal ChR2 under the same conditions, and established the utility of targeted opsins for enhancing the resolution of local connectivity maps of neural circuits.</p><p>The soma-targeted ChR2 could be combined with many of the techniques for two-photon optical control of neuronal activity previously developed for caged neurotransmitters or optogenetic probes. The relative merit of the optical activation method depends on the axial resolution, temporal precision required and the number of neurons to be stimulated simultaneously in a given experimental paradigm. For example, rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot in a pattern on the soma can generate action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Packer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prakash et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rickgauer and Tank, 2009</xref>) and combination with spatial light modulators allows for simultaneous excitation of neuronal ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Packer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2015</xref>). The temporal resolution of this rapid scanning approach, however, is limited by the time required to scan along the cell body. Scanless activation of untargeted ChR in brain slices using TF, alone or in combination with spatial light modulators, is capable of generating action potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons within 1–3 ms of light onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</xref>) and in cortical neurons in less than 10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>). We did not take full advantage of the temporal precision capability of TF to fire action potentials in our current study, instead focusing on a screening method that would identify connections without optimizing the amount of power that would fire each potential presynaptic neuron with minimal latency. We therefore chose longer pulses at a power sufficient to fire most neurons and generate trains of action potentials, which would elicit stronger signals with calcium indicators. For experiments requiring temporal precision, the minimization of action potential latency requires optimization of excitation area and laser power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Papagiakoumou et al., 2008</xref>). Because power is also the limiting factor in extending the area of two-photon activation to large numbers of neurons with spatial light modulators, the reduced power required to bring soma-targeted opsins to threshold would be an asset to such experiments.</p><p>The optimal performance of our method relies on sufficient co-expression of an opsin, a marker for opsin expression, and a genetically encoded calcium sensor. For GCaMP6s and similar sensors, there appears to be a balance between sufficient expression to detect single action potentials and excessive levels that lead to a lack of responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). Targeting this expression window can be complicated, particularly when simultaneously trying to achieve high opsin levels using a separate AAV construct. Indeed, heterogeneity in GCaMP expression levels between neurons with viral infection may be partially responsible for the 20% of neurons in which we did not detect a change in GCaMP fluorescence with TF stimulation. We have also explored the co-expression of GCaMP6s as the second member of a single P2A-mediated bicistronic construct, but the GCaMP6s expression level was lower than desired, resulting in inadequate detection of action potentials (data not shown). Future development of these techniques will therefore benefit from bypassing viral systems and instead expressing the calcium sensor or the opsin in transgenic animals. The enhanced sensitivity of the targeted ChR2 should alleviate the concern that there would be sufficient opsin expression from a single genetic locus for activation of neurons with two-photon excitation.</p><p>There are several opportunities for future extension of this method. The somatic targeting approach could also be exploited in the context of other opsins such as C1V1, which has recently been leveraged for two-photon stimulation of neural circuits in acute slices and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Packer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prakash et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>). Other molecules which may be good candidates for somatic targeting include the red-shifted ReaChR for its sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lin et al., 2013</xref>) and Chronos for its rapid temporal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the somatic restriction of membrane-bound genetically encoded voltage sensors could dramatically reduce background associated with the neuropil and facilitate an all-optical version of our current method. Because the Kv2.1 targeting sequence is unable to restrict the distribution of the single-pass membrane protein CD8, however, there may be certain structural constraints on the effectiveness of the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lim et al., 2000</xref>). We suspect that at least for the opsins, which are all seven transmembrane domain proteins likely to have a similar structure, the Kv2.1 motif will be sufficient to achieve somatic localization.</p><p>In summary, our combination of TF and soma-restricted ChR2 enables functional connectivity mapping and is straightforward and easy to implement with standard two-photon microscopes. Furthermore, these techniques could also be used in vivo, where the enhanced resolution of the targeted ChR2 makes it especially attractive for selective cell stimulation in behavioral paradigms. These enhancements to probing brain microcircuitry through optical stimulation promise to reveal much about nervous system function and how it might be modified by experience and perturbed in animal models of neurologic or psychiatric disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct generation</title><p>The vector pAAV-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP (Addgene plasmid 26973) served as the backbone for generating certain modified constructs.

The imaging pathway used a Chameleon Ti:sapphire laser tuned to 920 nm (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). The stimulation pathway employed a MaiTai DeepSee Ti:sapphire laser tuned to 880 nm (SpectraPhysics, Santa Clara, CA). The spectral broadening necessary for temporal focusing was achieved on this path by placing a 300 line/mm diffraction grating (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) approximately 1 m away from the galvanometric mirrors; the laser spot on the grating was imaged onto the plane between the mirrors using a 500 mm focal length lens (Thorlabs) placed 500 mm away from the grating along the path of the first diffraction order from the grating. The stimulation laser was recombined with the imaging laser in the scan head using a 900 nm long-pass dichroic mirror (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT). The power applied by either laser was controlled with a separate Pockels cell (Conoptics, Danbury, CT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Three weeks after viral injection, animals were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.

Sections were stained for ChR2-EYFP fusion proteins with a rabbit antibody raised against GFP followed by an Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Sections were mounted in Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and images were collected on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope using 10× air- and 40× oil-immersion objectives. Acquisition settings for laser power and PMT voltages were kept constant between nontargeted and targeted ChR2 samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Stimulation and resolution studies</title><p>Temporal focusing stimulation was controlled by Prairie View 5.0 software (Bruker). Standard stimulation protocols used 150 ms pulses, except as noted in the text. Stimulation powers were measured after the objective, and ranged from 15 to 285 mW; assuming our spot size to be at least 10 µm in diameter, we are using powers of no greater than 0.2 to 3.6 mW/µm<sup>2</sup>. This calculation assumes a completely flat excitation profile; in reality, there is some spread in the axial dimension and thus, the power density is probably even lower. Cells filled with fluorescent Alexa dyes were visualized by two-photon microscopy and recorded in whole-cell voltage or current clamp as the temporal focusing spot was moved to different axial planes, different cell bodies or particular spots along dendrites. For each dendrite examined, the temporal focusing-induced current was plotted as a function of distance from the cell soma; the resulting curves were averaged for each construct to generate the traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. All responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were verified to exhibit kinetics associated with direct stimulation of the patched cells: that is, exhibiting onset and offset precisely locked to the start and end of the optical stimulation. Stimulation powers were chosen separately for each cell by identifying the minimum power that evoked action potentials continually across ten trials. Resolution of spike generation was measured by moving the stimulation spot at 9 µm intervals laterally or 10 µm axially above or below the cell soma and recording the proportion of trials out of 10 leading to an action potential. Data were collected from cells until a minimum of ten cells was obtained for following ChR2 expression along dendrites; given a standard deviation of ~11% for these measurements, our sample size should be able to detect a 15% difference between groups with a power of 0.8. Data for other measures were collected in parallel, and no data were ever excluded even if a recording failed prior to collecting the dendrite expression results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium imaging and connection analysis</title><p>Images of 512 × 512 pixels were simultaneously collected at 1.5 Hz using a raster scanning galvonometric system. Each stimulation epoch was timed to coincide with the onset of every other imaging frame, that is, the first spot was stimulated at the onset of the second frame, the second spot was stimulated 1.26 s later at the onset of frame 4, and so on. In this manner, a calcium peak in any frame could be associated with stimulation of a particular point in the field. During each stimulation epoch, microscope PMTs were protected from saturating fluorescence signals by Uniblitz shutters (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Because this resulted in a lack of signal in the first 150 ms of every other frame as the top portion of the microscope field was scanned by the imaging laser, all stimulation points and calcium data collection were confined to a ~200 × 300 µm region of the microscope field. First-pass regions of interest (ROIs) were based on the stimulation points defined by labeled nuclei; frames containing significant calcium transients were then used to manually refine each ROI to define the soma of a responsive cell. For each ROI, the change in fluorescence relative to baseline (△F/F) was computed based on a baseline period of 10 frames prior to the onset of any stimulation. Significant calcium transients were defined as events of greater than three standard deviations above the mean for a duration of at least 2 frames. Cells with baseline GCaMP6s signals of more than 2 standard deviations above the mean in a given experiment were excluded from analysis, as GCaMP overexpression can lead to aberrant responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). A synaptic connection was scored if the following criteria were met: (1) a latency of at least 2 ms from stimulus onset, (2) occurring in at least three out of four trials, (3) a jitter of less than 14 ms, (4) a rise time from 10% of peak to 90% of peak of less than 10 ms, and (5) the presence of a calcium transient in the photostimulated cell. Detected connections were confirmed to be excitatory in nature by altering the holding potential of the patched cell to demonstrate a reversal potential of ~0 mV. Connectivity rate was defined as then number of pairs with calcium transients in the presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic currents divided by the number of presynaptic neurons with calcium transients stimulated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Alipasha Vaziri for advice on temporal focusing, Jason Christie for consultations on implementing temporal focusing on our specific two-photon setup, David Whitney and Dan Wilson for valuable conversations regarding calcium imaging, David Fitzpatrick for comments on the manuscript, and Asnel Joseph, Nowrin Ahmed, and Laura Conatser for performing stereotaxic AAV injections.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Single-cell resolution circuit mapping with temporal-focused excitation of soma-targeted channelrhodopsin&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder as the Senior editor and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that the work does not meet the standard for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviewers agreed that the strategy you propose is elegant and potentially very powerful, and could have a major impact on the field of neuroscience, unfortunately they also expressed serious concerns regarding the details of the experiments and the presentation of the results, which dampened enthusiasm for the manuscript. In particular, the section of the manuscript on circuit mapping was felt to be especially weak and would require a major series of additional experiments. As you probably know, <italic>eLife</italic> has a policy of not asking for significant new experiments as part of a revision, thus resulting in the present decision.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors describe an optogenetics method to reach optogenetics activation with single cell resolution. The approach combines the use of temporal focusing with targeted opsins, which restrict the chanelrhodopsin expression to the soma and the apical dendrites. The development of somatic opsins is one of the most promising ways of reaching a true cellular resolution with optogenetics and will surely strongly impact the neuroscience community.</p><p>However, in my opinion, the manuscript cannot be published in the present form and requires significant major modifications.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>References reporting optical methods using two-photon excitation, diffractive optics and temporal focusing for optogenetics are not extensively cited. Also a state of the art (including eventual references) on alternative approaches to achieve somatic ChR2 targeting will help in appreciating the novelty of the paper. The decision of using Kv2.1 voltage gated potassium channel to confine ChR2 targeting should be discussed more extensively.</p><p>Results and Discussion:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (left): The meaning of this figure is not clear. It seems that the authors want here to characterize the optical resolution of the system. If this is the case, lateral resolution will be better characterized by performing a lateral displacement of the excitation spot along the x and y direction and plotting the corresponding curves (similarly as was done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>, right panel, for axial resolution). The 3D image is very confusing and not necessary.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>: Cross sections through the images are needed in order to appreciate the values for lateral and axial FWHM.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: The image showing the Alexa 594 distribution (central bottom panel) has a very reduced fluorescence spreading with respect to the central top one: this difference is not justified as the spreading should be comparable in the two cells: authors should probably choose a better example.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>: The experiment on acute slice has been done only once: this is not enough to support their conclusion more statistics is needed. They should be able to derive for acute slice a figure similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and C.</p><p>They need to discuss the effect of the planarity of the dendrites in the experiments: the excitation spot has been moved laterally along the objective focal plane, if the dendritic process is axially tilted this could also induce a decrease in the current (more statistic will enables removing this ambiguity).</p><p>In order to compare data from non targeted and targeted cells, authors should comment on the time they wait after injections in the two cases. Is this comparable? How long the somatic targeting stays somatic? Is there a critical time window after which the somatic ChR2 starts spreading along dendritic processes? Scale bar should be indicated in the bottom image. Why for the targeted ChR2, data have been taken with larger step?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: The authors should better explain how they obtained this figure; how do they define the threshold?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>: In the caption they write &quot;each position in a map was stimulated with the minimum power that reliably evoked action potential when stimulation was applied to the soma&quot;: they should better quantify the meaning of &quot;reliably evoked action potential&quot;.

This is in principle a very elegant approach for improving the spatial precision of optogenetic activation, currently a key limitation in the field. However, the manuscript has a rather preliminary flavor (several of the key observations appear to be n = 1). The authors are in the position to provide a major advance here by performing a detailed quantification of how accurate and reliable their method is, using ground truth calibrations. For example, the authors have not quantified how accurate their method is with any paired recordings to prove the connections they find are real. They only state that the average connectivity is similar to that in other experiments in which pairs were directly recorded. Most importantly, the lack of detailed quantification (with mean, SD, and N) needs to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) There are major details missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. What is the mean action potential reliability and resolution, i.e. the grand average result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> across all neurons? What powers were typically used for AP generation at the soma in these experimental conditions? What are the max currents observed? Please provide mean, SD, and N. Note that the figure was not created with the construct that was ultimately used, which is a weakness.</p><p>2) How many cells were used to generate the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>? It appears that some of the differences are statistically borderline and without complete data including the sample size it is difficult to determine the reliability of this result. Also, how did the authors determine the number of significant digits to include?</p><p>3) In describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors mention that 3 photostimulation trials are performed at each location. Could the authors please show raw trials, perhaps in a lighter shade behind the average, to indicate the reliability of observed connections?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> uses a different stimulation duration that rest of paper – the photostimulation time has been increased to 150 ms for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. As this value doesn't match the previous calibrations, it is very difficult to use the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to calibrate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

How do the authors explain the discrepancy between the fact that these long photostimulations (150 ms!) may very well induce more than one action potential, but only one post-synaptic response is observed? Many cortical synapses may depress, but not sufficiently to explain these observations.</p><p>6) What is the cutoff for a connection and how reliable is this? For example, in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, fourth from the right, there is a large calcium transient and some tiny EPSCs – could these be a weak connection?</p><p>7) How often do the authors observe failures to confirm pre-synaptic action potential generation with imaging?

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months, so please let us know if you have any questions first.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The development of somatically targeted opsins is one of the most promising ways of achieving true cellular resolution with optogenetics and will surely have a strong impact the neuroscience community. The authors have considerably improved the quality of the manuscript by adding more data and statistical analysis. There is a strong case now for arguing that this new construct is better suited for mapping connectivity in the circuit using targeted optogenetic stimulation. However a few points of the paper still need additional work before the manuscript is ready to proceed towards publication. We encourage the authors to proceed with these final experiments as a matter of urgency, as this is a highly competitive field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The power levels used in the different experiments are often missing, and this information is crucial to appreciate the spatial resolution achieved in the experiments (e.g. how far are the powers used from the saturation value?). The powers used to evoke a single AP are rather high and latency and jittering are rather long compared to what has been reported in the literature. This point is particularly weak considering that in several parts of the manuscript the authors insist on the &quot;enhanced sensitivity &quot;of the targeted opsin. Overall this implies that the opsins (somatic or not) used in this experiments are not very efficient and may not be suitable for experiments requiring e.g. multi-spot stimulation. Many datapoints e.g. the ones showing cellular resolution, or the connectivity experiments, are only performed using the targeted opsins and it is difficult to appreciate their importance if one can't compare the same experiments performed with the non-targeted version.</p><p>2) In order to showcase the advantage of the 'new targeted' construct, it is crucial to include the axial and lateral profile of spike probability also for the 'non-targeted' construct in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>. Please add this quantification to existing panels in this figure. State the power at which these curves were obtained.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: line scans to demonstrate somatic targeting are all done along dendritic processes, while no information or data are provided to show the expression confinement along axons. This would be helpful.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: &quot;each pixel in the map show the direct current&quot; are the authors plotting the peak current here? Moreover from this map it is difficult to understand the depolarization achieved. The same experiment performed in current clamp would allow us to learn about the spike probability for spot placed out of the target, which ultimately is the key elements to support the necessity of the somatic opsin for the connectivity experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> or to appreciate the enhanced spatial resolution (see next comment).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is nice. The quantification of these connectivity mapping experiments could be included in this figure rather than only in the Results section of the text. For completion, please add an additional example of another such slice experiment in an extra supplementary figure. Also, the information on the stimulation protocol used here is very vague: &quot;each cell was stimulated in series with 2 seconds between stimuli&quot;: how many stimuli? What power did they use? How confined is the response if experiments as the ones showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C-D</xref> are done using this protocol? How do these results compare if similar experiments are done with a non-somatic opsin?</p><p>6) In the discussion the authors justify the use of high power and long photostimulation power:</p><p>&quot;We did not take full advantage of the temporal precision capability of TF to fire action potentials in our current study, instead focusing on a screening method that would identify connections without optimizing the amount of power that would fire each potential presynaptic neuron with minimal latency. We therefore chose longer pulses at a power sufficient to fire most neurons and generate trains of action potentials, which would elicit stronger signals with calcium indicators. For experiments requiring temporal precision, the minimization of action potential latency requires optimization of excitation area and laser power&quot;</p><p>This paper should convince us about the use of a new optogenetic construct, and (as discussed above) a more detailed characterization of the opsin showing the photostimulation area and laser power that enables AP generation with a temporal resolution and precision comparable to what has been achieved in the literature is important and should be carried out.</p><p>7) The sentence &quot;Furthermore, these techniques could also be used in vivo, where the enhanced sensitivity of the targeted ChR2 makes it especially attractive&quot; is misleading: in the paper the authors do show that the targeted version is more sensitive than the non-targeted one. But in both cases they use excitation powers much higher than what has been achieved in the literature and demonstrate performances (temporal resolution, latency and jittering) inferior to what has been achieved with ChR2 or C1V1 by other labs. This should be reworded.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single-cell resolution circuit mapping in mouse brain with temporal-focused excitation of soma-targeted channelrhodopsin&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder as the Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There remain concerns about the intensity and duration of the illumination pulses used (150 ms). This suggests that the construct is not very efficient. Why were such long pulses used? Were shorter pulses used in some experiments? The authors should either demonstrate that their construct is also effective in triggering spikes when using shorter pulses, or provide a convincing justification for the use of longer pulses.</p><p>2) Please add to the Methods section some of the text that is currently a response to point 1, related to stimulation power needed to excite the cells. (&quot;Our manuscript reports excitation powers of between 15 and 285 mW (for both types of opsins); assuming our spot size to be at least 10 μm wide and 10 μm thick, we are using powers of no greater than 0.2 to 3.8 mW/μm<sup>2</sup>).

We have not completely characterized the reasons for this but suspect that linking high opsin expression to high GCaMP expression on the same construct leads to many cells with GCaMP in their nuclei that no longer exhibit calcium transients.

The efficiency of ChR2 excitation is quite high as indicated by its two-photon cross section. We intended to refer to the low single-channel conductance of ChR2 and suggest that when the excitation is axially confined, a rapid scanning approach or a light sculpting technique is needed to quickly activate many ChR2 molecules and drive spike generation.

What is the mean action potential reliability and resolution, i.e. the grand average result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> across all neurons? What powers were typically used for AP generation at the soma in these experimental conditions? What are the max currents observed? Please provide mean, SD, and N. Note that the figure was not created with the construct that was ultimately used, which is a weakness.</italic> </p><p>The resolution of spike generation in 10 cells expressing the targeted construct is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>. These measurements were determined at the threshold power for each particular cell, the distribution of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The average currents at each power are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. There was no difference between targeted and untargeted cells in the average current necessary to evoke action potentials (i.e., rheobase), only a difference in the amount of stimulation power required to evoke such current.</p><p> <italic>2) How many cells were used to generate the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>? It appears that some of the differences are statistically borderline and without complete data including the sample size it is difficult to determine the reliability of this result. Also, how did the authors determine the number of significant digits to include?</italic> </p><p>These data are now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 2</xref>, and include N for all measurements. Significant digits are determined by the measurement limits of the Clampex patch clamp software.</p><p> <italic>3) In describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors mention that 3 photostimulation trials are performed at each location. Could the authors please show raw trials, perhaps in a lighter shade behind the average, to indicate the reliability of observed connections?</italic> </p><p>All raw trials are now shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, with calcium traces overlaid in a lighter shade and electrophysiological traces displayed adjacent to each other.</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> uses a different stimulation duration that rest of paper – the photostimulation time has been increased to 150 ms for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. As this value doesn't match the previous calibrations, it is very difficult to use the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to calibrate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. How does the longer duration affect spatial resolution, action potential threshold, etc.?</italic> </p><p>All data in the paper are now derived from 150ms stimulation.</p><p> <italic>5) Many of the calcium imaging transients in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">figure 3</xref> are quite large, and sometimes double-peaked when there is only one EPSC observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom row, red square). How do the authors explain the discrepancy between the fact that these long photostimulations (150 ms!) may very well induce more than one action potential, but only one post-synaptic response is observed? Many cortical synapses may depress, but not sufficiently to explain these observations.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, the longer stimulation protocol was used in hopes of generating trains of presynaptic action potentials. While single postsynaptic currents are observed (some neurons only generate one action potential regardless of stimulation intensity), we frequently saw large calcium transients and trains of postsynaptic currents, which are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p> <italic>6) What is the cutoff for a connection and how reliable is this? For example, in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, fourth from the right, there is a large calcium transient and some tiny EPSCs – could these be a weak connection?</italic> </p><p>In the original version of the manuscript, the currents described by the reviewer did not occur across multiple trials. In the new experiments reported here, we require that events occur in at least three out of four trials and with less than 14 ms jitter and a greater than 2 ms latency from the photostimulation. These criteria are now described in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Calcium imaging and connection analysis”).</p><p> <italic>7) How often do the authors observe failures to confirm pre-synaptic action potential generation with imaging? They only say &quot;occasionally&quot;. Excluding these from analysis could heavily bias estimation of connectivity rates!</italic> </p><p>The exact numbers of excluded connections from the current study are now described in the Results. For the majority of cells (5 out of 7 in the current study), every connection found could be associated with a somatic calcium transient. Out of the 36 connections identified across all cells in the present study, 3 were excluded due to lack of a somatic calcium signal.</p><p> <italic>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors photostimulate 192 different locations in a grid-like fashion. They don't aim to zap neurons directly, but rather by shooting at many locations, they hope to hit some neurons by chance. A quick segmentation of the image to find neurons and shoot them directly would improve accuracy, reliability, and potentially even be more efficient! Why do the authors not target neurons initially?</italic> </p><p>We originally hoped that baseline GCaMP fluorescence would be sufficient to target neurons as the reviewer suggests, however, we found that many neurons with significant calcium responses to TF stimulation were impossible to identify under baseline imaging conditions. We agree with the reviewer that segmentation would be preferable, and developed a new construct in which neuronal nuclei were fluorescently labeled for easy targeting for TF stimulation. All mapping studies in the current version of the paper use this construct.</p><p> <italic>9) Have the authors repeated the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> more than once? If so, please present some grand average data.</italic> </p><p>The data for seven different mapping experiments are now described in the Results section (seventh paragraph).</p><p> <italic>10) Losonczy et al. 2010, cited by the authors, shows effective activation of axons. How can the authors be sure that is not occurring here? Can they provide some presynaptic patch confirmations of any of the connections they see?</italic> </p><p>Targeted ChR2 expression is not seen in the axons of dye-filled cultured neurons, which is consistent with the known exclusion of Kv2.1 from axons beyond the initial segment.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The power levels used in the different experiments are often missing, and this information is crucial to appreciate the spatial resolution achieved in the experiments (e.g. how far are the powers used from the saturation value?). The powers used to evoke a single AP are rather high and latency and jittering are rather long compared to what has been reported in the literature. This point is particularly weak considering that in several parts of the manuscript the authors insist on the &quot;enhanced sensitivity &quot;of the targeted opsin. Overall this implies that the opsins (somatic or not) used in this experiments are not very efficient and may not be suitable for experiments requiring e.g. multi-spot stimulation. Many datapoints e.g. the ones showing cellular resolution, or the connectivity experiments, are only performed using the targeted opsins and it is difficult to appreciate their importance if one can't compare the same experiments performed with the non-targeted version.</italic> </p><p>The power levels used in most experiments were calibrated for each cell to generate a single action potential; we chose this approach to compare resolution and sensitivity across multiple cells that may differ in absolute levels of opsin expression. We have made an extra effort to explicitly mention this rationale as well as the average powers chosen for each experiment; for sample mapping experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, we have also included specific power levels in the figure legends.</p><p>With temporal focusing excitation distributed across a volume, the power levels for opsin excitation are expected to be higher than those used when scanning a much smaller diffraction-limited spot. In earlier papers using temporal focusing stimulation of ChR2, Andrasfalvy et al. (<italic>PNAS,</italic> 2010) reported action potential generation anywhere with 300-400 mW power at the sample plane, and Losonczy et al (Nature Neurosci., 2010) report power levels between 50 and 500 mW. Our manuscript reports excitation powers of between 15 and 285 mW (for both types of opsins); assuming our spot size to be at least 10μm wide and 10μm thick, we are using powers of no greater than 0.2 to 3.8 mW/μm<sup>2</sup>. This approaches but does not surpass excitation powers of 0.45 mW/μm<sup>2</sup> reported by the Emiliani group, but differences in opsin delivery and expression may account for some of the discrepancy. Finally, Rickgauer et al. (Nature Neurosci., 2014) were able to use less than 100 mW over the entire temporal focusing disc when employing C1V1, which could be due to the enhanced optical response of that opsin relative to ChR2.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that additional comparisons between nontargeted and targeted opsins would reveal the utility of a somatic targeting approach. We have taken this approach to heart and included new comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and also added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (see below).</p><p> <italic>2) In order to showcase the advantage of the 'new targeted' construct, it is crucial to include the axial and lateral profile of spike probability also for the 'non-targeted' construct in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>. Please add this quantification to existing panels in this figure. State the power at which these curves were obtained.</italic> </p><p>The manuscript now has a new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with the nontargeted resolutions incorporated (see also sixth paragraph of Results). As alluded to above, the power levels for all the resolution experiments (including both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) vary from cell to cell and are set to be the minimum power that generates a single action potential in ten out of ten trials. The average powers for these experiments are reported in third paragraph of Results and a mistaken power level was corrected.</p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: line scans to demonstrate somatic targeting are all done along dendritic processes, while no information or data are provided to show the expression confinement along axons. This would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We conducted similar optical stimulation experiments on axonal processes, added more detailed imaging, and included the results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and in the Results (fourth paragraph).</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: &quot;each pixel in the map show the direct current&quot; are the authors plotting the peak current here? Moreover from this map it is difficult to understand the depolarization achieved. The same experiment performed in current clamp would allow us to learn about the spike probability for spot placed out of the target, which ultimately is the key elements to support the necessity of the somatic opsin for the connectivity experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> or to appreciate the enhanced spatial resolution (see next comment).</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we are plotting the peak current amplitudes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. This voltage clamp experiment remains an important demonstration of the extent of direct currents that overwhelm smaller synaptic events in mapping experiments, which can be seen now in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We agree that the spike probability at off target locations is worthwhile information and were able to investigate this in the context of actual connectivity mapping experiments by extracting information from our previous data as well as new experiments with nontargeted opsin. When using a nontargeted construct, we found an increased probability of calcium transient generation in off-target cells when stimulating separate cells in the slice. Moreover, the average distance between an off-target activated cell and the stimulation point was greater when using nontargeted ChR2. These observations are now reported in the Results.</p><p> <italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is nice. The quantification of these connectivity mapping experiments could be included in this figure rather than only in the Results section of the text. For completion, please add an additional example of another such slice experiment in an extra supplementary figure. Also, the information on the stimulation protocol used here is very vague: &quot;each cell was stimulated in series with 2 seconds between stimuli&quot;: how many stimuli? What power did they use? How confined is the response if experiments as the ones showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C-D</xref> are done using this protocol? How do these results compare if similar experiments are done with a non-somatic opsin?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments about the new figure, and have incorporated more quantification from multiple connectivity experiments into the figure legend, as requested. We have also included another example slice experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have also tried to explain in the figure legend that each cell is stimulated sequentially at the onset of every other imaging frame (i.e., 2.4 seconds after the previous cell in the field). After going through all the cells in the field (40-80 cells), the entire protocol is repeated for three additional iterations to produce the results in the figures. We have reported the average power value across the mapping experiments seventh paragraph of Results and the specific power levels for each representative experiment within the figure legend. Finally, we appreciate the suggestion to perform mapping experiments with nontargeted ChR2, and have included an example as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This allowed us to demonstrate unintended activation of off-target cells as well as the extent to which direct activation of the dendritic arbor occurs and can make interrogation of local connectivity problematic.</p><p> <italic>6) In the discussion the authors justify the use of high power and long photostimulation power:</italic> </p><p> <italic>&quot;We did not take full advantage of the temporal precision capability of TF to fire action potentials in our current study, instead focusing on a screening method that would identify connections without optimizing the amount of power that would fire each potential presynaptic neuron with minimal latency. […] For experiments requiring temporal precision, the minimization of action potential latency requires optimization of excitation area and laser power&quot;</italic> </p><p> <italic>This paper should convince us about the use of a new optogenetic construct, and (as discussed above) a more detailed characterization of the opsin showing the photostimulation area and laser power that enables AP generation with a temporal resolution and precision comparable to what has been achieved in the literature is important and should be carried out.</italic> </p><p>Our goal with this manuscript was to provide a baseline system from which to base further refinements of optogenetic mapping experiments and to establish the utility of somatic opsin targeting for such an approach. We therefore focused on greater characterization of spatial resolution of the targeted ChR2 and less on temporal precision. Nevertheless, we now include data that show action potential latency consistent with that achieved in the literature can be obtained by increasing stimulation power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our mapping experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> also demonstrate that the advantages in spatial resolution with the targeted construct are maintained at higher stimulation powers that produce shorter latencies.</p><p> <italic>7) The sentence &quot;Furthermore, these techniques could also be used in vivo, where the enhanced sensitivity of the targeted ChR2 makes it especially attractive&quot; is misleading: in the paper the authors do show that the targeted version is more sensitive than the non-targeted one. But in both cases they use excitation powers much higher than what has been achieved in the literature and demonstrate performances (temporal resolution, latency and jittering) inferior to what has been achieved with ChR2 or C1V1 by other labs. This should be reworded.</italic></p><p>We altered the statement to focus more on spatial resolution (final paragraph of Discussion).</p><p> <italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p> <italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) There remain concerns about the intensity and duration of the illumination pulses used (150 ms). This suggests that the construct is not very efficient. Why were such long pulses used? Were shorter pulses used in some experiments? The authors should either demonstrate that their construct is also effective in triggering spikes when using shorter pulses, or provide a convincing justification for the use of longer pulses.</italic> </p><p>We implemented a longer stimulation protocol as this provided the greatest probability of eliciting trains of action potentials, leading to increased calcium signals in mapping experiments. In an earlier version of our manuscript, we characterized responses for both types of opsins using a shorter stimulation time (32 ms). We have now included some of these data as an additional figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and added appropriate commentary in the text (fourth paragraph of Results). Moreover, the ability to reduce latency to less than 10 ms with increased power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that even shorter stimulation pulses may still be effective.</p><p> <italic>2) Please add to the Methods section some of the text that is currently a response to point 1, related to stimulation power needed to excite the cells. (&quot;Our manuscript reports excitation powers of between 15 and 285 mW (for both types of opsins); assuming our spot size to be at least 10 μm wide and 10 μm thick, we are using powers of no greater than 0.2 to 3.8 mW/μm<sup>2</sup>). Expressing power as mW/</italic>μ<italic>m<sup>2</sup> (rather than incident power in hundreds of mW) will be useful for readers.</italic> </p><p>We have now expressed all powers in the text and figures as mW/μm<sup>2</sup>, and added an explanatory note to the Materials and methods section (subsection “Stimulation and resolution studies”).</p><p> <italic>3) 'Single-cell resolution' is advertised in the title, but is not well supported.
