Synaptic iGluSnFR signal time courses vary widely depending on experimental conditions, often lasting 10–100 times longer than the extracellular lifetime of synaptically released glutamate estimated with uptake measurements. iGluSnFR signals typically also decay much more slowly than the unbinding kinetics of the indicator. To resolve these discrepancies, here we have modeled synaptic glutamate diffusion, uptake and iGluSnFR activation to identify factors influencing iGluSnFR signal waveforms. Simulations suggested that iGluSnFR competes with transporters to bind synaptically released glutamate, delaying glutamate uptake. Accordingly, synaptic transporter currents recorded from iGluSnFR-expressing astrocytes in mouse cortex were slower than those in control astrocytes. Simulations also suggested that iGluSnFR reduces free glutamate levels in extrasynaptic spaces, likely limiting extrasynaptic receptor activation. iGluSnFR and lower affinity variants, nonetheless, provide linear indications of vesicle release, underscoring their value for optical quantal analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>iGluSnFR</kwd><kwd>glutamate transport</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS003039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS113499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulla</surname><given-names>Chris G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulla</surname><given-names>Chris G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS100796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulla</surname><given-names>Chris G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fluorescent glutamate indicators distort the time course of neurotransmitter diffusion and uptake by competing with transporters, an important caveat to consider when using iGluSnFR and its analogs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) have been modified to develop genetically encoded biosensors to detect different molecules, including glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lorimier et al., 2002</xref>). PBPs comprise two domains linked by flexible ‘hinge’ where ligand binding brings the two domains closer together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quiocho et al., 1997</xref>). PBP glutamate indicators are based on GltI, part of <italic>E. Coli.</italic>’s ABC glutamate/aspartate transporter complex; early versions (FLIPE and GluSnFR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hires et al., 2008</xref>) signaled ligand binding via Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fehr et al., 2002</xref>) between fluorescent proteins tethered to each PBP domain.

Analogous information has been obtained using synaptically-evoked excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)-mediated currents (STCs) recorded in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergles and Jahr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lüscher et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond and Jahr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanson et al., 2015</xref>). Although these two approaches can lead to similar conclusions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinky et al., 2018</xref>), they differ significantly in their response time courses: Synaptically evoked iGluSnFR-mediated fluorescence signals decay with exponential time courses ranging from ~20 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2016</xref>) to 100 ms or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parsons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinky et al., 2018</xref>). STCs decay nearly 10 times more rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergles and Jahr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond and Jahr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond, 2005</xref>) and suggest that glutamate is removed from the extracellular space by EAATs in just a few ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond, 2005</xref>). This difference between iGluSnFR response and STC waveforms is evident even in studies employing both techniques under apparently similar experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For iGluSnFR signals and STCs to provide quantitative insights into the dynamics of glutamatergic transmission, the kinetic discrepancies between the two signals must be understood. The STC time course reflects a combination of release asynchrony, transporter kinetics, glutamate diffusion and electrotonic distortion by astrocytic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergles and Jahr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond, 2005</xref>). By contrast, the factors determining iGluSnFR response waveforms have not been identified explicitly. Slower iGluSnFR responses do not simply reflect the kinetics of the indicator, as the iGluSnFR dissociation time course is 2–10-fold faster than most response decays. Moreover, iGluSnFR signals are slowed by partial blockade of glutamate transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parsons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinky et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that they report changes in uptake capacity and glutamate clearance. Whereas STCs reflect the naturally occurring process of glutamate uptake by endogenous transporters, iGluSnFR expression introduces exogenous binding sites into the extracellular milieu. The extent to which glutamate buffering by iGluSnFR may influence glutamate diffusion is not intuitively obvious.</p><p>Here, Monte Carlo simulations of glutamate diffusion, uptake and iGluSnFR signaling were performed to explore the mechanisms underlying iGluSnFR signal dynamics. These simulations show that iGluSnFR response time course depends strongly on iGluSnFR expression level. Simulated iGluSnFR responses mimic those reported in the experimental literature only when iGluSnFRs compete with EAATs for glutamate to the extent that iGluSnFR delays glutamate uptake. These predictions were confirmed with electrophysiological recordings from iGluSnFR-expressing astrocytes in cortical slices: STCs recorded in iGluSnFR-expressing astrocytes rose and decayed more slowly than those recorded in control astrocytes expressing tdTomato, indicating that iGluSnFR expression slowed the glutamate uptake time course. We conclude that, although iGluSnFR and STCs provide powerful, complementary indications of glutamate release and clearance, care is required in their interpretation. Our simulations suggest that an ideal glutamate indicator would exhibit a large dynamic range (i.e. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) and low expression levels to deliver detectable signals while minimally disrupting glutamate uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The stochastic behavior of simulated glutamate transporter and iGluSnFR molecules was governed by experimentally derived kinetic models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

EAAT1 and EAAT2 are expressed in astrocytic membranes at high density (&gt;10<sup>4</sup> molecules per μm<sup>2</sup>) that, adjusted for membrane density and extracellular volume fraction, corresponds to an effective concentration of 140–330 μM in the extracellular space of hippocampal and cerebellar neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehre and Danbolt, 1998</xref>).

Because glial and neuronal membranes are so closely apposed in synaptic neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishchenko et al., 2010</xref>), the large majority of glial EAATs likely must compete with iGluSnFRs for glutamate, regardless of whether iGluSnFR is expressed in neurons or in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2016</xref>). Additional experiments, presented below (Figure 9), examined other extrasynaptic expression patterns of EAATs and iGluSnFRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Competition between iGluSnFRs and EAATs slows uptake and iGluSnFR activation time courses</title><p>When EAATs (100 μM) and iGluSnFRs (300 μM) were co-localized in extrasynaptic space, simulated glutamate release activated iGluSnFR with a time course that reached a peak in about 5 ms and decayed with an exponential time course (τ = 27 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This decay was significantly slower than iGluSnFR’s deactivation time constant (τ = 10 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), suggesting that iGluSnFR interacted with extrasynaptic glutamate over a prolonged period. Consistent with this, the time course of glutamate uptake from the extracellular space was slowed in the presence of iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This slowing was also evident in the simulated STC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, inset), which reflects electrogenic state transitions within EAATs upon binding and transporting glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles et al., 2002</xref>; see Materials and methods). The time courses of both the iGluSnFR response and glutamate uptake were prolonged by higher iGluSnFR concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), suggesting that iGluSnFR buffers glutamate diffusion and delays its uptake. At very low iGluSnFR levels (e.g. 1 μM), the uptake time course closely approximated the room temperature control in the absence of iGluSnFR (τ ~4 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond, 2005</xref>), and iGluSnFR activation decayed at a rate approaching iGluSnFR deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At higher iGluSnFR concentrations, however, both time constants increased and converged; the highest iGluSnFR levels tested gave rise to time constants that exceeded 100 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), similar to slower published iGluSnFR signal time courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parsons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinky et al., 2018</xref>). Although iGluSnFR extended the extracellular lifetime of glutamate, it did not affect the distance that glutamate diffused prior to being taken up by transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), consistent with iGluSnFR’s role as a stationary buffer. At higher expression levels, each glutamate molecule bound to iGluSnFR multiple times before it was able to bind a transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). (Each glutamate molecule typically bound a transporter only once, as simulated EAATs transported glutamate with 90% efficiency.)

The localization and kinetic properties of EAATs remained the same: only transporter density was changed. The apparent effects of simulated EAAT blockade depended dramatically on the imaging volume. Over a 1 μm radius ROI, the effects on iGluSnFR time course of removing 80% or 100% of the transporters was relatively minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), because the glutamate concentration time course over that small spatial scale is dominated by diffusion, not glutamate uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diamond and Jahr, 1997</xref>).

This could be accomplished by, for example, expressing iGluSnFR only in some subset of interneuron plasma membranes. To test this idea, we confined EAATs and iGluSnFRs in simulations to alternating spherical shells of varying thickness, with EAATs occupying the innermost shell in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). EAAT and iGluSnFR concentrations within each shell were adjusted so that the average concentrations were 100 and 300 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As expected, excluding iGluSnFR from the region immediately surrounding the release site reduced the amplitude of the indicator signal and sped the time course of glutamate uptake compared to the case in which iGluSnFRs and EAATs were perfectly co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Segregation did not, however, speed the iGluSnFR signal, because the subset of glutamate that diffused into the iGluSnFR-only region tended to remain there, buffered by the surrounding indicator and contributing to a prolonged iGluSnFR signal. This effect was also evident in the glutamate clearance time course, which exhibited a second, similarly slow component. The fast component of clearance, meanwhile, was similar to that observed in the absence of iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, dashed line). These results suggest that, when EAATs and iGluSnFRs are strongly segregated (e.g. 2 μm alternating shells), slow iGluSnFR signals may be observed even under conditions when most synaptically released glutamate is taken up quickly (red traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Similar results were obtained in simulations employing rectilinear coordinates with iGluSnFR and EAAT expression segregated alternately or randomly into 2 × 2 × 2 μm<sup>3</sup> cubes (data not shown). These scenarios do not appear to reflect the experimental conditions reported above, however: iGluSnFR expression in astrocytic membranes slowed STCs significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas sharp segregation (2 μm shells or cubes) simulations produced STC waveforms similar in time course to those simulated in the absence of iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Simulations: Segregated expression reduces buffering effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of simulation in which EAATs and iGluSnFRs were colocalized (i), or segregated into alternating spherical shells surrounding the synapse, with EAATs occupying the innermost shell (ii).

This scenario may present a case in which astroglial EAATs sample extracellular space evenly but iGluSnFR is expressed in only a subset of neurons. In this case, iGluSnFR signals were larger and faster than in the segregated case, and clearance was also faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D and H,I</xref>). The iGluSnFR signals were larger because the same EAAT concentration, evenly distributed, presented half the EAATs in the initial shell, enabling more glutamate to reach the iGluSnFR-containing shells. iGluSnFR signals and glutamate clearance were faster because glutamate no longer became ‘trapped’ in iGluSnFR-only regions. Nonetheless, the simulated STC was very similar to that in the absence of iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>). Similar results were obtained using Cartesian coordinates (data not shown). These results indicate that iGluSnFR, when expressed in only a subset of neuronal membranes, may produce detectable (albeit smaller) signals with reduced distortion of endogenous glutamate uptake dynamics. Such an arrangement may be ideal for experiments in which many synapses can be imaged simultaneously but glutamate diffusion and uptake must not be disturbed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>iGluSnFR and its variants offer great opportunities to study the dynamics of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. The diffusion simulations presented here aimed to examine what factors influence the measured time course of iGluSnFR signals. They suggest that iGluSnFR responses are slower than predicted from diffusion laws and astrocyte STC recordings because iGluSnFR buffers glutamate diffusion and prolongs its extracellular lifetime following synaptic release. Consistent with these conclusions, STCs recorded from iGluSnFR<sup>+</sup> cortical astrocytes were slower than those recorded in tdTomato<sup>+</sup> control astrocytes, confirming that iGluSnFR slows glutamate clearance. The buffering effects of iGluSnFR were also evident in simulations incorporating lower affinity iGluSnFR variants. Compartmentalized iGluSnFR expression, perhaps in a subset of neuronal membranes, might reduce the buffering effect but likely would not produce faster signals that more closely approximated the native glutamate clearance time course. Despite these caveats regarding time course, multi-synapse simulations suggest that glutamate indicators provide a linear readout of the number of activated synapses.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Indicator expression levels influence glutamate uptake and iGluSnFR signal time courses</title><p>Our simulations and experiments clearly indicate that the buffering effects and slowed glutamate clearance depend strongly on the expression levels of iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), potentially complicating comparison of iGluSnFR signals across brain regions. For example, a recent report indicates that iGluSnFR signals are faster in the hippocampus than the cortex, suggesting that glutamate uptake in the hippocampus is more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pinky et al., 2018</xref>). Absent other considerations, these differences could reflect differences in iGluSnFR expression rather than uptake capacity, that is it may be that iGluSnFR is simply expressed more densely in the cortex, thereby slowing iGluSnFR signals recorded there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In this particular case, however, STCs are also faster in hippocampus than cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanson et al., 2015</xref>), providing a second, complementary test that corroborates the first. Importantly, these STC recordings were made from astrocytes in the <italic>absence</italic> of iGluSnFR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanson et al., 2015</xref>). Our simulations and experiments indicate that STCs recorded in iGluSnFR<sup>+</sup> tissue also are slowed relative to control, potentially providing a misleading agreement between STCs and iGluSnFR fluorescence signals. These results also suggest that iGlu variants optimized for increased expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marvin et al., 2018</xref>), actually may disrupt glutamatergic signaling even more.</p><p>iGluSnFR concentration is likely the most critical parameter in our simulations that is not constrained in some way by experimental data. The actual effective concentration likely varies widely due to differences in brain region, expression system, promotor and indicator subtype. Biochemical measures may overestimate this parameter by including protein that is not expressed in the plasma membrane, and immunohistochemistry cannot distinguish what fraction of molecules on the cell surface is active. In the case of EAATs, quantitative immunoblotting revealed extremely high endogenous expression of EAAT1 and EAAT2 in the hippocampus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehre and Danbolt, 1998</xref>), and postembedding immunoelectron microscopy indicated that most EAATs are localized to astrocytic plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhry et al., 1995</xref>). EAAT expression is particularly dense in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehre et al., 1995</xref>), exceeding 10,000 monomers per μm<sup>2</sup> of astroglial plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehre and Danbolt, 1998</xref>). It is, admittedly, remarkable that iGluSnFR might be expressed at even higher levels, as predicted by our simulations. It is also unknown whether iGluSnFR expression in astrocytes might come at the expense of surface EAAT expression, although cortical astrocyte STCs recorded from tissue in which iGluSnFR is expressed in neurons are similar in waveform to those recorded here in iGluSnFR-expressing astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; M.

To examine what kinetic properties would yield the best performance, we combined the most advantageous kinetic properties of iGlus into one hypothetical indicator (FrankenSnFR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). A fast unbinding rate (k<sub>-1</sub>) ensures rapid deactivation but necessitates a fast binding rate (k<sub>+1</sub>) to maintain suitably high affinity and rapid responses at low expression levels. Both the entry and exit from the activated state (k<sub>+2</sub> and k<sub>-2</sub>, respectively) must be fast to preserve rapid signal onset and cessation, and k<sub>+2</sub> must be significantly greater than k<sub>-2</sub> to achieve a high maximal activation probability (P<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>+2</sub>/[k<sub>+2</sub> + k<sub>-2</sub>]). Combining these features created an indicator that activated and deactivated rapidly, bound glutamate with high affinity (k<sub>d</sub> = 71 μM, EC<sub>50</sub> = 15 μM) and exhibited high P<sub>max</sub> (0.77; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B–D</xref>).

Once a whole-cell recording was established, cells were confirmed as astrocytes based on their passive membrane properties, low membrane resistance, and hyperpolarized resting membrane potential.</p><p>100 μs stimulus pulses were generated every 15 s with a stimulus isolator (ISO-Flex, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel). Stimulus intensity was set at 2 times the resolvable threshold stimulation. Simultaneous electrophysiology and iGluSnFR imaging were performed in a subset of cells. Imaging was performed using a Prime95b (Teledyne Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) camera with a 200 Hz frame rate, illuminated by a CoolLED illuminator and GFP filter cube (Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT) and controlled by MicroManager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>) with a 60× water immersion objective (LUMPLANFL, Olympus, Waltham, MA) on an Olympus/Prior Openscope microscope.

For astrocyte synaptic transporter current recordings, 4–12 sweeps were averaged and normalized, and the decay of the glutamate transporter current was fit with a mono-exponential function (plus <italic>y</italic> offset) to quantify glutamate uptake kinetics (fitting region was 18–148 ms post-stimulus). For iGluSnFR imaging, 10 repeated runs of identical stimulation were averaged together and decays were fit with a bi-exponential function (decay + bleaching).</p><p>Absolute time courses of STCs and iGluSnFR signals were not compared between the single- and double infection data sets because the control STCs in the hSyn-EGFP/GfaABC1 D-tdTomato mice were significantly faster (τ<sub>decay</sub> = 9.8 ± 2.3 ms, mean ± SD, n = 13) than those in the GfaABC1D-tdTomato mice (16.0 ± 3.6 ms, n = 15; <italic>t</italic>(25.8) = 4.9, p=4.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test). The reason for this difference is unclear. It seems unlikely that expression of a second virus in neurons accelerated glutamate uptake in glia, but it is possible that some undetected difference in recording conditions caused a change in STC and iGluSnFR time courses. Another, perhaps most likely reason, may be that the double-infection experiments were performed on C57Bl/6 mice newly acquired from Jackson Labs, whereas the single infection experiments were performed on C57Bl/6 mice bred in-house. Whatever the cause, the time courses were consistent within each data set, so in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref> the STC and iGluSnFR signal decays were normalized to the control STC decays in each data set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Simulations</title><p>Transmitter diffusion, uptake and glutamate indicator activation were simulated using an expanded version of a previous model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond, 2005</xref>) written in MATLAB.

At each time step Δt = 1 µs (Δt = 0.5 or 2 µs yielded similar results), each glutamate molecule was displaced in each spatial dimension by a distance r randomly selected from a normal distribution about zero (average r<sup>2</sup> = 2DΔt; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hille, 1984</xref>, where D (the diffusion coefficient)=0.253 µs<sup>2</sup> ms<sup>−1</sup> in extracellular fluid at 25°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Longsworth, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nielsen et al., 2004</xref>). Diffusion within the synaptic cleft was limited to two (<italic>x,y</italic>) dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbour and Häusser, 1997</xref>); extrasynaptic diffusion was modeled three-dimensionally through an isotropic extrasynaptic space (extracellular volume fraction = 0.21). D in all spaces was reduced further to account for tortuosity of the extracellular space (D<sup>*</sup>=D/λ<sup>2</sup>; λ = 1.55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998</xref>; eliminating tortuosity within the synaptic cleft did not affect the results significantly). For multi-synapse simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), synapses were modeled as point sources within isotropic extracellular space. Control simulations confirmed that removal of the synaptic cleft had little effect on the simulated iGluSnFR waveform for ROIs &gt; 2 μm radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Transporters were modeled using a Markov representation of EAAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), with two simplifying modifications: The extracellular transporter was configured to bind H<sup>+</sup> prior before glutamate, rather than allowing either to bind first, and the T<sub>i</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>⇋T<sub>o</sub>Na<sub>2</sub> transition was eliminated. Once all the transported elements unbound on the intracellular side, the glutamate molecule was designated as taken up and removed from the simulation and the transporter returned to the unbound, outward facing state at a rate corresponding to physiological measured recovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles et al., 2002</xref>). Substrate concentrations other than [glu]<sub>o</sub> were assumed constant. Simulated STC waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,J</xref>) reflected the stoichiometric current in the model (+one for forward transitions 1, 7 and 9,–1 for forward transition 15 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles et al., 2002</xref>). Voltage-dependent rates were calculated at −95 mV (similar results were observed at −70 mV, data not shown). iGluSnFR kinetics were implemented according to a simple three-state model: bound, unbound, and fluorescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helassa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular space was partitioned transparently into 10-nm-think concentric spherical shells (single-synapse simulations) or 100 × 100 × 100 nm<sup>3</sup> cubes (multi-synapse simulations) so that local transporter, iGluSnFR and glutamate concentration could be determined. At each time step, the probability of binding to a transporter or iGluSnFR was determined independently for each glutamate molecule as follows: First, the EAAT2 and iGluSnFR glutamate binding rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helassa et al., 2018</xref>) were multiplied by the time step, the glutamate concentration in the relevant shell/cube and the number of transporter/iGluSnFR molecules in the shell/cube, to give the number of transporters/iGluSnFRs bound in the time step, and then divided by the number of glutamate molecules in the shell/cube to yield the probability that a particular glutamate molecule would bind. If binding occurred (i.e. if a random number between 0 and 1 was less than the binding probability), the number of free transporter/iGluSnFR molecules in the cell was decremented. Once bound, the glutamate molecule underwent probabilistic transitions in subsequent time steps through the Markov schemes. Because transporters and iGluSnFRs were modeled explicitly only upon binding an individual glutamate molecule, the number of simulated transporters/iGluSnFRs was limited by the relatively low number (5000–75,000) of glutamate molecules simulated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the NIH (NS113499, NS104478, NS100796 to CGD) and the NINDS Intramural Research Program (NS003039 to JSD).

Despite the ability of these tools to accelerate scientific progress, the consequences of their introduction into a functioning organism are often overlooked. The authors here present a comprehensive overview of the consequences of iGluSnFR (genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate indicator) expression on glutamate handling in the synaptic cleft. Because iGluSnFR can expressed at very high concentrations, it represents a very significant glutamate buffer. This will slow glutamate-driven processes. Thus, both glutamate transporter currents and optical readouts will be slowed. This manuscript combines physiology and computational modeling to demonstrate this important confound that must be considered when using this and other sensor tools.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript details a number of effects that could and probably already have led to misinterpretations of glutamate-signalling processes probed with iGluSnFR. Both reviewers were convinced by the results which nicely complement experimental and theoretical approaches. The manuscript could be strengthened by additional biological experiments or additional discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Potential improvements include the following:</p><p>– Varying the expression level of iGlu for comparison in cortical astrocytes would further complement the model simulations. For example, the authors could inject at a higher (or lower) viral titre initially and compare uptake kinetics at day 21-28 post surgery.</p><p>– The relative ratio of iGlu and EAATs is likely a crucial component of glutamate clearance. Based on the ephys results, can the authors predict whether there is an upregulation of EAAT expression in response to iGlu expression (i.e., what is the difference in resting membrane potential in iGlu+ astrocytes due to)?

We chose to increase the effective iGluSnFR expression rather than decrease it, because our iGluSnFR signals are already on the fast end of the published range using large-scale imaging methods, suggesting relatively low expression. In one group of animals, iGluSnFR was expressed under control of the hSyn (neuronal) and GFAP (primarily glial) promoters. Another control group was infected with hSynEGFP and GfaABC1D -tdTomato (GfaABC1D is a slightly abbreviated version of the GFAP promoter). As predicted by our simulations, iGluSnFr expression slowed STCs to a greater degree, compared with controls, when iGluSnFr was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes as compared to when iGluSnFr was expressed in astrocytes alone (new Figure 4).</p><p>We did not directly compare the absolute time courses of STCs or iGluSnFR signals between the single- and double infection data sets because the control STCs in the hSyn-EGFP/GfaABC1D-tdTomato mice were significantly faster (τ<sub>decay</sub> = 9.8 ± 2.3 ms, mean ± SD, n=13 ) than those in the previous single-infection data set (16.0 ± 3.6 ms, n=15, <italic>p</italic>=4.4×10<sup>-5</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test). In the Materials and methods, we consider three possible explanations:</p><p>1) The addition of a second virus to target neurons may have caused glutamate uptake to be accelerated in glia. We think this possibility is unlikely.</p><p>2) Although we carefully maintained similar superfusion environments in the two sets of experiments, the second set of experiments may nonetheless have been performed under some slightly different condition that gave rise to faster STC and iGluSnFR time courses.</p><p>3) To complete these experiments within the time frame prescribed by the editors, we ordered appropriately aged C57Bl/6 mice from Jackson labs for the double infection experiments, whereas the previous single-infection experiments were performed with an inhouse C57Bl/6 line. Despite being genetically similar, these new mice may have exhibit faster uptake kinetics.</p><p>We favor the third possibility but, in any case, the time courses were consistent within each data set, so we have chosen to normalize the STC and iGluSnFR signal time courses to the control STC decays in each data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The relative ratio of iGlu and EAATs is likely a crucial component of glutamate clearance.

First, as now noted in the Results, astrocyte RMP in P21 astrocytes was not substantially different in WT (-73.6 ± 1.7 mV n=12), EAAT1<sup>+/-</sup> (-74.2 ± 1.6 mV; n=17; <italic>p</italic>=0.96 compared to WT) and EAAT2<sup>+/-</sup> (-71.4 ± 1.5 mV; n=12; <italic>p</italic>=0.35 compared to WT) animals (J. Shih and C. Dulla personal communication). This comparison is analogous to experiments in which transporter function is reduced pharmacologically. (For the reasons highlighted in the new Figure 6, we consider it problematic to evaluate the effects of completely blocking transporters.) In addition, astrocyte RMP was not substantially different in control astrocytes (from hSyn/EGFP/ GfaABC1DtdTomato mice) and in astrocytes from hSyn-iGluSnFR/GFAP-iGluSnFR animals (control: -72.4 ± 1.4 mV, n=18; iGluSnFr -71.5 ± 1.3 mV n=20; <italic>p</italic>=0.66, <italic>t</italic>-test). These issues are now considered in the Results along with the rest of the data in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How might the prolongation of excitatory neurotransmission with iGlu's affect the activation of different subsets of glutamate receptors, i.e., NMDA/AMPA during the time course in the cleft? Relatedly, what is known regarding the potential excitotoxic effects of iGlu overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>We know of no excitotoxic effects of iGluSnFR expression in the literature. New simulations suggest that iGluSnFR expression likely reduces pathological activation of glutamate receptors that could lead to excitotoxicity (Figure 3). If anything, then, iGluSnFR may be neuroprotective. There is, of course, the possibility that AAV expression causes the tissue to become unhealthy, but we controlled for this by comparing between iGluSnFR<sup>+</sup> and tdTomato<sup>+</sup> astrocytes.</p><p>We now include simulations suggesting that glial iGluSnFR expression does not affect the glutamate time course or receptor activation in the cleft (processes controlled predominantly by diffusion), and the rapid diffusion, dilution and clearance of glutamate predicts little AMPAR or NMDAR activation beyond the cleft in which glutamate is released (new Figure 3). These simulations do suggest, however, that glial iGluSnFR expression may reduce perisynaptic mGluR activation (new Figure 3B<italic>v</italic>), potentially influencing homosynaptic modulation.</p><p>In addition, we have performed simulations in which iGluSnFR is present in the synaptic cleft as well as extrasynaptic regions. We find that iGluSnFR in the cleft does not substantially affect synaptic receptor activation (Figure 3D).</p><p>The rapid glutamate dilution and limited extrasynaptic receptor activation in our simulations are consistent with previous work (Wahl et al., 1996; Barbour, 2001). We employed an experimentally verified diffusion coefficient (Nielsen et al., 2004), but we wanted to ensure that our simulation results did not depend critically on this parameter. We therefore repeated simulations with a five-fold lower diffusion coefficient (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). As expected, slower diffusion led to slower dilution and enhanced receptor activation in the synaptic cleft and perisynaptically, but the effects of iGluSnFR on receptor activation remained the same. In addition, this change in glutamate diffusion coefficient caused only very minor changes in simulated iGluSnFR signals or uptake time course (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E).</p></body></sub-article></article>
