contribute to the functions of the ubiquitous class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms, p110α and p110β. We found that p110β localizes to membrane rafts in a Rac1-dependent manner. This localization potentiates Akt activation by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus genetic targeting of a Rac1 binding-deficient allele of p110β to rafts alleviated the requirement for p110β-Rac1 association for GPCR signaling, cell growth and migration. In contrast, p110α, which does not play a physiological role in GPCR signaling, is found to reside in nonraft regions of the plasma membrane. Raft targeting of p110α allowed its EGFR-mediated activation by GPCRs. Notably, p110β dependent, PTEN null tumor cells critically rely upon raft-associated PI3K activity. Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic account of how membrane raft localization regulates differential activation of distinct PI3K isoforms and offer insight into why PTEN-deficient cancers depend on p110β.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17635.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17635.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PI3K signaling</kwd><kwd>Rac1</kwd><kwd>PTEN loss</kwd><kwd>GPCR signaling</kwd><kwd>membrane microdomains</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 CA168504-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jean J</given-names></name><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 CA165962-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jean J</given-names></name><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA172461-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009730</institution-id><institution>Stand Up To Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Translational Research Grant SU2C-AACR-DT0209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jean J</given-names></name><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-CA50661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA30002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A unique two-step mechanism of plasma membrane recruitment and activation governs G-protein-coupled receptor mediated PI3K signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been widely studied as a major regulator of cellular proliferation, metabolism and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fruman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cain and Ridley, 2009</xref>). PI3Ks catalyze phosphorylation of the 3’OH group on phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane, which induces translocation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. Once recruited to the plasma membrane, Akt becomes activated by PDK1 and mTOR2 dependent phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). Activation of PI3K signaling frequently occurs in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The PI3Ks are organized into three classes based on their structural similarities and mechanism of activation. The most extensively studied class I PI3Ks are activated by growth factor receptors. Of these, class IA enzymes are activated via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), small G-proteins and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and PI3K signaling is functionally antagonized by the PIP<sub>3</sub> degrading PI3 phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sang et al., 2012</xref>). p110α and p110β are the catalytic class IA isoforms with a ubiquitous expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia et al., 2009</xref>). Heterodimerization with the regulatory p85 subunit stabilizes p110 isoforms but at the same time keeps their kinase activity in check through inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Although both p110α and p110β form heterodimers with p85 and catalyze the same biochemical reaction upon activation, studies have indicated that they have distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foukas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guillermet-Guibert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). p110α appears to mediate bulk of PI3K signaling downstream of RTKs whereas p110β preferentially signals downstream of GPCRs. Notably p110α and β isoforms are involved in mutually exclusive signaling complexes with distinct members of small GTPase protein superfamily, Ras and Rac1 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fritsch et al., 2013</xref>). However, we are far from a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that account for the full spectrum of their functional differences.</p><p>In cancer, p110α is the main isoform required for transformation by oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>) and the encoding <italic>PIK3CA</italic> is frequently found to have suffered from one of two common activating hotspot mutations in many tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Samuels et al., 2004</xref>). This reliance of tumors on p110α may be partially explained by the fact that it has much higher specific activity compared to p110β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knight et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed in a GEM model of breast cancer driven by Her2, knockout of p110α blocked tumor formation while knockout p110β actually caused tumors to develop more quickly- a surprising result explained by a competition model where the less active p110β binds to the same limiting number of p85/p110 binding sites on Her2 and thus actually lowers signaling output compared to the case where only p110α is expressed and hence can bind to all of the PI3K binding sites on the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Utermark et al., 2012</xref>). Notably tumors that have lost expression of PTEN are largely dependent on p110β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wee et al., 2008</xref>), an unexpected outcome given its weaker kinase activity. While it is possible that some loss of PTEN tumors feature activation of GPCRs thus explaining their p110β dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodriguez et al., 2016</xref>), that does not appear to be a unifying theme.</p><p>The plasma membrane is the site of activation for numerous signaling cascades, and its organizing principles contribute to the specificity and potency of these sequences of biochemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusumi et al., 2012</xref>). The lipid raft hypothesis proposes that the preferential association among sphingolipids, sterols, and specific proteins confers upon the lipid bilayer the potential for lateral segregation of key signaling molecules, dramatically transforming the cell membrane from a passive bystander to a dynamic entity facilitating signaling through subcompartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lingwood and Simons, 2010</xref>). Sphingolipid and cholesterol enriched membrane rafts play a key signaling role in T cell activation via the T cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaus et al., 2005</xref>), B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gupta and DeFranco, 2007</xref>), focal adhesions, cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaus et al., 2006</xref>), membrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Meer et al., 1987</xref>) and hormone signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Márquez et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data implicate involvement of raft nanodomains in recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane upon PIP<sub>3</sub> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lasserre et al., 2008</xref>), and FRET-based Akt activity reporters uncovered a preferential activation of Akt in membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao and Zhang, 2008</xref>). On the other hand PTEN was shown to localize selectively to nonraft membrane microdomains in human embryonic kidney cells, possibly further restricting Akt activation in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2011</xref>). However, although membrane microdomain compartmentalization is believed to be a crucial mechanism for achieving signaling specificity, the role of spatial partitioning in class IA PI3K signaling has remained elusive.</p><p>To address these questions, we combined simultaneous knock-out of p110α and p110β with genetic targeting that enabled us to express unique class IA PI3K isoforms directed to specific plasma membrane microdomains. Using this strategy, we investigated Akt activation, cellular proliferation and migration in response to growth factors, when expression of particular class IA PI3K isoforms was directed to membrane rafts or nonraft regions of the plasma membrane. We found that raft targeting of either p110α or p110β potentiates GPCR mediated activation of Akt. In addition, we determined that p110β required Rac1 binding for raft localization and Gβγ association for activation downstream of GPCRs, whereas raft-targeted p110α was dependent on EGFR activity. Notably we found that PI3K signaling was also dependent on raft integrity in PTEN null cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that any class IA PI3K catalytic isoform, when targeted to GPCR signaling permissive membrane microdomains, could activate Akt and maintain downstream PI3K signaling through distinct mechanisms. Finally, our data has novel implications concerning the optimal methods for inhibiting Akt activation in PTEN null tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of Isogenic MEFs expressing p110α or p110β</title><p>To facilitate the study of the individual p110 isoforms, we first generated immortalized <italic>p110α<sup>flox/flox</sup>; p110β<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

To test whether Rac1 or Gβγ may be responsible for localization of p110β to membrane rafts, we introduced point mutations to p110β that abolish its binding to Rac1 or Gβγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fritsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dbouk et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Starvation and serum or GPCR agonist stimulation experiments demonstrated that although p110β deficient in either Gβγ or Rac1 binding, instigated Akt phosphorylation upon serum stimulation, both were significantly impaired in elevating p-Akt, in response to two GPCR agonists; lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, fractionation of raft versus nonraft membrane microdomains revealed that only p110β-GBM but not p110β-RBM localizes to rafts suggesting that Rac1 binding to p110β might constitute a raft localization signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We next attempted to verify this in HMECs, where p110β could readily be detected in triton resistant membrane fractions. We knocked-down Rac1 expression using Rac1 specific siRNAs and analyzed triton sensitive and resistant membrane microdomains.

Previous reports suggest that GPCR activation can also trigger widespread downstream signaling via modulation of various growth factor receptor pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsieh and Conti, 2005</xref>).

Since p110α has no Gβγ or Rac1 binding site, we hypothesized that GPCR mediated EGFR activity might be critical for raft-localized p110α to modulate Akt function in LPA signaling. To test this idea, we selectively inhibited Gβγ, EGFR or PDGFR with gallein, lapatinib and crenolanib respectively, in serum starved and LPA stimulated p110α-Lyn or p110β-wt DKO add-back MEFs. EGFR activation as well as Akt and the downstream S6 phosphorylations were observed for both MEF lines upon stimulation with LPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

In contrast, Gβγ activity was critical for p110β-wt mediated GPCR signaling while EGFR inhibition had only a modest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 9). Consistent with these results, p110α-Lyn DKO add-back MEFs were more resistant to gallein in cellular proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left), whereas p110β-wt DKO add-backs were refractory to EGFR inhibition by lapatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right). These results suggest that the EGFR activation by LPA stimulated GPCRs is required for raft-localized p110α to promote Akt phosphorylation and activation; whereas the canonical Gβγ pathway was essential for p110β-mediated GPCR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Raft dependent PI3K function is essential for PTEN null cancer cells</title><p>Our results thus far suggest that raft integrity might play a more significant role for p110β dependent signaling. We and others have demonstrated that tumors deficient of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) are often dependent on the p110β isoform. Therefore we employed PTEN intact and PTEN null cancer cell line pairs and attempted to disrupt rafts by inhibiting cholesterol function. First, we treated PTEN positive DU145 and PTEN null PC3 prostate cancer cells with increasing doses of the cholesterol-depleting agent MβCD. PC3 cells were significantly more sensitive to MβCD treatment than DU145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Next we used PTEN wt MCF7 and PTEN null BT549 breast cancer cells to further test our hypothesis. Along the same line, BT549 breast cancer cells were more susceptible to MβCD than MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). As an independent approach, we utilized simvastatin, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step (HMG-CoA to mavelonic acid) in cholesterol biogenesis in order to lower cholesterol levels. Once again, PC3 cells were considerably more sensitive to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis than DU145 cells. A simvastatin concentration of 1 μM was sufficient to potently inhibit proliferation of PC3 cells, which did not impede growth of DU145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Next we treated PTEN wt MCF7 and PTEN null BT549 cells with simvastatin. Treatment of BT549 cells with simvastatin led to a significant impediment of proliferation at 1–2 μM concentrations, which was not growth inhibitory for MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>).

In an attempt to restore PI3K pathway activation, we expressed constitutively active, oncogenic mutants of p110α, H1047R and E545K in PC3 cells. Notably this lead to an activation of Akt as anticipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Next, we treated these cells with the cholesterol-lowering agent, simvastatin. Although control PC3 cells were quite susceptible to simvastatin treatment, PC3-p110α H1047R or E545K expressing cells proliferated more robustly in the presence of previously deleterious doses of the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). A biochemical analysis of these cells showed that Akt activation was repressed in PC3 cells treated with simvastatin and this repression was relieved by p110α-H1047R or E545K expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). These results suggest that raft specific inhibition of PI3K function in PC3 cells can be partially alleviated by expression of constitutively active oncogenic alleles of p110α, which presumably utilize raft independent modes of activation. As a complementary approach, we re-expressed either a wt or a catalytically dead version of human Pten (Pten C124S) in PC3 and BT549 cells. Restoration of wt Pten lead to a reduction in Akt activation as judged by levels of pAkt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>). Interestingly, Pten expressing PC3 and BT549 cells became more resistant to increasing concentrations of simvastatin, while cells expressing Pten C124S were almost as sensitive to simvastatin as the parental cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C,E and F</xref>, E and F). These results are in support of the notion that loss of Pten in certain cancers might lead to a dependence on raft mediated PI3K signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Signal transduction via the PI3K pathway requires a sequence of highly orchestrated molecular events transpiring at the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how local signaling is modulated and how membrane microdomain architecture might influence the signal output. We have used a molecular genetic system that allowed us to express specific membrane-targeted isoforms of either p110α or p110β in an isogenic p110α/p110β DKO background. This genetic system enabled functional comparisons between wild type and membrane-targeted alleles of class IA PI3Ks. Interestingly for p110β, raft targeting alleviates the requirement for Rac1 binding. However, Gβγ association is unable to be rescued by raft targeting. These results indicate that Rac1-p110β interaction may be necessary for localization of p110β to GPCR signaling permissive membrane microdomains, whereas its association with Gβγ remains crucial for the activation of its lipid kinase activity upon ligand binding to GPCRs. Interestingly, even p110α, which is usually unresponsive to GPCR activation, becomes responsive if properly localized. Finally, our data has implications concerning the optimal methods for inhibiting Akt activation in PTEN null cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>Our DKO add-back MEF lines were extremely well behaved when tested by the guidance of existing literature: e.g. they were responsive to the relevant PI3K class IA isoform-specific small molecule inhibitors for both signaling and growth. Our efforts in enriching p110α and p110β in membrane rafts and nonraft regions using targeting sequences derived from the Lyn kinase and Kras were also clearly successful as judged by several means of membrane fractionation. Minimal off-target localization with these p110 constructs might be attributed to the indirect interactions of p85 mediated via its SH2 and/or SH3 domains.</p><p>The resulting targeting constructs were utilized to study the role(s) of microdomain compartmentalization in growth factor signaling. Serum starvation and stimulation experiments revealed that GPCR activation could be communicated to Akt when either p110α or p110β was adequately localized in membrane rafts. One fundamental difference between these PI3Ks however, is in their intrinsic membrane binding properties. p110β, by virtue of its association with Rac1, is naturally localized to membrane rafts. On the other hand, p110α does not reside in rafts under physiological conditions. However, when it is artificially targeted to the rafts, p110α is capable of functioning downstream of GPCRs. Moreover, raft-targeted p110α acts in a redundant manner with p110β in PTEN null PC3 cells.</p><p>While membrane raft localization is essential for p110 activation by GPCRs, whether it occurs via Rac binding for p110β in the physiological case or via a Lyn-tag for p110α, the second step in p110 activation by GPCRs can be more varied. In the physiological case p110β is activated via its interaction with Gβγ. However, we found that EGFR activity is essential for raft-localized p110α mediated Akt phosphorylation. EGFR is enriched in raft fractions, and its activity has been intimately linked to GPCR signaling. LPA stimulation, for instance, was reported to induce EGFR phosphorylation and transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daub et al., 1997</xref>). Membrane bound metalloproteases and non-receptor tyrosine kinases like Src and Pyk2 are implicated in this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prenzel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreev et al., 2001</xref>). Our results suggest that LPA stimulated-EGFR could contribute to activation of raft-localized p110α, whereas the canonical Gβγ association is the prominent form of activation for p110β. However, we cannot rule out a modest contribution of EGFR in raft-localized p110β activation, as we detected residual activation of Akt in cells expressing raft-targeted, Gβγ binding deficient p110β upon LPA treatment. Notably p110β may also be dependent on Rac mediated raft localization for its activation in the non-physiological conditions of PTEN loss. However, in the case of p110β activation in response to PTEN loss yet another mechanism may be involved as the second step in p110β activation- further experimentation will be required to test this point.</p><p>Our findings confirm the existing literature that both Rac1 and Gβγ binding are instrumental for p110 function downstream of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fritsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dbouk et al., 2012</xref>) and allow us to place them in a two-step model for p110 activation. Raft targeting of mutant versions of p110 enabled us to infer that Rac1 binding, at least in a PTEN wild-type setting, is crucial for localization of p110β into signaling permissive membrane microdomains. Gβγ interaction on the other hand, provides the basis for p110β activation upon ligand-induced stimulation of GPCRs. We further verified the involvement of raft microdomains in LPA mediated GPCR signaling via cholesterol deprivation experiments. Cholesterol depletion specifically inhibited activating Akt phosphorylations whereas Erk phosphorylation was largely unaffected. These results indicate that activation of the MAPK signaling cascade by GPCRs is not crucially dependent on raft integrity, reinforcing the notion that critical role of membrane compartmentalization may be unique to PI3K/Akt signaling.</p><p>The higher abundance of PTEN in nonraft membrane regions seen here and in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2011</xref>) might be an important determinant in localizing signaling as it may prevent unnecessary propagation of signaling cascades initiated in rafts to nonraft regions. Thus the reported selective localization of PTEN in nonraft domains suggests that it might exert relatively little control on raft recruitment of p110β and activation of Akt, while preventing the resulting signals from propagating outside raft domains. The elevated signaling potency observed when either p110α or β is targeted to rafts could be explained by a regional lack of PTEN dependent negative regulation. In tumor cells lacking PTEN, such p110β dependent signaling could spread to larger portions of the cells greatly strengthening PI3K signaling. However the fact that p110β signaling in PTEN null cells is still dependent on raft integrity suggests that the second, Rac-independent 'Gβγ like' signal activating p110β is likely to initiate in rafts in the absence of PTEN. We do not feel that this second signal is Gβγ itself in most PTEN null cells as Akt activation is often not blocked by GPCR antagonists.</p><p>Notably we have found that knock down of PTEN in our MEFs does not render their growth dependent on p110β or sensitive to raft disruption suggesting that while PTEN loss may be necessary for p110β activation (in rafts as demonstrated by the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) it is not sufficient. Similarly the Vanhaesebroeck group has found that not all tumors arising in mice with global knockout of a single PTEN allele are dependent on p110β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenjeno et al., 2012</xref>). Thus additional parameters seem to be involved in optimal activation of p110β in a PTEN null setting.</p><p>Use of simvastatin, an FDA approved cholesterol lowering drug, hampered proliferation of PTEN null cancer cells which might pinpoint a plausible 'addiction' of these cancer cells to raft mediated PI3K function. Based on these findings, a combinatorial treatment regimen employing PI3K inhibitors and cholesterol lowering statins might have the potential to treat a broad range of cancers with minimal undesirable side effects.</p><p>In summary, our findings establish a novel distinction between p110α and p110β, and offer new insight into the mechanistic basis of p110 activation by GPCR signaling. Here, we propose that recruitment and activation constitute two distinct steps in PI3K/Akt signaling downstream of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Once properly placed, either p110α or β molecules can be activated via alternative GPCR signaling cascades owing to the versatility of signaling components activated by a liganded GPCR. Our data warrant further work on the role of membrane partitioning in regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and offer novel therapeutic aspects concerning treatment of PTEN null cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vector construction and shRNA sequences</title><p>Lyn and Kras tagged constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao and Zhang, 2008</xref>) were generated by in frame fusion of the N-terminal part of the Lyn kinase (GCIKKSKRKDKD, for myristoylation and palmitoylation) at the 5’ end or the C-terminal part of Kras (KKKKKSKTKCVIM, CAAX motif for prenylation) at the 3’end of a pBABE p110α or p110β vector with an N-terminal HA-tag respectively. p110β Gβγ (K532D/K533D) and Rac1 (S211D/K230A) binding mutants were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, California) and sequence verified.

After centrifugation at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C, the second postnuclear supernatant was combined with the first. 1 ml of 50% Opti-Prep (Sigma) was added to the combined postnuclear supernatants and placed in the bottom of a 5 ml centrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California). 400 μl each of 20%, 17.5%, 15%, 12.5%, 10%, 7.5% and 5% Opti-Prep solutions were poured on top of the lysates. Discontinuous gradients were then centrifuged for 90 min at 100000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C using an SW-55 rotor in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. After centrifugation, 400 μl fractions were collected and distribution of proteins was analyzed by immunobloting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, Pennsylvania) in PBS at RT for 15 min. Coverslips were washed in PBS 3 times for 5 min and blocked in blocking buffer (1xPBS, 5% normal goat serum (Cell Signaling), 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 hr. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1xPBS, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C. Followed by rinsing 3x 5 min with PBS, coverslips were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 1xPBS, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1–2 hr at RT in dark. Cells were then mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold with DAPI (Cell Signaling) mounting medium and imaged with a Nikon TE2000-U epifluorescence microscope with appropriate filters. Corrected total cell membrane fluorescence was determined for p-Akt T308 and p-Akt S473 signals using Image J (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Rabbit anti–p-Akt T308, anti-p-Akt S473 and mouse anti-HA were all from Cell Signaling. Alexa 488 anti–rabbit, Alexa 594 anti–mouse from Invitrogen. Quantifications are average of 3 independent experiments of at least 10 cells per experimental condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cellular proliferation assays</title><p>MEFs were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, New York) at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well. Cancer cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning) at a density of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well. At the indicated time points, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% acetic acid (Fisher), 10% ethanol for 15 min and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet (Sigma), 10% ethanol for 20 min, washed with distilled water and air-dried. Cell-associated dye was extracted with 2 ml of 10% acetic acid for 15 min and the optical density (OD) was measured at 595 nm. Values were normalized to the OD at day 0 or to vehicle treatment at day seven for each sample. Each data point was determined in either duplicates or triplicates. For experiments performed with limited supplementation, DMEM with 2% FBS was used. For experiments with cancer cells, RPMI with 4% FBS was used. Data shown are the mean of at least three independent experiments with standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Activation of simvastatin</title><p>Simvastatin (Sigma) needs to be activated by opening of the lactone ring before use in cell culture. Briefly, four milligrams of simvastatin were dissolved in 0.1 ml of 100% ethanol, with subsequent addition of 0.15 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. The solution was heated at 50°C for 2 hr in a water bath and then neutralized with HCl to pH 7.2. The resulting solution was brought to a final volume with sterile PBS (10 mM), and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Wound healing assays</title><p>Cells were seeded at 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well dishes in DMEM, 8% FBS, incubated for 24 hr then serum-starved for 10 hr. A wound was induced into the cell monolayer using a 200 μl pipette tip. Cells were incubated in DMEM, 2% FBS, at 37°C. In triplicate experiments, wounds were imaged at the indicated time points for 12 hr at 3 positions along each wound. Recovery percentages indicate the percentage ratio of distance traversed by the leading edge of migrating cells to the initial wound, determined with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transwell migration assays</title><p>Cells were seeded in duplicates onto 8-µM PET Transwell migration chambers (Corning) at a density of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in media containing 1% FBS and media containing 4% FBS + 20 μM LPA + 5 µM S1P were placed in the lower chamber as chemoattractant. Cells were allowed to migrate to the lower side of the inserts for 18 hr. Cells which did not migrate, were removed with a cotton swab on the upper side and then the inserts were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% ethanol for 15 min and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet, 10% ethanol for 20 min, washed with distilled water, air-dried and then scanned. Cell-associated dye was then extracted with 2 ml of 10% acetic acid for 15 min and the OD was measured at 595 nm.

Re-expression of Pten lead to a reduction in p-Akt in both PC3 and BT549 cells, whereas expression of a phosphatase-dead version of Pten did not alter levels of p-Akt. Interestingly, restoration of Pten expression rendered PC3 and BT549 cells more resistant to simvastatin treatment. These results complemented the data obtained upon use of oncogenic p110α mutants in simvastatin treated PC3 cells. Both PC3 and BT549 cells could be partially saved from the adverse effects of simvastatin via expression of Pten, which attenuates the activity of Akt that functions downstream of PI3K signaling. These results further corroborated the notion that Pten loss might be critical in lipid raft mediated p110beta activation. You can now find these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We also have followed the reviewers’ suggestions and have employed PTEN silencing in MEFs. These results were surprising to us. According to our western blot analysis, we have obtained 2 MEF lines with near complete knock-out of PTEN. As expected, a significant increase in p-Akt and p-S6 levels were detected accompanying the loss of PTEN expression (Figure A). We used these PTEN knock-down MEF lines alongside with control cells to study phenotypes associated with PI3K inhibition and simvastatin treatment. Initially we treated these cells with isoform specific inhibitors of class IA PI3Ks; BYL719 (a p110α specific inhibitor), KIN193 (a p110β specific inhibitor), CAL101 (a p110δ specific inhibitor) or GDC001 (a pan-PI3K inhibitor). wt MEF cells are inherently more dependent on p110α mediated signaling. A modest concentration of p110α inhibitor (1μM) significantly inhibited cellular growth of exponentially growing cells. Comparable amounts of p110β or p110δ specific inhibitors do not significantly affect cellular growth (Figure B). Of note, knock-down of PTEN with 2 shRNAs did not alter this prevalent isoform dependence. PTEN silenced MEFs are still p110α dependent for growth and do not display a significant growth reduction upon inhibition of p110β or p110δ isoforms. In addition, all these MEF lines were exquisitely sensitive to pan-PI3K inhibition by GDC. We have also verified this biochemically in a short-term inhibitor treatment assay analyzing p-Akt and p-S6 in the same MEF lines. Treatment with BYL719 for 2 hours almost completely wiped out p-Akt or p-S6 in either control or PTEN silenced MEF lines whereas KIN193 displayed a much reduced potency in downregulating Akt and S6 phosphorylations in control or PTEN knock-down MEFs (Figure D). In line with the assays using isoform-specific inhibitors, treatment of either control or PTEN silenced MEFs with simvastatin lead to a similar level of growth inhibition. In brief, PTEN loss in untransformed MEFs rendered them neither p110β dependent nor more sensitive to interference with raft function. These results were indeed intriguing given the strong correlation between PTEN loss and the dependence on the p110β isoform.</p><p>Our data suggest that although PTEN loss may be essential for progression into a more p110β dependent state, it does not seem to be sufficient for this transition. Indeed, in an animal model of prostate tumor formation induced by Pten loss, in only one out of the three mouse prostate lobes ablation of p110β, but not that of p110α, impeded tumorigenesis with a concomitant diminution of Akt phosphorylation (Jia et al. Nature, 2008). The Vanhaesebroeck lab also found tumor formation driven by PTEN loss was not always blocked by ablation of p110β activity in a different GEM model. Clearly, additional parameters seem to be involved in optimal activation of p110β in a PTEN null setting. At the present time we have not incorporated this data into the text – we feel that negative data is not sufficient to make strong inferences. However if the reviewers or editors prefer we are willing to incorporate this data (probably as a point in the Discussion and supplemental figure).</p><p><italic>2) The behavior of p110α when targeted to lipid rafts is interesting, with LPA induced activation being shown to operate via EGFR.

Western blot analysis for Y1068 phosphorylation on EGFR yielded results which were in complete agreement with previous reports describing activatory EGFR phosphorylation in response to LPA. We have now included a p-EGFR panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> displaying corresponding activation of EGFR upon LPA stimulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
