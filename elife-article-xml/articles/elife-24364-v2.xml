in no case is the underlying network structure well understood. Here we examined the circuit anatomy of zebra finch HVC, a cortical region that generates sequences underlying the temporal progression of the song. We combined serial block-face electron microscopy with light microscopy to determine the cell types targeted by HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons, which control song timing. Close to their soma, axons almost exclusively targeted inhibitory interneurons, consistent with what had been found with electrical recordings from pairs of cells. Conversely, far from the soma the targets were mostly other excitatory neurons, about half of these being other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells. Both observations are consistent with the notion that the neural sequences that pace the song are generated by global synaptic chains in HVC embedded within local inhibitory networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24364.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24364.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24364.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For us to interact with the world around us, our brains must plan and execute our movements and behaviors. For instance, although speaking is often quite effortless, it is also remarkably complex; all of the muscles in our vocal cords have to be activated at just the right moments to create words. It remains poorly understood how exactly the brain generates such precise timing signals that enable these movements.</p><p>A specific portion of the songbird brain allows the bird to sing its song, a process that has clear parallels with human speech. Previous work had demonstrated that this region in the bird’s brain acts as a ‘clock’ for singing behavior, with individual brain cells active at just a single moment, or ‘tick’. Little consensus had been reached concerning how this might be achieved.</p><p>Kornfeld, Benezra et al. have now used new anatomical methods to better understand how the songbird clock works. A technique called 3D electron microscopy allowed the connections between the neurons in the clock brain region to be seen directly. This revealed that these neurons form direct connections with each other, which is consistent with the idea that one ‘tick’ can lead to the next and so on, like a series of falling dominoes.</p><p>Several mysteries remain to be resolved by future research. First, the connections that Kornfeld, Benezra et al. found are between cells that are quite distant from each other. This arrangement is fundamentally different from many other brain areas where neighboring cells are thought to work together. Second, although these key brain cells form appropriate connections to act as a clock, it is still not clear whether and how the network uses these connections during singing.</p><p>By resolving these mysteries, we will establish a new framework for understanding how the brain encodes learned motor gestures that may help to spur innovative new approaches for combatting motor-related deficits due to injury or disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24364.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24364.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>), but the network properties that underlie such dynamics are poorly understood. Here we explore the synaptic connections within the zebra finch HVC, which is central to generating the neuronal activity necessary to coordinate activation of vocal muscles during the highly reproducible courtship song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aronov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Long and Fee, 2008</xref>). Song progression is paced by HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons, which project to the primary downstream target area, known as the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). During the song, an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron is either silent or active in the form of a burst of action potentials that occurs at a single precise and cell-specific time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahnloser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Long et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vallentin and Long, 2015</xref>). At any moment, it is estimated that about 200 of these ‘pacer’ neurons are active and can drive the appropriate motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fee et al., 2004</xref>), presumably through a set of specific synaptic connections in RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Markowitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lynch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Picardo et al., 2016</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24364.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of synaptic inputs onto HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> dendrites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A schematic of the songbird brain showing HVC and its two main downstream targets, RA and Area X.

This observation weakened the case for synfire chain-based sequence generation in HVC and sparked the development of alternative hypotheses that do not require direct connections between excitatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yildiz and Kiebel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amador et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong and Abarbanel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rajan et al., 2016</xref>).

Within this volume, 34 somata were positively identified as HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons by the presence of a BDA-derived electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). This number is approximately 14% of the expected value of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> somata (240 ± 28, SEM), given that there are about 40,000 ± 3800 (SEM) HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2002</xref>) and the total HVC volume is 0.35 ± 0.024 mm<sup>3</sup> (n = 14, SEM). For 12 of the 34 labeled HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons, we manually reconstructed (skeletonized) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Helmstaedter et al., 2011</xref>) the dendrite as far as possible. These reconstructions ranged in dendritic path length from 642 µm to 1956 µm (1290 ± 469 µm, mean ± SD) compared with complete LM-based reconstructions (1438 µm to 4819 µm, mean ± SD: 3187 ± 997 µm). Although ~70% (174 out of 248) of dendritic branches reached the boundary of the EM data set and were thus incomplete, 74 branches were completely reconstructed, including their most distal inputs (median ± SD of maximum soma distances: 90.9 ± 8.6 µm and 116.7 ± 29.4 for EM and LM, respectively). Our reconstructions therefore sample the full gamut of input types. While we do not find any variation of the input type with dendritic distance from the soma beyond a distance of 40 microns (see below), it cannot be completely ruled out that a subtle bias exists that lies below our detection threshold but might be discoverable when using larger data volumes.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24364-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24364.009</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Video of a subregion of the acquired SBEM dataset, showing the original data resolution (lossy compression).</title><p>Number of z-sections shown is 100, translating to 2.9 µm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24364.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24364.009</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24364-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24364.010</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Video of a subregion of the acquired SBEM dataset, showing a larger field of view with a BDA-labeled HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> soma (lossy compression).</title><p>Number of z-sections shown is 200, translating to 5.8 µm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24364.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24364.010</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>We started by classifying for one cell all (1,003) incoming synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h</xref>) by visually inspecting their ultrastructural details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gray, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colonnier, 1968</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>).

Inhibitory synapses were significantly enriched near the soma (68 ± 4% of all synapses at most 40 µm from the soma are inhibitory compared to 57 ± 2%, for synapses beyond that distance, mean ± SEM, p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>), an observation also made in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 1994</xref>). To estimate the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses that a single HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron receives on average, we first calculated dendritic synapse densities for all nine analyzed cells separately for asymmetric (0.25 ± 0.02 µm<sup>−1</sup>, mean ± SEM) and for symmetric synapses (0.36 ± 0.02 µm<sup>−1</sup>). To get expected counts per cell, we multiplied these with the full dendritic path length (on average 3.2 mm per neuron), determined from LM reconstructions. Thus, on average well above half of all synapses onto HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> dendrites are symmetric (59%, 1144 ± 429, mean ± SD) and only 41% are asymmetric (786 ± 311) — a surprising dominance of inhibitory inputs that stands in stark contrast to mammalian cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaulieu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>), where the inhibitory synapses are typically found to be at most 20% of the total.</p><p>We next inspected all BDA-labeled dendrites emerging from the 12 aforementioned cells for synapses in which the presynaptic axon was labeled, and thus had to come from other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). We found 44 such homotypic synapses between HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells (see Materials and methods), but they comprise only about 1% among an estimated total of 3817 ± 926 (SD) incoming excitatory synapses. Their median size (0.21 µm<sup>2</sup>) and size variation (first and third quartile: 0.10 µm<sup>2</sup> and 0.48 µm<sup>2</sup>), were statistically indistinguishable from those for all asymmetric synapses (0.17 µm<sup>2</sup>; first and third quartile: 0.08 µm<sup>2</sup> and 0.39 µm<sup>2</sup>, p&gt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). One might be tempted to consider the small number of double-labeled synapses as evidence that HVC<sub>(RA)</sub>-HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> connections are rare. However, BDA labeled only a small fraction (1/7th) of all HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells in our data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>) and even for those, axonal collaterals were often incompletely filled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>), suggesting the probability that a given stretch of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> axon is labeled could be quite small. To estimate this probability, we created a 300-member set of 1 µm<sup>3</sup> cubes randomly placed throughout the SBEM volume and measured the total labeled axonal path length they contained. The value obtained (38.6 µm of labeled axon across 300 cubes) is about 13 times smaller than that expected given an estimate of the combined axonal path length (585.6 m) of all 40,000 HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells. The axonal labeling probability of 7.6 ± 1.6% (SEM, see Materials and methods) in turn implies that the homotypic HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> synapses constitute ~15 ± 4% (SEM) of all excitatory synapses onto HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons.</p><p>We next took a presynaptic perspective to independently estimate the extent of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub>-HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> connectivity and used a transsynaptic tracing scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGuire et al., 1991</xref>) to determine the cell-type of the targets of the outgoing synapses on BDA-labeled axon collaterals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The three main cell types found in HVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kubota and Taniguchi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mooney, 2000</xref>) are easily distinguished in LM: Inhibitory interneurons have smooth dendrites with a nearly complete lack of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mooney, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wild et al., 2005</xref>), and excitatory neurons project to either RA or to the basal ganglia (Area X), with the descending axon clearly recognizable. Even short stretches of dendrite can be reliably ascribed to one of the three types, because the spine density varies widely between but not within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kubota and Taniguchi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mooney, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). Dendrites were largely aspinous (0.01 ± 0.01 spines/µm, mean ± SD) for interneurons, densely covered with spines (0.70 ± 0.13 spines/µm) for HVC<sub>(X)</sub> cells and less so (0.21 ± 0.07 spines/µm) for HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons. This spine density metric correctly classified 17 out of 18 BDA-labeled HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> dendrites in EM as well as 11 inhibitory neurons that had been classified using other morphological characteristics (symmetric synapses and a large soma diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We used this to classify the cell type of postsynaptic dendritic segments (n = 528) transsynaptically traced from nine BDA-labeled axons fully reconstructed in the EM volume. In 41 of 569 cases, the cell type could not be determined. These cases were excluded from further analysis, because the ultrastructure was obstructed by the BDA label (n = 33) or because the recovered dendritic branch was too short (n = 8), see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>.</p><p>When we examined three BDA-stained axons that each emerged from labeled somata in the SBEM dataset (path lengths: 1.37, 0.88, and 0.72 mm), we found that of 121 connections, 115 terminated on dendrites of inhibitory cells but only six onto excitatory cells, four of which being other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This agrees with the high connectivity found for closely spaced HVC<sub>(RA)</sub>-interneuron pairs by electrical recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kosche et al., 2015</xref>) as well as with reports using EM connectomics for other cortical tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bock et al., 2011</xref>). However, at this density, there would only be about 20 homotypic synapses per HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron, which is about six times smaller than our estimate derived from the BDA-labeled inputs onto HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> dendrites.</p><p>We then examined BDA-labeled axon fragments that were 'orphaned' (n = 6, path length: 0.56 ± 0.27 mm, mean ± SD), i.e., could not be traced back to their soma and were therefore likely farther away from it. Three of the fragments were synaptically connected to one of the labeled dendrites and four were partially myelinated. We discovered that the prevalence of synapses onto excitatory neurons, and onto other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells in particular, was much larger for orphaned fragments than for attached axons; increases were 13-fold (HVC<sub>(RA)</sub>-E), from 5.0% (6 out of 121) to 64.6% (263 out of 407), and 11-fold (HVC<sub>(RA)</sub>-HVC<sub>(RA)</sub>), from 3.3% (4 out of 121) to 36.8% (150 out of 407) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> dendrites were often connected by more than one synapse to a labeled axon (17 doubles, 3 triple, and 1 quintuple among 127 analyzed pairs). The much larger (compared to the proximal outputs) fraction of excitatory target cells for the orphans implies that the prevalence of the different target types must depend on the distance from the soma. This would also be consistent with the low connection probability of 0.7% between HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells found in electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kosche et al., 2015</xref>), where the recorded somata are usually less than 200 µm apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mooney and Prather, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), while, as our LM reconstructions show, 56 ± 14% (SD) of the axon collaterals' path lies farther than 200 µm from the soma, with some of them ramifying over the extent of HVC (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24364.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spatial variation of postsynaptic cell type.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SBEM-based reconstructions and synaptic targets for two orphaned axon segments.

Consistent with this, HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> axons in the SBEM data set that were connected to a cell body were much more highly branched (12.4 ± 3.7, mean ± SD, branch points/mm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) than most orphaned axon fragments, with an average of only 4.0 ± 4.3 (mean ± SD) branch points/mm. To obtain a quantitative estimate of the distance to the soma and its uncertainty based on the number of branch nodes on a branch and its length we used both a nearest neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–g</xref>) and a Bayesian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) analysis (for details see Materials and methods). We found that a synapse was much more likely to be connected to another HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell or to a HVC<sub>(X)</sub> neuron rather than to an inhibitory neuron if the synapse was farther away from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The transitions between these regimes may well be gradual: One of the orphaned axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) showed an unusually high branch density (11.4 branch points/mm), suggesting a location close to the soma (16th to 84th percentile: 35.8 to 72.3 µm and also made the majority of its connections (52 of 83, 63%) onto interneurons, twice the fraction seen for the other orphaned axons (32 ± 10%, mean ± SD).</p><p>To rule out the possibility that our findings are due to a selection bias, we estimated the fraction of homotypic synapses for the 59 BDA-labeled axon fragments found in the 300-member set (see above), tracing each fragment from the sampling cube until we found two synapses or reached the data set boundary, and determined the postsynaptic cell types. Out of 105 synapses, 65 targeted interneurons, 22 HVC<sub>(X)</sub> neurons, and 18 other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons. Since there are approximately 1111 ± 513 (SD) outgoing synapses inside HVC for each HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron (given an axon path length of 14.7 mm and a total synapse density of 75.4 synapses/mm), we expect about ~191 ± 88 (SD) homotypic synapses per cell (on average, incoming and outgoing homotypic synapse have to be equal in number), comprising about a quarter (24 ± 4%, SEM) of all incoming excitatory synapses, and nearly half of all outgoing excitatory contacts. The discrepancy between the estimates of the homotypic fraction of incoming excitatory synapses from the dendritic (~15%) and axonal perspective (~24%) might be due to the fact that when counting the number of double labeled synapses, we accepted only those where the labeling of the presynaptic terminal was unambiguous.</p><p>How can we be sure that all or at least most of the orphaned fragments belong to HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons? Since BDA (which is transported in the retrograde direction much more efficiently than anterogradely in all tissues tested, including the zebra finch brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reiner et al., 2000</xref>) was only injected into RA, any labeled axon has to belong to a cell with an axon that connects HVC and RA, as HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> axons do. If there is indeed a substantial number of cells in RA that project to HVC(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roberts et al., 2008</xref>), then it is possible that a substantial fraction of the orphaned axons could originate from those cells. To independently confirm the number of RA<sub>(HVC)</sub> cells, we injected the fluorescent tracer DiI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) into HVC, which heavily labeled the upstream nuclei NIf and Uva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) but yielded only a small number of labeled somata in RA (125, 163, and 171, respectively, in three birds), approximately one for every 200 HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons on average. To account for the density of labeled axon in our EM volume, each those cells would need a total axon path of ~4 m in HVC, which appears unlikely given that the extensively ramifying HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> axons have a length of only ~0.015 m.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that the synaptic architecture in HVC contains a density of connections between HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons that might be sufficient to support a synaptic-chain model, whereby precisely timed sequences of action potential bursts in HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons are generated by a wave of activity propagating via synaptic connections among these neurons without the need for inhibition-mediated propagation of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yildiz and Kiebel, 2011</xref>) or to involve structures outside HVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamaguchi and Mooney, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While we estimate that 25% of excitatory inputs to HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons are homotypic, the sources of the remaining synapses are unknown. It should be a central goal of future efforts to quantify the relative number of connections from these regions (e.g., Uva, NIf, etc.) at the level of single HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons. That said, many of these connections, such as auditory afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vallentin and Long, 2015</xref>), collaterals from HVC<sub>(X)</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scharff et al., 2000</xref>), and descending fibers from NIf are unlikely to play a role in motor patterning, since removal of NIf does not disrupt the song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardin et al., 2005</xref>). The precise role of Uva, a thalamic region also directly projecting to HVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nottebohm et al., 1982</xref>), remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coleman and Vu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the low rates of pairwise connectivity seen in electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mooney and Prather, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kosche et al., 2015</xref>), which previously had been interpreted as evidence against a direct synaptic chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong and Abarbanel, 2016</xref>), are not inconsistent with our estimate that each HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron receives a significant amount of its excitatory input from other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons. The reason is that with the around 200 homotypic inputs per cell, the probability to be connected to any one of around 40,000 HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons can be at most 0.5%. The question remains what fraction of those inputs are true ‘chain’ synapses in that the presynaptic cell’s activity immediately precedes that of the postsynaptic cell, but our study demonstrates that the anatomical substrate for the chain model exists.</p><p>An important next step will be to combine functional imaging with volume EM to directly test whether an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell receives more numerous or stronger direct homotypic inputs from cells that fire immediately prior to its own activity. In fact, a recent study describes how calcium activity can be imaged in the singing bird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Picardo et al., 2016</xref>), a crucial step in that direction. One potential difficulty stems from our finding that HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons preferentially form distal connections, indicating that the timing circuitry in HVC is distributed and therefore requires a large EM volume (as much as 500 million µm<sup>3</sup>, compared to 2 million µm<sup>3</sup> in our volume) for its complete reconstruction. It might take the better part of a year merely to acquire the raw data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schalek et al., 2016</xref>). While even a few years ago it seemed impossible to analyze such an amount of data within a reasonable time frame, recent progress in the automation of segmentation are encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Januszewski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dorkenwald et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that connections near the soma are often onto inhibitory neurons suggests that inhibition plays an important role in sequence generation, which is further supported by the large overall fraction of inhibitory inputs. One function of those inhibitory connections could be to decorrelate excitatory activity in space and time: Not only are nearby HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons rarely connected and thus unable to drive each other, but even when driven by a common input, only the cell(s) with the strongest input(s) will continue to fire in the face of the winner-take-all effect due to the strong reciprocal inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). Winner-take-all behavior is normally associated with certain cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hopfield and Tank, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>), such as decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>). In HVC, it may help to prevent local clusters of activity, which could lead to leakage across different chains passing through adjacent excitatory neurons. An altogether different role for local inhibition may be the improvement of temporal precision by sharpening burst timing through recurrent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hahnloser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Long et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cannon et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition may, furthermore, have a central role in shaping the distance dependency of postsynaptic targets during circuit development without the need for molecular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>). Instead, the architecture we observed may arise naturally from a pattern that initially follows Peters' rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Braitenberg and Schüz, 1998</xref>), which predicts synaptic connections between cell types with intermingled axonal and dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rees et al., 2017</xref>), but is then refined as the interneurons increasingly prevent the co-activation of nearby excitatory cells, thereby destabilizing connections between them while leaving more distant connections intact. Such a preferentially distal connectivity would also favor more widely distributed synaptic chains, which could have the added benefit of relying more on axonal propagation delays for sequence timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Budd et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the observed synaptic architecture shows some resemblance with local inhibitory/excitatory networks linked by long-range excitatory/excitatory connections (coupled winner-take-all modules) that have been shown to make computational models of cortical sequence generation more robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mostafa and Indiveri, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used adult (&gt;90 days post hatch) male zebra finches that were obtained from an outside breeder and maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with a 12/12 hr light/dark schedule.

Axonal boutons and dendritic spines were annotated manually in Amira using high-resolution LM stacks. The location of each bouton or spine was marked in 3D and aligned in Amira to the corresponding branch reconstruction. Spine-densities were calculated for each branch by dividing its total spine count by its path length. Branch nodes (points where the axon bifurcates) were manually located in the reconstructions using Amira. Branch nodes for which one of the daughter branches was &lt;15 µm in length were not included in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histological procedures (EM)</title><p>The bird used for the EM experiments was transcardially perfused in a way that preserves the extracellular space and leads to minimal shrinkage (JK, unpublished observations), by using high pressure and the following fixative solution: 0.07 M sodium cacodylate (Serva, Germany), 140 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde (Serva) added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cragg, 1980</xref>).

BDA-labeled neurons, using the soma as a starting place, were skeletonized within the EM stack in KNOSSOS by an expert annotator, and errors were corrected by the same individual in a second pass, which was also used for synapse annotation. All BDA-labeled axons, including orphaned axons, were traced by at least two independent annotators and discrepancies were resolved by an expert that had not participated in the initial annotation. Synapses on each axon were then labeled (see synapse identification) and proofread by an expert annotator who excluded cases where the BDA-label obscured the ultrastructure. The remaining synapses were used to seed the tracing of the postsynaptic dendrite segment. Annotators were instructed to reconstruct the postsynaptic dendrite to the end of the branch in one direction and to the next main branch point in the other direction. All dendritic-branch tracings were proofread by an expert and only included if at least a minimum path length of 10 µm could be reconstructed. All EM reconstructions were analyzed and visualized with custom Python code using the Mayavi2 (Enthought) library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kornfeld, 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kornfeld, 2017b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>EM synapse annotation</title><p>Synapses were labeled by an expert annotator and classified as symmetric or asymmetric (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Diameters were then converted to areas by assuming a circular synaptic contact.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Classification of postsynaptic cell type</title><p>To estimate dendritic spine density, a stretch of the postsynaptic dendrite (&gt;10 µm) was selected that often included the place where the axon was in contact with the dendrite. We counted as a spine every skeleton branch with a length greater than 1 µm that emerged from the dendritic shaft. Some postsynaptic protrusions found on interneurons contained multiple synapses (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Therefore, spines were defined as receiving no more than one synapse at their ends by three independent annotators. The resulting spine density D<sub>spine</sub> (in µm<sup>−1</sup>) was used to classify the dendritic stretch as belonging to an interneuron (D<sub>spine</sub> &lt; 0.11), HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> (0.11 &lt; D<sub>spine</sub> &lt; 0.46), or HVC<sub>(X)</sub> neuron (0.46 &lt; D<sub>spine</sub>). To detect dendritic reconstructions that were traced from separate synapses but belonged to the same dendrite, we detected overlap between skeletons using the following criterion: a node was considered to overlap another skeleton if it was less the 400 nm from any edge of all other skeletons. Dendritic reconstructions were defined as belonging to the same neuron when at least 25% of their nodes overlapped. Since the postsynaptic dendritic reconstructions were never complete (i.e. only parts of the entire neuron could be reconstructed), our analysis could only positively identify reconstructions as belonging to the same cell. For dendrites that were found to belong to the same cell (grouped together after being traced from different synapses), spine density was averaged before classification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Estimating the axon-to-soma distance</title><p>We used two different ways to estimate the distance between an orphaned branch and its soma from its number of branch nodes inside the EM volume, both based on the LM observation that the density of branch nodes, D<sub>b</sub>, varies with soma distance (r) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Only branches that both entered and left the sampled subvolume were considered (about 95% of the total) because all of the reconstructed orphaned branches in the EM volume also had that property. This was repeated with the origin of the division grid shifted in 10 µm increments along all three axes resulting in 17 × 17 × 8 different divisions for each LM stack.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Karel Svoboda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting paper on the detailed connectivity in HVC, a nucleus in the zebrafish brain that is critical for production of stereotyped song. A subclass of HVC neurons (those that project to RA) produce precise sequences (sequential neural activity patterns) of activity. However, the circuit and network properties underlying sequential activity patterns are not understood. Computational models have focused on local excitation to produce this activity. However, excitatory connections between RA-projecting HVC neurons have been difficult to find in brain slice recordings, arguing against the models. Kornfeld et al. show that proximal axons of RA-projecting HVC neurons synapse onto inhibitory interneurons; in contrast, more distal axonal segments synapse onto excitatory neurons, consistent with chain models.</p><p>This is the first serial EM reconstruction study of songbird brain, and therefore this manuscript could be an important resource for songbird researchers. The paper contains a wealth of anatomical data that will be useful for unraveling the circuit mechanisms underlying sequence generation in this circuit.</p><p>Please revise the paper in response to the points below. Three major points need addressing:</p><p>1) Data resource.</p><p>2) Conceptual issues. Mainly, the reviewers feel that this report has little to say about chain models and alternatives.</p><p>3) Technical issues. Mainly, the classification of symmetric and asymmetric synapses is not well supported.</p><p>Data resource issues:</p><p>The underlying EM data should be shared upon publication. This would be consistent with recent trends in sharing of volume EM data accompanying publication of biological results (Kasthuri et al., 2015; Bock et al., 2011; Takemura et al., 2013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/data-and-software-release">https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/data-and-software-release</ext-link>; and many others at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openconnectomeproject.org/">http://www.openconnectomeproject.org/</ext-link>). Traced skeletons should also be provided.</p><p>Approach: the authors confirmed the morphology of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells by using single-cell labeling and light microscopy (LM). Most (95%) of the dendrites of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells are sufficiently compact to be covered by the image size of the serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) (166 x 166 x 77 μm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p>From a postsynaptic perspective, SBEM revealed that the synapses onto an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell are dominated by inhibitory (symmetric) synapses rather than excitatory (asymmetric) synapses (60%: 40%, main text, sixth paragraph). This fraction is surprising because it is different from results described in the mammalian literature (but see point 1 below). After taking into account the ratio of BDA-labelled (retrogradely labelled) HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells relative to the total number of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells, HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> – HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> connections are estimated to be ~15% of all the excitatory inputs (main text, eighth paragraph) to a single HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell.</p><p>From a presynaptic perspective, the authors also found that the probability of making a connection to another HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron depends on the distance between the presynaptic axon and its cell body of origin. At a short distance (&lt;100μm) from the cell body, most (95%) of the synapses that an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> axon makes are on inhibitory neurons, whereas few (3%) are made on other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells. At greater distances from the soma, the axon tends to make more synapses on other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells (36.7% of its presynaptic axon terminals, main text, eleventh paragraph). On average, the authors estimated that about a quarter (24%) of all incoming excitatory synapses are homotypic (HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> -HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> synapses. The discrepancy between this number and the estimate from post-synaptic side could be due to the difficulty of defining the presynaptic terminal compared to postsynaptic structure.</p><p>Although it was already known that HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells make connection to other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells, the distance dependent connectivity is a novel finding.

Since this is a potential bias in the underlying data, it would not be detected by the verification method, i.e. to have a second expert independently classify synapses to obtain consistent results. Misclassification would be consistent with the surprising finding that these dendrites have unusually high fraction of inhibitory input (~60%). Although it is likely the authors have developed expertise to classify these synapses, despite the above issues, the data presented in the paper are not sufficient to convince the reader. At a minimum, more raw data and examples of classification will need to be shown. If this does not suffice, an independent verification of classification correctness should be devised. For example, axons could be traced from identified excitatory and inhibitory somata in the volume, and the synapses these axons make could be randomly presented for classification to a blinded party.

Most (95%) of the dendrites of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells are sufficiently compact to be covered by the image size of the serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) (166 x 166 x 77 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>).</italic> </p><p><italic>From a postsynaptic perspective, SBEM revealed that the synapses onto an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell are dominated by inhibitory (symmetric) synapses rather than excitatory (asymmetric) synapses (60%: 40%, main text, sixth paragraph). This fraction is surprising because it is different from results described in the mammalian literature (but see point 1 below). After taking into account the ratio of BDA-labelled (retrogradely labelled) HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells relative to the total number of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells, HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> – HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> connections are estimated to be ~15% of all the excitatory inputs (main text, eighth paragraph) to a single HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell.</italic> </p><p><italic>From a presynaptic perspective, the authors also found that the probability of making a connection to another HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron depends on the distance between the presynaptic axon and its cell body of origin. At a short distance (&lt;100μm) from the cell body, most (95%) of the synapses that an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> axon makes are on inhibitory neurons, whereas few (3%) are made on other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells. At greater distances from the soma, the axon tends to make more synapses on other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells (36.7% of its presynaptic axon terminals, main text, eleventh paragraph). On average, the authors estimated that about a quarter (24%) of all incoming excitatory synapses are homotypic (HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> -HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> synapses. The discrepancy between this number and the estimate from post-synaptic side could be due to the difficulty of defining the presynaptic terminal compared to postsynaptic structure.</italic> </p><p><italic>Although it was already known that HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells make connection to other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells, the distance dependent connectivity is a novel finding. This is of interest to those who are interested in the network architecture of HVC.</italic> </p><p>Importantly, the reviewers point out that connectivity between HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons had been already demonstrated, but we should certainly emphasize that the approaches used to test this connectivity (paired intracellular recordings in slices) suggested that it was exceptionally weak. For instance, in an earlier study, only 1 out of 141 HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> pairs were synaptically coupled (Kosche et al., J Neurosci, 2015), which seemed to be inconsistent with the model of a synaptic (or synfire) chain. A major finding of the present study – in addition to the distance dependence – is the fact that each HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron is forming nearly 200 connections onto other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons.</p><p><italic>The core analysis for the distance dependent connectivity is that orphaned axons are further from their parent somata and make a higher proportion of excitatory synapses. This is a one bit analysis, which is ok. Beyond that, the attempts at quantitative analysis using Baysian approaches is not convincing.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a more convincing approach would be to analyze connectivity within a much larger volume in which the distances of each synapse from the soma could be directly measured. However, in our study, we developed an innovative method for exploiting the fact that branching patterns in HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons vary with the distance of a given axonal segment from the cell body. To establish this relationship, we performed the first full reconstructions of the local axonal arbors of HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons and assembled a data set of 15 such cells in light microscopy. We then used this information to perform two separate and independent analyses (a simulation as well as the Bayesian approach) to estimate the distances of our identified (retrogradely labeled) axonal pieces from the cell bodies. Both gave very similar results. We would be grateful if the reviewer could provide us with a more detailed explanation of why he/she doesn’t find our Bayesian approach convincing.</p><p><italic>Major conceptual issue 1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Although the HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> – HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> interaction is the major focus of this paper, the results here show that only a quarter of excitatory inputs onto an HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cell are from other HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> cells.

However, the focus of this study was the connectivity within HVC in light of a whole range of experiments over the years that have suggested that at least the timing within each syllable is generated inside HVC. While studies will undoubtedly attempt to quantify the relative number of connections from other regions (e.g., Uva, NIf, etc.) at the level of single HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neurons, many of these connections, such as auditory afferents (Vallentin and Long, 2015), collaterals from HVC<sub>(X)</sub> neurons (Scharff et al., 2000), and descending fibers from NIf (Cardin et al., 2005) are unlikely to play a role in motor patterning. We now include these points in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Major conceptual issue 2: These results do not serve to support a chain model.

Our finding that excitatory connections are substantially less frequent from the proximal part of the axon provides an explanation for the results of paired electrical recording experiments and suggests a network architecture that combines multiple neural circuit motifs, the lateral inhibition-based winner-take-all circuit and the spatially dispersed chain. It would, of course, be desirable to have a wiring diagram of a large part of HVC together with calcium recordings from a sufficient number of cell to ensure that pairs of cells with closely spaced burst times can be found among them. This is particularly challenging, given that there seems to be little correlation between time and space in HVC. In fact, our findings suggest that cells that fire in succession may be even less likely to be near each other than chance would suggest. We now discuss this problem in the manuscript but the combined activity/connectivity experiment is certainly beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><italic>Out another way.

To address the concerns raised by reviewers, we have included significant new data and analysis. We have now analyzed 50 additional synapses. In short, the reviewers propose an independent verification of the synapse type classification based on cells identified through other means (i.e. somatic and dendritic appearance). We performed this verification of the synapse type classification by randomly sampling 31 synapses from the axons of identified interneurons and 19 synapses from the axons of one HVC<sub>(RA)</sub> neuron (8 synapses) and two HVC<sub>(X)</sub> neurons (11 synapses), and we presented these synapses in a randomized and blind manner to the expert annotator who performed the original classification. All 50 synapses were correctly assigned, confirming our classification approach.
