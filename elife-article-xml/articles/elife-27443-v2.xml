Despite multitudes of theoretical permutations, limited subunit combinations have been identified in the brain.

First, α subunits possess intrinsic signals to segregate into distinct pentamers. Second, γ2 is essential for GABA<sub>A</sub>R assembly with Neuroligin-2 (NL2) and GARLHs, which localize GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at synapses. Third, δ suppresses α6 synaptic localization by preventing assembly with GARLHs/NL2.

In the brain, fast inhibition of synaptic membrane depolarization is mediated principally by the binding of GABA to ionotropic GABA receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), hetero- or homo-pentamers consisting of combinations of six α, three β and ten non-α/β subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olsen and Sieghart, 2008</xref>). While a huge number of permutations are theoretically possible, only a fraction are observed in neural tissues, with just a handful of major GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes dominating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKernan and Whiting, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olsen and Sieghart, 2008</xref>). This preferential subunit assembly results in GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with specialized localization and function. For example, in cerebellar granule cells, α1/β/γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs localize at synapses and mediate phasic inhibition, whereas α6/β/δ-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs localize at extrasynaptic sites and mediate tonic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Günther et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mihalek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nusser et al., 1998</xref>). Beyond these cardinal cases, there are numerous long-standing examples of particular GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes whose subunit compositions, distributions and functions have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fritschy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olsen and Sieghart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sigel and Steinmann, 2012</xref>). For example, the major GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes contain at most one non-α/β subunit, making non-α/β subunits mutually exclusive within a pentamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araujo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jechlinger et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, it remains unclear how the majority of GABA<sub>A</sub>R pentamers incorporate two α subunits of a single isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 1998</xref>), or which non-<underline>α</underline>/β subunit dictates pentamer assembly of each α and β isoform in vivo. Thus, the rules constraining GABA<sub>A</sub>R assembly, and the precise mechanism by which GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtype determines distribution, have not been fully revealed.</p><p>Ion channels often function with auxiliary subunits that modulate localization and/or channel properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jackson and Nicoll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yan and Tomita, 2012</xref>). AMPA receptors form a complex with TARP auxiliary subunits, which are required for AMPA receptor synaptic localization. Similarly, GARLH putative auxiliary subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were recently identified in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamasaki et al., 2017</xref>). GARLHs form complexes with GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and the inhibitory synaptic cell adhesion molecule Neuroligin-2 (NL2), and are essential for synaptic localization and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), but not GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity at the cell surface in primary hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus. Furthermore, synaptic localization of the inhibitory scaffolding molecule gephyrin requires GARLH expression in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamasaki et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, GARLHs play a major role in the synaptic localization and downstream signaling of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. However, the subunit specificity of GABA<sub>A</sub>R assembly with GARLH/NL2 in vivo is not fully understood.</p><p>Here, we aimed to uncover the rules determining which subunits coassemble within a single complex, and which segregate into distinct complexes. To address this question, we examined the formation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and their association with GARLH/NL2 in heterologous cells and in vivo using various knock out mice. Our results reveal three novel assembly rules for GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and GARLH/NL2. First, α1 and α6 subunits possess intrinsic signals to preferentially segregate into distinct pentamers. Second, γ2 is required for native GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to assemble with GARLH/NL2. Third, δ inhibits assembly of α6 with γ2 and thus GARLH/NL2. These findings establish a simple model for restricted combinations of subunits in GABA<sub>A</sub>R pentamers in vivo and reveal an assembly pathway that increases GABA<sub>A</sub>R synaptic targeting and synaptic transmission in the absence of δ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct compositions of GARLHed and GARLHless GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs</title><p>As an in vivo model for GABA<sub>A</sub>R assembly, we focused on cerebellar granule cells, which predominantly express two distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes: α1/β/γ2- and α6/β/δ-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jechlinger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nusser et al., 1999</xref>). We analyzed constituents of native GABA<sub>A</sub>R complexes using blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE). BN-PAGE preserves protein complexes but cannot accurately measure their molecular weights, because in contrast to SDS-PAGE, protein complex structure affects migration on BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schägger et al., 1994</xref>). For example, AMPA receptors lacking their N-terminal domains migrate at 55 kDa on SDS-PAGE, while a tetramer of these subunits migrates at 480 kDa on BN-PAGE, roughly twice the expected 220 kDa for a tetramer of 55 kDa subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We solubilized mouse cerebellar membranes with lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol (MNG), followed by BN-PAGE and western blotting. We found that all δ and most α6 migrated at 480 kDa, whereas nearly all γ2 and most α1 migrated at 720 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By contrast, β2/3 migrated equally at 480 and 720 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the brain, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs assemble with GARLHs and NL2 to form a tripartite complex that migrates at 720 kDa on BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamasaki et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, we found that both GARLH4 and NL2 also co-migrated at 720 kDa. Thus, endogenous GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits segregate into two major complexes—a GARLH/NL2-associated (GARLHed) α1/β/γ2-containing complex migrating at 720 kDa, and a GARLHless α6/β/δ-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R migrating at 480 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27443.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distinct compositions of GARLHed and GARLHless GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</title><p>Cerebellar membranes solubilized with lauryl maltose-neopentyl glycol (MNG) were subjected to BN-PAGE.

We first confirmed assembly in this system of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits α1, β2 and HA-tagged γ2 (HAγ2, in which the HA epitope was inserted after the γ2 signal sequence) by analyzing Triton X-100-solubilized oocyte membranes using BN-PAGE. We observed α1/β2 and α1/β2/HAγ2 hetero-oligomers at 520 kDa, slightly higher than the 480 kDa complex in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This size difference corresponds with differences in the molecular weights of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits expressed in oocytes and in the brain on SDS-PAGE and may be caused by differences in species, alternative splicing or post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamasaki et al., 2017</xref>).

Consistent with this, we found that α1 and α6 preferentially incorporate into GARLHed and GARLHless GABA<sub>A</sub>R complexes, respectively, and thus are largely segregated in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, it is unclear what rule determines α1 and α6 segregation. Because γ2 and δ are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araujo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jechlinger et al., 1998</xref>), one possibility is that preferential assembly of α1 with γ2 and α6 with δ ensures α1/α6 segregation. Alternatively, α1 and α6 may segregate independent of non-α/β subunits. To directly test this, we analyzed assembly of both α isoforms with β2 in the absence of non-α/β subunits using an antibody shift assay. An antibody shift assay is a powerful assay to confirm the existence of a protein in a complex on BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In this method, we pre-incubate lysate with an antibody prior BN-PAGE and western blotting. Antibody-bound complexes will migrate at a higher molecular weight on the BN-PAGE gel, indicating the existence of the antigen in the protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is critical that the antibody for pre-incubation and the antibody for western blotting come from different species, because pre-incubated antibodies can also be detected by the secondary antibody during western blot analysis. We expressed both α isoforms (α1 and HA-tagged α6, permitting use of rabbit anti-α6 and mouse anti-HA antibodies for HAα6 shift and detection, respectively) and β2 subunits. α1 and HAα6 ran as 520 kDa pentamers on BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, first lane). Addition of anti-α6 antibody shifted up only the HAα6 signal, but not the α1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, third lane). Conversely, addition of anti-α1 antibody shifted up only the α1 signal, but not the HAα6 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, second lane). The results indicate that α1 and HAα6 segregate independent of non-α/β subunits when co-expressed with β2, and thus their segregation is encoded by the α subunits themselves.</p><p>To test if this was also true in vivo, we used the antibody shift assay to analyze α1/α6 segregation in cerebellum lacking both the γ2 and δ subunits. Because conventional γ2 knockout (KO) mice show postnatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Günther et al., 1995</xref>), we crossed double conditional <italic>Gabrg2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>/<italic>Gabrd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the <italic>Gabra6</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fünfschilling and Reichardt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Maguire, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schweizer et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (see Materials and methods), resulting in viable γ2/δ granule cell (GC)-specific double knock out (DKO) mice that displayed no changes in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In both control and γ2/δ GC-DKO cerebella, addition of an anti-α1 antibody did not supershift the α6 signal, but did supershift the α1 signal expressing mostly in the Purkinje cells, suggesting that α1 does not incorporate into α6-containing complexes even in the absence of γ2 and δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, in vivo, the segregation of α1 and α6 into distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>R complexes is independent of γ2 and δ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>γ2 is essential for assembly of the native GARLHed GABA<sub>A</sub>R complex</title><p>We next explored the preferential association of γ2 subunits with GARLH/NL2.

By contrast, overall intensity of α1 and β2 signal was not noticeably altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). High-magnification images revealed the doughnut-like structure of cerebellar glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A central hole corresponds to an excitatory input and is surrounded by excitatory synapses on the glomerular interior, while inhibitory inputs form synapses on the glomerular periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jakab and Hámori, 1988</xref>).

The images are representative of three independent experiments. The arrow and arrowhead indicate the GARLHed and GARLHless GABA<sub>A</sub>R, respectively, and antibody-bound complexes are indicated. (<bold>G</bold>) δ suppresses an assembly pathway for α6-containing GARLHed GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. γ2 assembles with α1, β2/3 and GARLH/NL2 to mediate synaptic localization and phasic activation. Normally, δ sequesters α6, thereby suppressing γ2 interaction with α6. α6/δ-containing receptors do not interact with GARLH and neuroligin-2 (NL2), which are required for synaptic localization and phasic activation, and thus α6/δ-containing receptors localize at extrasynaptic sites and mediate tonic activation. In the absence of δ, α6 assembles with γ2, β2/3 and GARLH/NL2 to mediate synaptic localization and phasic activation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-27443-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>We next confirmed that δ is sufficient to inhibit α6 incorporation into γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in heterologous cells. To do this, we first used the antibody shift assay in cRNA-injected oocytes in the absence of GARLH/NL2. When HAα6 was expressed with β2, γ2 and δ, an anti-δ antibody, but not an anti-γ2 antibody, caused HAα6 signal to shift up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating HAα6 oligomerization with δ but not γ2. In contrast, when HAα6 was expressed with β2 and γ2 without δ, the anti-γ2 antibody, but not anti-δ antibody, supershifted the HAα6 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To confirm directly that α6 could incorporate into GARLHed complexes, we expressed combinations of α1, α6, γ2 and δ with both β2 and GARLH4/NL2 in oocytes and analyzed complexes by BN-PAGE. We found that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs associated with GARLH4/NL2, regardless of whether α1 or α6 was expressed, when coexpressed with γ2, but not δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results indicate that δ is sufficient to inhibit the oligomerization of α6 with γ2.</p><p>Finally, we noted that although α1 and α6 preferentially segregate into distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs independent of non-α/β subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), in δ GC-KO cerebella, both α1 and α6 incorporate into GARLHed complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To test if α1 and α6 segregate into distinct GARLHed complexes, we analyzed α1/α6 coassembly in γ2 GC-KO and δ GC-KO cerebella using the antibody shift assay. Addition of an anti-α1 antibody did not supershift α6 signal from GARLHless GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in γ2 GC-KO or from GARLHed complexes in δ GC-KO cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, addition of an anti-α1 antibody shifted up the α1 signal from GARLHed complexes in both cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suggests that α1 and α6 remain largely segregated into separate complexes, even when both assemble with GARLH/NL2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A long-standing question in the field of GABA<sub>A</sub>R biology is the so-called ‘combinatorial principle of receptor construction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnard et al., 1998</xref>): What pentameric arrangements are favored in vivo, and what molecular rules determine these arrangements? This study reveals three novel rules governing the ‘combinatorial principle’ for native GABA<sub>A</sub>R complexes. First, α1and α6 subunits segregate into distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>R pentamers independent of non-α/β subunits. Second, γ2 is required for GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to assemble with GARLH/NL2. Third, δ inhibits the incorporation of α6 into GARLHed complexes by sequestering it into GARLHless GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. These rules reveal the presence of an assembly pathway for α6-containing GARLHed complexes that is normally silenced by δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In the absence of δ, this pathway serves to increase inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2015</xref>) by allowing α6-containing pentamers to assemble with GARLH/NL2 and localize to synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Subunit compositions of distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes</title><p>In theory, a huge number of pentameric arrangements of GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits are possible. Our work reveals rules that help explain both why certain GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes are favored, and why different subunits display distinct subcellular distributions. However, our results don’t explain the atomic principles that must ultimately underlie these rules. For example, we found that intrinsic properties of α1 and α6 ensure their segregation into distinct pentamers independent of non-α/β subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>), but the atomic basis for this segregation was not investigated. The subunit arrangement in the prototypical α1/β2/γ2 pentamer is thought to be β2-α1-β2-α1-γ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baur et al., 2006</xref>). In this case, it remains unclear how one α1 subunit could preferentially recruit another α1 subunit, given the intervening β2 subunit. One possibility is that non-adjacent α1 subunits actually make physical contacts, for example through their intracellular loops located between transmembrane domains 3 and 4. Another possibility is that the identity of each α subunit is conveyed allosterically via the intervening β2 subunit. For the α6/β2/δ pentamer, the situation is slightly different. One model for the subunit order for this pentamer is β2-α6-δ-α6-β2, with δ situated between both α6 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baur et al., 2010</xref>). In this case, it is possible that δ simply recruits both α6 subunits. However, this would still not explain why α6 subunits preferentially coassemble, excluding α1, even in the absence of <underline>δ</underline> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus far, a structural study of a β3 homopentamer lacking intracellular loops has provided critical information regarding the overall channel architecture, as well as atomic resolution descriptions of intersubunit β3-β3 contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</xref>). High-resolution structures of GARLHless and GARLHed GABA<sub>A</sub>R complexes with full-length proteins will ultimately be needed to gain atomic level insight into the assembly rules described here, and to identify domains responsible for α1 and α6 segregation.</p><p>We also found that α6 incorporates into γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, which assemble with GARLH/NL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and localize at synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in δ GC-KO mice. Upregulation of γ2 in conventional δ KO mice was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tretter et al., 2001</xref>), which we also observed in the δ GC-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). α1 and β3 were increased in conventional δ KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tretter et al., 2001</xref>) but were not changed in our cerebellar granule cell-specific δ KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), perhaps because Cre expression under the <italic>Gabra6</italic> promoter is delayed until around P7. In δ GC-KO mice, we also observed an increase in the other essential components of the cerebellar GARLHed GABA<sub>A</sub>R complex, namely GARLH4 and NL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One possibility is that, in the absence of δ, the synthesis of γ2, GARLH4 and NL2 is increased to accommodate α6 that is no longer sequestered by δ. Alternatively, without δ, excess α6 might bind to and stabilize γ2, GARLH4 and/or NL2, thus increasing protein levels independent of changes in synthesis. Further studies will be needed to address these details.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic targeting of α6-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs</title><p>In δ GC-KO mice, α6 associates with γ2, GARLH4 and NL2 and is redistributed to synapses, strongly suggesting that α6 synaptic localization, like α1 synaptic localization, requires γ2 and GARLH4. To test this formally, future studies should assess the ability of α6 to localize to synapses in the absence of γ2 and/or GARLH4 in δ KO mice. Similar to α6, α4 is proposed to localize to extrasynaptic sites and also assembles with δ in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jechlinger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wongsamitkul et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to examine whether, in δ KO mice, α4 also incorporates into GARLHed complexes and is targeted to inhibitory synapses.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with the reported increase in mIPSC sensitivity to furosemide, which preferentially inhibits α6-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, in δ KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2015</xref>). Accardi and colleagues also reported an increase in mIPSC frequency, but not amplitude, in δ KO mice. While increases in mIPSC frequency are sometimes attributed to presynaptic alterations, the authors posited a second possibility, namely that the number of inhibitory synapses is increased in the absence of δ. Given our finding that α1 and α6 segregate into distinct pentamers even in the absence of δ, one possibility is that in δ KO mice, α6-containing pentamers actually localize to and activate a distinct set of inhibitory synapses. Further studies will be needed to address this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Can manipulation of an extrasynaptic subunit modulate synaptic strength?</title><p>The major GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes in the brain accommodate only one non-α/β subunit, and thus incorporation of δ into a pentamer precludes incorporation of γ2 and blocks assembly with GARLH/NL2. This suggests the intriguing hypothesis that changes in δ expression—for example, by ethanol or seizure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cagetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marutha Ravindran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>)—could control the ratio of GARLHed complexes and GARLHless pentamers in vivo, and thus alter inhibitory synaptic strength. Supporting this, a marked increase in α6-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated IPSCs in cerebellar granule cells was observed in δ KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2015</xref>). Were this hypothesis fully substantiated, it would provide an opportunity to pharmacologically control inhibitory transmission by targeting the extrasynaptic δ subunit. Future studies are required to examine δ expression as a potential drug target.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Protein</th><th>RRID</th><th>Species</th><th>Provider</th><th>Cat#</th><th>Epitope (AA)</th><th>Epitope (domain)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GABARβ2/3</td><td>AB_309747</td><td>Mouse</td><td>Millipore</td><td>05–474</td><td>Not specified</td><td>Not specified</td></tr><tr><td>GABARα1</td><td>AB_2108811</td><td>Mouse</td><td>Neuromab</td><td>75–136</td><td>AA355-394</td><td>Cytoplasmic loop (intracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>PSD95</td><td>AB_2307331</td><td>Mouse</td><td>Neuromab</td><td>75–028</td><td>AA77-299</td><td>PDZ1 and 2</td></tr><tr><td>HA</td><td>AB_2314672</td><td>Mouse</td><td>Covance</td><td>MMS-101P</td><td/><td>HA peptide</td></tr><tr><td>GABARα1</td><td>AB_310272</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Millipore</td><td>06–868</td><td>AA1-15 (mature protein)</td><td>NTD (extracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>GABARα6</td><td>AB_11212626</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Millipore</td><td>AB5453</td><td/><td>Cytoplasmic loop (intracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>GABARα6</td><td>AB_2039868</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Alomone</td><td>AGA-004</td><td>AA20-37</td><td>Extracellular</td></tr><tr><td>GABARγ2</td><td>AB_11211236</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Millipore</td><td>AB5559</td><td/><td>Cytoplasmic loop (intracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>GABARδ</td><td>AB_672966</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Millipore</td><td>AB9752</td><td/><td>NTD (extracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>HA</td><td>AB_390918</td><td>Rat</td><td>Roche</td><td>11 867 431 001</td><td/><td>HA peptide</td></tr><tr><td>GARLH4</td><td>N.A.</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Yamasaki et al</td><td>N.A.</td><td>AA195-247</td><td>CTD (Intracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>NL2</td><td>AB_993011</td><td>Rabbit</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>129 202</td><td>AA732-749, AA750-767</td><td>CTD (Intracellular)</td></tr><tr><td>VGAT</td><td>AB_887873</td><td>Guinea pig</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>131 004</td><td>AA2-155</td><td>N-terminus</td></tr><tr><td>GluN1</td><td>AB_396353</td><td>Mouse</td><td>BD Pharmingen</td><td>556308</td><td>AA660-811</td><td>Extracellular</td></tr><tr><td>Gephyrin</td><td>AB_2232546</td><td>Mouse</td><td>Synaptic systems</td><td>147 021</td><td/><td>N-terminus</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gephyrin</td><td valign="top">AB_397930</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">BD Pharmingen</td><td valign="top">610585</td><td valign="top">AA569-726</td><td valign="top">C-terminus</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>GARLH4, NL2 and GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit α1, α6, β2, γ2 and δ cDNAs (Open Biosystems) were cloned into appropriate vectors (pGEM-HE or gateway entry vectors (Invitrogen)).

Only a few of the theoretically possible subunit combinations exist in the brain, but it is largely unresolved how the selection of the receptor components is regulated. The manuscript by Martenson et al., tackles this important question. The authors analyzed both recombinant and native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and antibody-shift assays to unravel which subunits can assemble into a receptor, which subunits exclude each other and which subunits are critical for forming a synaptic complex. They substantiated their findings in cerebellar granule cells genetically manipulated to lack specific receptor subunits. Based on the results, the authors put forward three &quot;assembly rules&quot; for subunits of GABA-A receptors into pentamers with associated auxiliary subunits, that help to explain segregation of subunits between synaptic (phasic inhibition) and extrasynaptic (tonic inhibition) localizations. The conclusions represent a significant and important advance in understanding the assembly of inhibitory receptor complexes. The experiments are logically designed and support the conclusions. However, there are deficits in the analysis of the data and its presentation that must be corrected before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The information provided about methods, replication, and statistics in the figure legends and/or methods section is inadequate in many respects. Each figure legend should list the number of times each experiment was repeated, and a measure of the agreement between repetitions. This is particularly lacking in the methods and legends for figures showing results of BN-PAGE. The methods provide only the general statement that all experiments were replicated. The number of replications should be listed for each part of each experimental figure. For example, the methods do not state, nor do earlier cited papers, how the gels were scanned and how the images were processed. What was the make and model of the scanner? What software was used to adjust the images for printing and to quantify the images?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, an asterisk marks a &quot;non-specific band&quot;. The figure should state the source of the non-specific band. Was it present in a blot of secondary alone? How do the authors know that it is &quot;non-specific?&quot;</p><p>3) It is well established that γ2 is essential for the synaptic localization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Three of the authors of the current manuscript contributed to a 2017 publication identifying GARLHs as GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor components that link the core GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor to NL2 at inhibitory synapses (Yamasaki et al., 2017). Within the earlier study, it was shown that γ2 was required to bridge GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and GARLHs/NL2 upon heterologous expression. In the current work the authors refer to this finding and show that most of the GARLHed complexes in the cerebellum contain γ2 and that a deletion of γ2 in cerebellar granule cells in culture eliminated incorporation of α1 and β2/3 into GARLHed complexes. Furthermore, using γ2 GC-KO mice they provide evidence that γ2 is essential for the synaptic localization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in cerebellar granule cells. However, the γ2 GC-KO mice have been used in the previous study too, and a strongly reduced expression of LH4 and NL2 in cerebellar extracts and of LH4, NL2 and α1 in glomerular postsynapse-enriched fractions has been reported (Yamasaki et al., 2017). The current manuscript should refer to these results as well, e.g. in the sections describing the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 4. The expression levels of LH4 and NL2 in cerebellar granule cell cultures with and without γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) need to be determined and shown. The authors should point out that their conclusion that the association of native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with GARLHs requires γ2 is based on a combination of findings described in the current work and the previous publication (Yamasaki et al., 2017).</p><p>4) The authors show that intrinsic signals in α1 and α6 prevent their incorporation into the same receptor. The authors discuss that it is unclear how these intrinsic signals function since α1 and α6 are separated by β and δ, respectively, within the pentamer. The conclusion that intrinsic properties prevent the two subunits from assembling together is justified. However, to get more insight into the intrinsic signals it would be useful to know if the authors have tried to narrow down regions within α1 and α6 that are involved in the segregation of the subunits.</p><p>The authors provide evidence that γ2 can assemble into α6-containing receptors in the absence of δ and connect them with synapses suggesting that the strength of inhibitory synapses could be regulated by the level of δ expression. It would also be interesting to include data as to whether the effect of δ is specific for α6-containing receptors or whether δ is able to assemble into α1-containing receptors in the absence of γ2. These two sets of experiments will not be required for publication, but the paper would be more interesting if the authors can include such information.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4F</xref> are not quantified. From the images shown in 4B, I had a hard time seeing the changes of alpha1 localization in the gamma2 KO. The Ephys phenotype of the KO is very strong as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The synaptic signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4F</xref> should be quantified. The same is true for the glomerular synaptic images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27443.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The information provided about methods, replication, and statistics in the figure legends and/or methods section is inadequate in many respects.

We consistently observe this band around 100 kDa when analyzing oocyte extracts using SDS-PAGE and western blotting, regardless of the primary antibody used. Thus, the asterisk-marked band reflects an endogenous oocyte protein, and not a heterologously expressed GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit. And we called the band a “non-specific band”.

However, the γ2 GC-KO mice have been used in the previous study too, and a strongly reduced expression of LH4 and NL2 in cerebellar extracts and of LH4, NL2 and α1 in glomerular postsynapse-enriched fractions has been reported (Yamasaki et al., 2017).</italic> </p><p>We wish to thank the reviewers for their careful reading of our previous manuscript (Yamasaki et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>The current manuscript should refer to these results as well, e.g. in the sections describing the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 4.</italic> </p><p>We now refer to the previous results in Yamasaki et al., 2017 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 4.</p><p><italic>The expression levels of LH4 and NL2 in cerebellar granule cell cultures with and without γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) need to be determined and shown.</italic> </p><p>We are willing to do this experiment, which requires P7 pups homozygous for the conditional γ2 allele and carrying a CreERT transgene. Unfortunately, despite multiple attempts at breeding, we have not yet obtained pups of the required genotype, and thus we will not be able to provide this result within the two-month window for revision. We can perform this experiment immediately as soon as the pups become available.</p><p>That said, we feel that the information this experiment would provide is not necessary to draw our current conclusion. The novelty of this figure is the loss of the 720 kDa complex in cerebellar granule cell cultures lacking γ2. This is the first demonstration that γ2 is required for the formation of the 720 kDa complex in vivo. Because the expression levels of LH4 and NL2 in cerebella from adult γ2 knockout mice were already evaluated in Yamasaki et al., 2017, we feel our conclusions are fully supported without the additional experiments requested. Thank you for considering our situation.</p><p><italic>The authors should point out that their conclusion that the association of native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with GARLHs requires γ2 is based on a combination of findings described in the current work and the previous publication (Yamasaki et al., 2017).</italic> </p><p>We now point this out clearly by stating, “Combining our new finding that γ2 is required in vivo for assembling the native GABA<sub>A</sub>R complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) with the finding from Yamasaki et al., 2017 that γ2 is required for reconstituting the native GABA<sub>A</sub>R complex in a heterologous system, we conclude that the association of native GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with GARLHs requires γ2.”</p><p><italic>4) The authors show that intrinsic signals in α1 and α6 prevent their incorporation into the same receptor. The authors discuss that it is unclear how these intrinsic signals function since α1 and α6 are separated by β and δ, respectively, within the pentamer. The conclusion that intrinsic properties prevent the two subunits from assembling together is justified. However, to get more insight into the intrinsic signals it would be useful to know if the authors have tried to narrow down regions within α1 and α6 that are involved in the segregation of the subunits.</italic> </p><p>We have not tried to identify the intrinsic signal domains in α1 and α6. Mapping the regions within α1 and α6 that are involved in the segregation of the subunits using chimeric proteins would provide valuable information. However, interpretations of results using chimeric proteins would be difficult without a high-resolution atomic structure of this complex, because mutations might induce global changes in structure that may cause disruption of the intrinsic signal indirectly. Thus, we left a detailed dissection of the segregation of α1 and α6 for future studies.</p><p> <italic>The authors provide evidence that γ2 can assemble into α6-containing receptors in the absence of δ and connect them with synapses suggesting that the strength of inhibitory synapses could be regulated by the level of δ expression. It would also be interesting to include data as to whether the effect of δ is specific for α6-containing receptors or whether δ is able to assemble into α1-containing receptors in the absence of γ2. These two sets of experiments will not be required for publication, but the paper would be more interesting if the authors can include such information.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. Thank you also for recognizing that, although the experiment would provide valuable information, it is not essential for our main argument. To assess the ability of α1 and δ to interact in the absence of γ2, the best experiment would be an antibody shift analysis using anti-α1 and anti-δ antibodies for shift and western blotting, respectively. Unfortunately, the combination of anti-α1 and anti-δ antibodies showed significant background, a common issue in antibody shift assays on BN-PAGE. Because the result was inconclusive, we did not include it.</p><p> <italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4F</xref> are not quantified. From the images shown in 4B, I had a hard time seeing the changes of alpha1 localization in the gamma2 KO. The Ephys phenotype of the KO is very strong as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. The synaptic signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4F</xref> should be quantified.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this feedback. We have revised the figure according to your comments, and believe the new figure is a substantial improvement over the original. To quantify the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in the same way used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we performed similar experiments and quantified staining usingγ2 KO and Cre-negative control littermates. This result showed a reduction in the co-localization of α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) with VGAT in γ2 GC-KO, suggesting a reduction in synaptic α1 and gephyrin in γ2 KO. In addition, α1 colocalized more frequently with the glomeruli marker GluN1 in the cerebellar granular layer of γ2 GC-KO, whereas gephyrin co-localization with GluN1 was reduced. This result suggests that, in γ2 GC-KO, α1 redistributes diffusely on the cerebellar glomeruli, whereas gephyrin partly redistributes outside the glomeruli.</p><p><italic>The same is true for the glomerular synaptic images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic></p><p>Supplemented comment (provided after an author query): &quot;<italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the intensity of a6 signal is reduced in the delta KO.

This conclusion is independent of the absolute expression level of α6. Perhaps, the label on Y-axis of this figure in the original manuscript was not clear. We revised the Y-axis label as “Fraction of α6 colocalized with VGAT.”</p><p><italic>From these images, it appears that the amount of a6 receptors apposing the VGAT positive presynaptic terminals is similar if not reduced in the delta KO.

Thus, we are not able to compare the absolute signal intensity of α6 colocalized with VGAT between control and δ GC-KO mice in a confident manner. Instead, we used the Mander’s colocalization coefficient (Dunn, Kamocka, and McDonald, 2011; Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006) to assess the fraction of total α6 signal colocalized with VGAT. Importantly, no method is available to derive IPSC frequency from synaptic clustering detected by immunohistochemistry. The point of this figure is that α6 localizes to synapses more than extrasynaptic sites in δ GC-KO mice. This finding is totally novel.</p></body></sub-article></article>
