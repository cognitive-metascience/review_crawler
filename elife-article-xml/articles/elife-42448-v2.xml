understood. Here high-resolution quantitative imaging, bioenergetics measurements and mitochondrial membrane potential- and redox-sensitive dyes are used to define RSV’s impact on host mitochondria for the first time, delineating RSV-induced microtubule/dynein-dependent mitochondrial perinuclear clustering, and translocation towards the microtubule-organizing centre. These changes are concomitant with impaired mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Strikingly, agents that target microtubule integrity the dynein motor protein, or inhibit mitochondrial ROS production strongly suppresses RSV virus production, including in a mouse model with concomitantly reduced virus-induced lung inflammation. The results establish RSV’s unique ability to co-opt host cell mitochondria to facilitate viral infection, revealing the RSV-mitochondrial interface for the first time as a viable target for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>respiratory syncytial virus</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1002486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jans</surname><given-names>David Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1043511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jans</surname><given-names>David Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1103050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jans</surname><given-names>David Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RSV's unique ability to co-opt host cell mitochondria to facilitate viral infection reveals the RSV-mitochondrial interface as a viable target for therapeutic intervention.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an enveloped RNA virus of the <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family, is a leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and a potent respiratory pathogen in elderly and immunosuppressed adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nair et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hall et al., 2009</xref>), leading to more deaths each year worldwide than influenza. Despite this, there are no effective anti-RSV therapeutics generally available, with palivizumab (Synagis) and ribavirin the only approved agents as a prophylactic and therapeutic, respectively, for high-risk patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hurwitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hebert and Guglielmo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Resch, 2017</xref>). Like all pneumoviruses, RSV replicates in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2013</xref>), but specific interaction with host cell organelles, and the mitochondria in particular, has remained largely unexplored. Unbiased discovery studies capitalising on quantitative proteomic protocols to identify changes in protein levels upon RSV infection have revealed a significant impact on the abundance of a number of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Munday et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Diepen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kipper et al., 2015</xref>), including respiratory complex I proteins, outer mitochondrial membrane complex subunits, voltage-dependent anion channel protein, and the prohibitin subunits that play essential roles in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, morphology and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kipper et al., 2015</xref>). The implication is that RSV may have the capacity to impact host cell mitochondrial activities, and in keeping with this, we recently were able to document changes in mitochondrial morphology during RSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria are integral to ATP production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in eukaryotic cells. Oxidative phosphorylation driven by ATP synthase/complex V and the electron transport chain (complexes I-IV) is responsible for up to 90% of cellular ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schertl and Braun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letts et al., 2016</xref>). The electron transport chain carries out a series of redox reactions, which are tightly coupled to the generation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) through proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schertl and Braun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letts et al., 2016</xref>). ROS arising from incomplete electron transfer across complexes I and III are generally cleared by intracellular antioxidant enzymes under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schertl and Braun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letts et al., 2016</xref>), but oxidative stress can occur when ROS production exceeds antioxidant capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin and Beal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>). Changes in cytoskeletal organization and/or motor activities can impact mitochondrial distribution and function because mitochondria are trafficked intracellularly through the action of molecular motors operating on microtubules and actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hancock, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here the RSV-host interface at the level of mitochondrial organization and function is interrogated in detail for the first time. A unique combination of redox/membrane potential-sensitive/ratiometric dyes, direct bioenergetics analyses, and high-resolution quantitative imaging/flow cytometric analysis is used to demonstrate that RSV drives a staged redistribution of mitochondria in microtubule- and dynein-dependent fashion, concomitant with compromised mitochondrial respiration in infected cells. Inhibiting RSV-induced changes in mitochondrial distribution both restores mitochondrial respiration, and can protect against RSV infection. Further, we show that RSV’s effects on the mitochondria result in enhanced mitochondrial ROS production; importantly, blocking mitochondrial ROS with a specific inhibitor significantly reduces RSV replication and titers, and alleviates RSV-induced inflammation in a mouse model. The results highlight RSV’s ability to co-opt the host cell mitochondria to enhance mitochondrial ROS to facilitate virus production, and establish it for the first time as a viable target for future anti-RSV strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RSV infection drives mitochondrial perinuclear clustering and redistribution of mitochondria towards the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC)</title><p>Building on our preliminary observations of altered mitochondrial morphology in RSV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), we first performed high resolution Airyscan CLSM imaging of mitochondria in RSV-infected cells at 8 hr post-infection (p.i.)

This asymmetric distribution was confirmed by our quantitative analysis of the angular distributions of mitochondrial fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) towards the axis of the MTOC (red line); quantitation of mitochondrial staining within 45° on either side of the MTOC revealed significantly (p&lt;0.001) increased (40–50%) levels in infected cells at 18 and 24 h p.i. compared to the mock-infected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Compared to mock infection, RSV infection at 8 and 18 hr increased population 1 by about 2- and 8-fold, respectively, with these increases reversed by MitoQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

We treated mock-infected cells with rotenone as a positive control, with strong DCF staining in regions colocalized with Mitotracker Deep Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row) indicating high levels of mitochondrial ROS. Analysis of RSV-infected cells revealed higher levels of ROS associated with perinuclear mitochondria at 8 h p.i.; this staining at 12 h p.i. was still perinuclear, but with intense nuclear staining as well as some diffuse cytoplasmic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To assess the mitochondrial contribution to this ROS staining, we confirmed the actions of MitoQ to suppress the actions of rotenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> row). We then treated RSV-infected cells with MitoQ 2 hr before imaging and observed a marked reduction in DCF staining, suggesting that the ROS generated in the absence of MitoQ in infected cells was largely mitochondrial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Strikingly, when we included nocodazole treatment to prevent microtubule-dependent mitochondrial clustering upon RSV infection, DCF staining remained largely mitochondrial and cytoplasmic and was largely excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom row).

Histological analysis of H and E-stained slides was used to determine bronchial and perivascular inflammation based on established quantification schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehra et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the intensity of bronchial or perivascular inflammation was scored numerically for each view-field on a scale of 1 to 9. 0 denotes no inflammation; 1–3 scant cells but not forming a defined layer; 4–6, 1–3 layers of cells surrounding the airway epithelium or the vessel; and 7–9, four or more layers of cells surrounding the airway epithelium or the vessel. Blood from each mouse was also collected by heart puncture, serum extracted and used for ELISA to determine systemic inflammatory responses using RANTES as a marker, as per the manufacturer’s specifications (RANTES, RayBiotech Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>A cytotoxicity detection kit (LDH Release Assay, Roche Applied Science) was used to quantitatively assess cell death on the basis of the amount of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) released into the medium upon plasma membrane damage.

In fact, in the original submission we had used two distinct approaches to impact mitochondrial movement without affecting microtubules directly; Figures 3A (second last row) and 3D (sixth and seventh rows) show results for a specific inhibitor targeting dynein ATPase activity, and siRNA knockdown of a dynein adaptor protein or cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain component, respectively. In all of these, treatment restores the even distribution of mitochondria in RSV-infected cells without affecting the filamentous microtubule structure, as indicated clearly by the α-tubulin staining. We now highlight in the text more clearly that these treatments do <italic>not</italic> disrupt microtubules, but clearly impact the effects of RSV on infected cell mitochondria (subsections “RSV-induced mitochondrial redistribution is microtubule- and dynein-dependent” and “RSV infection inhibits host mitochondrial respiration dependent on dynein/microtubule integrity”). To build on the reviewers’ specific suggestion, however, we have now added completely new experimental data (five panel Figure 8—figure supplement 6), where we use siRNA to knockdown the CLUH protein, as suggested. The results are most exciting, showing that CLUH knockdown induces mitochondrial perinuclear clustering (even in the absence of RSV infection) (Figure 8—figure supplement 6B, C), resulting in elevated mitochondrial ROS (Figure 8—figure supplement 6D, E), and most importantly, resulting in increased RSV virus production (Figure 8—figure supplement 6F). Together with Figure 3A, D, this demonstrates that mitochondrial redistribution (and not microtubule disruption per se) is key to mitochondrial ROS production, which in turn facilitates RSV virus production (subsection “Mitochondrial redistribution/elevated mitochondrial ROS generation is critical for RSV virus production”, last paragraph). We thank the reviewers again for encouraging us to perform these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore quantification of the data on mitochondrial morphology should be provided allowing more precise statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to do more analysis; we now include a new panel in Figure 1 (Figure 1B) showing the quantitative analysis. This supports the conclusions from Figure 1A, with significantly altered mitochondrial morphology evident in virus-infected cells compared to mock-infected cells. We have also amended our description of the results, to make them more precise (subsection “RSV infection drives mitochondrial perinuclear clustering and redistribution of 43 mitochondria towards the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC)”, first paragraph), as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also check cell viability in the in vitro infection experiments to exclude the effects of cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion; we now include a new figure (Figure 8—figure supplement 3) that documents the minimal effects on cell viability of our various siRNA and drug treatments in mock- and RSV-infected cells. The results confirm that the observed reduction in viral replication is not a result of reduced cell viability (subsection “Mitochondrial redistribution/elevated mitochondrial ROS generation is critical for RSV virus production”). We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to present this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The findings should be critically verified and discussed in the light of the work done by the Casola group at UTMB. Specifically the experiments presented in the Figure 9 are an extension of the Casola group's antioxidant studies on RSV-induced disease, therefore cytokine/chemokine production, or other measures of antioxidant efficacy, should be done in a similar manner so that the results can be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers’ comments highlight the clear parallels between our studies, and those of the Casola group. Although our experiments examine distinct aspects of inflammation (airway, perivascular, and systemic; Figure 9) as opposed to inflammation of the bronchoalveolar lavage (Casola group), both studies show reduced levels of chemokine (RANTES) as well as lung inflammation following antioxidant treatment in RSV-infected mice compared to the control group (Figure 9G; compare to Figure 6, PMID: 17008643). Importantly, both studies support the idea that antioxidant treatment ameliorates RSV-induced pathogenesis. To add emphasis to this point, we now include detailed discussion of how our results relate to and confirm those of the Casola group (Discussion, second paragraph), as well as adding additional references (including from the Casola group). These changes have made the relevance of the manuscript to the present literature much clearer, and help feature the work of the Casola group, as appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be great to provide evidence concerning mitochondrial redistribution in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells as this would add to our understanding by showing this effect occurs in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We now include new figures, namely Figures 1—figure supplements 2 and 3, documenting the key observations of RSV-induced mitochondrial perinuclear clustering in human airway progenitor-like basal cells, including quantitative analysis, and Figure 8—figure supplement 1, documenting the fact that the mitochondrial ROS scavenger MitoQ protects against RSV infection in human primary airway epithelial cells (4 lines). The results confirm the physiological relevance of our results in the A549 system, providing important insights into RSV’s impact on mitochondrial distribution of human airway epithelia (subsections “RSV infection drives mitochondrial perinuclear clustering and redistribution of mitochondria towards the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC)” and “RSV-induced mitochondrial redistribution is microtubule- and dynein-dependent”; Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers agree that ROS generation mechanisms caused by mitochondrial reorganisation are beyond the scope of the study.

Importantly, we have included CLUH in Figure 10 (absent in the previous revision) and in the legend. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, one of the reviewers notes that the authors have misinterpreted the first concern about microtubules and RSV replication.

We have translocated our novel data from the previous Figure 8C into Figure 7E, as well as reshuffle the order of appearance in the manuscript of several of the supplementary figures to enhance the flow. Importantly, we now refer appropriately to previous work on RSV filament formation to preface the section on microtubules and RSV replication (new reference Vanover et al., 2017). We thank the reviewer for these suggestions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
