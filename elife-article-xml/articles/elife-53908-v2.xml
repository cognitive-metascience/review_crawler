Recent studies of guinea fowl (<italic>Numida meleagris</italic>) revealed that the distal leg muscles rapidly modulate force and work output to minimize perturbations in uneven terrain. Here we probe the role of reflexes in the rapid perturbation responses of muscle by studying the effects of proprioceptive loss. We induced bilateral loss of autogenic proprioception in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle (LG) using self-reinnervation. We compared in vivo muscle dynamics and ankle kinematics in birds with reinnervated and intact LG. Reinnervated and intact LG exhibit similar steady state mechanical function and similar work modulation in response to obstacle encounters. Reinnervated LG exhibits 23ms earlier steady-state activation, consistent with feedforward tuning of activation phase to compensate for lost proprioception. Modulation of activity duration is impaired in rLG, confirming the role of reflex feedback in regulating force duration in intact muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>guinea fowl</kwd><kwd><italic>Numida meleagris</italic></kwd><kwd>helmeted guinea fowl</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIAMS 5R01AR055648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biewener</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H005838/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daley</surname><given-names>Monica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral training studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Joanne C</given-names></name><name><surname>Daley</surname><given-names>Monica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Running guinea fowl maintain stable running after loss of the stretch reflex in a major ankle extensor muscle, by increasing feedforward muscle activation to maintain ankle stiffness and work output.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory feedback is widely accepted as an integral component of vertebrate locomotor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donelan and Pearson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grillner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prochazka and Ellaway, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossignol et al., 2006</xref>). Proprioception from muscle mechanoreceptors contributes to 1) short-latency reflexes via spinal mono- and polysynaptic pathways to regulate the ongoing activity and muscle mechanical output (force, stiffness, impedance and work) and 2) longer-latency responses to coordinate and maintain task-level goals for balance and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grillner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Pearson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frigon and Rossignol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prochazka and Ellaway, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossignol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Safavynia and Ting, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sherrington and Laslett, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sherrington, 1910</xref>). Proprioceptive reflexes can occur through <italic>autogenic</italic> (self-generated) pathways arising from the same muscle, and through <italic>heterogenic</italic> pathways arising from other muscles via spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frigon and Rossignol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Pearson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nichols, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ross and Nichols, 2009</xref>). Thus, the relationship between a specific sensory signal and its resulting effects is complex and dynamic.</p><p>Despite recognized functions of proprioception, the relative contribution of feedback control in high-speed locomotion remains unclear. Sensorimotor delay constrains how quickly an animal can sense and respond to a stimulus using feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">More and Donelan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">More et al., 2010</xref>). The fastest possible feedback loop occurs through mono-synaptic reflexes, which involve a delay that increases in proportion to nerve transmission distance. This reflex delay becomes a larger fraction of the stride cycle with increasing speed, limiting time available for reflex-mediated correction.</p><p>The challenges of long delays relative to stride cycle times likely necessitates greater reliance on feedforward control strategies at higher speeds. Here we use feedforward to refer to the contributions to motor output arising from the motor cortex, descending pathways and rhythmic spinal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Frigon and Rossignol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pearson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yakovenko et al., 2004</xref>). Rhythmic spinal networks can generate the basic flexion and extension motor pattern for gait, even when proprioceptive feedback is removed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pearson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharp and Bekoff, 2015</xref>). Normally, however, descending networks act in concert with spinal networks and feedback, using multimodal and distributed sensory inputs to update state estimates, regulate rhythm and control foot placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drew and Marigold, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marigold and Drew, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pearson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Todorov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Potocanac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, there is no âpureâ feedfoward control within vertebrate systems. We use the term here as a pragmatic distinction, where <italic>feedforward</italic> refers to anticipatory âlook-aheadâ control over one or more stride cycles, and <italic>feedback</italic> refers to reflex-mediated reactive responses to perturbations.</p><p>Although feedforward networks normally act in concert with feedback, feedforward motor activation coupled to intrinsic muscle properties can be sufficient to produce stable gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yakovenko et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with this, the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) of guinea fowl (<italic>Numida meleagris</italic>) rapidly absorbs energy in response to unexpected drop perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>), stabilizing high speed running without a reflex response. The rapid perturbation response arises from the intrinsic mechanical properties of the muscle-tendon tissues and musculoskeletal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Loeb, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loeb et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jindrich and Full, 2002</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azizi et al., 2008</xref>). Intrinsic mechanical responses can be actively tuned by the specific feedforward pattern of muscle activation. For example, humans hopping on surfaces with randomized, sudden increases in ground stiffness show a feedforward increase in muscle co-activation and knee flexion, increasing mechanical stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moritz and Farley, 2004</xref>). However, many perturbation responses involve multiple control mechanisms that overlap in time. Guinea fowl running over obstacles use a combination of feedforward, intrinsic mechanical and reflex-mediated mechanisms, with a delay of ~40 ms for reflex-mediated increases in muscle force (6ms reflex latency + 34ms force development delay: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>). Considering that the feedforward and intrinsic mechanical contributions alter ongoing muscle dynamics <italic>before</italic> the reflex-mediated response, it is difficult to disentangle the specific contributions of proprioceptive reflexes to the observed perturbation responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Investigating the role of proprioception through self-reinnervation</title><p>Here we probe the integration of feedforward, feedback and intrinsic mechanical control by eliciting a proprioceptive deficit in the lateral gastrocnemius muscle (LG) of the guinea fowl (<italic>Numida meleagris</italic>) using bilateral self-reinnervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Self-reinnervation involves peripheral nerve branch transection and immediate repair, resulting in recovery of motor output with long-term, local loss of autogenic muscle proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cope et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullinger et al., 2011</xref>). Self-reinnervation occurs through axonal regrowth and reconnection with denervated tissues over a recovery period of 4-8 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cope et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gordon and Stein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vannucci et al., 2019</xref>). Reinnervated muscles retain a deficit in the monosynaptic stretch reflex due to synaptic retraction of primary muscle spindle afferents and disconnection from parent motoneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandt et al., 2015</xref>). However, intermuscular force and length feedback networks may remain partially intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyle et al., 2016</xref>). Cats and rats with reinnervated muscles maintain whole-limb function by adjusting inter-joint coordination and muscle co-activation to compensate for loss of reflex-mediated ankle stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>).

Birds share features of sensorimotor structure and function with mammals, including muscle tissue properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poore et al., 1997</xref>) and muscle proprioception through muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dorward, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haiden and Awad, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maier, 1992</xref>). Ground birds use bipedal walking and running gaits with mechanics and energetics similar to human locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heglund et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taylor et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatesy and Biewener, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberts et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Daley and Birn-Jeffery, 2018</xref>). Bipedal gaits involve substantial periods of single-limb contact, which limits the redundancy of balance mechanisms and poses a challenge for stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Higham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>). Whereas a quadrupedal cat or rat might be able to compensate for deficits by shifting weight bearing among legs, a biped with a bilateral proprioceptive deficit cannot. Accordingly, one goal of the current study is to explore whether or not guinea fowl exhibit a similar response to proprioceptive deficit as observed in quadrupedal vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that autogenic proprioceptive deficit will lead to increased reliance on feedforward control mechanisms and intrinsic muscle mechanics to maintain stable locomotion. To test for shifts in stability and control mechanisms, we measured ankle kinematics and in vivo LG muscle dynamics (length, force and activation) during treadmill running on level and obstacle terrain. There are several potential mechanisms to compensate for autogenic proprioceptive deficit: 1) Birds might compensate for proprioceptive deficit by increasing feedforward muscle activation before obstacle contact, as observed in birds negotiating high-contrast obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>). 2) Alternatively, if feedback regulation of LG is essential for stability in fast locomotion, loss of autogenic proprioception may necessitate increased reliance on heterogenic reflex pathways from synergists, with a slight delay compared to intact animals, as suggested by work in cats and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyle et al., 2016</xref>). 3) Finally, if intrinsic mechanics are mainly responsible for the modulation of muscle force and work, we might expect minimal change in muscle activity patterns (EMG), as observed in birds subjected to unexpected drop perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>). We expect birds to compensate for proprioceptive deficit by tuning gait and feedforward muscle activity to maintain a stable response to obstacle perturbations, as observed in reinnervated rats and cats walking on slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>). If stability is impaired following reinnervation, this should be evident from increased variance and longer time to recover from obstacles. By investigating the shifts in guinea fowl LG muscle force, length and activation dynamics following reinnervation, we hope to gain insight into the mechanisms of sensorimotor integration and plasticity that enable robustly stable and agile bipedal locomotion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mechanical function of intact <italic>versus</italic> reinnervated LG</title><p>We find that many features of the steady-state in vivo mechanical function of the guinea fowl reinnervated lateral gastrocnemius (rLG) are similar to that previously measured in the intact LG (iLG)Â (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that an autogenic proprioceptive deficit will lead to increased reliance on feedforward tuning of muscle activity to achieve stable muscle dynamics in obstacle terrain. In birds with intact LG proprioception, the timing of muscle activity in obstacle-perturbed strides is consistent with combined feedforward and feedback control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>). Birds with reinnervated LG (rLG) exhibit a consistent phase shift in EMG onset relative to muscle length, with activation starting 6% earlier (23 ms) in the steady state contraction cycle, in both level and obstacle terrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This is consistent with a feedforward tuning of rLG activation timing to enable rapid force development and high muscle stiffness during stance, in the absence of monosynaptic reflexes. Regulation of EMG duration in obstacle strides (S 0) is absent in rLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that proprioceptive feedback in late stance normally regulates force duration, which is disrupted following reinnervation.</p><p>A stable intrinsic mechanical response with neither feedforward- nor feedback-mediated changes in neural drive can occur when a perturbation is encountered at high running speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>). Rapid changes in muscle length and velocity in response to perturbations can decouple activation and force development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>). In our previous work on intact in vivo muscle dynamics, variation in LG muscle strain during initial foot contact and limb loading explained 60% of the variation in force developed in obstacle encounters, while variation in LG muscle activation explained only 9%. This clearly demonstrates the decoupling between activation and force development that can occur in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>). These intrinsic mechanical effects minimize the disturbances in body dynamics that arise from terrain height perturbations, enabling rapid recovery to steady gait. Similar intrinsic mechanical stabilizing responses have been demonstrated in the distal hindlimb joints of hopping and running humans subjected to unexpected changes in terrain height and stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moritz and Farley, 2004</xref>). In concert with the stabilizing contributions of the intrinsic muscle-tendon dynamics, guinea fowl with intact proprioception also use feedforward and feedback regulation of muscle activity to maintain stability in obstacle terrain, with greater feedforward contributions when obstacles are visible and high contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We find that guinea fowl with LG proprioceptive deficit achieve similar increases in total EMG activity during obstacle strides; however, the increases in activity occur early in the stride, before obstacle-induced changes in muscle force and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is consistent with anticipatory, feedforward increases in neural drive to the muscle, as observed in birds running over high-contrast visible obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>), and humans hopping on randomized but expected increases in surface stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moritz and Farley, 2004</xref>). These findings are consistent with a hybrid feedforward/feedback control model as conceptualized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuo, 2002</xref> in which feedforward and feedback gains are balanced to enable accurate state estimation and robust cyclical dynamics in the presence of both disturbances and sensory error. Although the reinnervated LG contributes to an effective obstacle negotiation response, it requires a longer recovery time and increased muscle activity following obstacle contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that the integrated response of the intact neuromuscular system enables robust stability with lower muscle activation costs.</p><p>Several features of the kinematics and muscle dynamics suggests coordinated plasticity and tuning of feedfoward control to compensate for reflex deficit following recovery from nerve injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We observe similar increases in work output in response to obstacle encounters in rLG and iLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the idea that muscle work modulation is an important feature of task-level control for stability in uneven terrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>). However, work modulation is achieved through different underlying mechanisms in rLG and iLG. Earlier steady state activation in rLG (lacking autogenic proprioceptive feedback) enables higher muscle force development in early stance to resist the external load applied at foot contact, which likely contributes to the higher rate of shortening throughout stance. Additionally, rLG exhibits larger increases in peak force in obstacle encounters compared to iLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This increase in peak force likely involves both active and passive components: an active contribution from increased feedforward drive and EMG amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and a passive contribution from increased stretch of connective tissues associated with a more flexed ankle posture at foot contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Finally, Birds with rLG also show an anticipatory shift in stride duration before obstacle encounters, which is not observed in the intact cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and may help control landing conditions for obstacle encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that reinnervated birds achieve effective muscle work modulation and stable obstacle negotiation through feedforward tuning of muscle activation and gait to compensate for loss of autogenic proprioception.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic of theÂ neuromechanical control mechanisms regulating function of the reinnervated lateral gastrocnemius (rLG) of the guinea fowl.</title><p>Green text indicates the in vivo experimental measures used to infer sensorimotor control mechanisms.

We find here that earlier onset is associated with greater shortening and work production. The specific response of a muscle to a shift in activation phase is likely to be highly sensitive to the specific steady-state length trajectory of the muscle. Muscle force capacity and the activation and deactivation kinetics are substantially influenced by velocity and recent strain history, as demonstrated in controlled studies of in vitro muscle force-length work loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askew and Marsh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Josephson, 1999</xref>). Further work is needed to understand how in vivo muscle fascicle length dynamics interact with neural activation patterns and MTU compliance to enable tuning of muscle contraction dynamics to the mechanical demands of cyclical locomotor tasks.</p><p>We do observe shifts in muscle activity in late stance in some reinnervated individuals in response to obstacle encounters, which suggests heterogenic reflex responses in reinnervated LG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, these responses are variable and idiosyncratic, with some birds showing increased EMG in late stance in obstacle strides, and others showing a decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The variable and idiosyncratic reflex responses result in wide confidence intervals for the obstacle-induced EMG response in the latter half of stance, despite consistent force-length trajectories over the same time-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Idiosyncratic use of heterogenic reflex modulation across individuals following nerve injury recovery is consistent with findings in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyle and Nichols, 2018</xref>). Guinea fowl have several agonist muscles to the LG that could contribute to heterogenic feedback modulation, including the medial gastrocnemius and digital flexors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>). However, no muscle is an exact synergist of the LG, because each has a unique combination of moment arms, fiber length, pennation angle and connective tissue compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daley and Biewener, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, it is unlikely that proprioception from agonists can completely restore accurate sensing to regulate LG force and work output. Additionally, in the presence of increased sensory error and noise, birds may learn over time to compensate through sensory integration in higher CNS pathways, leading to updated central coordination and feedforward drive to rhythm generating networks.</p><p>It was previously unknown whether guinea fowl would respond to reinnervation and proprioceptive deficit in a manner similar to quadrupedal mammals. We find that our results are consistent with the findings on rats and cats. Reinnervated cats and rats exhibit shifts in feedforward muscle activity and inter-joint coordination during slope walking, to compensate for loss of reflex-mediated ankle stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abelew et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>). Cats and rats also preserve task level features of gait, such as leg length and body motions, despite variance in muscle and joint dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>). These findings suggest performance of task-level goals as a target of sensorimotor optimization. Also similar to cats, guinea fowl exhibit variation among individuals in heterogenic compensation for loss of the autogenic stretch reflex, as suggested by the variable tendon tap responses and variation in late-stance EMG activity in obstacle perturbed steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Work on cats suggests complex intermuscular feedback connectivity, which can recovery to varying degrees following reinnervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cope et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pearson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lyle and Nichols, 2018</xref>). This complexity and variability among individuals following recovery from nerve injury reflects the complexity and plasticity of proprioceptive feedback networks. Nonetheless, the recovery of consistent task-level mechanical function supports the idea that sensorimotor control is optimized to maintain task-level performance goals such as stable body dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Safavynia and Ting, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>One of the major limitations in the current study is the potential for multiple differences between the intact and reinnervated cohorts that were not controlled, because the experiments on the two cohorts were conducted over different periods of time. The self-reinnervation procedure requires a long-term recovery period and results in a chronic sensory deficit, which is likely to lead to a complex array of changes in the musculoskeletal tissues and the sensorimotor networks. The current study did not include a sham-surgery experimental control, and we did not strictly monitor the ages of the original intact cohort at the time of the in vivo muscle-tendon surgeries. Nonetheless, it is reassuring that our findings are consistent with similar studies in cats and rats, suggesting feedforward tuning of muscle activation and ankle kinematics to maintain stability following loss of proprioception. In future experiments, it will be important to control the timing and amount of exercise training in intact and reinnervated experimental groups, considering the potential for exercise to influence the recovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeltz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The recovery process almost certainly involves coupled changes across multiple systems, including connective tissue compliance, muscle activation kinetics, fiber type distribution, motor unit size and distribution, spinal intraneuronal connectivity, and sensory integration in higher CNS centers for state estimation and movement planning. Due to the complex nature of these adaptations, it is challenging to fully tease apart individual contributions and mechanisms from in vivo experimental measures alone. In future studies, the coordinated mechanisms of sensorimotor adaptation and plasticity could be systematically explored through a combination of integrative experimental and computational approaches. These approaches could include 1) closed loop neuromechanical simulations to enable predictive hypothesis testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ijspeert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roth et al., 2014</xref>), 2) combined use of in vivo measures of muscle dynamics with in vitro testing of muscle contractile dynamics, to replicate biologically realistic force-length contraction dynamics, 3) histological studies to examine changes in muscle fiber type distribution and connective tissue characteristics following reinnervation, and 4) perturbation approaches that probe both short and long term adaptation processes.</p><p>It remains unclear how the specific length trajectory and velocity features of in vivo muscle dynamics contribute to the intrinsic stability and control of movement. Dynamic measurement techniques are needed to address this challenge and to develop realistic models for in vivo muscle-tendon function. In addition to widely recognized force-length and force-velocity âHill-typeâ properties, muscle exhibits short and long-term history-dependent changes in force capacity in response to stretch and shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Edman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Edman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Edman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Josephson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Herzog, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Herzog, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rode et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nishikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yeo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nishikawa et al., 2018</xref>).

We conducted regular treadmill training from 7 weeks after reinnervation surgery. Exercise was started at 7 weeks to ensure synaptic withdrawal of primary afferents before recovery, eliciting a proprioceptive deficit in the self-reinnervated LG.

These muscle masses are a comparable to those measured from intact guinea fowl in previous studies, representing approximately 0.5% body mass for LG and 1.3% body mass for total gastrocnemius mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daley and Biewener, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Higham and Biewener, 2008</xref>). This suggests full recovery from denervation-induced muscle atrophy in the reinnervated cohort. Fascicle lengths for were 17 Â±1 mm and 18Â±2 mm and pennation angles were 25Â±5Â° and 24Â±5Â° for reinnervated and intact LG, respectively. Crystal alignment relative to the fascicle axis (<italic>Î±</italic>) was within 2Â°, indicating that errors due to misalignment were <italic>&lt;</italic>0.1%. We calibrated the tendon force buckle in situ p<italic>ost mortem</italic> by applying a series of known cyclical loads using a force transducer (model 9203, Kistler, Amherst, MA), which yielded linear least-squares calibration slopes with R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.97.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Level and obstacle terrain conditions</title><p>We recorded trials on i) uniform level terrain and ii) terrain with repeating 5 cm obstacles, at the same treadmill speeds, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>. The treadmill belt (Woodway, Waukesha WI) was slatted black rubber-coated steel with running surface 55.8 cm x 172.7 cm with clearance for obstacles beneath. Obstacles were constructed from styrofoam reinforced with cardboard covered with black neoprene to form a light, stiff surface. Waterproof glue (Shoe Goo, Eugene, OR, USA) secured heavy-duty fabric hook and loop fastener (Velcro, Cheshire, UK) to the obstacle and treadmill surface. Four sequential slats of obstacles produced a 20 cm<sup>2</sup> continuous obstacle surface. Obstacles were encountered approximately every 4-5 strides, with some variation due to varied stride length and treadmill station keeping. We recorded high-speed video at 250 Hz (Photron, San Diego, CA, USA) for analysis of ankle kinematics, detection of stride timing and statistical coding of strides in relation to obstacle encounters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data processing</title><p>We assigned strides categories in relation to the obstacle encounters, using the approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>, based on the stride sequence of the instrumented leg: the stride prior to an obstacle contact (S â1), obstacle contact strides (S 0), the stride following obstacle contact (S +1), and strides in flat terrain between obstacles (S +2). All level terrain strides were assigned the same stride category (L). Note, this is simpler stride coding than presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>, which also considered the timing of obstacle encounters by the contralateral leg. Strides in which the contralateral limb had made contact with the obstacle in the previous step are grouped here into the (S +2) category, for simplicity. This does not substantially alter the findings, because the coding was similar between intact and reinnervated birds, and the current analysis is focused on the shifts in LG force-length dynamics related to a direct obstacle encounter by the instrumented leg.</p><p>Features of LG activation, force-length dynamics and work output were measured, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daley and Biewener, 2011</xref>. Raw EMG signals were used to calculate myoelectric intensity in time and frequency domains using wavelet decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>). This was used to calculate total myoelectric intensity per stride (E<sub>tot</sub>) and mean frequency of muscle activation (E<sub>freq</sub>). We calculated fractional fascicle length (L) from sonomicrometry data using mean length in level terrain as a reference length (L<sub>o</sub>). Note, however, that L<sub>o</sub> is not directly related to sarcomere length or optimal length for the isometric force-length curve, which were not measured. Fractional fascicle length was differentiated to obtain fascicle velocity (V, in lengths per second, Ls<sup>â1</sup>). Shortening strains are negative. We multiplied fascicle velocity (in ms<sup>â1</sup>) by tendon force (in Newtons, N) to calculate muscle power (Watts), which was integrated through time to calculate total work per stride (Joules, J; with shortening work being positive), and then normalized by muscle mass to obtain mass-specific muscle work (Jkg<sup>â1</sup>). We also recorded muscle (fascicle) length, velocity and force at specified times to evaluate how strain and activation factors influence muscle force and work output. All data processing was completed using MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc; Natick, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>The statistical analysis approach is similar to that used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 2015</xref> to investigate obstacle perturbation responses relative to steady state level terrain strides. We used a linear mixed-effects model ANOVA to test for significant effects of <italic>treatment</italic> (intact/reinnervated cohorts) and stride category (<italic>stride ID</italic>: Level, S -1, S 0, S +1, S +2) as fixed categorical factors, with individual (<italic>ind</italic>) included as a random effect. Statistical analysis was completed in Matlab using âfitlmeâ and associated functions in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (Mathworks, Inc; Natick, MA, USA). Several linear mixed effects models were evaluated:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>'Y ~ 1 + (1|ind)'</p></list-item><list-item><p>'Y ~ 1 + treatment + (1|ind)'</p></list-item><list-item><p>'Y ~ 1 + stride_ID + (1|ind)'</p></list-item><list-item><p>'Y ~ 1 + stride_ID + treatment + (1|ind)'</p></list-item><list-item><p>'Y ~ 1 + stride_ID *treatment + (1|ind)'</p></list-item></list><p>Model 5 (with the interaction term between fixed effects) was used as the final model, because it had the lowest AIC for 13 of 14 of the variables analyzed (AIC, Akaike, 1976). Model 4 had the lowest AIC for mean EMG frequency (E<sub>freq</sub>), but the difference between Models 4 and 5 was not significant according to a likelihood ratio test. Therefore, for consistency, Model 5 was used for all variables. Posthoc pairwise comparisons were calculated for the mean difference Â± 95% confidence interval between intact and reinnervated treatment cohorts and for the mean differences between level and obstacle strides categories within each treatment cohort. Pairwise comparisons were calculated after removing the random effect of individual, because the intact and reinnervated datasets came from different cohorts of individuals. We used False Discovery Rate to calculate an adjusted p-value threshold to maintain a 5% false positive rate across all statistical tests, including fixed effects tests and post-hoc pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by NIH grant NIAMS 5R01AR055648 to AAB, grant BB/H005838/1 to MAD from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), and a doctoral training studentship from the BBSRC to JCG supervised by MAD.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.

Sensorimotor integration consists of neuronal feedforward, neuronal feedback and intrinsic muscle mechanics. Authors have studied how lateral gastrocnemius muscle (LG) and nervous system respond to the rapid perturbation when the proprioceptive sense as the fast feedback response is lost. Statistical comparison has been conducted between two groups (reinnervated and intact birds) through the recorded running trials at the same speed for both level and obstacle terrain. From the collected data of muscle force and length (intrinsic mechanics) and EMG (feedforward) signals, the authors have found that despite deficits in LG monosynaptic reflex following reinnervation, the general pattern of muscle dynamics of the reinnervated LG (rLG) is qualitatively similar to that of previously measured intact birds (iLG). However, the steady-state timing of EMG activation of rLG, as the feedforward, is phase-shifted earlier in the stride cycle. This earlier onset enables rapid force development and higher muscle stiffness at the time of foot contact and likely helps compensate for the loss of proprioceptive feedback. Additionally, regulation of force duration in obstacle strides is disrupted following reinnervation, suggesting that proprioceptive feedback in late stance normally regulates force duration. The authors have concluded that the autogenic proprioceptive deficit will lead to increased reliance on feedforward tuning of muscle activity to achieve stable muscle dynamics in obstacle terrain.</p><p>In general, this is a very well-written paper, with an extensive analysis that is of broad interest to those interested in complex sensorimotor integration. Also, in general, the figures and methods were very clear. The work described in this paper is novel and its impact would be considerable in understanding complexities of sensorimotor in bipedal locomotion.</p><p>There are some important concerns that, however, need to be addressed. In the main, these require:</p><p>A) Presenting the data more clearly.</p><p>B) A clear qualitative description of the differences between cohorts.</p><p>C) Redo the statistical analysis in a more interpretable manner.</p><p>D) Improve clarity of figures.</p><p>E) Reproducing data from the previous manuscript in order to make side-by-side comparisons will be convenient.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Suggestions:</p><p>Figure 2: To avoid confusion, it's better to use different colors since blue and orange are used extensively in this paper for iLG and rLG.</p><p>Figure 5: Figure is really busy and it's hard to visually see the differences between iLG and rLG. The difference between iLG and rLG looks negligible. It might be useful to show the mean and standard deviation of the difference between rLG and iLG.</p><p>2) A major weakness is the lack of discussion about potentially profound differences across the two groups, and inconsistent comparison across different cohorts of bird. While the authors do acknowledge that different birds were sampled in the intact and reinnervated groups in the Materials and methods, this point may easily be missed by the reader and should be re-stated as a limitation in the Discussion (perhaps starting at the seventh paragraph of the subsection âWhat is the role of proprioception in the control of high-speed locomotion?â). Considering that the nerves were injured while the birds were juveniles and testing was performed in adults means the normal maturation process may have impacted adaptation to proprioceptive loss and may limit applicability to understanding the roles of feedback and feedforward control, or effects of nerve injury, in adults. In general, similarities among groups are stated to be &quot;comparable&quot; without supporting quantification from the intact group (e.g. in the Materials and methods, body and muscle masses, muscle lengths, gait speed etc.; in Results, Figure 2. While is it also reported that tendon tap reflexes were absent, no quantification was provided. How are potentially different levels of recovery accounted for? Was exercise begun 7 weeks after injury to avoid regeneration associated with immediate training? (Brandt et al., 2015).</p><p>3) Despite the assertion in the Results (first paragraph), there are clearly differences in the level- and obstacle-terrain gait kinematics and kinetics between groups (c.f. Figures 2, 3, 6, 8).</p><p>4) Differences across S-1, S-0, and S+1 are interesting but not discussed. Why is it that S+1 has a greater advance in EMG than S-0 and S<sup>-1</sup>? This could be compared to downslope walking?</p><p>5) In general, figures were difficult to digest without careful parsing of the legends and could use better in-figure descriptors. For example, Figures 3 and 4 are not readable in black and white, the upper and lower rows could be labeled as &quot;intact&quot; and &quot;reinnervated&quot;, while a dark line indicating &quot;level terrain&quot; with the colors indicating &quot;obstacle&quot;. Foot contact lines could also be labeled, as the legends are hard to follow. Figure 3 legend &quot;for a single individual from each condition&quot; it is not clear whether &quot;condition&quot; refers to level vs. obstacle or intact vs. reinnervated.</p><p>6) The mixed model ANOVA results were difficult to follow, and it may be better to present specific individual findings based on the hypothesis, e.g. earlier LG activation, evidence of later reflex, There is also concern over the number of variables in the model and the potential for false positives (Tables 1, 2 and Figure 5). A select number of tests should be done in alignment with specific hypotheses posed. Mean effects should be reported using ANOVA and post hoc tests. The coefficients reported are not interpretable in terms of differences across conditions/steps (e.g. Figure 6B). Bar charts with the main effect would be easier to understand.</p><p>7) The implication for broader audiences could be enhanced, and the differences between bipedal and quadrupedal locomotor impairments are not clearly discussed. It is not clear that the shift to bipedal gait added significant insight into the role of proprioception in movement, as similar deficits occur in both.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53908.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, this is a very well-written paper, with an extensive analysis that is of broad interest to those interested in complex sensorimotor integration.
