we seek rewards and avoid harm. It has been reported that individuals vary markedly in their avoidance of detrimental consequences, that is in their sensitivity to punishment. The underpinnings of this variability are poorly understood; they may be driven by differences in aversion sensitivity, motivation for reward, and/or instrumental control. We examined these hypotheses by applying several analysis strategies to the behaviour of rats (<italic>n</italic> = 48; 18 female) trained in a conditioned punishment task that permitted concurrent assessment of punishment, reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We show that punishment insensitivity is a unique phenotype, unrelated to differences in reward-seeking and Pavlovian fear, and due to a failure of instrumental control. Subjects insensitive to punishment are afraid of aversive events, they are simply unable to change their behaviour to avoid them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>punishment</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>individual differences</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP190100482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Gavan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP170100075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Gavan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral analyses show that individuals insensitive to punishment are afraid of aversive events, they are simply unable to change their behaviour to avoid them.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our behaviours, decisions, and choices are shaped by their consequences. When rewarded, they are likely to be repeated, but when punished they are not. Reward and punishment are among the most fundamental psychological building blocks of behaviour. They allow us to cope with a changing world, maximising our probability of survival by seeking utility and avoiding harm. Yet there is often pronounced variation between individuals in responsivity to the consequences of their behaviours. Notably, individuals differ significantly in their sensitivity to punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marchant et al., 2018</xref>). Insensitivity to punishment is observed experimentally as impaired suppression of behaviours that cause aversive events. Punishment sensitivity plays an important role in normal learning, decision making as well as emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corr, 2004</xref>). Differences in sensitivity to punishment have been implicated in the aetiology or maintenance of a range of psychopathologies including conduct disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggs-Gowan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dadds and Salmon, 2003</xref>), drug and behavioural addictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vanderschuren et al., 2017</xref>), eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monteleone et al., 2018</xref>), psychopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregory et al., 2015</xref>), and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elliott et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eshel and Roiser, 2010</xref>). Moreover, punishment sensitivity is an increasingly popular measure of the motivation to engage in drug-seeking and drug-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasanetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marchant et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pascoli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vanderschuren and Everitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vanderschuren et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cause(s) of differences in punishment sensitivity are poorly understood. Three main mechanisms have been proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, individual differences in punishment learning may be due to temperamental differences in aversive valuation or aversion sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray, 1970</xref>). Successful punishment learning requires that the punisher be encoded as aversive. If individuals differ in the extent to which they are sensitive to the aversiveness of punishers, then they are likely to differ in the extent to which they will suppress any behaviour that produces a punisher. A second possibility is that punishment insensitive individuals show reward dominance, with choices and behaviour more strongly determined via the value of any rewards they earn rather than any punishment they incur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Brien and Frick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson and Berridge, 2003</xref>). A final, and not mutually exclusive, possibility is that individual differences in punishment sensitivity emerge from individual differences in aversive instrumental learning and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seligman, 1970</xref>). Punishment learning involves encoding the instrumental contingency between behaviour and its adverse consequences. It is possible that punishment insensitive and sensitive individuals may encode the punisher as equally aversive but differ in their ability to detect or encode the contingency between their behaviour and the punisher and/or in their ability to control behaviour according to this instrumental knowledge.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Potential sources of punishment insensitivity.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52765-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Mechanistic behavioural assessment of differences in punishment sensitivity is difficult. One way of distinguishing between these different mechanisms is to examine responses to the punisher directly. However, the magnitude of the unconditioned response to a stimulus has little bearing on what is learned about that stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rescorla, 1988</xref>). An alternative approach is to use tasks that dissociate reward and aversion learning to reveal what relationships exists between them, thus allowing diagnosis of common origins. For example, if individual differences in punishment sensitivity are due to differences in aversive valuation or sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray, 1970</xref>), then this should be reflected in other forms of learning about the same aversive event in the same individuals, such as Pavlovian conditioning. So, insight into the origins of differences in punishment sensitivity could be obtained through comparisons of instrumental reward learning, instrumental punishment learning, and Pavlovian fear learning. However, there are methodological issues involved when making such assessments. For example, in order to understand individual variation, these different forms of learning have to be assessed in the same individuals. To avoid carry-over effects, they must be assessed concurrently. Finally, the same measure should be used to quantify each form of learning. Few tasks solve each of these methodological issues and none have been used to understand individual differences in punishment learning.</p><p>Here we used a conditioned punishment task that permitted us to concurrently identify and study individual differences in instrumental reward learning, instrumental punishment learning, as well as Pavlovian fear learning using the same behavioural measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Killcross et al., 1997</xref>). Rats were trained to respond on two levers for food reward. We then introduced concurrent punishment and Pavlovian fear contingencies on one lever but not the other. We used rates of lever pressing as our measure of reward, punishment, and fear. In addition to direct comparisons of lever pressing performance between the three contingencies, we used a variety of data analytic strategies (multidimensional scaling, principal components analysis, factor analysis, and k-means clustering) to understand the relationship between individual differences in instrumental reward learning, instrumental punishment learning, and Pavlovian fear learning. If punishment insensitivity is attributable to differences in reward dominance, then individual differences in punishment learning should be related to differences in instrumental reward seeking. If punishment sensitivity is related to aversive insensitivity, then individual differences in punishment and fear should be related to each other. Finally, if individual differences in punishment insensitivity are attributable to punishment-specific deficits, then no relationship between the three forms of learning should be apparent.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individual differences in punishment and fear</title><p>Three contingencies were in effect within this task: the instrumental contingency of reward which should maintain responding on both levers; the instrumental contingency of punishment, which should bias animals away from the punished response (i.e. punishment suppression), and the aversive Pavlovian contingency that drives fear conditioning to predictive cues and suppresses ongoing behaviour (i.e. Pavlovian suppression). Each of these three effects were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Prior to aversive training, there was no preference between pressing the to-be-punished versus unpunished lever (F(1,47) = .071; p = 0.791, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Across the course of aversive training, reward learning was maintained and punishment learning as well as fear learning were observed. There was evidence for punishment learning because there was less lever pressing on the punished lever than the unpunished lever (the traditional measure of punishment learning in this task) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Punishment avoidance increased across days (linear trend: F (1,47)=7.49; p=0.009, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.137). Follow-up analyses revealed significant punishment suppression for each session (1st session: F (1,47)=5.48; p=0.024, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.137; remaining sessions: F (1,47)&gt;23.4; p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.332). There was also robust evidence for Pavlovian fear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conditioned suppression elicited by presentations of the CS+ also increased across training (F (1,47)=35.1; p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.427), with significant suppression being observed for each session (all F (1,47)&gt;54.7; p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.537). However, as expected, these group-averaged data obscured pronounced individual differences. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> show the same data plotted at subject level. Punishment suppression appeared to be bimodally distributed with some subjects showing strong punishment suppression (i.e. punishment sensitivity) and others weaker or no punishment suppression (i.e. punishment insensitivity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). There was also, albeit less pronounced, variation in Pavlovian fear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Lever preference and conditioned suppression across conditioned punishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean ± SEM preference ratios showing evidence for punishment.

This measure is simple and valid, but it obscures the degree to which preferences are driven by changes in punished responding, unpunished responding, or both. Moreover, subjects that suppress punished and unpunished lever-pressing equally would have ratios of 0.5, which might mistakenly be interpreted as an absence of punishment avoidance and hence punishment insensitivity. Therefore, we also assessed suppression of punished and unpunished responding separately against pre-punished rates of responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Here a suppression ratio of 0.5 indicates no difference in rate of pressing relative to last day of training (i.e. punishment insensitivity) whereas a ratio of 0 indicates complete suppression. At the group level, this analysis showed a main effect of lever (F(1,47) = 44.39; p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.485), session (linear: F(1,47) = 9.476; p=0.003, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.167), and a significant lever x session interaction (F(1,47) = 10.62; p=0.002, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.184). This interaction was driven by a significant increase in the unpunished suppression ratio across sessions (linear: F(1,47) = 24.54; p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.343), but no significant change in punished lever suppression (linear: F(1,47) = .210; p = 0.649, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.004). Punished lever suppression was significantly greater than unpunished lever suppression for all sessions (F(1,47) &gt; 9.22; p&lt;0.004, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> 0.164). So, robust punishment was observed using this measure. However, this group level analysis again obscured pronounced individual differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Examination of individual subject performances showed that suppression of responding on the punished lever, but not the unpunished lever, appeared bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lever-press suppression across conditioned punishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean ± SEM suppression ratios for responding on the punished (red) and unpunished (green) levers relative to training. *p&lt;0.05 punished vs. unpunished.

We observed strong positive correlations among each of these measures across sessions, showing that each subject’s relative behaviour was stable across days. However, we observed few significant positive correlations between the measures. Notably, for fear and punishment, the only significant correlation was negative and present only on the first day of training.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Relationships between punishment, fear and reward.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation matrix for suppression ratios during CS+ presentations, punished lever, and unpunished lever across conditioned punishment sessions (1-6).

To visualise these, we used multidimensional scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This showed that punishment, fear, and reward clustered in separate spaces. Punished lever suppression was clustered in a separate space from conditioned suppression, suggesting that punishment and fear are highly dissimilar to each other. Unpunished lever suppression was initially closely related to punished response suppression but became progressively different as training progressed.</p><p>These results show qualitative differences between punishment, reward, and fear. To better understand the shared variance between our measures we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify any shared underlying components in learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). If there is a common aversion sensitivity that underpins punishment and fear learning, or any other common process, then PCA should identify it as a component with strong loadings from both punishment suppression and CS+ suppression. A 4-component solution was optimal, accounting for 75.9% of overall variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), with most measures well captured by these four components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The first component captured the influence of punishment: punishment suppression across the course of training loaded strongly on this component. The second component captured the influence of contextual fear learning early during training: both initial punishment suppression and unpunished responding loaded positively on this component whereas CS+ suppression loaded negatively. The third component captured specific CS+ fear from later in training: only CS+ suppression loaded positively on this component. The fourth component captured reward: the remainder of the variance in unpunished responding loaded positively on this component. So, punishment and fear do not load positively on the same component. In fact, any relationship between them was largely negative, indicative of a competitive rather than complementary relationship between them.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Principal component and factor analysis of suppression during conditioned punishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Loading heatmaps for principal component analysis of suppression ratios across conditioned punishment sessions (1-6).

It is less explicitly a means to identify underlying latent variables in datasets. Therefore, we performed Factor Analysis to identify latent variables in the association between punishment, reward, and fear. The results from this analysis were similar to PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on factor loadings, variation in aversive learning can be accounted for by an influence of punishment (Factor 1), contextual fear (Factor 2), CS+ fear (Factor 3), and reward (Factor 4). Taken together, these findings suggest punishment, reward, and fear are largely orthogonal each other.</p><p>We also assessed the relationship between pre-punishment lever-pressing and behaviour in conditioned punishment. Training lever-pressing was correlated with unpunished (average <italic>r</italic> = 0.561, p&lt;0.0001) but not punished lever-press rates during ITIs (average <italic>r</italic> = 0.198, p=0.18) or conditioned suppression (average <italic>r</italic> = 0.173, p=0.24). This relationship was further supported by PCA and multidimensional scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This implies responding during training predicts later unpunished responding but not punishment or conditioned suppression. Lever-press suppression ratios, which remove variability attributable to pre-punishment differences in reward-seeking, were not correlated with training lever-press rate (punished lever suppression: <italic>r</italic> = −0.06, p=0.69; unpunished lever suppression: <italic>r</italic> = −0.04, p=0.79), again indicating that punishment-driven changes in lever-pressing are unrelated to initial rates of lever pressing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cluster analysis reveals punishment sensitive vs. insensitive phenotypes</title><p>To further understand individual differences in aversive learning we used cluster analysis.

Here we studied individual differences in punishment sensitivity in rats, using a task permitting concurrent assessment of punishment, reward, and fear learning. We identified pronounced individual differences in punishment sensitivity. Using data-driven analytic approaches we show that these individual differences in punishment sensitivity cannot be predicted or explained by individual differences in fear or reward. Rather, across each analysis, punishment, fear and reward were remarkably independent. There was no evidence here to support the possibility that punishment insensitivity is due to reduced aversion sensitivity or reward dominance.</p><p>Instead, punishment insensitivity was a failure of instrumental learning. It could have multiple origins but is most likely due to a failure to encode the instrumental response-punisher association relative to the other associations in the task. Our task involved multiple instrumental (response-outcome) and Pavlovian (stimulus-outcome) contingencies; punishment-sensitive subjects parsed these contingencies to show Pavlovian and instrumental behavioral control whereas insensitive subjects were impaired in partitioning these different contingencies. The strongest evidence for this possibility comes from the cluster analyses. Punishment-insensitive subjects identified by cluster analysis exhibited modest suppression of both punished and unpunished responding. This profile of generalised behavioural suppression is incompatible with the reward dominance account, and is similar to the behaviour shown by subjects receiving response-independent aversive events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunt and Brady, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2018</xref>). That is, punishment-insensitive animals behaved as though they were not causing the aversive events they were experiencing and instead expressed weak but generalised Pavlovian fear. Alternatively, the subjects may have encoded this instrumental association but been unable to inhibit their punished behaviour in accordance with this knowledge. However, any such failure of inhibition must have been specific to the punished response and not a failure of behavioural inhibition more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray and McNaughton, 2000</xref>) because punishment-insensitive subjects showed intact behavioural inhibition during Pavlovian fear.</p><p>It is worth noting that punishment-insensitive rats were a relatively large proportion of the sample. Given the evidence that impaired punishment contingency detection underpinned punishment insensitivity, it is likely the relatively lean punishment contingency applied here (VI60 sec CS+) was a key factor in determining the number of insensitive subjects. Future research examining the effect of this contingency on punishment sensitivity would be useful. Interestingly, insensitivity to punishment in drug seeking has been observed using tighter response-punisher contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marchant et al., 2018</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that drugs of abuse may promote punishment resistance by impairing punishment contingency detection. This is consistent with demonstrations that insensitivity to punishment might be reduced at high shock intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golden et al., 2017</xref>) or after extended punishment training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>). Further work is needed to assess this.</p><p>From a theoretical perspective, perhaps the most surprising finding here was the absence of any notable co-variance between instrumental and Pavlovian aversive learning, even when more powerful methods capable of detecting such underlying relationships were applied (e.g. PCA and FA). Historically, theories of associative learning and motivation have assumed that instrumental and Pavlovian determinants of behaviour share a common basis and that reinforcers have common motivational value that underpins these different forms of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mackintosh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rescorla and Solomon, 1967</xref>). These theories have derived strong support from the inter-changeability of outcomes as reinforcers for Pavlovian and instrumental learning. They remain a dominant approach to understanding aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cain and LeDoux, 2008</xref>). However, it is now well understood that distinct processes govern instrumental versus Pavlovian reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickinson and Balleine, 2002</xref>). Our findings extend this dissociation to aversive learning (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giuliano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pelloux et al., 2007</xref>). We show that if there is any trans-contingency encoding of outcome value, then this contributes little to how animals learn punishment and fear. These two forms of aversive learning were independent of each other suggesting that the motivational underpinnings of Pavlovian fear and punishment are distinct.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for use of punishment sensitivity in assessing motivation. Punishment tasks are widely used to model the adverse consequences of drug seeking and measure motivation to engage in drug-seeking in the face of adverse consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasanetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pascoli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vanderschuren and Everitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vanderschuren et al., 2017</xref>). The persistence of drug-seeking in the face of punishment (i.e. insensitivity to punishment) is invoked as an objective behavioural marker of addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deroche-Gamonet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vanderschuren and Everitt, 2004</xref>). This insensitivity is typically attributed to drug-induced plasticity promoting reward dominance or impulsivity. However, a key finding here is that insensitivity is a characteristic of punishment itself. Punishment insensitivity can emerge from a specific deficit in instrumental aversive learning and can be observed in studies using non-drug rewards. This suggests that punishment insensitivity can pre-exist any drug-induced plasticity promoting reward dominance or impulsivity and this pre-existing difference may provide one basis for persistence of reward seeking in the face of punishment.</p><p>Other clinical populations are characterised by differences in sensitivity to punishment. Increased sensitivity to punishment is characteristic of depressive disorders; these individuals show catastrophic, globalised reactions to punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elliott et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eshel and Roiser, 2010</xref>). Cluster analyses here identified a hyper-sensitive phenotype that initially displayed pronounced and indiscriminate suppression of behaviour, commensurate with pronounced Pavlovian fear, before showing exaggerated punishment and appropriate discrimination between punished and unpunished behaviour. The transition from fear to punishment among hypersensitive animals was rapid and occurred within two sessions. Moreover, although there were no sex differences among the sensitive and insensitive phenotypes, the hypersensitive cluster was comprised exclusively of females. The relatively small number of animals in this hypersensitive cluster preclude further analyses, but the data-driven/bottom-up approach used to identify this cluster of hypersensitive subjects could prove useful for further research.</p><p>In summary, we examined punishment-, fear- and reward-related learning and behaviour in a task that permits assessment each of these processes concurrently in the same animals. We observed pronounced variations in punishment learning. We also identified clinically relevant phenotypes of insensitivity and hyper-sensitivity to punishment. In each case, these individual differences in punishment sensitivity could be explained by failures to encode the instrumental response-punisher association, not by aversion insensitivity or reward dominance. Subjects insensitive to punishment were afraid of the punisher but were unable to change their behaviour to avoid it.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were experimentally naive adult male and female Long-Evans rats (N = 48, 18 females) supplied by the University of New South Wales (Sydney, NSW, Australia).

Punishment learning was defined as suppression of punished lever-pressing during the ITI. This was captured in two ways. The traditional assessment is to measure rates of punished responding relative to unpunished responding during the ITI using a ‘preference ratio’ ([Pun ITI rate/total ITI rate]; previously termed a ‘punishment ratio’). Suppression of punished as well as unpunished responding were also assessed using ‘lever suppression ratios’ (session ITI rate/[training ITI rate + session ITI rate]), which capture rates of responding on each lever relative to rates on the final day of pre-punishment training. This allows separate assessment of punished vs. unpunished responding under punishment, clarifying lever preferences or lack thereof. Finally, CS suppression ratios were calculated to assess suppression of lever-pressing (both levers) during each CS relative to ITI (CS rate/[ITI rate + CS rate]). The CS+ ratio measures Pavlovian fear via conditioned suppression, while the CS- ratio acts as a control comparison.</p><p>All three ratios range from 0 to 1. A CS or lever suppression ratio below 0.5 indicates suppression of lever-pressing relative to baseline, a ratio above 0.5 indicates elevated lever-pressing, while a ratio of 0.5 indicates no change/suppression. In the case of the preference ratio, a ratio of 0.5 indicates no preference between levers during the ITI, while a ratio below 0.5 indicates avoidance of the punished lever relative to the unpunished lever.</p><p>Ratios were analysed using polynomial contrasts in PSY. Significant suppression/bias was determined via single mean tests against the null of 0.5. Differences in ratios between groups and levers, and how these developed over sessions, were assessed via between x within ANOVAs. Lever (punished vs. unpunished) identity and session (linear trend) were used as within-subject factors where applicable. Cluster was applied as a between-subjects factor where applicable.</p><p>All other analyses were conducted in SPSS 25. Relationships between punishment and conditioned suppression were assessed via correlations, principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). CS+ suppression, punished and unpunished lever suppression ratios across the 6 days of conditioned punishment were used as inputs to parsimoniously capture aversively-motivated changes in behaviour while controlling for non-aversion related differences in responding. PCA and FA results were varimax rotated to improve interpretability of components/factors. Relationships between lever-press rates and conditioned suppression across conditioned punishment and last day of lever-press training were also assessed using correlations and principal component analysis.</p><p>Similarity/dissimilarity of suppression ratios or lever-press rates across sessions were also conveyed using multidimensional scaling (SPSS PROXSCAL with the following parameters: simplex, interval transformation, squared Euclidean distance, z-scored). These parameters provided an excellent fit of the data (suppression ratios: normalized raw stress = 0.01831, S-Stress = 0.04746, DAF = 0.98169, Tucker’s coefficient for congruence = 0.99080; lever-press rates/conditioned suppression: normalized raw stress = 0.02288, S-Stress = 0.05471, DAF = 0.97712, Tucker’s coefficient for congruence = 0.98849).</p><p>K-means clustering was used to assess distinct suppression phenotypes. Silhouette values were obtained for 2–7 clusters, revealing marginally higher values for 2–4 cluster solutions. Distribution of sex across clusters was assessed via chi square. To determine the possible contribution of different shock intensities on suppression, a between (cluster) x within (session) ANOVA was conducted on shock intensities. To assess the role of shock intensity on suppression, a univariate ANOVA was conducted for punished lever and conditioned suppression on last day of conditioned punishment using shock intensity as a covariate and cluster as a fixed factor.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Australian Research Council (DP190100482; DP170100075).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All procedures were approved by the UNSW Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) (ACEC16/160B) and in accordance with the code set out by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for the treatment of animals in research.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw data.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-52765-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-52765-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript in Figure 1.

Specifically do the authors think their results mean that this is the only cause of behavior that ignores bad outcomes, or do they see their result as showing the clear and dissociable operation of one cause, without necessarily excluding others as potential causes? If the former, then I think they have a lot more work to do to rule out other possible causes, particularly when considering things such as addiction and depression.</p><p>But my guess is that they mean the latter, and currently they do use language in a number of places that suggest they are more circumspect. I think they just need to be more clear about this. In particular, it seems to me that they have a task that very nicely isolates a particular influence. And they show that influence can be dissociated from other potential causes of insensitivity. But I think they do not rule out a role for insensitivity in the other dimensions in the general ability to control behavior. Perhaps some of the features of their task minimize these influences? For instance, the rats are food deprived, well-trained on the food-seeking task, and on a particular schedule. They are also trained first for the food. These are all interesting variables that may make the reward-seeking more robust or dissociated from the subsequent effect of punishment. Likewise, the fear measure is taken during a CS that comes after the decision to respond. These are interesting decisions in arranging their test behavior, and in some regards, they might even make sense for modeling something like addiction where the reward is well-learned. But they might affect the results, I think. If shock was trained first or if the CS+ were presented prior to the choice, as in a transfer task, might the other mechanisms are be important in the control of behavior by aversive outcomes?</p><p>Of course, I imagine the authors think what I am suggesting is obvious. But the discussion and paper to do not come across like this. It seems to me that some consideration of these dimensions and pointing out the possibility of unique subgroups that could be revealed by other training protocols might be important. Otherwise I think the paper could be misunderstood by those less versed in behavior than the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel and colleagues examined the relationship between conditioned fear, punishment and reward in rats. This was done using a conditioning procedure in which rats were presented with two levers, each producing reward, but with one producing an auditory CS+ and the other an auditory CS-. Punishment was measured by the rat's propensity to press the lever producing the CS- over the CS+. Conditioned suppression was measured by the change in rate of pressing during cue presentation. The results were clear and compelling. All rats acquired conditioned suppression to the CS+, albeit with some individual variance. Punishment was also observed at the group level, but markedly more variability was observed. Subsequent analyses with multi-dimensional scaling and principal components demonstrated that punishment and conditioned suppression were largely unrelated, or even negatively correlated. Even more, individuals with could be classified and punishment-sensitive or insensitive. All in all, the results reveal independent behavioral mechanisms for reward, punishment and suppression.</p><p>All aspects of this study were excellent. The core idea behind the manuscript – to examine the interplay between reward, punishment is suppression is novel and simple. Yet testing these relationships is of obvious importance. Each process is essential to adaptive behavior and each is implicated in array of psychiatric disorders. The execution and analysis of the resulting data was thorough and well-captured the diversity in individual responding. Particularly elegant was the common scale on which punishment and suppression were measured. I believe the results are important and will garner considerable interest.</p><p>There are two areas in which I feel the manuscript could be strengthened and I have one comment concerning the language used to describe the procedure. These are provided below.</p><p>Measuring conditioned suppression</p><p>I had difficulty finding which lever was used to measure conditioned suppression. Were baseline and cue rates taken from both trial types? Or was only the CS- lever used because pressing was biased towards this lever? Specifically, I could not find a description of the lever used for the main result:</p><p>&quot;There was also robust evidence for Pavlovian fear (Figure 2B). Conditioned suppression elicited by presentations of the CS+ also increased across training (F (1,47) = 35.1; p &lt;.001, ηp2 = 0.427), with significant suppression being observed for each session (all F (1,47) &gt; 54.7; p &lt;.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.537).&quot;</p><p>I also could not determine which lever was being used for suppression in the main figure (Figure 2).</p><p>If the authors could specify exactly which lever(s) was used for calculating suppression ratio it would be helpful.</p><p>Examining reward</p><p>I was very impressed with the author's treatment of conditioned suppression and punishment, both of which were well captured by use of a ratio. However, reward responding seemed less well captured by this measure. At times, I could not determine what measure was being used to assess reward responding. I realize this is difficult while the conditioning procedure is ongoing, as biases in lever pressing should be observed during cue and ITI periods.</p><p>However, a pure measure of lever-pressing is available in the lever-press training prior to the beginning of fear discrimination. I am curious if lever press rates observed during this time predict performance in punishment and suppression. For example, rats showing high press rates prior to discrimination may be punishment-insensitive rats OR these rats may show less conditioned suppression. These relationships could be initially examined with simple tests like Pearson's correlation coefficient. This would provide a clearer and more direct examination of the relationship between reward and conditioned punishment &amp; conditioned suppression. If relationships are found, multi-dimensional scaling and principal components could be performed with this factor.</p><p>Punishment vs. Conditioned Punishment</p><p>The Abstract and Introduction describe the impetus of the study to disentangle reward, punishment and Pavlovian fear (suppression). For the most part, this is reasonable and sets up the reader for the study performed. As the authors are aware (indeed, Dr. Killcross is an author) this procedure was initially designed to dissociate conditioned suppression from conditioned punishment (Killcross et al., 1997). Punishment and conditioned punishment are likely to require independent + overlapping neural and behavioral mechanisms. For this reason, I think it would be prudent to state in the Abstract that conditioned punishment is measured. This should also be stated at the end of the Introduction – when the behavioral procedure is discussed. Indeed, when I first started reading the manuscript, I assumed direct punishment was going to be assessed. Ultimately, I think the use of conditioned punishment – as the authors performed – was more appropriate. Making this clear at the outset of the manuscript will better prepare the reader for the experiment that was performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent paper in which the authors used a creative two-lever operant procedure to study individual differences in punishment responding and the relationship between responding to punishment of food reward, conditioned fear responding to the punishment cue, and responding for food reward.

The main important general conclusion is that punishment insensitivity is not due to either reduced aversion sensitivity or higher reward value.
