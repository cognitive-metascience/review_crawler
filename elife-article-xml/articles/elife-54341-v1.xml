lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) can be epigenetically inherited independently of underlying DNA sequence. To gain insight into the mechanisms that mediate epigenetic inheritance, we used a <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> inducible heterochromatin formation system to perform a genetic screen for mutations that abolish heterochromatin inheritance without affecting its establishment. We identified mutations in several pathways, including the conserved and essential Rix1-associated complex (henceforth the rixosome), which contains RNA endonuclease and polynucleotide kinase activities with known roles in ribosomal RNA processing. We show that the rixosome is required for spreading and epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin in fission yeast. Viable rixosome mutations that disrupt its association with Swi6/HP1 fail to localize to heterochromatin, lead to accumulation of heterochromatic RNAs, and block spreading of H3K9me and silencing into actively transcribed regions. These findings reveal a new pathway for degradation of heterochromatic RNAs with essential roles in heterochromatin spreading and inheritance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>RNA degradation</kwd><kwd>H3K9 methylation</kwd><kwd>Rix1</kwd><kwd>rixosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM072805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moazed</surname><given-names>Danesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moazed</surname><given-names>Danesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shipkovenska</surname><given-names>Gergana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Summer student internship award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Durango</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical studies show that a conserved ribosome biogenesis complex also localizes to heterochromatin, where it triggers RNA degradation and promotes the spreading and epigenetic inheritance of histone methylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterochromatic domains of DNA are a conserved feature of eukaryotic chromosomes and play central roles in regulation of transcription, inactivation of transposons, and maintenance of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allshire and Madhani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saksouk et al., 2015</xref>). Heterochromatin is established by the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes to nucleation sites, followed by spreading of the modification by a read-write mechanism, which involves recognition of the initially deposited modification and deposition of the same modification on histones in adjacent nucleosomes. The so-formed broad domains of repression can be epigenetically inherited through many cell divisions. Recent studies using inducible heterochromatin formation strategies have demonstrated that DNA sequence-independent and DNA sequence-dependent pathways work together with the histone modification directed read-write to mediate epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Moazed, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laprell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coleman and Struhl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms that mediate faithful epigenetic inheritance are not fully understood.</p><p>In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> heterochromatin is assembled at pericentromeric DNA regions, telomeres, the mating type locus, and the ribosomal DNA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holoch and Moazed, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These regions are associated with histone H3K9 methylation, a conserved marker of heterochromatin, which is catalyzed by the Clr4 (Suv39h) methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>). Studies using an inducible heterochromatin formation system demonstrated that in some cells heterochromatin can be inherited independently of any input from underlying DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies, H3K9 methylation is induced by fusion of a Clr4 fragment, containing the methyltransferase domain but lacking the chromodomain (CD) required for recognition of H3K9me, to the bacterial Tetracycline Repressor (TetR-Clr4ÎCD), which binds to <italic>tetO</italic> arrays inserted at a euchromatic locus. The inheritance of the inducible heterochromatic domain depends on the read-write capability of Clr4 and can be readily observed in cells in which the anti-silencing factor <italic>epe1<sup>+</sup></italic>, encoding a Jmjc family demethylase member, has been deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trewick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sorida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>). Mutation or deletion of the chromodomain of Clr4, required for efficient read-write, specifically disrupt epigenetic inheritance without any effect on heterochromatin establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>). In wild-type <italic>epe1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, in addition to the read-write mechanism, epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin requires input from specific DNA sequences or a locally generated siRNA amplification loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang and Moazed, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). The development of inducible heterochromatin domains, and the demonstration that they could be epigenetically inherited, provides a unique opportunity to delineate the pathways that are specifically required for heterochromatin inheritance.</p><p>To investigate whether other pathways work together with the read-write mechanism to maintain heterochromatin, we used the inducible heterochromatin system to conduct a genetic screen for mutations that abolish heterochromatin inheritance without affecting its establishment. Our screen identified mutations in several pathways, including mutations in known heterochromatin associated factors, components of the DNA replication machinery, and in three subunits of an RNA processing complex, composed of Rix1, Crb3, Grc3, Mdn1, Las1 and Ipi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schillewaert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fromm et al., 2017</xref>). This complex, which we propose to name the ârixosomeâ, is conserved from yeast to human, has well-characterized essential functions in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing and has been previously shown to localize to heterochromatin in a Swi6-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iglesias et al., 2020</xref>), but its role in heterochromatin function remains unknown. We show that the rixosome targets heterochromatic RNAs for degradation through the conserved 5ââ3â exoribonuclease pathway to clear a path for Clr4-mediated read-write.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epigenetic maintenance defective (<italic>emd</italic>) mutants</title><p>Since the requirements for establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin cannot be readily separated at endogenous sites, the identification of pathways specifically required for epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin has not been possible. To identify such pathways, we employed an inducible heterochromatin system which allows for separation of the establishment and maintenance phases of heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Heterochromatin is established by the recruitment of a TetR-Clr4ÎCD fusion to a <italic>10xtetO-ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter in the absence of tetracycline. The TetR-Clr4ÎCD fusion is then released by the addition of tetracycline, which disrupts the interaction of the TetR domain with the <italic>10xtetO</italic> targeting sequence. The maintenance of silencing is monitored by the color of the colonies grown on low adenine medium, supplemented with tetracycline. <italic>ade6<sup>OFF</sup></italic> cells give rise to red colonies, due to the accumulation of a red intermediate in the adenine biosynthetic pathway, while <italic>ade6<sup>ON</sup></italic> cells give rise to white colonies. In the absence of the anti-silencing factor Epe1 (<italic>epe1Î</italic>), growth on tetracycline-containing medium results in a variegated phenotype, due to the stable propagation of the heterochromatic domain in roughly 60% of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A Genetic Screen Identifies Factors Essential for Heterochromatin Inheritance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram representing an inducible reporter system for heterochromatin establishment and inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>10xtetO</italic>, 10 copies of the <italic>tet</italic> operator; TetR-Clr4ÎCD, fusion of TetR and Clr4 lacking the chromodomain; H3K9me, di- and tri-methyl histone H3 Lys 9; TET, tetracycline.

We plated the mutagenized cultures on low adenine medium lacking tetracycline and then replica plated the mutant colonies on low adenine medium containing tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We screened the resulting replicas for colonies which lost the silencing of the <italic>10xtetO-ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter in the presence of tetracycline, but not in its absence. Such colonies represent mutants which are specifically defective for the maintenance of silencing. We screened 80,000 colonies and obtained 83 apparent <italic>emd</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). About half of these mutants showed single-locus segregation patterns in random spore analysis when backcrossed to the original reporter strain. The remaining mutants showed complex segregation patterns, consistent with cumulative weak effects from multiple contributing loci. We proceeded to characterize the <italic>emd</italic> mutants with single gene segregation patterns, as these likely represent the factors with the strongest effects on heterochromatin maintenance.</p><p>While all <italic>emd</italic> mutants lost silencing on tetracycline-containing medium, they differed in their ability to establish efficient silencing on medium lacking tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). In some mutants, the silencing of the <italic>10xtetO-ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter was slightly weaker than that of the non-mutagenized strain, indicating that the mutated genes likely play a role in heterochromatin establishment, in addition to their role in maintenance. In the remaining mutants, the establishment of silencing was either as strong as or stronger than that of the non-mutagenized reporter strain, suggesting that the underlying mutations are specifically required for heterochromatin maintenance. The stronger than wild-type establishment may reflect weakened heterochromatin structure at the endogenous domains and the resulting redistribution of silencing factors from the endogenous to the ectopic domain.</p><p>To isolate the variants linked to the maintenance defect in each of the <italic>emd</italic> mutants, we performed whole genome sequencing combined with pooled linkage analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birkeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iida et al., 2014</xref>). Out of the 40 <italic>emd</italic> mutants, 30 yielded high confidence single nucleotide variants in coding regions of the genome (variants present inÂ &gt;90% of the mutant spore pool), one had no coding variant despite good genome coverage, and the remaining 9 had insufficient sequencing coverage to be analyzed. The identified mutations mapped to 19 genes, most of which encode subunits of one of five complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Among these are the CLRC and SHREC complexes, which play key roles in heterochromatin formation, and novel mutations in genes with no known function in heterochromatin maintenance. These included three independently identified mutations in the N-terminal tail of histone H3, encoded by <italic>hht2,</italic> and multiple mutations in the Mrc1, Mcl1 and Pol1 components of the DNA replication machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we isolated mutations in multiple genes, encoding factors broadly associated with the nuclear periphery (<italic>bsd1</italic>, <italic>nup211</italic>, <italic>mpd2</italic>), a subunit of the major Ccr4-Not deadenylase complex (<italic>ccr4</italic>), a universal stress family protein (<italic>dbs2</italic>), and a vacuolar sorting protein (<italic>bro1</italic>). Finally, we identified four mutations in three genes â <italic>crb3</italic>, <italic>grc3</italic> and <italic>mdn1 â</italic> coding for subunits of an essential ribosome biogenesis complex that we refer to as the rixosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and are the focus of this study.</p><p>The rixosome contains six unique subunits â three structural subunits Crb3, Rix1 and Ipi1, which form the core of the complex, and three catalytic subunits â the endonuclease Las1, the polynucleotide kinase Grc3 and the AAA-type ATPase Mdn1, which are involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fromm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasse et al., 2015</xref>). All subunits are essential for viability and are conserved from yeast to mammals, including humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our screen identified four mutations in three different subunits of the complex â Crb3, Grc3 and Mdn1. We validated three of the mutations by reconstituting them de novo in the original reporter strain. All de novo constructed strains reproduced the mutant phenotypes in plating assays on low adenine medium in the presence and absence of tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To confirm that the observed maintenance defects were due to loss of heterochromatin, we followed the propagation of the heterochromatin specific histone H3 Lys9 di-methylation (H3K9me2) in the absence of tetracycline and in cultures treated with tetracycline for 10 generations. In the absence of tetracycline, the rixosome mutants showed similar levels of H3K9me2 as the wild-type, which is consistent with the lack of silencing defects under the establishment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). By contrast, in the tetracycline treated cultures, the levels of H3K9me2 were drastically reduced in the mutants, but not in the wild-type, indicating that loss of silencing of the <italic>10xtetO-ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter under the maintenance conditions resulted from loss of the underlying heterochromatic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Rixosome is Required for the Inheritance of Heterochromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subunits of the rixosome, their specific activities in the context of ribosome biogenesis, and their human orthologs.Â Subunits identified in our screen are highlighted in bold.

The remaining H3K9 methylation levels reflect ongoing heterochromatin maintenance requiring the Clr4 read-write mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>).

The rixosome co-purifies with native heterochromatin fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iglesias et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore used this native purification protocol to test whether the rixosome mutations affect its interaction with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iglesias et al., 2020</xref>). We tagged the C-terminus of the Crb3 subunit with a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puig et al., 2001</xref>), which did not interfere with the maintenance of silencing at the <italic>10xtetO-ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

The Crb3-TAP purification from wild-type cells pulled down the core subunits reported previously to be part of the rixosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) and its rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis interaction network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref> Tables S3 and S4). Importantly, we also recovered the heterochromatin-associated protein Swi6, which was previously shown to associate with the rixosome in an H3K9me-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iglesias et al., 2020</xref>). When we purified Crb3-TAP from cells carrying the <italic>crb3-D198N</italic> mutation, we detected a modest reduction in the amount of co-precipitated Swi6 in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), which was not explained by a decrease in the overall Swi6 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). However, other interactions, including those between the subunits of the rixosome complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), were also weakly affected, indicating that the stability of the complex in the <italic>crb3-D198</italic> mutant may have been compromised. These results were consistent with the mild rRNA processing defects observed in this mutant at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). By contrast, when we purified Crb3-TAP from cells carrying the <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> mutation, the levels of Swi6 copurifying with the mutant complex were dramatically reduced, but the mutation had little or no effect on the overall integrity of the rixosome and its other interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Furthermore, neither the <italic>crb3-D198N</italic>, nor the <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> mutations had any effect on the total levels of Swi6 in the cell, ruling out that the loss of association of the rixosome with Swi6 could be an indirect effect of reduced Swi6 expression or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that the Grc3-V70M mutation specifically disrupts the association of the rixosome complex with Swi6 and further support a specific role for the complex in heterochromatin maintenance, independent of its essential function in ribosome biogenesis. The Grc3-V70M mutation is located in the unstructured N-terminus of Grc3 within a VxVxV sequence motif, a variant of the consensus PxVxL motif of proteins, which interact directly with the chromoshadow domain of HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thiru et al., 2004</xref>).

Under establishment condition, we did not observe an increase in <italic>gfp</italic> reporter RNA levels in the <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> mutant relative to wild-type cells. We reasoned that other RNA degradation pathways may act redundantly to mask the effects of the rixosome on RNA levels under strong establishment conditions at the reporter locus.

Nevertheless, we reasoned that since the rixosome can localize to pericentromeric repeats through association with Swi6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), it might participate in degradation of RNAs transcribed from the repeats in a parallel and redundant manner alongside RNAi. If this were the case, we would expect an increase in the level of siRNAs in the absence of the rixosome as more RNA would be available for processing by the RNAi machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We assessed the levels of siRNA generated from the pericentromeric <italic>dg</italic> repeats in wild-type, <italic>grc3-V70M,</italic> and <italic>dhp1-1</italic> cells by northern blotting and, consistent with the above hypothesis, found that both mutations caused a marked increase in siRNAs accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, lanes 1â3 and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>).

Consistent with the requirement for Swi6 in recruitment of the rixosome to heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iglesias et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>dg</italic> siRNA levels were similar between <italic>swi6Î grc3<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>swi6Î grc3-V70M</italic> cells, indicating that the ability of the rixosome pathway to compete with RNAi required its Swi6-mediated recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, lanes 5 and 6, and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C,D,E</xref>). Swi6 stabilizes the RNAi machinery on heterochromatin and in its absence centromeric siRNA levels are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motamedi et al., 2004</xref>).

The rixosome is recruited to heterochromatin by the HP1 protein, Swi6, to promote the degradation of RNAs transcribed by RNA pol II within heterochromatic domains. In the context of heterochromatin, the rixosome may perform a function that is analogous to that of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex at euchromatic mRNAs or the integrator complex which has been shown to release paused RNA pol II complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi and Manley, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>). However, unlike CPSF, which is recruited by specific polyadenylation signals in the 3â ends of mRNAs, the rixosome is recruited throughout heterochromatic domains via association with Swi6/HP1 and targets heterochromatic RNAs for degradation rather than polyadenylation and export. The role for the rixosome in heterochromatic RNA degradation is supported by our demonstration that (1) heterochromatic RNAs accumulate in cells carrying rixosome mutations, (2) the kinase activity of the Grc3 subunit of the rixosome, which prepares RNA for degradation by the 5ââ3â exoribonuclease Dhp1/XRN2, is required for its heterochromatin maintenance function, and (3) a mutation in Dhp1 has the same heterochromatin formation defects as rixosome mutants. The conservation of all rixosome subunits from yeast to human raises the possibility that it functions in chromatin silencing in other eukaryotes.</p><p>Our findings suggest a new role for RNA degradation, promoted by recruitment of the rixosome, in formation and epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin. The rixosome contains subunits with multiple catalytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schillewaert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fromm et al., 2017</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These activities, which take place on the pre-60S ribosomal particles, include the Las1-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) in 27S pe-rRNA, followed by phosphorylation of the 5â-OH cleavage product to generate a 5â-PO<sub>4</sub> end, which becomes a substrate for trimming by the 5ââ3â exonuclease Dhp1/XRN2 leading to formation of mature 25S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fromm et al., 2017</xref>). The cleaved 3â end, containing 2â,3â cyclic phosphate, is trimmed by the 3ââ5â RNA exosome to generate mature 5.8S RNA. Finally, the dynein-related AAA ATPase subunit,Â Mdn1, appears to mechanically remove biogenesis factors from the pre-60S particle to generate 60S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings suggest that, in addition to these essential functions, the rixosome is recruited to heterochromatin where its RNA processing activities are utilized to degrade heterochromatic RNAs in order to promote the spreading and epigenetic inheritance of H3K9me (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for rixosome-mediated degradation of nascent transcripts and its role in spreading and inheritance of heterochromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The rixosome localizes to heterochromatin via a direct interaction between the N-terminus of Grc3 with Swi6. The endonuclease Las1 and the polynucleotide kinase (PNK) Grc3, subunits of the rixosome, cleave nascent (left, pol II-associated) and/or mature chromatin-associated (right) transcripts and phosphorylate the free 5â hydroxyl end at the site of cleavage, respectively.

These phenotypes are accompanied by accumulation of transgene RNA in rixosome mutants. Notably, the spreading defect only manifests itself at heterochromatin regions which lack a redundant RNA clearance pathway, namely RNAi. For example, at pericentromeric DNA repeats where the RNAi machinery is recruited to nascent noncoding RNAs and processes them into siRNAs, the rixosome contributes to noncoding RNA degradation, but is not required for H3K9me spreading, silencing, or inheritance â unless the RNAi pathway is rendered inactive by mutation. By contrast, at the boundaries of the mating type locus, where no redundant RNA degradation pathway operates, rixosome-mediated RNA clearance is essential for heterochromatin spreading and silencing. The rixosome thus defines a second RNA degradation mechanism that localizes to heterochromatin, through direct recruitment by Swi6, and plays an indispensable role in heterochromatin spreading and maintenance in transcription units that are not associated with RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Both the spreading and epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin require the read-write capability of the Clr4 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jih et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>). During read-write, Clr4 binds to nucleosomes containing pre-existing H3K9me and catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 in adjacent nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>). Fission yeast heterochromatic domains are associated with low levels of transcription and the synthesized RNA has been suggested to be retained by Swi6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">BÃ¼hler et al., 2007</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kloc et al., 2008</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2008</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jih et al., 2017</xref>).Â The rixosome may cleave nascent pol II-associated RNAs or mature chromatin associated RNAs in the path of nucleosome-bound Clr4. In this model, in the absence of the rixosome, the RNA pol II complex or chromatin-associated RNAs would create a barrier that blocks Clr4 read-write (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which is required for both spreading of H3K9me from a nucleation point and its copying onto newly deposited nucleosomes following DNA replication.</p><p>In summary, the profound requirement for the rixosome in the spreading and epigenetic inheritance of H3K9me mirrors the requirement for the Clr4 read-write capability and supports the idea that the rixosome and read-write act coordinately during spreading and inheritance of H3K9me. Our findings suggest that heterochromatin-associated rixosome acts as a key trigger that promotes RNA degradation by the Dhp1/XRN2 exoribonuclease. Finally, we note that subunits of the mammalian rixosome have been reported to interact with chromatin components and mutations in multiple subunits of the complex are associated with human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hussey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sareddy and Vadlamudi, 2016</xref>). It will be important to understand the extent to which chromatin-dependent functions of the rixosome may contribute to the regulation of gene expression and development in mammals and other eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Proteins were digested with trypsin (Promega #V5111) in 200 mM HEPES buffer pH 8.5 with 2% acetonitrile (v/v) overnight at 37Â°C. For direct TMT peptide labeling of digests, TMT-10plex reagents from Thermo Fisher Scientific (#90406) were used. After quenching with hydroxylamine at 0.3% (v/v), reactions were acidified with formic acid and peptides purified by reversed phase C<sub>18</sub> chromatography via stage tips. Data were collected on an Orbitrap Lumos instrument with a multi-notch MS<sup>3</sup> method. Prior to injection, peptides were separated by HPLC with an EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific) with a 100 Î¼m inner diameter column and a 2.6 Î¼m Accucore C<sub>18</sub> matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 4 hr acidic acetonitrile gradient.

For TMT quantification, an SPS-MS<sup>3</sup> method was used with HDC fragments scanned in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50,000 at 200 Th with a maximum injection time of 200 ms. Peptides were searched with an in-house software based on SEQUEST (v.28, rev. 12) against a forward and reverse database of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> proteome database (Uniprot) with human contaminants added. Searches had a mass tolerance of 50 ppm for precursors and a MS<sup>2</sup> fragment ion tolerance of 0.9 Da. For searches, 2 missed cleavages were allowed and methionine oxidation was searched for dynamically (+15.9949 Da). After linear discriminant analysis (LDA), peptide false discovery rate was 1%, as was the FDR for final collapsed proteins. MS<sup>1</sup> data were post-search, calibrated, and the search performed again. For TMT quantification, peptides with an isolation specificity ofÂ &gt;70% and a summed TMT signal-to-noise (s/n)&gt;200 were filtered. Proteins with at least two peptide quantification events were considered for analysis. For all 1139 quantified proteins, an enrichment score was calculated as the summed TMT signal-to-noise (TMT sum s/n) ratio of the tagged wild-type sample over the untagged TMT sum s/n of the wild-type control. The top 10% most enriched proteins (118) contained all known components of the Rix1 core complex (Crb3/Ipi3, Rix1/Ipi2, Ipi1, Las1, Grc3, Mdn1), many of the pre-60S ribosome particle components (ribosomal and ribosome biogenesis proteins), Swi6 (required for the recruitment of the Rix1 complex to heterochromatin) and nuclear export factors known to be involved in the shuttling of the pre-60S complex to the cytosol. The wild-type/mutant fold change score for each protein was calculated as the ratio of the summed TMT s/n in the wild-type over the mutant IPs, after subtraction of the background from the untagged control and correction for the abundance of the bait protein. The log transformed fold-change scores were plotted against the log transformed enrichment scores to identify proteins which were over- or under-represented in the mutant sample relative to the wild-type.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John L Rinn (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Moazed and colleagues report the identification of rixosome, a RNA degradation complex previously implicated in rRNA biogenesis , that is important for heterochromatin spreading and inheritance in fission yeast. The authors conduct a forward genetic screen with an inducible heterochromatin system, and show that several hits comprise a RNA degradation complex they term the rixosome. Rixosome interacts with Clr4 H3K9 methylase and generates RNA fragments that are substrates for XRN2/Dhp1 exonuclease. Additional functional and genetic interaction studies show that the rixosome functions redundantly with RNAi pathway to ensure heterochromatin spreading. Altogether, this study expands on previous findings (Kitano et al., 2011; Chalamcharla et al., 2015; Tucker et al., 2016) and brings them into a new and exciting perspective. Overall this work identifies important mechanisms for the interplay between RNA and heterochromatin, and should be published after the following points are clarified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Interplay between rixosome and RNAi needs to be clarified. On one hand, authors claim that these pathways compete and bring as evidence increase of sRNA in <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> mutant (Figure 4H lane 2). On the other hand, the authors argue that rixosome and RNAi work together in a redundant manner for heterochromatin spreading and inheritance. E.g. in Figure 2E and F <italic>ago1Î</italic> seem to increase the effect of rixosome mutation suggesting a cooperative action in the maintenance of H3Kme at endogenous heterochromatic domain. Similarly Figure 5 and 6 argue for the redundancy model. The confusion arises from how rixosome has specificity for which RNA. If rixosome only cleaves euchromatin RNA, then RNAi and rixosome could work together. If rixosome cleaves heterochromatic RNA that is necessary for RNAi-dependent heterochromatin, then rixosome would counteract RNAi. Please address experimentally or comment on whether rixosome has specificity toward different classes of RNAs.</p><p>2) Another approach the authors took for testing a post-transcriptional role of RIXC in silencing are ChIP experiments with RNA Pol II. These revealed only mild (i.e. 2-fold: <italic>caf1grc3-V70M</italic> vs. <italic>caf1</italic> at <italic>10xtetO-ura-gfp</italic>; Figure 4F) or no increase of RNA Pol II (grc3-V70 vs. wild type at <italic>L(BglII):ade6</italic>; Figure 5F), which let the authors conclude that transcription is not affected. However, also RNA levels were only moderately increased in those mutants, and even clr4 mutants did not show changes for RNA Pol II for one of the reporters (Figure 5F). Thus, rather than ruling out transcriptional changes, these RNA Pol II ChIP experiments appear to be not sufficiently sensitive. A better approach for measuring transcription and RNA turnover would be NET-seq and pulse-labeling with 4-thiouridine (4SU) (Mata and Wise, 2017), respectively. Otherwise, these statements should be toned down.</p><p>3) By northern blots, the authors showed increased sRNA in <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> and <italic>dhp1-1</italic> single and double mutants, which seems to be consistent with their model. However, no increase was seen for <italic>swi6</italic> and the corresponding double mutant <italic>swi6grc3-V70M</italic>. These results seem inconsistent and raise doubts whether this assay is quantitative and reliable. Experiments should be repeated and sRNA levels should be quantitatively assessed, and appropriate loading controls that can also be quantified (other than SybrGold stain) should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54341.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Interplay between rixosome and RNAi needs to be clarified.

Thank you for explicitly describing the source of the confusion. Our findings clearly indicate that the 2 pathways can act on the same RNA substrates at the pericentromeric repeats (as the reviewer implies, the pathways act in parallel or compete for the same RNA substrates). Thus, when rixosome function at heterochromatin is eliminated, more RNA substrate is available for processing by the RNAi machinery, resulting in higher siRNA levels in rixosome mutant cells (new Figure 5G, lane 2). Conversely, in the absence of RNAi, the residual H3K9me at the pericentromeric repeats becomes entirely rixosome-dependent, indicating that the rixosome, and by implication its RNA degradation activity, is required for H3K9me maintenance in the absence of RNAi (Figure 2F, G).</p><p>The data presented in our manuscript clearly demonstrate that the rixosome is <italic>not</italic> necessary for RNAi-dependent heterochromatin, as indicated by the observations that (1) RNAi-dependent H3K9me and silencing at pericentromeric DNA repeats is not affected by rixosome mutations [Figure 2 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2] and (2) mutations in the rixosome result in increased pericentromeric siRNA levels [Figure 2G]. We have strived to modify the text and figure legends to make these points clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another approach the authors took for testing a post-transcriptional role of RIXC in silencing are ChIP experiments with RNA Pol II. These revealed only mild (i.e. 2-fold: caf1 grc3-V70M vs. caf1 at 10xtetO-ura-gfp; Figure 4F) or no increase of RNA Pol II (grc3-V70 vs. wild type at L(BglII):ade6; Figure 5F), which let the authors conclude that transcription is not affected. However, also RNA levels were only moderately increased in those mutants, and even clr4 mutants did not show changes for RNA Pol II for one of the reporters (Figure 5F). Thus, rather than ruling out transcriptional changes, these RNA Pol II ChIP experiments appear to be not sufficiently sensitive. A better approach for measuring transcription and RNA turnover would be NET-seq and pulse-labeling with 4-thiouridine (4SU) (Mata and Wise, 2017), respectively. Otherwise, these statements should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment but believe that our presentation of the RNA Pol II ChIP and the qRT data may have led to a misunderstanding. As the reviewer states, we see only modest changes in RNA Pol II occupancy in <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> versus wild type for 2 different reporter genes at 2 different heterochromatic regions [<italic>10xtetO::ura4-gfp</italic> and <italic>L(BglII):ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> loci](new Figures 5D, E and Figure 6F). Regarding the possibility that âRNA Pol II ChIP experiments appear to be not sufficiently sensitiveâ, we believe that the data we had already presented rules out this possibility for the first locus. In Figure 5E, we included a crucial control in which heterochromatin is absent and the reporter gene is maximally derepressed (tetR-clr4-I, <italic>clr4Î</italic>). Comparison of tetR-clr4-I, <italic>clr4Î</italic> mutant with wild type (clr4+) control in Figures 5E shows that our RNA Pol II ChIP signal at this locus displays a large dynamic range of ~120 fold. Despite little or no change in RNA Pol II occupancy in the <italic>caf1Îgrc3-V70M</italic> double mutant cells (Figure 5E), we observe a 5-fold increase in RNA levels (Figure 5C). It is important to note that these experiments were performed under establishment conditions in which we show that the rixosome is not required for silencing (Figure 1D). The data show that even under conditions in which the reporter gene is strongly silenced, we could detect some increase in RNA levels in the absence of rixosome-mediated RNA degradation, which supports the model that the RNA processing/degradation activities of the rixosome are required for heterochromatin maintenance. In the revised manuscript, we provide further support for this idea by demonstrating that the catalytic polynucleotide kinase activity of the Grc3 subunit of the complex â which prepares RNA substrates for degradation by Dhp1/XRN2 â is required for heterochromatin maintenance (new Figure 4).</p><p>Regarding modest increases in RNA Pol II occupancy and RNA levels in rixosome and clr4 mutants at the mating type locus (new Figure 6E and F), we failed to note that some transcriptional repression at the mating locus occurs in a heterochromatin-independent manner. It has previously been shown that a heterochromatin-independent (Clr4- and H3K9me-independent) mechanism represses the expression of the <italic>mat2P</italic> gene (Hansen et al., PLOSgenetics 2011, cited in the revised manuscript). Our results are therefore consistent with previous findings and indicate that loss of rixosome localization to the mating type locus has little or no effect on the H3K9me-independent repression of mat2P.</p><p>We were unable to more fully address the possible lack of sensitivity in detection of changes in RNA Pol II occupancy noted by the reviewer due to shutdown of laboratories to combat COVID19 spreading. We are eager to perform the nascent transcript experiments mentioned by the reviewers in the near future. We have removed the section in the Discussion where we proposed that the at some target genes [such as <italic>L(BglII)::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic>] the rixosome may function in silencing by promoting RNA degradation without an effect on RNA Pol II occupancy. We note that whether or not the rixosome affects RNA Pol II occupancy at target loci, our conclusion that its RNA degradation activities are critical for heterochromatin spreading and epigenetic inheritance remain valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) By northern blots, the authors showed increased sRNA in grc3-V70M and dhp1-1 single and double mutants, which seems to be consistent with their model. However, no increase was seen for swi6 and the corresponding double mutant swi6 grc3-V70M. These results seem inconsistent and raise doubts whether this assay is quantitative and reliable. Experiments should be repeated and sRNA levels should be quantitatively assessed, and appropriate loading controls that can also be quantified (other than SybrGold stain) should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewers, we quantified the siRNA data for the appropriate mutant cells and used <italic>snoR69 and a spike-in 20mer RNA</italic> as loading controls for the northern blots (new Figure 5G and H and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C-E).</p><p>We apologize for not describing these results more clearly. As noted by the reviewer, we observed increased sRNA levels in <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> and dhp1-1 single and double mutants, which is consistent with a role for rixosome- and Dhp1-dependent RNA degradation at pericentromeric DNA repeats. We note that the absence of an effect of the <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> in <italic>swi6Î</italic> cells is exactly what we would expect because (1) in <italic>swi6Î</italic> cells, the rixosome is no longer recruited to pericentromeric DNA repeats [Iglesias et al., 2020, Supplementary Figure 1] and (2) the <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> mutation disrupts the interaction of the rixosome with Swi6 and its localization to heterochromatin (this study, Figure 3). We would therefore not expect the <italic>grc3-V70M</italic> mutant to have any effect on dg siRNA levels as each mutation (<italic>swi6Î</italic> and <italic>grc3-V70M</italic>) abolishes the localization of the rixosome to heterochromatin, i.e., they act in the same pathway.</p><p>Finally, we would like to note that the lack of an increase in siRNA levels in cells lacking Swi6 is an expected result. We and others have previously shown that Swi6 stabilizes the RNAi machinery on chromatin and is required, to a variable degree depending on the locus, for accumulation of siRNAs. Therefore, although in swi6D cells, the rixosome is no longer recruited to heterochromatin, in these cells, siRNAs do not accumulate to the same level as swi6+grc3D or swi6+dhp1D cells. We have now included this explanation in the text (page 16, lines 368-372).</p></body></sub-article></article>
