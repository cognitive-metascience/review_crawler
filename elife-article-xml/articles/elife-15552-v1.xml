It is composed of glucose polymers that form massive semi-crystalline granules. Its precise structure and composition determine its functionality and thus applications; however, there is no versatile model system allowing the relationships between the biosynthetic apparatus, glucan structure and properties to be explored. Here, we expressed the core Arabidopsis starch-biosynthesis pathway in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> purged of its endogenous glycogen-metabolic enzymes. Systematic variation of the set of biosynthetic enzymes illustrated how each affects glucan structure and solubility. Expression of the complete set resulted in dense, insoluble granules with a starch-like semi-crystalline organization, demonstrating that this system indeed simulates starch biosynthesis. Thus, the yeast system has the potential to accelerate starch research and help create a holistic understanding of starch granule biosynthesis, providing a basis for the targeted biotechnological improvement of crops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15552.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15552.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15552.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most plants and algae produce a carbohydrate called starch, which provides the plant with a dense store of energy. Starch is also the main carbohydrate in our diet and its unusual physical properties mean that it has many industrial uses. It is made of two different sugar-based molecules known as glucans and forms large, partially crystalline granules inside plant cells. Several enzymes are known to be involved in making starch, yet it is not clear exactly how the process works.</p><p>Animals and fungi cannot make starch but they do make another type of carbohydrate called glycogen, which is also a glucan. Yeast is a single-celled fungus that is often used in research because it is easy to genetically engineer and quick to grow. To study the plant enzymes that make starch in more detail, Pfister et al. aimed to genetically engineer yeast to make their own starch.</p><p>For the experiments, different combinations of enzymes involved in starch production in a plant called <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were inserted into mutant yeast cells that were unable to make glycogen. The experiments show that all the plant enzymes are active in yeast and retain the roles that they perform in plants. Some of the enzyme combinations yielded glucan granules that occupied a large part of the yeast cell. These granules had many of the physical characteristics of plant starch, showing that yeast can be used as a system to better understand how starch is made.</p><p>Important next steps will be to insert more plant proteins into the yeast and to fine-tune the production of these proteins. This should help researchers to design starches with desired properties in yeast and ultimately engineer crop plants to produce them.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15552.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15552.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>starch biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>metabolic engineering</kwd><kwd>amylopectin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_153144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeeman</surname><given-names>Samuel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31CP30_163503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeeman</surname><given-names>Samuel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yeast cells can be engineered to study starch, the semi-crystalline storage carbohydrate from plants that is central to human nutrition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Starch is an agricultural raw material coveted for its nutritional value, but also for its functional properties, which have extensive applications in the food industry, in paper manufacturing, and in the production of biodegradable materials, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blennow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, special starches with reduced digestibility (resistant starch) are considered to be health-promoting, having a lower glycemic index and serving as a form of dietary fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Raigond et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Both industrial use and nutritional benefits depend on distinct biophysical characteristics and therefore on the underlying structure of starch. Starch is comprised of two α-polyglucan components (here named glucans): large moderately-branched amylopectin molecules and interspersing small, near-linear amylose molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manners, 1989</xref>). Both are built from chains of α-1,4 linked glucose units that are connected via α-1,6-linkages (branch points). In amylopectin, the major and essential component, the branching pattern is non-random, giving rise to clusters of unbranched chain segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pérez and Bertoft, 2010</xref>). Neighboring chains within these clusters form double helices that pack with distinct inter-helical spacing. The resulting crystalline lamellae, alternating with amorphous lamellae containing the branch points, stack with a periodicity of ~9–10.5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jenkins et al., 1993</xref>). This unique semi-crystalline nature of amylopectin renders starch insoluble.</p><p>Amylopectin biosynthesis involves multiple enzyme activities, often composed of several isoforms with distinct specificities: four classes of starch synthases (SSs) elongate glucan chains using ADPglucose as glucosyl donor, creating α-1,4 glucose linkages; two classes of branching enzymes (BEs) introduce branches in the form of α-1,6 linked chains; and at least one isoamylase-type debranching enzyme hydrolyzes some branches again, probably tailoring the glucan for crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pfister and Zeeman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tetlow and Emes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zeeman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jeon et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, amylose is synthesized by a single class of granule-bound starch synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denyer et al., 2001</xref>). According to the classification of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>), all SSs belong to the glycosyltransferase family 5 (GT5), while BEs and isoamylases belong to distinct subfamilies of the glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13).</p><p>Starches from different plants vary in terms of amylose content, amylopectin structure and glucan modifications (e.g. level of phosphorylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Santelia and Zeeman, 2011</xref>). However, to date, this variation cannot fully meet industrial needs, necessitating costly physicochemical modifications post-extraction to yield the desired properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tharanathan, 2005</xref>). Although the starch-biosynthetic enzymes are highly conserved, we still do not have sufficient knowledge required for the rational modification of starch structure and properties in crops. This deficiency has several roots; first, the difficulty in generating plant mutants hinders a systematic analysis in most species. Second, the results obtained from comparable mutants in different plant systems are not always identical (e.g. due to variation in genetic, environmental and/or developmental backgrounds). Third, enzyme kinetics obtained from soluble substrates in vitro may not be representative of how an enzyme acts on a crystallizing surface in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Neill and Field, 2015</xref>). These problems are further compounded by the fact that the glucans that make up starch are polydisperse, necessitating multiple biochemical and biophysical techniques for their structural characterization. Collectively, these limitations impair our ability to define enzyme functions unambiguously and to derive an overall model of starch biosynthesis. As a result, progress in engineering new starches with enhanced functionalities <italic>in planta</italic> has been empirical and slow, and the full potential of this important renewable resource has not been realized.</p><p>Here we created a model system in yeast that allows the expression of multiple starch-biosynthetic enzyme combinations in a targeted, controlled and fast manner. Using a suite of molecular and biochemical analyses, we show that the enzymes are functional and, in the right combinations, capable of producing semi-crystalline starch-like granules. This shows that our yeast system is a highly tractable experimental system in which starch biosynthesis can be simulated and the capacities of different interdependent enzymatic combinations can be evaluated, bringing us much closer to a holistic view of this critical process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of the yeast system</title><p>Our yeast system employs an expression platform in haploid <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CEN.PK113-11C, which had been developed for stable heterologous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mikkelsen et al., 2012</xref>). To eliminate interfering effects from the yeast’s endogenous glycogen metabolic pathway, we purged it of the five genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis (two glycogenins, two glycogen synthases and glycogen branching enzyme) and two involved in glycogen degradation (glycogen debranching enzyme and α-glucan phosphorylase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We simultaneously introduced all known amylopectin-biosynthetic genes from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> via stable integration of coding sequences driven by galactose-inducible promoters.

Furthermore, we tested <italic>BE1</italic> (At3g20440), a third Arabidopsis gene annotated as branching enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2007</xref>).

Arabidopsis was chosen as the donor for amylopectin-biosynthetic genes because it has been intensively used for starch research, resulting in well-characterized mutants that enable us to make direct comparisons between yeast- and plant-derived glucans.

Zymograms of soluble native protein extracts from yeast strains expressing ISA and single isoforms of SS and BE showed that each enzyme was expressed and active (SS1: lines 0 and 1; SS2: lines 2 and 3; SS3: line 5; SS4: line 7; BE2: line T; BE3: line S; ISA: all lines with uneven numbers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The enzymes migrated similarly as in extracts of the wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plant controls, even though we noted additional activity bands in some cases, possibly due to small alterations in post-translational modifications. Occasionally, we observed that protein activity varied in strength between the lines (e.g. SS2 activity between lines 2 and 3). We reasoned that the enzyme’s binding to insoluble glucans potentially accumulating in these lines may affect its extractability as a soluble protein. Indeed, protein abundance detected in Western blots using total protein extracts – where proteins in the insoluble fractions had been solubilized by boiling in SDS-containing buffer – was more uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that expression levels between individual lines are in fact comparable.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15552.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Native PAGE and immunoblots of heterologously expressed proteins.</title><p>Total proteins or native soluble proteins were extracted from yeast lines grown in liquid cultures with complex medium.

The plant sample is the same soluble protein extract in both cases. SS2, GlgC-TM (both carrying a C-terminal HA tag) and SS4 (carrying a C-terminal FLAG tag) were visualized using α-HA or α-FLAG antibodies, as indicated. The expected molecular weights are 83 kDa for SS2-HA, 50 kDa for GlgC-HA and 116 kDa for SS4-FLAG. Soluble and total proteins are shown because each protein’s abundance in the soluble extract is influenced by its binding to glucans and the resultant partitioning between the soluble and insoluble fraction. The signal intensities from the soluble proteins should not be compared with those from total proteins as they arise from separate blots.The following figure supplement is available for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>:</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15552.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15552.005</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15552.006</object-id><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Glucan contents and λ<sub>max</sub> values of individual replicates.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15552.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15552.006</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-15552-fig2-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-15552-fig2-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15552.007</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Enzyme function of ISA1/ISA2, BE1, BE2 and BE3 in yeast.</title><p>The relevant genotypes are indicated; the Arabidopsis genes are highlighted in yellow and the endogenous yeast genes in grey.

Either plant BE2 or BE3 enabled substantial glucan production in yeast cells lacking their endogenous BE (strains X and Y; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This was, however, not the case for strains expressing BE1. Here, only low amounts of amylose-like glucans could be detected (strains V and W), comparable to the strain lacking any branching enzyme (strain U; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This suggests that BE1 in fact is not a starch branching enzyme. Since the presence of BE1 also did not alter the glucans made by the other amylopectin biosynthetic enzymes, it was excluded from subsequent strain sets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> and associated text). In contrast, every plant SS produced glucans when expressed as the sole synthase activity (lines 0, 2, 4 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The color and intensity after iodine staining depend on the type of complex formed between iodine and the glucan’s secondary structure: Predominantely linear, single-helical glucans such as amylose stain deep blue; double-helical amylopectin chains stain brown, and glycogen (lacking secondary structures) stains weakly red-brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saenger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manners, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Streb et al., 2008</xref>).

The cells were harvested after 6 hr, as growth of yeast strains producing glucans was reduced afterwards (not shown). After homogenization of the cells and centrifugation at 6000 <italic>g </italic>for 5 min, water-insoluble glucans were collected in the pellet. The supernatant containing soluble glucans was further fractionated by addition of methanol (80% v/v). This yielded a second fraction of water-soluble but methanol-precipitable glucans (i.e. polysaccharides; here named soluble glucans) and a third fraction of methanol-soluble glucans (i.e. short malto-oligosaccharides and free sugars).</p><p>Most lines without ISA synthesized high amounts of soluble glucans, which reached around 10% of the wet weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Light microscopy (LM) of these cells revealed fairly uniform iodine staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) from line 28 indicated numerous small particles reminiscent of glycogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, cells expressing just SS1 as a synthase (line 0) accumulated far fewer glucans than lines expressing the other SS isoforms (lines 2, 4 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, in yeast lines still containing the endogenous glycogenins, all SS isoforms synthesized large amounts of glucan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; see figure legend for details). This suggests that, rather than having low activity, SS1 is less efficient than the other SSs in utilizing available primers or in generating its own.</p><p>Most lines expressing ISA produced water-insoluble glucans as well as soluble glucans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These lines also accumulated linear malto-oligosaccharides, most likely representing chains liberated by ISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This staining showed some variation within single cells and from cell to cell, probably reflecting different stages of yeast cell age and glucan maturation.

Cells of line 29 contained regions of a high density - putatively insoluble glucans - as well as regions of intermediate density, probably reflecting soluble glucans. Remarkably, the high-density regions had a density identical to that of Arabidopsis amylopectin, pointing towards a comparable internal organization of the glucans (mean electron density [± S.D., <italic>n</italic> = 6] from line 29 = 0.44 ± 0.01 e<sup>−</sup>Å<sup>−3</sup>, corresponding to a mass density of 1.36 ± 0.04 g mL<sup>−1</sup>; Arabidopsis amylopectin density = 0.441 ± 0.004 e<sup>-</sup> Å<sup>−3</sup>, corresponding to 1.36 ± 0.01 g mL<sup>−1</sup>; see Materials and methods for details) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Further, the absorption characteristics of the insoluble glucans after iodine complexion from line 29 were almost identical to those of amylopectins from wild-type and <italic>gbss</italic> mutant plants (λ<sub>max</sub> after iodine-complexion of ~548 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">[Zeeman et al., 2002b]</xref>). In addition, they were distinct from that of highly-branched, soluble glycogen from wild-type yeast (λ<sub>max</sub>445 nm), from that of soluble glucans from the corresponding line without ISA (line 28, λ<sub>max</sub>505 nm) and from that of linear glucans such as potato amylose (λ<sub>max</sub>634 nm). The similarity in absorption spectra indicates that the insoluble glucans from line 29 form comparable secondary structures to those in plant amylopectin, i.e. double helices between adjacent chains. Notably, also the iodine absorption spectra of insoluble glucans from yeast strains expressing only subsets of SSs (e.g. SS3, line 5, or SS4, line 7, or SS1, SS2 and SS3, line 21) were dissimilar to that from line 29, re-affirming the influence of SSs on glucan structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To directly investigate the formation of secondary and tertiary structures in the insoluble glucans from line 29, we acquired X-ray scattering intensity profiles.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the helices were stacked in a weakly ordered lamellar structure with a periodicity of 13.6 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), slightly longer than typically reported for plant starches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pérez and Bertoft, 2010</xref>).

It provides direct evidence that SSs, BEs and ISA are all key enzymatic components for starch granule formation. We furthermore show that the heterologously expressed enzymes retain their specificities in yeast and propose that this system can be used as an advanced tool for studying the overall process of starch biosynthesis in unprecedented speed and depth.</p><p>Despite decades of work with plant mutants, the requirements for starch synthesis have not been clearly defined. A major obstacle associated with any plant-related approach is the presence of additional starch-active enzymes, some of which may not even be known. In Arabidopsis chloroplasts, where starch is made and degraded during a single diurnal cycle, there is a plethora of starch-catabolising enzymes: the two additional debranching enzymes ISA3 (At4g09020) and limit-dextrinase (At5g04360), at least two active β-amylases (BAM1 [At3g23920] and BAM3 [At4g17090]), the α-amylase AMY3 (At1g69830), the disproportionating enzyme DPE1 (At5g64860) and the α-glucan phosphorylase PHS1 (At3g29320) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zeeman et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delatte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fulton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Seung et al., 2013</xref>). In general, starch synthesis and degradation are regarded as separate processes in wild-type plants. It is possible that the rapid crystallization of correctly synthesized amylopectin protects it from further modification by enzymes of starch degradation. However, in Arabidopsis mutants deficient in multiple starch-biosynthetic enzymes, glucan synthesis and accumulation have been repeatedly shown to be influenced by degrading enzymes, for example in the <italic>isa1isa2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delatte et al., 2005</xref>), the <italic>be2be3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumez et al., 2006</xref>), the <italic>isa1isa2isa3lda</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Streb et al., 2008</xref>-), the <italic>ss2ss3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>) and the <italic>ss3ss4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seung et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, it has been very difficult to reliably ascribe the glucans produced in a plant’s cell to the actions of a distinct enzymatic set.</p><p>The approach we used here to deduce the essential components for starch biosynthesis is more direct. Although plant genes have been expressed in yeast or <italic>E. coli</italic> before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guan and Keeling, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seo et al., 2002</xref>), our study is unique in several ways. The yeast is purged of its endogenous glycogen-metabolic pathway and the introduced genes can be induced together. These factors allow us to study starch biosynthesis independently of interfering background effects from the yeast itself, or from the plant’s degradative enzymes. Our study is also unique in terms of the systematic variation in enzyme combinations. This enables the contribution of each enzyme and capacities of different enzymatic sets to be analyzed in ways that were previously not possible.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of ISA, SS isoforms and BEs during the formation of insoluble glucans</title><p>Our work confirms that debranching by ISA is the major driving force for the formation of insoluble glucans: In most (but not all) cases, insoluble glucans were only obtained when ISA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The promotion of insoluble glucans by ISA is in-line with plant mutants lacking this enzyme, which typically accumulate water-soluble polysaccharides, so-called phytoglycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakamura et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mouille et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zeeman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dinges et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bustos et al., 2004</xref>). Presumably, ISA selectively hydrolyzes excessive or misplaced branches that would otherwise interfere with the formation of double helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myers et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with this, we could detect a pool of linear malto-oligosaccharides in strains where ISA promoted insoluble glucan formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In wild-type plants, such a malto-oligosaccharide pool is probably rapidly metabolized and therefore not detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Streb et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we also dissected the contribution of SSs and BEs to insoluble glucan formation. When ISA was present, SS1 always decreased the production of insoluble glucans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The decreased crystallinity of glucans in the presence of SS1 probably stems from the increased abundance of glucan chains of DP 6–10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) that are too short to efficiently contribute to the formation of higher-order structures underlying starch crystallinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pfannemüller, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gidley and Bulpin, 1987</xref>). We have recently described a comparable effect of SS1 in Arabidopsis, where the lack of SS1 in the <italic>isa</italic> mutant background restored granule formation in the mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, SS4 enhanced the production of insoluble glucans. This effect cannot be traced back to distinct structural modifications – no consistent alterations in glucan structure by SS4 were observed in our comparisons or in studies of Arabidopsis <italic>ss4</italic> mutants (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roldán et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szydlowski et al., 2009</xref>). One has to bear in mind, though, that the methods currently available for the analysis of starch structure give an incomplete picture, and structural features introduced by SS4 may not have been revealed.</p><p>We did not observe uniform effects upon the expression of SS2 and SS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For SS2, this was surprising; it has been shown that SS2 specifically elongates chains from around DP 8 to around DP 13 and suggested that this promotes the formation of higher-order structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, mutation of <italic>SS2</italic> in Arabidopsis results in small amounts of phytoglycogen and enhances the accumulation of phytoglycogen in <italic>isa</italic> mutants of both rice and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>). Although the alterations in glucan structure introduced by SS2 are preserved in the yeast system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), SS2 promoted the synthesis of insoluble glucans only when SS4 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, comparisons in bold). It is possible that the strong effect of SS4 in promoting insoluble glucan formation masks this effect of SS2 in yeast, potentially due to differences in relative expression levels compared to Arabidopsis.</p><p>Our data also add new insights into how branching level influences the synthesis of insoluble glucans: In some lines expressing only BE3 as a branching enzyme, insoluble glucans were obtained despite the absence of any debranching activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that the latter is not an absolute requirement for the insoluble-glucan production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Streb et al., 2008</xref>). BE2 and BE3 are closely related class II BEs and largely redundant in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumez et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the impact of having only BE3 is probably due to overall branching activity rather than to a difference in specificity. It is striking that in combination with some, but not all SS this low BE activity resulted in formation of insoluble glucans. This was despite the fact that in all cases the λ<sub>max</sub> of the iodine-stained glucans increased, suggesting that the structure was altered in a similar way, i.e. more chains long enough to form single or double helices were present. Clearly, such secondary structures are not sufficient for insoluble glucan formation, presumably because they need also to align in parallel to form a semi-crystalline matrix. Further investigations of the insoluble glucans made by different strains in our yeast collection will deepen our understanding of the structural features that allow crystallization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Seeding of glucan synthesis by SS isoforms</title><p>Glycogen biosynthesis in yeast and animals begins with the self-glycosylation of glycogenins on tyrosine residues, yielding short glucan chains that are then elongated by glycogen synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodriguez and Whelan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lomako et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pitcher et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, the mechanism of starch initiation is not known. In Arabidopsis, genetic evidence suggests a specialized role for SS4 in this process since <italic>ss4</italic> mutants display a strong reduction in starch granule number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roldán et al., 2007</xref>). Although <italic>ss3</italic> mutants have normal number of starch granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seung et al., 2016</xref>), further loss of SS3 from the <italic>ss4</italic> mutant background resulted in a nearly complete failure of glucan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szydlowski et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that SS3 becomes indispensable for glucan priming when SS4 is absent.</p><p>In our yeast strains, it is unclear what primes glucan synthesis. Every SS was capable of glucan synthesis on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but to varying extents. Particularly, when SS1 was the sole synthase, the overall glucan content of the whole population was low and iodine staining revealed that only a fraction of the cells accumulated glucans (strains 0 and E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, glucan synthesis by SS1 was strongly improved in a corresponding strain with the endogenous glycogenins (<italic>GLG1</italic> and <italic>GLG2</italic>; strain D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This phenotype is reminiscent of the yeast glycogenin mutant (<italic>glg1glg2</italic>) which synthesizes only little glycogen overall but accumulates it in single colonies, presumably due to stochastic initiation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Torija et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that, similar to yeast glycogen synthases, SS1 has limited capacity to initiate glucan synthesis, but can use primers provided by glycogenins. It is worth noting that SS2 also synthesized slightly fewer glucans when glycogenins were absent (strain H <italic>vs.</italic> I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our study also suggests that degradation influences glucan initiation. When only SS1 and/or SS2 were present, glucan accumulation was strongly diminished by ISA (e.g., in strains 1, 3 and 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We first reasoned that SS1 and SS2 alone may generate a polymer that is excessively debranched by ISA, possibly because the glucan fails to become crystallization-competent upon debranching and hence remains accessible to further ISA action. However, the absence of malto-oligosaccharides - the expected products of ISA action - in these lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) argues against such a scenario. Rather, the degradation may happen at a very early time point and could impair the glucan synthesis altogether by limiting the availability of primers. This observation is particularly interesting since Arabidopsis <italic>ss3ss4</italic> mutants are virtually glucan-free due to an apparent failure in the priming of glucan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szydlowski et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, it was recently shown that the additional knock-out of the α-amylase AMY3 in <italic>ss4</italic> Arabidopsis mutants increases granule number and overall starch content, and loss of AMY3 in <italic>ss3ss4</italic> Arabidopsis mutants (<italic>amy3ss3ss4</italic> mutants) even restored some granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seung et al., 2016</xref>). These phenotypes were interpreted to mean that at least part of the priming function of SS4 lies in the protection of primers from premature degradation. Our observation that ISA may also diminish primers could explain why glucan accumulation in <italic>amy3ss3ss4</italic> mutants is only partially restored. Notably, ISA has been implicated as a negative regulator of granule initiation before, since the remaining starch of <italic>isa</italic> mutants is typically deposited as numerous small granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bustos et al., 2004</xref>). The generation and analysis of plant mutants deficient in SS3, SS4 and different starch degrading enzymes is ongoing in order to test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differences between the yeast glucans and plant starch</title><p>It is interesting - but perhaps not surprising - that the granules made in yeast by the Arabidopsis enzymes are not identical to those made by Arabidopsis itself. For instance, long chains (DP &gt; 18) were overrepresented in the yeast glucans, in particular when ISA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and data not shown). In plant amylopectin, the group of chains with DP &lt; 25 is believed to make up a single 9- to 10.5-nm-repeat, being part of the double helices that underlie starch crystallinity (so-called A and B<sub>1</sub> chains; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hizukuri [1986]</xref>). Since the length of these chains probably defines the width of the lamellar repeat, the relative abundance of long chains in yeast glucans may explain the increased width of the repeat we observed (13.6 nm in the insoluble glucans from line 29; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The molecular factors determining the width of the lamellar repeat are not known, but were suggested to involve the specific placement of branches by BEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nakamura, 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, we did not obtain a wild-type repeat distance, despite having expressed both known starch BEs from Arabidopsis. Most plants contain an additional BE of class I, which displays distinct specificities when assessed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rydberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nakamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sawada et al., 2014</xref>), but the Arabidopsis’ genome does not encode such a BE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumez et al., 2006</xref>). In-line with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dumez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), our data also do not support the idea that the gene annotated as BE1 in Arabidopsis represents a third BE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While we believe that we have expressed the right enzyme combinations, differences in the relative amounts of each enzyme between the yeast lines and Arabidopsis are likely. Indeed, although the BE activities according to our zymograms appear comparable in yeast and in Arabidopsis leaves, some SS activities differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In particular, SS3 activity was elevated in yeast compared with Arabidopsis. The same may be true for SS4, which was proposed to contribute only little to chain elongation in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szydlowski et al., 2009</xref>). It is interesting to note that the repression or mutation of class II BEs causes the so-called <italic>amylose-extender</italic> phenotype, where amylopectin is characterized by longer chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hedman and Boyer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mizuno et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sestili et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Regina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klucinec and Thompson, 2002</xref>). In barley, this was shown to be accompanied by a longer lamellar repeat (12.5 nm instead of 10.4 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Regina et al., [2012]</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this phenotype reflects a limitation of overall BE activity (creating an imbalance with chain elongation) or the specificity of the remaining class I BE, or both. In a recent molecular genetic approach, an impact on amylopectin structure either by BE specificity or by the amount of BE activity relative to the other starch-biosynthetic enzymes was shown directly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., (2015)</xref> complemented the <italic>be2be3</italic> Arabidopsis mutant with class I or class II BEs. Analysis of different transgenic lines established that when either BE activity was limiting, it resulted in decreased amounts of starch and amylopectin with a higher proportion of chains of DP &gt; 18, compared with when the same BE was expressed at higher levels. It would be interesting to see if, in such transgenic Arabidopsis, there is variation in the length of the lamellar repeat.</p><p>Another difference between the glucans made in yeast and in plant cells concerns the presence of soluble polysaccharides: while virtually all plant glucans are normally laid down as insoluble starch granules, every yeast strain accumulated also substantial amounts of soluble glucans. The percentages of insoluble glucans from total glucans varied depending on the complement of enzymes present (as discussed above). Still, it did not exceed ~70% in the best cases (strains O and N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and ranged between 17 and 58% when ISA and both BEs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This incomplete formation of insoluble glucans in yeast can have several reasons. First, it could again be a matter of enzyme balance, although we do not know of a comparable instance from plants here. Second, the efficient crystallization of glucans may require additional factors that we have not yet introduced into yeast. An interesting candidate is Early Starvation1 (or ESV1), a non-catalytic starch-binding protein whose absence causes altered granule morphology and starch turnover in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feike et al., 2016</xref>). ESV1 was proposed to facilitate the correct alignment of glucans within the granule matrix, which in turn could indirectly control the accessibility and thus degradation rate of glucans. However, its precise action remains unclear. Third, it is possible that soluble glucans that fail to crystallize efficiently are also synthesized in plant cells, but are rapidly removed by the starch-degrading enzymes described above. In yeast, such soluble glucans would accumulate as soluble glucans, since the degrading machinery is absent. Finally, it is also important to note that our definition of insoluble and soluble glucans in this context is based on the fractionation by centrifugation at 6000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Insoluble glucans with a tiny particle size may remain in the supernatant after such a low-speed centrifugation. Indeed, preliminary experiments suggest that half of the glucans in the soluble fraction from line 29 sediments upon extending the centrifugation to 20 min (data not shown), indicating that at least part of it may actually be insoluble.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Future applications of the yeast system</title><p>Further work should allow us to dissect the causes of the structural differences described above and simultaneously take us closer to a holistic view of starch biosynthesis. For instance, by applying quantitative proteomics, we could assess the relative differences in enzyme levels between yeast and Arabidopsis. By exerting further control over the relative expression level of the starch-biosynthetic enzymes in yeast, we would expect to obtain insoluble glucans with an even closer match to genuine Arabidopsis leaf starch. Furthermore, the systematic variation of the relative activities could allow as to determine the impact of enzyme level as well as enzyme specificity. This could be achieved using well-defined modules for heterologous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), benefitting from the recent large-scale characterization of yeast promoters, 5’UTRs and terminator sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dvir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yamanishi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our system may also be optimal for exploring the special characteristics of each enzyme in detail by studying the effects of random or site-directed mutations, domain swaps etc. Further, it provides exciting new opportunities to explore other important, but less-well understood aspects of starch granule synthesis. For instance, a number of starch-biosynthetic enzymes, have been found to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tetlow et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grimaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Makhmoudova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kötting et al., 2010</xref>) and, in case of cereals, to assemble into protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tetlow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hennen-Bierwagen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crofts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>). Still, whether and how these protein modifications and associations affect the enzyme activities has mostly remained elusive. In yeast, these questions could be readily addressed by expressing putative regulatory kinase/phosphatase pairs or enzymes with mutated phosphorylation sites or interaction domains.</p><p>Our understanding of industrially important starch traits, such as starch phosphorylation or amylose content could also be greatly improved. Enzymes controlling starch phosphorylation (i.e., glucan, water dikinases and glucan phosphatases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Silver et al., [2014]</xref>) could be expressed and studied in yeast, as could factors affecting amylose content. For the latter, one could integrate GBSS with its recently-identified granule-targeting protein PTST (Protein Targeting to Starch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Seung et al., 2015</xref>), with or without enzymes altering the levels of malto-oligosaccharides that may serve as primers of amylose synthesis (e.g., starch-degrading enzymes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zeeman et al., 2002a</xref>). There is also the potential to study non-enzymatic proteins, such as ESV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feike, 2016</xref>) or the rice protein Floury Endosperm6 (FLO6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). These proteins are of particular interest since they appear to exert their function through binding to starch itself or to starch-biosynthetic enzymes, thus providing an additional level of enzyme regulation. Furthermore, our system could be used to investigate the potential of non-plant enzymes, for instance 4,6-α-glucanotransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>), to modify starch polymers and thereby improve their properties. Such functional aspects could also be explored given that yeast culture is scalable.</p><p>Having illustrated the feasibility of this approach using the Arabidopsis genes, we suggest that it could easily be applied to study starch-biosynthetic pathways in crop species where knock-out mutants are rarer and/or more tedious to create (due to generation times, polyploidy, etc.). Even with advanced genome editing and transgenesis methods, the creation of a set of homozygous plant lines may take substantially longer than recreating and analyzing the pathway in detail in yeast, particularly in the light of the emerging systems for combinatorial gene assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). The yeast platform may thus be used to perform comprehensive pioneering studies to identify promising enzyme combinations for subsequent testing in plants. Overall, this system could usher in a new era in starch biosynthesis research and inspire work ranging from theoretical modelling of the biosynthetic process to the strategic analysis of functional properties of novel glucans for industrial use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals, media and plant materials</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and restriction enzymes from Fermentas (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>Complex medium consisted of 1% (w/v) Bacto yeast extract (BD) and 2% (w/v) Bacto peptone (BD), supplemented with either 2% (w/v) glucose (medium named YPD) or 2% (w/v) galactose (Acros Organics; medium named YPGal).

Before injecting cells into the tips of glass micro-capillaries, glycerol was added to the cell suspension as cryo-protectant to a final concentration of ~17% (v/v). Purified, dry, amylose-free Arabidopsis starch granules (<italic>gbss ptst</italic> mutant starch) were resuspended in water 12 hr before injection into the capillary tips. Filled capillary tips were flash frozen in liquid ethane and stored briefly in liquid nitrogen before mounting for tomography measurements.</p><p>Cryo X-ray ptychographic tomography measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz et al., 2015</xref>) were performed at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland) using a photon energy of 6.2 keV, corresponding to a wavelength of 0.2 nm. The beam was defined by a coherently illuminated Fresnel zone plate of 200 μm diameter and 90 nm outer-most zone width, providing a flux of about 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> photons s<sup>−1</sup>. The specimens were mounted on a 3D piezoelectric positioning stage on top of a rotation stage 3.7 mm downstream of the focus, where the beam had a diameter of about 8.2 μm. Coherent diffraction patterns from the specimen were recorded with an Eiger 500 k detector with 75 μm pixel size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinapoli et al., 2011</xref>) placed 7.514 m downstream the sample position. For both specimens, ptychographic scans were acquired by scanning the sample in a grid following a Fermat spiral pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2014</xref>) with an average step size of 2.5 μm over a field of view of 38 × 22 μm<sup>2</sup> (horizontal×vertical), corresponding to 131 points per scan. At each scanning position, diffraction patterns were recorded with an exposure time of 0.1 s. Ptychographic scans were repeated at 192 rotation angles of the specimen with respect to the beam ranging from 0 to 179.0625° with a step size of 0.9375°. During the entire acquisition, a cryo jet was blowing nitrogen gas at 110 K onto the glass capillary, ensuring that the frozen specimen remained in the vitreous phase for the measurements. Ptychographic reconstructions were performed using 200 iterations of a difference map algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thibault et al., 2009</xref>) followed by 100 iterations of a maximum likelihood refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Thibault and Guizar-Sicairos, 2012</xref>). Using 500 × 500 pixels of the detector to crop the diffraction patterns, the resulting images had a square pixel size of 40.07 nm. All reconstructed phase images from different angular positions were processed and combined in a tomographic reconstruction as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guizar-Sicairos et al., (2011)</xref>. For each sample a 3D resolution of about 150 nm was estimated by Fourier shell correlation of two tomograms, each of them obtained from half of the angular projections, using the half-bit threshold criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van Heel and Schatz, 2005</xref>). The dose imparted on each specimen was estimated to be about 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> Gy.</p><p>For measurements of electron densities of insoluble glucans, 6 cubic regions with 20<sup>3</sup> to 30<sup>3</sup> voxels were randomly selected within a single tomogram among regions of high density (presumably constituting the insoluble glucans) from individual Arabidopsis starch granules or individual cells of line 29, respectively. For each selected region, the electron density value at the maximum of the histogram (i.e., the mode) was determined. The mean and standard deviation were calculated from values of the six cubic regions. Average electron densities were converted to mass densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diaz et al., 2012</xref>) using an A/Z ratio (mass number/atomic number) of 1.863, i.e., assuming a glucose polymer (formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) with 27% (w/w) hydration, as suggested for B-type starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pérez and Bertoft, 2010</xref>). Note that the exact water content cannot be deduced from the measured density, but influences the conversion from measured electron density to final mass density only little, since the calculated A/Z ratio of water (A/Z = 1.80) and of glucan (A/Z = 1.89) are similar (e.g., within the range of 10% to 35% [w/w] water content, the A/Z ratio and thus the calculated mass density differ by &lt;1.2%). The mean electron densities ± S.D. calculated from the 6 cubic regions were 0.441 ± 0.001 e<sup>−</sup>Å<sup>−3</sup> (corresponding to a mass density of 1.364 ± 0.004 g ml<sup>−1</sup>) for Arabidopsis starch and 0.44 ± 0.01 e<sup>−</sup>Å<sup>−3</sup> (corresponding to a mass density of 1.36 ± 0.03 g ml<sup>−1</sup>) for insoluble glucans from yeast line 29. We additionally estimate a systematic error of ~0.003 e<sup>−</sup>Å<sup>−3</sup> (corresponding to ~0.01 g ml<sup>−1</sup>) in the absolute electron density measurement caused by noise in the tomographic reconstructions. The error given in the results section is the sum of this systematic error and the S.D.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Small and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS)</title><p>Insoluble glucans were purified as described for SEM, but additionally washed in 80% (v/v) ethanol and desiccated under low pressure for two days.

Arabidopsis leaf starch from wild-type (WS ecotype) and mutants was extracted using perchloric acid as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>). Soluble and insoluble glucan fractions were solubilized by heating to 99°C for 15 min.

The glucans were eluted in 4 mL water, lyophilized and re-dissolved in water by heating to 99°C for 5 min. In addition, non-debranched controls of soluble and insoluble glucans from several yeast lines were prepared by omitting the debranching enzymes. Malto-oligosaccharides were treated in the same way as these non-debranched controls. Chains were separated on a HPAEC-PAD system (ICS-5000, Dionex) using a CarboPack PA-200 column, a flow rate of 0.5 mL min<sup>−1</sup> and the following program: 0 to 12.5 min, a linear gradient from 95% eluent A (100 mM NaOH) and 5% B (150 mM NaOH, 0.5 M sodium acetate) to 60% A and 40% B; 12.5 to 50 min, a linear gradient to 15% A and 85% B; 50 to 52 min, a linear gradient to 10% A and 90% B; 52 to 60 min, 10% A and 90% B (column wash); 60 to 80 min, 95% A and 5% B (column equilibration) (all eluent percentages are given as volume per volume). Peaks were identified using standard linear glucan chains with degrees of polymerization (DP) from 2 to 7 (maltose to maltoheptaose). Peak areas were determined with Chromeleon software and summed within the depicted range (DP 3 to 60 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, and DP from 3 to 45 for the comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>).

Your paper has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their comments with one another, and, based on the individual reviews and the reviewers' discussion, the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Starch is the most important storage carbohydrate in plants, with key roles in plants and serving as the major dietary source of carbohydrates for humans. It l also has many non-food applications. Differences in starch structure between and within species are of great biological, nutritional and technical importance. Starch is also immensely complex, consisting of an unbranched glucan (amylose) and a branched glucan (amylopectin), which form a semi-crystalline starch granule. This physicochemical complexity sets starch apart from all other storage glucans, including the widely distributed soluble glycogen. Starch structure and the role of different enzymes in generating this structure have been intensively studied in several plant species including the referenced system Arabidopsis and also many crops including maize and potato. This has occurred out of curiosity, but also frequently driven by possible applications. The approach has mainly involved using forward or reverse genetics, followed by chemical and physical analysis of the resulting changes in starch structure. These studies have defined a set of enzymes that are involved in starch synthesis – or more precisely, whose modification / deletion alters the levels or especially the structure of starch. These genes are being used to try to modify starch structure in Arabidopsis and several crop plants.</p><p>However, although very successful, this previous research does not provide a full understanding of how starch is synthesized, and the structure of starch and starch granules. This requires the reconstitution of the entire system from defined parts, i.e. synthetic biology.</p><p>This is the potentially game-changing advance that is reported by Zeeman and colleagues.</p><p>Starting with a yeast strain in which all glycogen-metabolizing genes are deleted, the individual components can be added all together, or in combinations or alone to test how a starch-like structure can be created. This paper convincingly shows that each of the individual enzyme is active, and that when all are present they form a starch-like structure which is analyzed chemically and physically to show the properties are much more similar to starch from Arabidopsis than to glycogen.</p><p>Specifically, using a combinatorial approach, the authors examined nearly 30 recombinant yeast strains containing plant starch synthases (SS), branching enzymes (BE), and a debranching isoamylase heterodimer (ISA). A particular strain (&quot;line 29&quot;) expressing four SS, two BE, and the ISA heterodimer, along with an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, was able to recapitulate the abundant production of insoluble starch granules with a structure highly similar to those from wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Numerous other strains produced α-glucans of distinct primary structure and morphology.</p><p>The authors also convincingly argue why this is best done is yeast, being faster and more generalizable. Studies of starch structure in mutants are unavoidably complicated by the simultaneous presence of starch degrading enzymes that may – and almost certainly do – act on incorrectly formed starch. The use of a completely heterologous system allows to rigorously dissect how starch and starch grains are formed.</p><p>As such, this work demonstrates and validates a powerful new model system to dissect the complex, crucially topical process of starch biosynthesis across plant species. This system also has the potential to explore the effects of protein mutants/variants, post-translational modifications, and cooperativity with additional proteins and enzymes. The study appears to be technically sound and performed with a high degree of rigor.</p><p>In short, this research is a tour-de-force and opens new perspectives for understanding how starch is synthesized and using this knowledge to modify starch structure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As mentioned at the end of the Discussion, starch grains contain amylopectin and amylose and the latter is formed by GBSS. In this study, GBSS was omitted, and the focus was on formation of an amylopectin-like macromolecule. This does need to be justified. It may be important to compare the amylopectin-like structure formed in yeast with the structure of amylopectin in gbss1 mutants (is it identical with amylopectin in wild-type Arabidopsis). This can probably be done very easily, probably even using information available in the literature.</p><p>2) Consideration should be given to why the repeat structure of the insoluble glucan in strain 29 is not the same as for Arabidopsis starch. The fact that the enzymic reconstruction omitted one branching enzyme (BE1) should be discussed. Although the authors have published that knock out of this gene has no discernible phenotype in Arabidopsis, it remains possible that in the yeast system this could make an important contribution to starch structure.</p><p>3) It would be helpful to have experimental data for results in yeast that were not predicted by the work from plants. For example, there are examples within the yeast system where insoluble glucan is produced in significant amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> line I) which contradict some of the basic principles that have emerged from the plant work (SS2 plus BE3 only without ISA) which are not discussed properly nor is any analysis of the resulting glucan structure offered to illuminate this finding. This result contradicts the authors' claim in the Discussion that all SSs can generate soluble glucans in combination with BEs and ISA – clearly at least one SS can do this without ISA. Outside of this exception, the importance of ISA activity in insoluble glucan formation is not discussed fully except in the context of removing soluble glucan.</p><p>4) The analysis of Arabidopsis mutants has suggested that the role of SS4 in starch biosynthesis is due to its ability to prime granule formation. However, the yeast results suggest that SS3 and possibly SS2 might also be able to prime insoluble glucan accumulation. Some discussion of these results needs be offered as well as comparison of the 'starch structure' between lines 5, 7 and 29 to compare the arrangements of glucan formed by limited complements of enzymes compared to the full complement in line 29.</p><p>5) Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, it might be pointed out that the DP&gt;18 are strongly overrepresented in the yeast product compared to Arabidopsis. Is there an explanation for this?</p><p>6) In the first sentence of the Discussion, 'genuine' starch granules may be an overstatement, especially as GBSS and presumably amylose are missing. Further on in the same paragraph, 'the highest degree of similarity' can perhaps be rephrased – what the authors mean is probably that the glucan was most similar to those from Arabidopsis when all enzymes were included, but this sentence could also be read otherwise.</p><p>7) Some of the discussion /comparison of the results in yeast and plants that is at the moment in the Results should be moved to the Discussion. Splitting it between the Results and Discussion does not help to bring over the main messages. It also leaves the Discussion a little short on new insights and a little long on what might be done in the future. Also, more discussion of the roles on glycogenines in yeast, and the ability of the cocktail of enzymes to create a starch-like structure without a seeding polysaccharide or glycoprotein might be added.</p><p>8) The authors have put much emphasis on the results from strain 29, which carries genes encoding the entire complement of starch biosynthetic enzymes defined in Arabidopsis (except GBSS and SBE1). However, the presentation of their analysis might be improved by comparing and contrasting insoluble glucan made in Arabidopsis and yeast, with additional data on the structure of the insoluble glucans produced in yeast in strains where such production was unexpected. An analysis of what did not work as expected rather that only what did work, or a systematic discussion of the contribution of each component in isolation and in combination could provide a better interpretation of the data already generated as well as establishing how robust the yeast model is for starch synthesis in plants.</p><p>9) For a general reader, a brief account of the colors obtained with iodine with different glucans (including glycogen) would be very helpful.</p><p>10) Similarly the method used to separate soluble and insoluble glycans should be briefly explained in the text.</p><p>11) The authors should include a precise description of the glycosidic linkages of amylose and amylopectin in the second paragraph of the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15552.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) As mentioned at the end of the Discussion, starch grains contain amylopectin and amylose and the latter is formed by GBSS.

Likewise, the amylopectin from wild-type Arabidopsis starch (separated from amylose by size-exclusion chromatography) has a wavelength of maximal absorption (λ<sub>max</sub>) of 550 nm after complexion with iodine (Zeeman et al., 2002), very close to that of <italic>gbss ptst</italic> amylopectin (548 nm). These points are now mentioned in the manuscript. We used starch from the Arabidopsis <italic>gbss ptst</italic> mutant (lacking the only GBSS isoform and its starch-targeting protein, Seung et al. 2015) in addition to wild-type starch for structural analyses (SEM, SAXS, WAXS) where comparisons had not previously been made. We are confident that the absence of GBSS (and PTST) does not alter amylopectin structure in Arabidopsis mutants.</p><p><italic>2) Consideration should be given to why the repeat structure of the insoluble glucan in strain 29 is not the same as for Arabidopsis starch.

Although the authors have published that knock out of this gene has no discernible phenotype in Arabidopsis, it remains possible that in the yeast system this could make an important contribution to starch structure.</italic> </p><p>Most plant species contain two classes of branching enzymes (class I and II). In Arabidopsis, however, both BE2 and BE3 fall into class II, and there is no class I branching enzyme (Dumez et al., 2006). The gene annotated as BE1 belongs to the putative class III of branching enzymes (Han et al. 2007). However, no branching enzyme activity or role in starch metabolism has been reported for this or any other enzyme of the putative class. The <italic>be1</italic> mutant of Arabidopsis was first reported to have a wild-type phenotype (Dumez et al. 2006), while the <italic>be2be3</italic> double mutant was reported to have no starch synthesis (i.e. a BE null mutant). Later, the <italic>be1</italic> mutant was reported to be embryo lethal (Wang et al. 2010). We nevertheless agreed with the reviewers that it was interesting to test the function of BE1 in the yeast system. We therefore expressed it in two different backgrounds; 1) together with SS3 and the AGPase (strains V and W, new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This strain only contained amylose-like glucans like its parental line with just SS3 and the AGPase, indicating that BE1 alone has little or no branching activity. Second, we included BE1 in strain 29 (i.e. in addition to the other amylopectin-synthesizing enzymes). Here again, BE1 did not alter glucan production or structure (as judged by iodine staining, chain-length distribution, granule morphology, X-ray scattering patterns; new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and data not shown). Thus, the absence of BE1 cannot explain the atypical repeat structure in the insoluble glucans from strain 29. Rather we believe that the repeat size stems from an enzymatic imbalance; more specifically excessive synthase activity relative to branching activity – a hypothesis we state clearly in the Discussion of the revised manuscript (section “Current limitations and future applications of the yeast system”) and which we will test in future research.</p><p><italic>3) It would be helpful to have experimental data for results in yeast that were not predicted by the work from plants. For example, there are examples within the yeast system where insoluble glucan is produced in significant amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> line I) which contradict some of the basic principles that have emerged from the plant work (SS2 plus BE3 only without ISA) which are not discussed properly nor is any analysis of the resulting glucan structure offered to illuminate this finding. This result contradicts the authors' claim in the Discussion that all SSs can generate soluble glucans in combination with BEs and ISA – clearly at least one SS can do this without ISA. Outside of this exception, the importance of ISA activity in insoluble glucan formation is not discussed fully except in the context of removing soluble glucan.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an important point here: the production of insoluble glucans by SS2 in the absence of ISA is interesting. In the revised manuscript, we have investigated this aspect systematically for all SSs. For this we created an additional set of yeast strains expressing only BE3 (like in line I) instead of both BE2 and BE3 (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These data show that SS3 is also capable of producing insoluble glucans in the absence of ISA, and that in both instances this is dependent on having only BE3 instead of both BE2 and BE3. Iodine staining of the glucans revealed a consistent shift towards higher λ<sub>max</sub> values (wavelength of maximum absorption) when only BE3 is present. This indicates that more chains are able to form secondary structures, which presumably renders part of the glucans insoluble, despite the absence of ISA. We now discuss this finding and the role of isoamylase during the formation of insoluble glucans more extensively in the Discussion section “Role of ISA, SS isoforms and BEs during the formation of insoluble glucans”.</p><p><italic>4) The analysis of Arabidopsis mutants has suggested that the role of SS4 in starch biosynthesis is due to its ability to prime granule formation. However, the yeast results suggest that SS3 and possibly SS2 might also be able to prime insoluble glucan accumulation. Some discussion of these results needs be offered as well as comparison of the 'starch structure' between lines 5, 7 and 29 to compare the arrangements of glucan formed by limited complements of enzymes compared to the full complement in line 29.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript we now distinguish more clearly the priming of granule formation (i.e. whether a given SS can efficiently use available primers or generate its own) and whether the glucan product made by the concerted action of a given SS, BE and ISA combination can crystallize.</p><p>We therefore investigated the capability of each SS isoform to initiate glucans in the absence and presence of the yeast’s endogenous glycogenins (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; discussed in section “Seeding of glucan synthesis by SS isoforms”). This shows that SS1 and – to a lesser extent – SS2 are partly dependent on glycogenins for glucan priming, meaning that they are less efficient in using available primers or generating suitable primers on their own. We acknowledge that we don’t know what is used as a primer in the absence of the glycogenins.</p><p>We also added a more detailed discussion on the role of each enzyme for the formation of an insoluble glucans (Discussion section “Role of ISA, SS isoforms and BEs during the formation of insoluble glucans”), as described in review point 3.</p><p><italic>5) Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, it might be pointed out that the DP&gt;18 are strongly overrepresented in the yeast product compared to Arabidopsis. Is there an explanation for this?</italic> </p><p>We believe that the overrepresentation of DP &gt; 18 goes along with the altered width of the lamellar repeat and is due to an imbalance in enzyme activity (too much chain elongation by SS3 and/or SS4 for the branching activity present; as described in our answer to point 3). The overrepresentation of DP&gt;18 is mentioned in the Results section “Yeast glucans have semi-crystalline properties of starch” and in the Discussion section “Current limitations and future applications of the yeast system”. There is also references given in that section to a paper where plant BE mutants were shown to have a longer lamellar repeat than normal. We argue that this can be explained by our imbalance theory.</p><p><italic>6) In the first sentence of the Discussion, 'genuine' starch granules may be an overstatement, especially as GBSS and presumably amylose are missing. Further on in the same paragraph, 'the highest degree of similarity' can perhaps be rephrased – what the authors mean is probably that the glucan was most similar to those from Arabidopsis when all enzymes were included, but this sentence could also be read otherwise.</italic> </p><p>We have changed “genuine” starch granules to “insoluble, starch-like granules” and rephrased the paragraph accordingly.</p><p><italic>7) Some of the discussion /comparison of the results in yeast and plants that is at the moment in the Results should be moved to the Discussion. Splitting it between the Results and Discussion does not help to bring over the main messages. It also leaves the Discussion a little short on new insights and a little long on what might be done in the future. Also, more discussion of the roles on glycogenines in yeast, and the ability of the cocktail of enzymes to create a starch-like structure without a seeding polysaccharide or glycoprotein might be added.</italic> </p><p>We have searched the manuscript for inappropriate discussion in the results and moved these to the Discussion.</p><p>We have also included the analysis of additional yeast strains still expressing the glycogenins in the manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which shows that SS1 and – to a lesser extent – SS2 are partly dependent on glycogenins for glucan priming, as mentioned above. We discuss this aspect and the seeding of glucan synthesis now in the Discussion section “Seeding of glucan synthesis by SS isoforms”.</p><p><italic>8) The authors have put much emphasis on the results from strain 29, which carries genes encoding the entire complement of starch biosynthetic enzymes defined in Arabidopsis (except GBSS and SBE1). However, the presentation of their analysis might be improved by comparing and contrasting insoluble glucan made in Arabidopsis and yeast, with additional data on the structure of the insoluble glucans produced in yeast in strains where such production was unexpected. An analysis of what did not work as expected rather that only what did work, or a systematic discussion of the contribution of each component in isolation and in combination could provide a better interpretation of the data already generated as well as establishing how robust the yeast model is for starch synthesis in plants.</italic> </p><p>As described above (point 3), we have added a systematic analysis of the “unexpected” production of insoluble glucans, i.e. in the absence of isoamylase (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), together with iodine staining characteristics. These data show that, in addition to isoamylase and starch synthases, also the level of branching activity influences whether or not insoluble glucans are produced. We now describe the contribution of each of these factors in the Discussion (section “Role of ISA, SS isoforms and BEs on the formation of insoluble glucans”), describing both what is consistent with previous plant work and what is not.</p><p><italic>9) For a general reader, a brief account of the colors obtained with iodine with different glucans (including glycogen) would be very helpful.</italic> </p><p>We have added an explanation to the Results section (“Yeast strains produce high amounts of glucans”).</p><p><italic>10) Similarly the method used to separate soluble and insoluble glycans should be briefly explained in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have added an explanation to the Results section (“Yeast strains produce high amounts of glucans”).</p><p><italic>11) The authors should include a precise description of the glycosidic linkages of amylose and amylopectin in the second paragraph of the Introduction.</italic> </p><p>We have added a precise description in the second paragraph of the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
