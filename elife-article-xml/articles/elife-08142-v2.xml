In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, Wnt-regulated convergent extension (CE) is readily affected by Dvl mutants unable to form the closed conformation than by wild-type Dvl. We also demonstrate that while Dvl cooperates with other Wnt pathway elements to activate canonical Wnt signaling, the open conformation of Dvl more effectively activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results suggest that together with other players in the Wnt signaling pathway, the conformational change of Dvl regulates Wnt stimulated JNK activity in the non-canonical Wnt signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08142.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08142.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08142.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The development of an animal embryo depends on a number of signaling pathways that pass information from the outside of the cell to the inside. These pathways include Wnt signaling, which also regulates cell growth. The pathways must be precisely controlled; abnormal Wnt activity has been implicated in several human diseases, ranging from heart disease to cancer.</p><p>Wnt signaling is complex, and actually comprises two major pathways: the canonical pathway (which depends on a protein called β-catenin) and the PCP pathway (which doesn't depend on β-catenin). Both pathways are triggered when Wnt molecules bind to receptors on the outside of the cell. These receptors pass the signal into the cell and to a protein called ‘Dishevelled’ (or ‘Dvl’ for short). This protein then passes the signal on through either the canonical or PCP pathway. Nevertheless it is not clear how the Dishevelled protein can direct the signal specifically down either one of these pathways.</p><p>Lee et al. now show that the Dishevelled protein can take on at least two different shapes. When it is ‘closed’, one end of the protein is tucked inside a pocket elsewhere on the protein's surface. But when Dishevelled is ‘open’, this end of the protein moves out of this pocket. Further experiments using frogs (called <italic>Xenopus</italic>, which are commonly used in research) reveal that mutant versions of Dishevelled that were unable to take on the closed form strongly affected an aspect of the frog's development that involves the PCP pathway.</p><p>Lee et al. then demonstrate that while Dishevelled cooperates with several other Wnt pathway components to activate the canonical pathway, the open form of Dishevelled activates the PCP pathway. The next challenge following on from this work is to find out how Wnt molecules binding to the receptor trigger the shape change in Dishevelled.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08142.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08142.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>Dishevelled</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>PDZ</kwd><kwd>auto-inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM081492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Jie J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA21765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Jie J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche (L' Agence Nationale de la Recherche)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-0262-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>De-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JSEI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Jie J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31271556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>De-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31471360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>De-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ligand-binding pocket of the Dishevelled PDZ domain can be occupied by Dishevelled's own highly conserved C-terminus, inducing a closed conformation that is ‘opened’ when Wnt signaling stimulates interaction between Frizzled and Dishevelled.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The multiple Wnt signaling–related pathways are crucial to various developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>). By regulating the cellular β-catenin level, canonical Wnt signaling controls cell fate, while non-canonical Wnt signaling plays a key role in controlling convergent extension (CE) and polarized cellular orientation. Dishevelled (Dvl, or Dsh in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), a key component of both Wnt signaling pathways, relays Wnt signals downstream from the membrane-bound Wnt receptor Frizzled (Fz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noordermeer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Theisen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelrod et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simons et al., 2009</xref>). While Dvl mediates both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals, different pathways diverge at this point. Therefore, Dvl has been described as the ‘policeman’ at the intersection who directs different Wnt signals in different directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutros and Mlodzik, 1999</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Dvl relays Wnt signals from Fz to different downstream components is not well understood.</p><p>Dvl contains highly conserved DIX, PDZ, and DEP domains and a highly conserved extreme C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wharton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>). The PDZ and DIX domains are reported to be involved in canonical Wnt signaling, while the PDZ and DEP domains play a crucial role in non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sokol et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelrod et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutros et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moriguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamanaka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). The central PDZ domain not only participates in both pathways but also binds directly to the membrane-bound Wnt receptor Fz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2003</xref>). Many Wnt signaling regulators have been reported to mediate the different Wnt signaling pathways by interacting directly with the PDZ domain of Dvl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wharton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Chen, 2009</xref>). Notably, in most species the extreme C-terminus of Dvl resembles a class III PDZ-binding motif (E/D-X-Ф, where Ф represents hydrophobic residues such as F, I, L, M, or V), while that of Dsh resembles a class II PDZ-binding motif (Ф-X-Ф) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tonikian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee and Zheng, 2010</xref>). Because these two motifs suggest the possibility of intramolecular binding, we hypothesized that the C-terminus of Dvl/Dsh binds intrinsically to the Dvl PDZ domain.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08142.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The C-terminal tail of Dishevelled (Dvl) is a PDZ domain binding motif.</title><p>Sequence alignment of the C-terminus of Dvl/Dsh from selected species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>), showing residue numbers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08142.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08142.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08142-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Here we use biophysical methods to investigate the interaction of the Dvl extreme C-terminus with the Dvl PDZ domain and demonstrate that Dvl adopts a closed conformation.

We first used a competitive binding assay. Binding of the PDZ domain to a fluorescently-labeled peptide (Rox-DprC) derived from the C-terminus of Dapper (Dpr), a known binding partner of the Dvl PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheyette et al., 2002</xref>), was monitored by fluorescence polarization. Both Dvl-C and Dsh-C peptides competitively inhibited the interaction of Rox-DprC with the Dvl-1 PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that the three peptides competed for the same binding site on the PDZ domain. The inhibition constants (K<sub>I</sub>) calculated from two independent experiments (12.3 ± 7.8 μM for the Dvl-C peptide and 26.8 ± 8.4 μM for the Dsh-C peptide) were similar to the binding affinity of Rox-DprC to the PDZ domain (K<sub>D</sub> ∼ 7.9 ± 0.9 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2009b</xref>).

Therefore, we conclude that the open conformation of Dvl is likely to initiate JNK activation.</p><p>Dvl has been suggested to exist in activated and inactivated states within the cell and to be activated by Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wharton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Chen, 2009</xref>); however, the form of the ‘active state’ has not been determined. Our findings suggest that the activation state of Dvl is determined by its conformation, such that in the absence of Wnt ligand, Dvl adopts a closed conformation that represents its inactive state. Wnt signaling opens the closed conformation of Dvl and thereby activates Dvl. For example, in a working model of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the simultaneous binding of Wnt ligand to both of its membrane-bound receptors, Fz and LRP5/6, initiates canonical Wnt signaling by causing dimerization of the two receptors. Within the cell, the close proximity of the two receptors' cytoplasmic tails triggers the formation of signalosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>) containing Dvl and Axin; Dvl binds to Fz through its PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2003</xref>), thus acquiring the open conformation. This open conformation also allows the Dvl DEP domain to interact with the membrane through nonspecific charge–charge interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noordermeer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Theisen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelrod et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simons et al., 2009</xref>) that in turn promote the Fz–Dvl interaction. Axin binds LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamai et al., 2004</xref>), and the DIX domains of Dvl and Axin interact to further stabilize the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>). The network of interactions in the super-complexes stabilizes the signalosomes remarkably, although the individual interactions are relatively weak. Energetically, the super-complex is more stable than the closed conformation of Dvl and therefore can capture the PDZ domain of Dvl. By ousting the Dvl C-terminus from its bond with the Dvl PDZ domain, the Fz binding motif also opens the conformation of Dvl as it is captured in the signalosome. Although other Wnt signaling pathways are less well defined, it is clear that most, if not all, non-canonical Wnt pathways are triggered by the interaction between Fz and Dvl, which is likely to open the conformation of Dvl as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Habas and Dawid, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Chen, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the active form of Dvl is its open conformation and that this active form initiates JNK-related Wnt signaling pathways.</p><p>The Dvl DEP domain is essential to activate JNK cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutros et al., 1998</xref>). The hypothesis that ‘opened’ Dvl stimulates JNK activity is consistent with a report that Daam1, a key player that connects Dvl to JNK, exists in an autoinhibited state and is activated by binding to Dvl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Daam1 binds to the Dvl DEP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habas et al., 2001</xref>), which is likely to be obstructed in the closed conformation. Therefore, opening of Dvl's conformation is a key step in the Wnt-stimulated cascade that activates JNK.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The cDNAs encoding the PDZ (residues 251–340), DEP (residues 377–503), mC1 (residues 251–695), and mD1-CΔ7 (residues 251–688) domains of mouse Dvl-1 were sub-cloned into the pET28a vector.

NOE restraints were grouped into distance ranges according to their relative intensity: strong (1.8–2.5 and 1.8–3.0 Å), medium (1.8–4.0 Å), and weak (1.8–5.0 Å). A total of 45 unambiguous restraints (23 sequential intramolecular NOEs from the Dvl-C peptide bound to the PDZ domain and 22 intermolecular NOEs between the Dvl-C peptide and the Dvl-1 PDZ domain) were used. Two types of restraints were combined to generate 2000 initial structures of the Dvl PDZ/Dvl-C peptide complex; 200 of these structures were selected by using NOE-derived restraints, and 100 structures were then obtained for final refinement.

The authors provide significant evidence uncovering a physical interaction between the PDZ domain of the protein and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Since the two domains might be expected to interact, this result, on its own, is not a surprise, but the authors propose that this interaction is critical for the ability of Dishevelled to signal. According to their model, the intramolecular association is responsible for the closed conformation of Dishevelled, which prevents JNK activation and convergent extension defects (referred to as noncanonical signaling). The comparison of Dishevelled constructs shows that the protein with a deleted C-terminus (C∆8) and the one with a nonfunctional PDZ domain (Xdd1) activate JNK and interfere with convergent extension stronger than the wild-type protein. Similar effects are observed for two Dvl antagonists that bind to the PDZ domain, consistent with the proposed model. Interestingly, the effects on beta-catenin reporters are opposite to those obtained for AP-1 luciferase, suggesting that the ‘open conformation’ of Dishevelled inhibits canonical Wnt signaling. This is another important point, although it is not emphasized in the manuscript.</p><p>This study is interesting because of the critical role of Dishevelled in Wnt signaling, the experiments are overall solid, with some typos and controls missing. To verify their conclusions obtained for the C-terminally truncated construct (C∆8), the authors are recommended to make specific point mutations disrupting the PDZ binding motif and, possibly, the PDZ domain. They should also confirm that the inhibitors used (TMEM88-C and 8625) interfere with the PDZ-PBD binding in vitro. I feel that the paper would benefit from showing an effect of a Wnt signal on the proposed intramolecular interaction, although these experiments might be considered beyond the scope of the present study. The authors should discuss early papers on Dishevelled and JNK signaling, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutros et al., 1998</xref> in Cell, which are not fully consistent with the proposed model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors address the potential role of intramolecular interactions between the Dsh/Dvl C-terminal sequences and its PDZ domain. They establish through a series of biochemical/structural techniques and a follow up biology in <italic>Xenopus</italic> that Dsh/Dvl is normally in a closed confirmation (with the C-term residues bound to the PDZ domain) and open Wnt-signaling activation it is “opened” up with the C-term residues being released from the PDZ and allowing the full length protein to bind to and activate downstream effectors, like for example JNK signaling in the Wnt/PCP signaling context or interaction with Axin in the canonical signaling pathway.</p><p>The observations presented here are of significance and relevance and worth publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have however a few concerns that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) Based on the presented data, both the canonical and the PCP (non-canonical) Wnt pathway are more “effective” in the open configuration. Yet, in the Abstract the authors state: “Wnt-regulated CE is more readily affected by Dvl mutants unable to form the closed conformation than wild-type Dvl...non-canonical signaling is mediated by the open conformation of Dvl...”. I assume the authors refer to CE and non-canonical signaling as the same (PCP-type Wnt signaling) and yet they state that one is “more affected”. This part of the Abstract is very unclear and needs to be rewritten.</p><p>2) The authors state (in the subsection “The binding pocket of Dvl PDZ is occupied by its intrinsic ligand”): “... suggesting not only that the Dvl PDZ domain binds intrinsically to the Dvl C-terminus but also that this binding interferes with interactions between the Dvl PDZ domain and its other binding partners in the Wnt signaling pathways”. How does this work with the presumed Fz C-tail Dvl PDZ interaction, which has been shown to be essential for Fz induced Dsh/Dvl membrane recruitment and thus activation; this was published by the same authors [Wong et al., Mol Cell 2003].</p><p>3) Throughout the paper the biochemical and biological experiment quantifications lack statistical analyses, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8 fig9 fig10">Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10</xref>.</p><p>4) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref> lacks several controls. The authors need to include “uninjected” and “xDsh alone”.</p><p>5) Some biological assays in a real in vivo/genetic setting (mouse or <italic>Drosophila</italic>) would have been helpful.

Our DLS studies were also unsuccessful partially because it was very difficult to concentrate the proteins. However, we did obtain a set of data from an analytical ultracentrifugation study (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>). The shapes of the data fit perfectly well with our model; the data shows that the “closed” form (C1) is more globular than the “open” form (C1-Δ7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>). However, the numbers extracted from data, such as hydrodynamic radius (Rstocks), for the two forms of Dvl are essentially the same. We speculated that this might be due to the large flexible loop in the “closed” form. Because of this inconsistence, we decided not to include the ultracentrifugation data in the manuscript.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08142.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08142.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08142.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08142-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>are used to argue that the Dvl C-terminus has an important role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, since deletion of this region doesn't produce a strong activation of luciferase activity.

We propose that inside the cell, these interactions compete with each other, and the surrounding condition the Dvl inside the cell determines the binding partner(s) of the Dvl PDZ domain. We discussed this issue in the Discussion section. For example, in the current working model of the canonical Wnt signaling, the binding of Wnt to both its receptors, Fz and LRP5/6 triggers the formation of the signalosome. The network of interactions in the signalosome super-complexes stabilizes the signalosomes remarkably, although the individual interactions are relatively weak. Energetically, the supercomplex is more stable than the “closed” conformation of Dvl and therefore can capture the PDZ domain of Dvl. By ousting the Dvl C-terminus from its bond with the Dvl PDZ domain, the Fz binding motif also opens the conformation of Dvl as it is captured in the signalosome.</p><p><italic>3) Throughout the paper the biochemical and biological experiment quantifications lack statistical analyses, e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8 fig9 fig10"><italic>Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10</italic></xref>.</p><p>We now include statistical analyses in these figure legends.
