intermediate-conductance potassium channels that are activated by calcium-calmodulin. KCa3.1 is unique among these four channels in that activation requires, in addition to calcium, phosphorylation of a single histidine residue (His358) in the cytoplasmic region, by nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B). The mechanism by which KCa3.1 is activated by histidine phosphorylation is unknown. Histidine phosphorylation is well characterized in prokaryotes but poorly understood in eukaryotes. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of His358 activates KCa3.1 by antagonizing copper-mediated inhibition of the channel. Furthermore, we show that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells deficient in intracellular copper exhibit increased KCa3.1 histidine phosphorylation and channel activity, leading to increased calcium flux and cytokine production. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for a mammalian potassium channel and for T-cell activation, and highlight a unique feature of histidine versus serine/threonine and tyrosine as a regulatory phosphorylation site.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16093.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16093.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>histidine phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>copper inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI107443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hubbard</surname><given-names>Stevan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK074192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thiele</surname><given-names>Dennis J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM084195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skolnik</surname><given-names>Edward Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA194584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mammalian potassium channel KCa3.1, which is important for T- and B-cell activation, is inhibited by cytoplasmic copper, mediated by a histidine residue (His358) that is phosphorylated to activate the channel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>KCa2.1, KCa2.2, KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 (also called SK1â4) are encoded by the <italic>KCNN</italic> genes and respond to calcium via calmodulin, which is constitutively bound to the cytoplasmic region of these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>). KCa2.1, KCa2.2 andÂ KCa2.3 are expressed predominantly in neurons, contributing to medium afterhyperpolarization, whereas KCa3.1 plays a key role in the activation of T cells, B cells and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feske et al., 2015</xref>). Potassium efflux via KCa3.1 is required to maintain a negative membrane potential, which provides the electrical gradient for sustained calcium influx via calcium release-activated channels (CRACs) and subsequent production of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feske et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A unique feature of KCa3.1 relative to the other KCa channels is its regulation by histidine phosphorylation. We showed previously that His358 of KCa3.1 is phosphorylated (pHis358)Â by nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Srivastava et al., 2006b</xref>), which, along with NDPK-A, are the only two mammalian protein histidine kinases identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwood and Wieland, 2015</xref>). We also showed that KCa3.1 activation requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Srivastava et al., 2006a</xref>), generated by a class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K-C2Î²) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Srivastava et al., 2009</xref>), and that KCa3.1 is negatively regulated by protein histidine phosphatase-1 (PHPT1), which dephosphorylates pHis358 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Srivastava et al., 2008</xref>), and by myotubularin-related protein-6 (MTMR6), which dephosphorylates PI(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Srivastava et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, we recently identified phosphoglycerate mutase-5 (PGAM5) as a histidine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates the catalytic histidine (His118) in NDPK-B. By dephosphorylating NDPK-B, PGAM5 negatively regulates T-cell receptor signaling by inhibiting NDPK-B-mediated histidine phosphorylation and activation of KCa3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Panda et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We reported previously that mutation of His358 (H358N) converted KCa3.1 into a channel that, like the other three KCa channels, requires only calcium-calmodulin for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Srivastava et al., 2006b</xref>). Furthermore, swapping 14 residues of KCa3.1 containing His358 with the equivalent residues of KCa2.3 converted the latter into a channel that required NDPK-B and PI(3)P for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Srivastava et al., 2006a</xref>). These studies highlighted the autonomous role of His358 and proximal residues in the regulation of KCa3.1.</p><p>Although histidine phosphorylation is well characterized in prokaryotic two-component systems used in chemotaxis and other sensing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hess et al., 1988</xref>), it is poorly characterized in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klumpp and Krieglstein, 2009</xref>), in part because phosphohistidine is more labile than phosphotyrosine or phosphoserine/threonine. In addition to KCa3.1, histidine phosphorylation of several mammalian proteins by NDPKs has been reported, including the Î² subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins and the transient receptor potential vanilloid-5 (TRPV5) channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwood and Wieland, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Klumpp and Krieglstein, 2009</xref>). However, the functional consequences of histidine phosphorylation of these eukaryotic proteins, and the mechanisms whereby histidine phosphorylation regulates their activity, are poorly understood. The regulation of KCa3.1 by histidine phosphorylation has emerged as the clearest example in a mammalian protein of the functional importance of this post-translational event, yet the molecular basis for His358-mediated regulation of KCa3.1 is unknown.</p><p>The special role of histidine in KCa3.1 inhibition, together with the knowledge that histidine is a common ligand in metal-ion coordination, led us to hypothesize that the four copies of His358 in the cytoplasmic domains of the homotetrameric channel coordinate a metal ion, which renders KCa3.1 refractory to the conformational changes induced by calcium binding to calmodulin. Here, we provide evidence for copper-mediated inhibition of KCa3.1 from patch-clamping studies of KCa3.1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from copper transporter-1 (Ctr1) knockout mice. Moreover, we show that copper inhibition of KCa3.1 is relevant in a physiologic context, namely, regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KCa3.1 is activated by metal chelators and inhibited by copper in whole-cell membrane patches</title><p>To test the hypothesis that KCa3.1 is inhibited by His358-mediated metal binding, we first used whole-cell patch clamping to measure the effect of the cell-permeable metal chelator TPEN (N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine) on the current from HEK 293 cells stably transfected with GFP-KCa3.1 (293-KCa3.1 cells).

These experiments were designed to explore the model that KCa3.1 is inhibited by copper binding to His358, which is released by GTP/ATP-dependent NDPK-B phosphorylation of His358 or, in vitro, by chelation by TTM, with either inhibitory-release mechanism requiring calcium binding to calmodulin for channel activation.

The mechanism by which (non-phosphorylated) His358 is inhibitory to KCa3.1 was not known. The specificity of His358 inhibitionâthe conservative substitution asparagine completely disinhibits the channelâpointed to an inhibitory mechanism for which histidine is uniquely suited.</p><p>One important biochemical feature of histidine is its role in coordinating metal ions, through one of the two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3) in the imidazole ring. Metal ions for which histidine serves as a ligand include copper, nickel, iron, zinc and manganese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). In homotetrameric KCa3.1, four copies of His358 are present in the cytoplasmic region, related (on average) by C4 symmetry. Of the metal ions listed above, only copper (Cu(II)) is found toÂ beÂ coordinated solely by four histidine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DokmaniÄ et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>These considerations suggested the possibility that the KCa3.1 inhibitory mechanism, mediated by His358, involves copper binding. In the present study, we provide strong support for this hypothesis. Moreover, we show that copper inhibition of KCa3.1 is physiologically relevant for CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation; KCa3.1 in T cells deficient in intracellular copper (from <italic>Ctr1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice) exhibits higher activity, which results in increased calcium influx and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although the BK and Shaker potassium channels and TASK-3, a two-pore-domain potassium channel, have also been shown to be inhibited by copper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gruss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2008</xref>), the inhibition mechanism is distinct from that in KCa3.1 because copper acts extracellularly in these other channels, and there is no evidence that these effects are regulated by histidine phosphorylation.</p><p>How would His358 be positioned spatially to bind a copper ion? His358 is located just C-terminal to the calmodulin-binding domain in KCa3.1 and 18 residues N-terminal to the predicted C-terminal coiled-coil region, which crystallographic analysis shows forms a four-helix bundle (S.R.H., unpublished data). Coiled-coil prediction software indicates that there is a reasonable probability that the region encompassing His358 also forms a coiled-coil/four-helix bundle, with His358 occupying an inward-facing âaâ position in the heptad repeat, which would position the four copies of His358 to coordinate a copper ion (via N3 in the imidazole ring) on the four-fold axis. Biophysical studies are ongoing to validate thisÂ structural model and demonstrate direct binding of copper to His358.</p><p>Our model for the phosphorylation- and calcium-dependent activation of KCa3.1 is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In the absence of calcium (basal state), copper binding to the four copies of His358 in homotetrameric KCa3.1 maintains low channel activity by opposing the calcium/calmodulin-mediated conformational changes that induce channel opening. Upon a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels due to T-cell stimulation (for example), calcium binding to channel-associated calmodulin induces conformational changes in the channel, distorting the four-helix bundle locally (the C-terminal four-helix bundle is maintained) and partially destabilizing copper binding to His358, thus exposing it to phosphorylation by NDPK-B. Because stable copper binding requires tetravalent coordination, phosphorylation of a single His358 residueÂ (on N3) in the tetramer is probably sufficient to abrogate copper binding and inhibition of KCa3.1. Unencumbered by copper, the channel-opening conformational changes induced by calcium proceed in the same manner in KCa3.1 as in the other three KCa channels. Consistent with our model, (i) NDPK-B or TTM activation of KCa3.1 required calcium to be present concurrently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), (ii) copper did not inhibit NDPK-B-activated (phosphorylated) KCa3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and (iii) KCa3.1 was hyperphosphorylated on histidine (and more active) in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Ctr1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> miceÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which contain lower intracellular copper levels.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16093.007</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for KCa3.1 activation by calcium and histidine phosphorylation.</title><p>For clarity, only two of the four KCa3.1 subunits and calmodulin (CaM) are shown. In the basal state (no calcium; left panel), the CaM C lobe (green sphere) is bound to the N-terminal segment of the calmodulin-binding domain (CBD, yellow) in KCa3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schumacher et al., 2004</xref>). The transmembrane S6 helices close off the channel on the cytoplasmic side. At the CÂ terminus of KCa3.1 is a coiled-coil region that forms a four-helix bundle (violet cylinders; S.R.H., unpublished data). Based on coiled-coil prediction software, it is probable that the region containing His358, which is just C-terminal to the CBD, also forms a four-helix bundle (maroon cylinders), with His358 (pentagon) occupying an inward-facing âaâ position in the heptad repeat. This would position the four copies of His358 for coordination of a Cu(II) ion on the axis of the four-helix bundle, which would stabilize the four-helix bundle and act to resist the conformational changes induced by calcium binding to the CaM N lobe (blue sphere). An increase in intracellular calcium induces conformational changes in the CBD that partially destabilize copper bindingÂ (middle panel), providing access to His358 for phosphorylation by NDPK-B (or copper chelation by TTM). Upon phosphorylation of His358, copper binding is abrogated, and the calcium-induced conformational changes in the CBD lead to channel opening (right panel; exact mechanism not known) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sachyani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16093.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16093.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16093-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p>The metal-binding properties of histidine and its ability to be phosphorylated distinguish histidine from the common phosphorylatable residues in eukaryotes, serine/threonine and tyrosine.

Cells were then attached to a poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip for 20âmin, and calcium imaging was done with an IX81 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus,Â Tokyo,Â Japan) and OpenLab imaging software (Improvision,Â Conventry,Â UK) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di et al., 2010</xref>). For single-cell analysis, 340/380 nm Fura-2 emission ratios of &gt;Â 100 cells per experiment were analyzed. Background fluorescence obtained from regions containing no cells was digitally subtracted from each image. To compare the different groups, the 340/380 nm ratio was normalized to 1 by dividing the fluorescence values at different time points to the cellular fluorescence at time 0. Experiments were independently repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunoprecipitation and western blotting</title><p>MouseÂ CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were lysed in lysis buffer (100âmM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1âmM EDTA, 5âmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,Â 0.5% NP-40Â andÂ 50âmM Tris, pH 8.0, along with freshly added 1âmM DTT, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with anti-KCa3.1 antibodies (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem,Â Israel,Â Cat # ALM-051). After washing three times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted using SDS loading buffer (pH 8.8), separated by SDS-PAGE (pH 8.8), and immunoblotted with anti-KCa3.1 or rabbit monoclonal anti-3-pHis (clone SC56-2) antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuhs et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FACS analysis of MEFs transfected with exofacial HA-tagged KCa3.1</title><p>KCa3.1 containing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag inserted into the extracellular loops between transmembrane helices S3 and S4 was transfected into <italic>Ctr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT MEFs. To assess the plasma membrane levels of KCa3.1, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10âmin on ice and washed three times with PBS. The non-permeabilized fixed cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:200 dilution) for 1âhr on ice, washed three times with PBS, and stained with secondary anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibody (1:500 dilution) for 30âmin on ice. Cells were then washed three times with PBS prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Cells incubated with only the secondary antibody served as the negative control. Flow cytometry was performed using LSR II HTS flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the results were analyzed using TreestarÂ (FlowJo).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Senena CorbalÃ¡n-GarcÃ­a (University of Murcia) for helpful discussions, Min Ha Hwang (Duke University) for mice dissections, and Heike Wulff (University of CaliforniaâDavis) for TRAM-34.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study that establishes a potential mechanism for the regulation of KCa3.1 channels in CD4 T cells by histidine phosphorylation on His358. The authors propose that Cu<sup>++</sup> ions would coordinate with four His358 residues thus rendering the channel refractory to the conformational changes initiated by the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to CaM. This mechanism is blocked by His358 phosphorylation. This may have important physiological significance in the context of understanding CD4 T cell activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Copper binding to His358 is inferred from indirect studies, but is not directly demonstrated â this should be acknowledged. The dose response of copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) shows that 1ÂµM had no effect, 10ÂµM shows an inhibitory effect, and that 100ÂµM was saturating. How does this dose response compare with physiological intracellular copper concentrations?</p><p>2) The concentration of free Cu<sup>++</sup> in the solutions used for the whole cell and inside-out patch clamp experiments is a concern. The expected Cu<sup>++</sup> concentration in the pipette solution used in whole cell experiments and in the bath solution for the inside-out experiments should be specified. EDTA has a binding affinity of 10-18M for Cu<sup>++</sup> and it is likely to be the same for EGTA. Under such conditions, both solutions should be Cu<sup>++</sup> free and yet channel activity appears to be low in the whole cell and inside-out recordings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> in control conditions.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that channel activity remains high after TTM removal in 300nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (the effect of TTM is not reversible) consistent with the bathing solution being Cu<sup>++</sup> free and TTM being capable of chelating Cu<sup>++</sup> from the Cu<sup>++</sup>- H358 complex. However, channel activity appears low in 300nm Ca<sup>2+</sup> after TTM treatment in 30nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. One would have expected channel activity to be high in this case if TTM had succeeded to chelate Cu<sup>++</sup> from the Cu<sup>++</sup>-H358 complex in 30nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions. The authors need to discuss how the action of TTM might be modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and may involve more than chelating Cu<sup>++</sup>.</p><p>4) Segments of the inside-out recording in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and D</xref> should also be presented at a higher time resolution to compare single channel activity at 300nm Ca<sup>2+</sup> + low Cu<sup>++</sup>, 10Î¼M CuCl<sub>2</sub> and TTM conditions. The authors also need to comment on the finding that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and D</xref>, channel activity appears greater in CuCl<sub>2</sub> conditions than in control before TTM application in 300nm Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions.</p><p>5) The proposed mechanism implies that Cu<sup>++</sup> coordination by four H358 is state dependent, with Cu<sup>++</sup> binding taking place in the channel-closed configuration. Accordingly, the potency of CuCl<sub>2</sub> to decrease channel activity following TTM treatment should be Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent with CuCl<sub>2</sub> being less potent in saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (10Î¼M Ca<sup>2+</sup>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of CuCl<sub>2</sub> mediated inhibition after TTM treatment should be presented in inside-out experiments to confirm state dependency.</p><p>6) The significance of the results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref> would be clearer if information on the mechanisms underlying Cu<sup>++</sup> cellular homeostasis, and on the expected basal Cu<sup>++</sup> intracellular level is provided. If channel expression is not affected in <italic>Ctr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, why is there a two fold difference in current intensity following TTM treatment between WT and <italic>Ctr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells assuming that TTM can chelate all the Cu<sup>++</sup> in the cells?</p><p>7) The structural constraints related to Cu<sup>++</sup> coordinating four His358 residues should be discussed. What are the minimal distances between adjacent imidazole nitrogen atoms to insure Cu<sup>++</sup> coordination? How does the proposed structural model for the channel closed state impact on the possibility of a dimer-dimer structure for the channel open state? The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> presumes that this dimer-dimer structure does not prevail in the channel open state configuration.</p><p>8) The increase in KCa3.1 channel activity in <italic>Ctr1<sup>-/+</sup></italic> CD4 T cells was predicted by the patch clamping studies. However, the increase in His358 phosphorylation was not predicted. This finding raises questions concerning mechanism. Is His358 phosphorylation a passive response to lack of copper binding to His358? This response differs from the major conclusion of this study â that phosphorylation prevents copper interactions with KCa3.1. The observation suggests a more complicated relationship between copper binding and histidine phosphorylation than the authors' conclusions.</p><p>9) Very limited information is provided concerning statistical analysis. For example, bar graphs and error bars are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, but it is unclear whether these data represent mean {plus minus} SEM or something else, and the number of biological replicates is unclear. What statistical test was performed? Are differences statistically significant? This information should be presented for all figure panels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16093.009</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Copper binding to His358 is inferred from indirect studies, but is not directly demonstrated â this should be acknowledged.

As pointed out by the reviewers, EGTA is also a potent copper chelator. We have now repeated the inside/out (I/O) patch clamp experiments without EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) so as to more accurately determine the lowest free copper concentration that inhibits. These experiments demonstrated that 100nm CuCl<sub>2</sub> inhibits KCa3.1, which is a 100-fold lower than with EGTA present.</p><p>Most of the intracellular copper is sequestered, and free intracellular copper levels are very low. This has led to much speculation as to how copper metalloenzymes become loaded with copper. Some of the ideas include copper metallochaperones that function to load copper onto enzymes and presumably KCa3.1. Thus, it is very difficult, and likely not relevant, to extrapolate the amount of copper needed to inhibit in vitro (I/O patches) to intracellular copper concentrations.</p><p> <italic>2) The concentration of free Cu<sup>++</sup>in the solutions used for the whole cell and inside-out patch clamp experiments is a concern. The expected Cu<sup>++</sup>concentration in the pipette solution used in whole cell experiments and in the bath solution for the inside-out experiments should be specified.

The authors need to discuss how the action of TTM might be modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and may involve more than chelating Cu<sup>++</sup>.</italic> </p><p>This is another excellent point raised by the reviewers, which we missed. We have now repeated the same experiment with NDPK-B and found that treatment with NDPK-B (and GTP) followed by high calcium also does not activate KCa3.1. Rather, calcium needs to be present simultaneously for both TTM and NDPK-B to activate. This makes perfect physiological sense as this requirement would prevent aberrant activation of the channel under sub-threshold stimuli. We hypothesize that a calcium/calmodulin-induced conformational change in the channel provides access to His358 for phosphorylation by NDPK-B. We have modified our model to incorporate this finding, which is presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and in the Discussion.</p><p> <italic>4) Segments of the inside-out recording in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and D</xref> should also be presented at a higher time resolution to compare single channel activity at 300nm Ca<sup>2+</sup> + low Cu<sup>++</sup>, 10Î¼M CuCl<sub>2</sub> and TTM conditions. The authors also need to comment on the finding that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and D</xref>, channel activity appears greater in CuCl<sub>2</sub> conditions than in control before TTM application in 300nm Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions.</italic> </p><p>The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> are mean patch current. The single channel activity will not be apparent with higher time resolution due to the existence of many channels in each patch. If the reviewers would like, we can also present the results as mean patch in the form of a bar graph for additional clarity.</p><p>High calcium results in activation of other potassium channels in the I/O patch that are not KCa3.1, which is evident from the failure of the KCa3.1 inhibitor to block this current. This finding provides further evidence that copper specifically inhibits KCa3.1, as copper only inhibits the TRAM-34-inhibitable current (KCa3.1) and not the non-KCa3.1 current induced by calcium. This is not evident in the other tracings, as baseline current shown is in 300nm calcium, not 30nm, as in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p> <italic>5) The proposed mechanism implies that Cu<sup>++</sup>coordination by four H358 is state dependent, with Cu<sup>++</sup>binding taking place in the channel closed configuration. Accordingly, the potency of CuCl<sub>2</sub> to decrease channel activity following TTM treatment should be Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent with CuCl<sub>2</sub> being less potent in saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (10Î¼M Ca<sup>2+</sup>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of CuCl<sub>2</sub> mediated inhibition after TTM treatment should be presented in inside-out experiments to confirm state dependency.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed this experiment and indeed found that copper inhibition of KCa3.1 is dependent on calcium levels, with a 10-fold higher concentration of copper (1Î¼M) required to inhibit the channel under saturating calcium concentrations (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results have been incorporated into our model (see Discussion and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p> <italic>6) The significance of the results illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref> would be clearer if information on the mechanisms underlying Cu<sup>++</sup>cellular homeostasis, and on the expected basal Cu<sup>++</sup>intracellular level is provided. If channel expression is not affected in Ctr1<sup>-/-</sup> cells, why is there a two fold difference in current intensity following TTM treatment between WT and Ctr1<sup>-/-</sup> cells assuming that TTM can chelate all the Cu<sup>++</sup>in the cells?</italic></p><p>See response #1 above with respect to free copper levels in cells. We think that the difference in activity is due to the failure of TTM (applied exogenously) to chelate all of the copper bound to KCa3.1 in WT MEFs. In fact, this is consistent with our findings that calcium binding to calmodulin is required for TTM to chelate copper away from KCa3.1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since intracellular calcium concentrations are unlikely to be saturating, TTM should not be able to chelate all of the channel-bound copper.</p><p> <italic>7) The structural constraints related to Cu<sup>++</sup>coordinating four His358 residues should be discussed. What are the minimal distances between adjacent imidazole nitrogen atoms to insure Cu<sup>++</sup>coordination? How does the proposed structural model for the channel closed state impact on the possibility of a dimer-dimer structure for the channel open state? The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> presumes that this dimer-dimer structure does not prevail in the channel open state configuration.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned in the previous version of the manuscript, we have unpublished crystallographic data showing that the C-terminal region of KCa3.1 forms a four-helix bundle. Suggestively, in this structure, His389 (31 residues C-terminal to the phosphorylation site, His358) occupies an inward-facing âaâ position in the heptad repeat, and the four copies of His389 (via N3 in the imidazole ring), along with an axial water molecule, bind a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis. (CuCl<sub>2</sub> was added prior to crystallization trials.) The N3 (imidazole ring)-Cu(II) distance is 2.0Ã (C4 symmetryâall four the same), and the O (H<sub>2</sub>O)-Cu(II) distance is 2.4Ã. This structure demonstrates that four histidine residues in the âaâ position of a four-helix bundle (in a homotetramer) are capable of binding a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis. Based on coiled-coil prediction software (see Minor Point #5 below), our model is that His358 is also positioned in an âaâ position in a four-helix bundle, coordinating a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis similar to His389.</p><p>Because our crystal structure of the C-terminal four-helix bundle is unpublished, and because of the confusion that could arise by showing copper coordinated by His389 instead of His358 (the subject of the present study), we prefer to simply state in the Discussion that His358 is predicted to occupy an inward-facing âaâ position, and that the four copies would be positioned to coordinate (via N3) a Cu(II) ion on the four-fold axis.</p><p>For several reasons, we believe that the 2:2 SK2 (KCa2.2):calmodulin (CaM) structure reported by Schumacher et al. (Nature 410, 1120 (2001)) is artifactual and that their dimer-dimer model for the open-channel state is not correct. The fundamental reason for believing their model is incorrect is that the dimer-dimer model is incompatible with the C4 symmetry of the homotetrameric SK/KCa channels. We believe that the 2:2 complex they observed in solution and in the crystal structure (with calcium present) is an artifact of the C-terminal 6xHis-tag included, which contained a heterologous leucine residue (<underline>L</underline>EHHHHHH) that interacts with the second molecule of CaM in the dimer (i.e., this might help to stabilize the 2:2 complex). Our solution data (unpublished), as well as data published by Halling et al. (J. Gen. Physiol. 143, 231 (2014)), show unequivocally a 1:1 SK2 (or SK4):CaM complex, with or without calcium present. Four 1:1 complexes can be assembled into a structure that is consistent with the C4 symmetry of the channel. Such a model was proposed by Sachyani et al. (Structure 22, 1582 (2014)) for Kv7.1, which is also activated by calcium-CaM and shows sequence similarity with the KCa channels in the CaM binding domain. We favor this model for KCa3.1-CaM in the open state, which is why this paper and not the Schumacher et al. (2001) paper is referenced in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend.</p><p> <italic>8) The increase in KCa3.1 channel activity in Ctr1<sup>-/+</sup> CD4 T cells was predicted by the patch clamping studies. However, the increase in His358 phosphorylation was not predicted. This finding raises questions concerning mechanism. Is His358 phosphorylation a passive response to lack of copper binding to His358? This response differs from the major conclusion of this study â that phosphorylation prevents copper interactions with KCa3.1. The observation suggests a more complicated relationship between copper binding and histidine phosphorylation than the authors' conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We have now addressed these points in the model presented in the Discussion and in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p> <italic>9) Very limited information is provided concerning statistical analysis.
