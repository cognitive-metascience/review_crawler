achieved by divergence in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04837.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04837.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04837.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Flies look very different from humans, but both are descended from a common ancestor that existed over 600 million years ago. Some differences between animal species are due to them having different genes: stretches of DNA that contain the instructions to make proteins and other molecules. However, often differences are caused by the same or similar genes being switched on and off at different times and in different tissues in each species.</p><p>The instructions that control when and where a gene is expressed are written in the sequence of DNA bases located in the regulatory region of the gene. These instructions are written in a language that is often called the ‘gene regulatory code’. This code is read and interpreted by proteins called transcription factors that bind to specific sequences of DNA (or ‘DNA words’) and increase or decrease gene expression. Changes in gene expression between species could therefore be due to changes in the transcription factors and/or changes in the instructions within the regulatory regions of specific genes.</p><p>Gene regulatory regions are not well conserved between species. However, it is unclear if the instructions in these regions are written using the same gene regulatory code, and whether transcription factors found in different species recognize different DNA words.</p><p>Nitta et al. have now used high-throughput methods to identify the DNA words recognized by 242 transcription factors from a fruit fly called <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Nitta et al. then used new computational tools to find motifs, or collections of DNA words, that are recognized by each of the transcription factors. By comparing the motifs, they observed that, in spite of more than 600 million years of evolution, almost all known motifs found in humans and mice were recognized by fruit fly transcription factors.</p><p>Nitta et al. noted that both fruit flies and humans have transcription factors that recognize a few unique motifs, and confer properties that are specific to each species. For example, some of the transcription factors that control the development of the fruit fly wing are not present in humans. Moreover, fruit flies lack both mucus-producing goblet cells and the ability to recognize a motif read by the transcription factor that controls the development of these cells in humans.</p><p>The findings of Nitta et al. also indicate that transcription factors do not evolve to recognize subtly different DNA motifs, but instead appear constrained to recognize the same motifs. Thus, much like the genetic code that instructs how to build proteins, the gene regulatory code that determines how DNA sequences direct gene expression is also highly conserved in animals. The language used to guide the development of animals has, as such, remained very similar for millions of years. What makes animals different is differences in the content and length of the instructions that are written using this language into the regulatory regions of their genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04837.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04837.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>evolutionary conservation</kwd><kwd>DNA binding specificity</kwd><kwd>HT-SELEX</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003426</institution-id><institution>Göran Gustafssons Stiftelse för Naturvetenskaplig och Medicinsk Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSI33_127485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hens</surname><given-names>Korneel</given-names></name><name><surname>Deplancke</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001703</institution-id><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institute Internal Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deplancke</surname><given-names>Bart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Drosophila</italic> has almost all transcription factor binding specificities available to humans; and human transcription factors with divergent specificities operate in cell types that are not found in fruit flies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is estimated that the divergence between vertebrate and invertebrate lineages occurred over 600 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hedges et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peterson et al., 2008</xref>). After the divergence, protein coding sequences have retained a relatively high level of similarity, whereas homology in gene-regulatory elements is not detectable, despite the fact that many developmental pathways and regulatory relationships between TFs and their target genes have been conserved (see e g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodrich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pichaud and Desplan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciglar and Furlong, 2009</xref>). Lack of sequence conservation in gene regulatory elements despite their conserved function could be a consequence of divergence of the gene regulatory code between vertebrates and invertebrates. Some changes in coding sequences of TFs have indeed been observed, and linked to specific evolutionary adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di-Poï et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have indicated that primary TF DNA binding specificity evolves slowly, and is extremely conserved between mammalian species (see e g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohmann et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Struhl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Merika and Orkin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amoutzias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>). The origin of most structural families of TFs dates well before the emergence of mammals, and even predates the divergence of vertebrates and invertebrates. Within each TF family, DNA binding specificity has also diverged considerably, with many families having 2–10 different subclasses displaying different primary binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, many differences in the TF repertoire between invertebrates and vertebrates exist due to the expansion of some gene families, such as nuclear receptors and C2H2 zinc finger factors in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charoensawan et al., 2010</xref>). It is currently unclear to what extent such expansion of TF families has changed the gene regulatory code by introducing novel DNA-binding specificities.</p><p>Systematic comparison of DNA binding specificities between vertebrates and invertebrates has been difficult. Databases collecting TF binding specificity information, such as TRANSFAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matys et al., 2006</xref>) and Jaspar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryne et al., 2008</xref>) contain a large number of specificities from different species. However, the data are generally derived using different methods in different laboratories, and therefore it is very difficult to separate method-specific biases from real differences in binding specificity, particularly in cases where the differences are not very pronounced. Comparison of TF binding specificities obtained using in vivo methods such as ChIP-seq or deep DNase I hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He et al., 2014</xref>), in turn, can result in identification of signals derived from heterodimers or indirect DNA binding, and is affected by biases due to the fact that different genomes have different GC content and repertoire of repetitive elements. Furthermore, although large systematic datasets exist for in vitro binding specificity of human and mouse TFs determined using protein-binding microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badis et al., 2009</xref>) and high throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>), these methods have not been previously used to systematically analyze specificities of many TF families from more distantly related organisms. Conversely, a large collection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TF binding specificities has been generated using bacterial one-hybrid assay (B1H; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noyes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enuameh et al., 2013</xref>). However, this method has not been applied to mammalian TFs at a scale sufficient for a broad comparison of TF specificity.</p><p>The lack of large, high resolution datasets generated using similar methods have limited previous studies of conservation of TF binding specificity to studies of divergence of strong core binding specificities in a limited number of cases (see e g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohmann et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Struhl, 1987</xref>). However, in addition to the primary specificity, many TFs have secondary modes of DNA binding, can recognize multiple different homodimeric sites and/or recognize multiple different sequences based on DNA shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rohs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>). These, more subtle DNA binding preferences could potentially change faster than and independently of the canonical core DNA recognition motif, and could thus also allow TF specificity to slowly drift in evolution.</p><p>To characterize the role of divergence and subtle drift in TF DNA binding specificity in animal diversity, we used HT-SELEX to determine TF binding specificities in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. For this, we used existing full-length collection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TF cDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hens et al., 2011</xref>), and also generated a novel genome-scale collection of fruit fly TF DNA binding domain (DBD) constructs. The TFs were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and their specificity determined using HT-SELEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jolma et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>), and compared to our existing human and mouse HT-SELEX data. A striking level of conservation of TF binding specificity was observed, with fruit flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans. Conservation of specificity extended to secondary modes of binding, and even subtle dinucleotide preferences, suggesting that TF binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. Specificities exclusive to either of the species were detected most commonly in cases where a TF subfamily had expanded in one of the species. Only two clear cases of divergence of specificity were observed between orthologs. These results indicate that TF evolution is constrained by structural limitations of the TF folds, and that changes in specificity are rare, and when they occur, tend to have relatively large effects. Interestingly, TF specificities that exist only in human are important for physiology of cell types that do not exist in fruit flies, suggesting that novel TF specificities contribute to formation of new types of differentiated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of DNA binding specificities of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs by HT-SELEX</title><p>A collection of cDNAs of DNA binding domains (DBDs) and full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs were compiled based on annotations in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://FlyTF.org">FlyTF.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfreundt et al., 2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hens et al.

The method is based on a novel distance measure between two subsequences, the Huddinge distance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and ‘Material and methods’ for details). In this method, a subsequence is aligned to all other subsequences, and its count is compared to counts of subsequences that contain <italic>n</italic> − 1 perfectly matching bases, where <italic>n</italic> is the maximum number of defined bases in the aligned subsequences. The method compares also gapped subsequences to ungapped ones, and can thus identify diverse motifs with widely spaced recognition sites, and differentiate between monomers and dimers of the same subsequence. In addition, as subsequences that differ by more than one substitution are not compared to each other, the method can identify strong dinucleotide preferences. Subsequences that differ by one in the number of defined bases are also compared to each other using a threshold to correct for the higher expected count of the subsequence that contains lower number of defined bases.</p><p>Analysis of the fruit fly HT-SELEX dataset using Autoseed resulted in the identification of 416 motifs, of which 210 were monomeric, 198 dimeric, 5 trimeric, and 3 dimers of dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Of these motifs, 90 describe secondary binding modes—bound sequences that are distinctly different from the primary TF binding site (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rohs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>) for a TF that has a stronger primary binding motif.

Motifs generally clustered based on the corresponding TF families. However, motifs obtained using HT-SELEX and B1H for the same proteins were often not located next to each other. One reason for this is that flanking sequences obtained using HT-SELEX and B1H are often not identical. The HT-SELEX data also generally yield somewhat longer profiles (average width of 12.7 bp vs 10.7 bp), particularly in cases where TFs bind as dimers (e.g., nuclear receptors). We and others have shown earlier that inclusion of dimeric sites and the extended flanking specificity improve prediction of in vivo occupied sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orenstein and Shamir, 2014</xref>), indicating that the extended specificity information revealed by HT-SELEX is biologically relevant.</p><p>In addition, the HT-SELEX data include binding models for 65 genes, which are not included in the B1H collection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).

However, sequence analysis of DBD sequences of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human revealed substantial differences in conservation of orthologous TF DBD pairs both between and within different TF families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that some divergence of TF binding specificity could have occurred. To address the conservation of the binding specificities, we first calculated motif similarity score of all previously existing B1H and HT-SELEX binding profiles for <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, respectively, and illustrated their similarities as a network map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Analysis of similarity between canonical homeodomain TF binding specificities between fruit fly and mammals using these existing datasets suggested that fruit fly homeodomains bind to a smaller subset of sites than human homeodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, this result could be due to the method-specific differences discussed above rather than true evolutionary divergence. Indeed, comparison between our HT-SELEX derived fruit fly and mammalian TF profiles indicate that fruit fly and human homeodomains bind to a similar range of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Analyses of other families, including T-box proteins, Nkx type homeodomains, and C2H2 zinc fingers of the EGR family using B1H data produce similarly misleading results suggesting divergence of DNA-binding specificity. In contrast, comparison of our results generated using the same method yields very similar specificity profiles between orthologous proteins from human and fruit fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).

However, both fruit flies and humans have a TF class that recognizes a unique site and does not exist in the other lineage, brinker and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) TFs, respectively. In addition, there are several subfamilies of TFs that recognize unique sites and are species-specific. For example, our analysis indicates that fruit fly lacks monomeric TFs that recognize sites similar to those of non-canonical E2F repressors (E2F7 and E2F8; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>) and members of the class III ETS family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and data not shown).

Thus, in addition to extending the repertoire of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TF binding specificities by providing 122 novel high-resolution motifs, our dataset extends previous models by shedding light on new features of <italic>Drosophila</italic> TF DNA-binding characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conservation of transcription factor binding specificity between fruit flies and mammals</title><p>TFs that belong to the same structural family generally bind to similar sites (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>), which is thought to represent the limited sequence space that can be recognized by particular protein folds. We show here that structural similarity of proteins defines not only the similarity of the core DNA binding site but also the flanking sequences, and that almost all specificities available for a human are also present in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2, 4</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has many genes that are orthologous to human TF genes with highly conserved DBD protein sequences even though these species diverged over 600 million years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We show here that orthologous TFs have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s3 fig1s4 fig1s5 fig1s6 fig1s7 fig1s8 fig1s9 fig1s10 fig1s11 fig1s12 fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 2–13</xref>). This fact suggests that DNA binding specificity is highly constrained by protein structure and is difficult to alter even over long evolutionary time scales. These results also indicate that TF specificity is not generally subject to subtle drift, but tends to either stay very similar or evolve to a distinctly different state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Divergence of specificity</title><p>Although humans have a larger number of TFs than fruit flies, the gene duplication events that have occurred after separation of the invertebrate and vertebrate lineages have generally not lead to emergence of novel TF specificities, outside of the rapidly evolving human zinc finger proteins that suppress endogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lukic et al., 2014</xref>). However, we did find a few cases where a clear divergence of TF specificity had occurred. Most cases involved TFs whose genes have duplicated, and then diverged. In several cases, orthologs of a human protein with a particular specificity do not exist in fruit flies. Examples include non-canonical E2F repressors (E2F7, E2F8), ETS class III (SPI1, SPIB, and SPIC), and nuclear receptors of the ESR and AR subgroups. Conversely, the fruit fly nuclear receptor knirps-like (knrl) and the Pax protein Poxn do not have direct human orthologs, and recognize sites not bound by human TFs. In addition, the arthropod specific TF, brk, recognizes a unique binding site.</p><p>We also identified few cases where an apparent direct ortholog has acquired a novel specificity in either vertebrates or invertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). One case affected the bZIP proteins CG30420 and its human orthologs ATF2 and ATF7, and another the nuclear receptors Hr96 and NR1I. In addition, the human ETS class IV proteins, SPDEF, and its fruit fly ortholog Ets98B recognized an identical GGAT core motif, but preferred different sequences in their 3′ flanks. Surprisingly, recognition of a secondary site we have previously described for SPDEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>) was conserved in fruit flies, with nearly identical sites bound by both SPDEF and Ets98B. The conservation of the secondary binding mode despite divergence of the primary specificity indicates that the binding modes can in some cases evolve independently of each other. Protein sequence-level conservation of the DNA-binding domains of the ETS proteins suggests that the divergence in specificity occurred at or near the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Biological roles of TFs with divergent specificity</title><p>Individual cell types of a multicellular organism are defined by expression of specific combinations of TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>), and the number of TF genes correlates with complexity of organisms (see e g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mastracci and Sussel, 2012</xref>). Interestingly, many of the TFs that we find to have a different specificity in humans are related to endocrine system function (AR, ESR1), or physiology of cell types that do not exist in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). For example, ATF2 and non-canonical E2F repressors are important for placental morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maekawa et al., 1999</xref>), whereas ETS class III and IRF factors have important roles in differentiation of cells of the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2003</xref>). SPDEF, in turn, regulates goblet cell differentiation in lung, conjunctiva, and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregorieff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marko et al., 2013</xref>). Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> has intestinal stem cells and enterocyte-related cells, it does not have a cell type similar to mammalian goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>). These results suggest that evolution of novel TF binding specificities has contributed to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that human and fruit fly TF binding specificities display a striking level of conservation, despite dramatic morphological differences resulting from more than 600 million years of evolution and lack of detectable sequence conservation at the level of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. These results indicate that analogously to the genetic code, which is more conserved than protein-coding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moura et al., 2010</xref>), the gene regulatory code is much more conserved than the regulatory sequences themselves. Our results suggest that morphological divergence is not driven by subtle drift in specificity of TFs, but primarily caused by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levine and Tjian, 2003</xref>), with some contribution from relatively large shifts in binding specificities of specific TFs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data availability</title><p>HT-SELEX sequence data are deposited to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, EMBL-EBI) under accession PRJEB7373.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Clone collection and protein production</title><p>Collection consisting of 760 DNA-binding domains was cloned by PCR, or generated by gene synthesis (codon optimized, Genscript) as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Bing Ren, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the other two reviewers, Kevin White, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Nitta et al. used HT-SELEX to characterize the DNA binding specificity for close to 900 <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factors (TF), generating DNA binding motifs for approximately 230 of them. For many of these TFs, they identified more than one motif recognized by the TFs. The authors then used this tremendous resource to address an important question, are TF binding specificities in <italic>Drosophila</italic> conserved in mammals? To do so, they have developed several new algorithms and generated many high-resolution PWMs for 230 fly TFs. Together with their previous work, this study will have a big impact on the transcription field and data generated will serve as a valuable resources for both experimental and computational researchers. The results not only confirmed previously known <italic>Drosophila</italic> TF binding specificities mapped using different approaches (mainly yeast one hybrid), but also added roughly 110 new TF binding motifs. The key finding is that <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Mammalian TFs with similar protein sequences have highly similar DNA binding specificity, which uncovers a strong conservation of DNA binding specificity of transcription factors over long period of evolution. This is very significant because it argues for a strong negative selection pressure for TF genes. Such conservation, though having been pointed out in previous studies (for example, Noyes MB et al., Cell, 2008), is interesting especially given the large scale and systematic nature. Another contribution is the AutoSeed program, which would be useful for processing of large SELECT datasets for extraction of TF binding motifs. The divergent binding specificity in human is interesting as it might be relevant to the emergence of novel cell types.</p><p>Technologically, the experiment was well designed and the analysis was thorough. The manuscript was well written and results were clearly presented.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) While the reviewers agree that the high degree of conservation in TF recognition motifs between mammals and flies is a potentially significant finding, to gain novelty some felt that it would be important that the authors, through either new analyses or new experiments, demonstrate the degree to which such conservation is unexpected, or unusual, for example, in comparison with other protein classes.</p><p>2) A missed opportunity is that there is relatively little in-depth characterization of TF binding specificity in terms of the relationship between DNA motifs and DNA binding domains for different family of TFs.</p><p>3) Since both 20- and 40-mer random sequences were used as DNA ligands, how reproducible were the motifs generated between the two pools of the DNA ligands?</p><p>4) Many C2H2 zinc finger and bHLH TFs failed to generate any significant motifs. Did they fail to recognize any 20- or 40-mer sequences or were the sequences they bind to too diverse to generate a significant motif?</p><p>5) The authors described comparison between motifs obtained by HT-SELEX and B1H system and concluded that there exists method-specific difference as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>. Have the authors tested the differences using EMSA or cell-based luciferase assays? It is important for the community to fully understand what caused the discrepancy and which method(s) is more reliable.</p><p>6) ATFs are known to recognize octameric palindrome sequences. If the authors' discovery of ATGACGTGAT as a new consensus for fly Aft-2 were true, it would disrupt this palindrome. Have the authors applied orthogonal method, such as EMSA and luciferase assays, to validate the expected interactions? Since this is one of the two cases reported in this study that an ortholog TF pair showed divergent binding specificity, the authors should provide more solid evidence.</p><p>7) The PWMs in the supplement table is missing. This information should be made publically available.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04837.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In general, the reviewers have a positive response to our manuscript, stating that the manuscript “will have a big impact on the transcription field and data generated will serve as a valuable resources for both experimental and computational researchers”.

In the revised version, we have addressed all of the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p>The changes include rewriting of the text, updates to figure panels in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 1 to 4</xref> and figure supplements <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, the addition of five new supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>), and inclusion of two additional authors, Ekaterina Morgunova, who contributed to the structural analyses, and Jarkko Toivonen, who contributed to the generation of the data for the new analyses.</p><p><italic>Main concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) While the reviewers agree that the high degree of conservation in TF recognition motifs between mammals and flies is a potentially significant finding, to gain novelty some felt that it would be important that the authors, through either new analyses or new experiments, demonstrate the degree to which such conservation is unexpected, or unusual, for example, in comparison with other protein classes</italic>.</p><p>We have now performed extensive analyses of conservation of orthologous pairs of TF DNA-binding domains and other interaction domains involved in protein-RNA, protein-protein and enzyme-substrate interactions. We included the comparative analyses of other interaction domains as previous analyses have revealed poor conservation of protein-protein interactomes between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human.</p><p>This analysis revealed that although many TF DBD families are very highly conserved, several families exist whose conservation level is similar to that of the other analyzed domains (e.g. kinase domains, SH3 and SH2 domains).</p><p>In addition, we observed broad differences in sequence-level conservation of DBD ortholog pairs within families. Thus, a simple but reasonable prediction based solely on protein sequence would be that there should be significant divergence in binding specificity between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs. However, we report here that orthologous pairs of TF DBDs almost invariably bound to the same DNA sequences, indicating that the binding specificity is very deeply conserved. We have now included these new analyses in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), and rewritten it to highlight the fact that the extreme conservation of binding specificity is surprising even after considering primary sequence-level conservation of DBDs (second paragraph of the Discussion, and the subsection headed “Conservation of primary DNA-binding specificities between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Humans” in the Results).</p><p><italic>2) A missed opportunity is that there is relatively little in-depth characterization of TF binding specificity in terms of the relationship between DNA motifs and DNA binding domains for different family of TFs</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point. We have now added a heatmap showing sequence-level conservation and conservation of binding specificity as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. Raw data is also added as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2–source data 1</xref>. This figure clearly shows that binding specificity is primarily determined by the structural family of the TF. We have also discussed this issue more extensively in the Results section.</p><p><italic>3) Since both 20- and 40-mer random sequences were used as DNA ligands, how reproducible were the motifs generated between the two pools of the DNA ligands?</italic></p><p>In general, motifs recovered using different length ligands are very similar for all TFs that recognize relatively short (&lt;15 bp) sites. We now show some examples of the reproducibility as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>. We also now discuss this matter in the Methods section and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Many C2H2 zinc finger and bHLH TFs failed to generate any significant motifs. Did they fail to recognize any 20- or 40-mer sequences or were the sequences they bind to too diverse to generate a significant motif?</italic></p><p>This is an important point. We repeated the SELEX for the bHLH and ZF proteins, and managed to generate models for four and eight additional proteins, respectively. The low recovery is thus intrinsic to the TFs and not due to low yield of the SELEX experiments themselves.</p><p>The low recovery of ZFs motifs is due to several reasons. First, some ZFs may not bind to DNA. Second, many C2H2 zinc finger genes encode large arrays of ZFs, which are difficult to express in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>In the case of bHLH proteins, it is known that some of them lack a functional DBD, and many of them do not bind to DNA as homodimers, and instead function as obligate heterodimers. The orthologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> bHLH proteins that failed in many cases also failed in human and mouse SELEX analyses (e.g. sim/SIM1, SIM2, Hand/HAND1, HAND2 etc).</p><p>Our analysis pipeline is capable of detecting any subsequence that is enriched. A diverse set of subsequences would thus be detected. Thus, it is unlikely that the failure of the experiments was due to lack of our ability to detect enriched features characteristic of TF-DNA binding.</p><p>It is, however, possible that generalized and weak preference to mononucleotides or dinucleotides due to shape based DNA recognition would not be detected. We have now included the additional data and discussed the ZF and bHLH cases, and the features of the computational analysis pipeline in the second paragraph of the Results section and in the beginning of the subsection headed “Identification of secondary binding modes and dinucleotide preferences”, also in the Results, respectively.</p><p><italic>5) The authors described comparison between motifs obtained by HT-SELEX and B1H system and concluded that there exists method-specific difference as illustrated in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2 and 3</italic></xref><italic>. Have the authors tested the differences using EMSA or cell-based luciferase assays? It is important for the community to fully understand what caused the discrepancy and which method(s) is more reliable</italic>.</p><p>In general the HT-SELEX and B1H results are in very good agreement, and mutually support each other. Both sets of data are for most purposes almost equally useful. However, there are minor differences that lead to loss of precision that is necessary for comparison of data for orthologs from different species.</p><p>The minor differences are caused mainly by failure of the B1H to capture subtle aspects of TF flanking specificity. In addition, in few cases the B1H analysis reports a monomer when the bound species is a homodimer. Comparison to data obtained using ChIP-seq or DNase I hypersensitivity supports the dimeric species and/or the flanking specificity revealed HT-SELEX where available. The ability of HT-SELEX to capture biologically relevant flanking specificity has also been confirmed by independent groups. For example, when comparing HT-SELEX with protein-binding microarrays, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orenstein and Shamir (2014)</xref> found that: “HT-SELEX models had better [ChIP-seq] binding prediction, partly because of the ability to model the side positions more accurately.” We have also reported similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have now added a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> showing comparisons between some of the most divergent B1H and HT-SELEX models, including those shown in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The models are still similar, but some differences are observed, and where available, data using other methods, including DNase I hypersensitivity from the same lab that performed the B1H supports the HT-SELEX version. We also discuss these issues briefly in the Results section (subsection headed “Conservation of primary 197 DNA-binding specificities between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Humans”), where we also emphasize that the B1H data is in general of very high quality.</p><p><italic>6) ATFs are known to recognize octameric palindrome sequences. If the authors' discovery of ATGACGTGAT as a new consensus for fly Aft-2 were true, it would disrupt this palindrome. Have the authors applied orthogonal method, such as EMSA and luciferase assays, to validate the expected interactions? Since this is one of the two cases reported in this study that an ortholog TF pair showed divergent binding specificity, the authors should provide more solid evidence</italic>.</p><p>There appears to be a misunderstanding here. We have now made it clearer that both fly Atf-2 (CG30420) and ATF7 have the same palindromic consensus 10-mer (ATGACGTCAT). They bind with weaker affinity to other sites, most of which are not palindromic as any single substitution to the site generates a non-palindromic sequence.</p><p>It is relatively commonly observed that homodimers bind non-palindromic sites, probably due to interactions between the subunits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jolma et al., 2013</xref> Figure S3A). Also crystal structure data has shown that bZIP TFs bind even to palindromic DNA with asymmetric contacts (Miller et al. 2003, PMID: 12578822 and Schumacher et al. 2000, PMID: 10952992).</p><p>We have now included the Results using full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> CG30420 to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>, and performed a replicate experiment using another completely independent CG30420 DBD clone (data also added to the figure supplement). In addition, we have analyzed the primary sequence of CG30420, which reveals a substitution by arginine of a key asparagine that recognizes the C base where the specificity difference is observed. We have now briefly discussed this issue in the Results section (subsection headed “Changes in binding specificity between orthologs”), and added the structure-based analysis to the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) The PWMs in the supplement table is missing. This information should be made publically available</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for including the PWM data in an unusual format. We have now included the individual PWMs as a <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and as an Excel spreadsheet with annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
