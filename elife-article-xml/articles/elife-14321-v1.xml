In contrast, studies in rodents have highlighted its role in spatial learning, supported by the discovery of place cells. Efforts to reconcile these views have found neurons in the rodent hippocampus that respond to non-spatial events but have not unequivocally dissociated the spatial and non-spatial influences on these cells. To disentangle these influences, we trained freely moving rats in trace eyeblink conditioning, a hippocampally dependent task in which the animal learns to blink in response to a tone. We show that dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons are all place cells, and do not respond to the tone when the animal is moving. When the animal is inactive, the apparent tone-evoked responses reflect an arousal-mediated resumption of place-specific firing. These results suggest that one of the main output stages of the hippocampus transmits only spatial information, even in this non-spatial task.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14321.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14321.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>dorsal CA1</kwd><kwd>nonspatial learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

The discovery of place cells in rodents led to the hypothesis that the hippocampus forms a 'cognitive map' that is essential for spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>). In contrast, human studies have indicated a more general role of the hippocampus in the formation of episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>). In support of the latter view, electrophysiological studies in rodents have found that pyramidal neurons in the dorsal CA1 area of the hippocampus can change their firing in response to arbitrary stimuli, both spatial and non-spatial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Komorowski et al., 2009</xref>). However, the functional significance of these observations remains controversial because many non-spatial tasks are studied in restrained animals or under circumstances where spatial and non-spatial influences on hippocampal firing cannot be unequivocally dissociated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O’Keefe, 1999</xref>).</p><p>To overcome this challenge, we selected a simple learning task—trace eyeblink conditioning—that can be performed independently of spatial location. In this task, a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS, a tone) is followed, after a short delay, by an unconditioned stimulus (US) that evokes an involuntary blink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With repeated presentations, the subject learns that the CS predicts the US and begins to blink in anticipation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Learning the CS-US association has been shown to be hippocampally dependent in many species, including humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clark and Squire, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takehara et al., 2003</xref>). Previous electrophysiological studies have found that dorsal CA1 pyramidal neurons change their firing following the CS onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weiss et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weible et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that these cells encode the non-spatial stimulus. However, these experiments did not characterize the spatial tuning properties of the recorded neurons.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14321.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CA1 pyramidal responses during trace eyeblink conditioning in a freely moving rat.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An eyeblink trial is a sequence of a tone (CS), a stimulus-free period (trace interval), and a blink-inducing electrical pulse (US).

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the CS can evoke significant changes in the firing rate of dorsal CA1 neurons. Additionally, we find that these apparent CS responses are spatially modulated, but surprisingly, they are absent when the animal is moving. These CS-evoked changes occur only when the animal is inactive, produce firing rates that match normal place cell activity, and are accompanied by a cessation of ripples. These observations are more consistent with an arousal-mediated resumption of place cell firing rather than a genuine encoding of the non-spatial stimuli. These results suggest that neurons in dorsal CA1, a major output stage of the hippocampus, transmit exclusively spatial signals even in this hippocampally dependent non-spatial task.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To simultaneously map the spatial and non-spatial influences on hippocampal firing, we trained adult rats in trace eyeblink conditioning while they traversed a linear track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), an environment in which the spatial coding of hippocampal neurons has been well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">O’Keefe, 2007</xref>). We presented the eyeblink trials at randomized locations throughout the environment, which enables us to dissociate spatial and non-spatial influences on neuronal activity.</p><p>Using chronically implanted tetrode arrays, we recorded from pyramidal cells in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus (an average of 36 cells per training session for a total of 1264). Consistent with previous studies, we found that a subset of cells significantly changed their firing rate following the CS onset (p&lt;0.01 for 10% of cells, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). However, an analysis of single-trial responses reveals that these cell-level statistics belie a high trial-to-trial variability, and none of the recorded cells respond consistently to the CS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>What is the source of this trial-to-trial variability? Does spatial tuning play a role? To address this question, we mapped each cell’s spatial tuning by measuring its average firing rate as a function of the animal’s location while moving around the environment. Cells that were active in the environment had directional place fields distributed throughout the linear track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

For example, the intermittently CS-responsive neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> had a place field in the right endbox, and the trials in which it fired corresponded to the trials presented within this place field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To visualize the influence of this spatial tuning, we ordered the trials by the place field intensity at the trial delivery location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). Overall, we find that the CS evokes an increase in firing when delivered within a cell’s place field, and silences the cell when delivered outside its place field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). This correlation between CS-evoked firing and place field intensity also holds at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These observations indicate that there are no CA1 neurons that respond consistently to the CS in a space-invariant fashion. Instead, the non-spatial stimulus modulates the firing of place cells.</p><p>What is the nature of this modulation? If the CS amplifies ongoing place cell activity, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> suggests, then we would expect that CS responses would be most prominent when place cells are actively engaged, such as during running. Surprisingly, we find the opposite: CS-evoked changes in firing rate are absent when the animal is running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and occur only when the animal is inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, the lack of CS-evoked changes while running is not accompanied by an impairment of task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

During periods of inactivity, animals may enter a state of quiet wakefulness, in which the firing of place cells is not exclusively governed by the animal’s present location. Instead, the hippocampus exhibits other patterns of firing, such as synchronous bursts (ripples) that may engage neurons with distant place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Csicsvari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>). We find that when the animal is sitting, ripples spontaneously occur during the pre-trial period, and abruptly cease following the CS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, CS-evoked changes in firing rate are more pronounced in trials with detected ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the firing of these cells outside their place fields is closely associated with the ripple events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These observations suggest that the animal is indeed in a state of quiet wakefulness during 'sitting' trials, and that the CS triggers an arousal response that leads to a resumption of place cell firing.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14321.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ripples cease following the CS onset.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ripple occurrence rate during trials presented while the animal was sitting (ripples did not occur when the animal was running).

Previous studies have reported that the CS can reset the theta rhythm, aligning the phase of theta to the CS onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nokia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darling et al., 2011</xref>). To distinguish a genuine phase reset from stimulus-evoked initiation of theta oscillations, it is important to restrict our analysis to trials with ongoing theta activity prior to the CS onset. The prominent theta oscillations during running provide the ideal conditions for this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Under these conditions, we found that both the CS and US can evoke a sustained alignment of theta phase, but only in one out of three animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Even when theta phase alignment did occur, the new phase remained highly correlated with the pre-stimulus phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that the observed alignment is due to a subtle phase shift rather than a reset of the theta rhythm. These results confirm that it is possible for the eyeblink stimuli to perturb ongoing theta oscillations, but the absence of this perturbation in two out of three animals shows that it is not necessary to perform the task.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14321.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The CS does not reset ongoing hippocampal theta oscillations.</title><p>This figure shows CS- and US-evoked changes to ongoing theta oscillations in the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) while running.

A conjunction <italic>CS-place cell</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) would change its firing in a location-dependent manner. At first glance, our data appear to fit this model—the CS responses of place cells are gated by their place fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)—but our key observation is that CS-evoked changes in firing rate disappear when the animal is running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This new finding rejects the conjunctive model because these cells can no longer encode the CS-place conjunction in this behavioral state.</p><p>A model that only relies on the known properties of place cell firing provides a more compelling explanation of the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In particular, place cells exhibit place-specific firing only when the animal is moving or alert, and exhibit a different pattern of firing when the animal is in a state of quiet wakefulness. If the CS were able to trigger an arousal response, this would manifest as an increase in firing within a cell’s place field (due to activation of place-specific firing) and a decrease in firing outside the place field (due to cessation of ripple-related firing). Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that in sitting animals, the CS indeed activates place-specific firing, silences out-of-field firing, and abolishes ripples. When the animal is already alert, such as during running, we observe no additional modulation beyond normal place field firing.</p><p>Hence the most parsimonious explanation of the experimental data is that dorsal CA1 neurons are all place cells and the apparent responses to the non-spatial stimuli are due to an arousal-mediated resumption of place-specific firing.</p><p>These observations clarify the nature of previously-reported patterns of hippocampal activity in eyeblink conditioning. Studies of inactive subjects in a fixed location, such as those with restrained animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weiss et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weible et al., 2006</xref>), would find that a subset of cells—those with a place field overlapping the experiment location—consistently increase their firing following the stimulus presentation. Most cells would not have place fields overlapping this location and would be silenced following the stimulus presentation.</p><p>The arousal-mediated nature of the hippocampal response can also account for a variety of learning-related phenomena. In particular, any salient stimulus should be able to evoke these hippocampal responses, regardless of whether the task is hippocampally dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2014</xref>). The salience of the stimulus, and hence its ability to trigger alertness, may change as the subject learns the predictive power of the stimulus, producing a stereotyped evolution of hippocampal activity across learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">McEchron and Disterhoft, 1997</xref>). On the other hand, manipulations that decrease the salience of the CS, such as habituation to the unpaired stimuli presented to control animals, would reduce the apparent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weiss et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have also reported that the CS can reset the phase of hippocampal theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nokia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darling et al., 2011</xref>). Given the lack of CS-evoked firing rate changes while running, could the CS onset be encoded by this phase reset instead? Analogous to previous studies, we find evidence for an alignment of theta phase to the CS onset. However, a direct comparison of pre- and post-stimulus phase reveals that this effect is due to a slight perturbation of the ongoing theta phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In particular, this analysis rejects the notion of theta reset to a specific phase. Furthermore, this phase perturbation is present in only one out of three animals, indicating that it is not necessary for performing the task. Moreover, we did not find evidence that theta phase precession was affected by the CS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Note, however, that this analysis does not rule out the possibility that the CS may modulate the degree of theta phase-locking across brain areas.</p><p>Finally, extensive lesion studies have demonstrated the critical importance of the hippocampus in trace eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takehara et al., 2003</xref>). How do our observations fit with this literature? We found that CS-evoked changes in dorsal CA1 firing rates and theta phase are not necessary for task performance—these responses are absent during running, but performance is not impaired—yet dorsally restricted lesions still produce learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takehara et al., 2003</xref>). Several possible explanations may account for this apparent discrepancy: (1) Dorsal hippocampal lesions may disrupt activity in other hippocampal areas (e.g. ventral CA1), which may contain genuinely CS-responsive neurons. (2) The encoding of the CS may be more subtle than changes in firing rate, but still detectable by postsynaptic targets. (3) The critical engagement of the hippocampus may not occur only during the trial itself. Memory consolidation is hippocampally dependent and proceeds without additional training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takehara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>), indicating that some eyeblink-related activity occurs well after the stimulus presentation. (4) Even though spatial information may appear irrelevant in this task, the presence of ongoing place-specific firing may still be necessary for learning space-invariant responses. For example, awareness of the context may be necessary for the animal to attend to the appropriate stimuli, or learning a context-dependent association may be a necessary stepping-stone to developing a space-invariant association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nadel and Willner, 1980</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that the dorsal hippocampus transmits exclusively spatial signals, even in a hippocampally dependent non-spatial task, and constrain the ways in which it may contribute to memory processing. These experiments also highlight the importance of accounting for brain state in studies where alertness changes may confound the observed selectivity to experimental stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>We recorded from three male Long-Evans rats, 3–5 months old at the time of surgery.

All animals received two training sessions per day, at the beginning and end of the 12-hr light cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>After filtering the differential EMG data with a 120–960 Hz passband, we computed its root-mean-square (RMS) value in three 100 ms windows: 'baseline' from –100 to 0 ms relative to CS onset, 'CR' from 380 to 480 ms (US onset occurs at 500 ms), and 'control' from –580 to –480 ms. Trials in which [CR − baseline] exceeded the 95th percentile of that animal’s [control − baseline] were considered blinks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Spike detection and sorting</title><p>After filtering the tetrode data with a 600–6000 Hz passband, we detected and aligned spikes on peaks in the nonlinear energy operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mukhopadhyay and Ray, 1998</xref>). Spikes were clustered by fitting a mixture model in a 12-dimensional feature space (three principal components per tetrode channel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calabrese and Paninski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ecker et al., 2014</xref>). A cluster was considered a single unit if it was well-isolated (sum of false positive and negative rates &lt; 10%), had a refractory period &gt; 1.5 ms, had a spike amplitude &gt; 120 μV, and its spike waveforms remained stable throughout the course of the recording.</p><p>These criteria identified 1585 single units, of which 1264 we deemed to be putative pyramidal cells based on firing rate (&lt;4 Hz), spike width (&gt;0.25 ms), and bursting (&gt;5% of inter-spike intervals are &lt;10 ms). Each of these 1264 units is treated independently in our analysis, even though several are likely to be repeated observations of the same neuron. We estimate that we recorded only 400–500 unique pyramidal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Place field analysis</title><p>We constructed place field maps by dividing the number of spikes in each location by the occupancy of that location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rich et al., 2014</xref>). Track rate maps are one-dimensional, computed for each direction independently, and smoothed with a σ = 3 cm Gaussian kernel. Endbox rate maps are two-dimensional, non-directional, and smoothed with σ = 1 cm.</p><p>Only periods where the animal was moving (velocity &gt; 2 cm/s) were included in the construction of the firing rate maps. Furthermore, the 2-s window following the CS onset was excluded so that eyeblink responses would not influence the construction of the place field maps. Areas with an occupancy &lt; 50 ms/cm<sup>2</sup> were considered to have an indeterminate spatial firing rate, and any eyeblink trials that occurred in these locations were excluded from analysis.</p><p>We found that 38% of cells were not active in this environment (i.e. did not have a place field with peak &gt; 2 Hz), but this underestimates the actual fraction of silent cells, as we are unable to reliably cluster single units with an overall firing rate &lt; 0.01 Hz.</p><p>The <italic>place field intensity</italic> on a given trial is the value of the place field map at the location in space where the trial was delivered.

We found 123 cells (10% of all pyramidal cells) that were significant at a p&lt;0.01 level. Of these, 87 increased their firing rate and 36 decreased their firing rate. However, this statistical test should be interpreted as a heuristic measure only, as the influences of spatial tuning and brain state violate the test’s assumption that samples are independent and identically distributed.</p><p>To quantify the reliability of a cell’s CS response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we looked for differences in pre- vs. post-CS firing on a trial-by-trial basis. For a rate-increasing cell like the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the observed response reliability is the fraction of trials in which it fired more spikes post-CS than pre-CS.

First, we filtered the tetrode data with an 80–250 Hz passband and looked for peaks in the RMS power.

For each animal, we used a single tetrode for all theta analysis. We chose tetrodes superficial to the cell layer (as determined by sharp wave polarity) so that small changes in the tetrode depth would have a minimal effect on the recorded theta phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>).</p><p>For each trial, we estimate the instantaneous theta frequency and phase using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a 400 ms Kaiser window (α = 1).

For example, we often observed a high-amplitude transient following the US delivery. This clearly skews the estimated theta phase in the vicinity of the US, but our analysis approach ensures that phase estimates 200 ms before or after the transient are unaffected. In contrast, techniques that involve the Hilbert transform or an analysis of IIR-filtered signals cannot guarantee that that the influence of such transients remain localized to a fixed time interval.</p><p>These guarantees ensure that our phase continuity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) does not introduce spurious autocorrelations. The pre-CS window ends at the CS onset, and the post-CS window starts 100 ms after that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>), therefore the pre- and post-CS phase estimates are derived from independent segments of data. To assist in comparison, we use the corresponding frequency estimates to extrapolate both phase estimates to the same point in time (the midpoint of this 100 ms gap, i.e. 50 ms after the CS onset).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank C Wierzynski for development of the experimental paradigm with tetrode recordings, A Hoenselaar for development of the data acquisition system and data processing toolchain, J Mok for assistance with histology, and S Cassenaer, B Hulse, and B Sauerbrei for valuable comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>KQS, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>EVL, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>MP, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>AGS, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting study which identifies a novel spatial correlate of the hippocampal substrate of trace eyeblink conditioning. The authors examined hippocampal pyramidal cell firing during eyeblink conditioning and investigated the relationship between this and spatial firing. They report that conditioned eyeblink unit responses were not consistent, occurring preferentially within the independently mapped place field. Outside of the place field the CS silenced the cell. Furthermore, CS-evoked responses did not occur during running but only when animal was inactive. What seems to be happening is that when the animal becomes inactive in the place field the firing rate drops below what would be predicted on the basis of the active field rate and this active-movement rate is restored by the CS. As has been shown before, sharpwave ripples occurred when the animal was not moving and were inhibited by the CS. The authors conclude that the simplest explanation for their results is that all of the pyramidal cells are place cells, and that, following conditioning, the CS triggers an arousal response which leads to the resumption of the spatial firing in the place field. Importantly they find no evidence for an independent response to the CS which is not dependent on the animal's spatial location.</p><p>The paper is well-written and well-illustrated and makes an important contribution to our understanding of the role of the hippocampus in conditioned responses. Essentially it shows that these are dependent on the spatial function of this brain region and are merely a reflection of one aspect of this spatial function, namely that as an animal sits quietly in the place field, its arousal level drops with a concomitant decrease in firing of the place cell. The CS increases arousal and via this change in state restores the firing of the cell. There is no evidence for a role of the hippocampus conditioning independent of this arousal influence on spatial firing. Importantly, the results rule out the CS- spatial location conjunction hypothesis since the CS does not fire the cells in the place field during running.</p><p>While the primary results are presented clearly, there are gaps in the analysis that should be addressed. In particular, there is a notable absence of analysis of theta activity and its relationship to conditioning, and CS-dependent hippocampal response.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the Discussion, the authors show how their results explain all of the previous findings on the role of hippocampal pyramidal cells in conditioning experiments. On the other hand, they admit that they cannot account for the effect of the hippocampal lesions on eyeblink conditioning. Their only suggestion is that spatial signals are critical for spacing-invariant learning, but this does not seem very compelling or plausible. A possibility not considered is that trace eyeblink conditioning is context dependent and that spatial context is dependent on the hippocampus. Nadel and Willner (1980) originally suggested that the role of the hippocampus in some of these conditioning tasks involved conditioning to the spatial context which might provide the arousing or occasion-setting input which promotes the association between the CS and US especially if there is an interval between the two (see also O'Keefe 1999).</p><p>2) Since animals spend most of their time in the end goal boxes and therefore most of the CS's were delivered there (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) there is a potential confound between location and behavior. It would have been better if the animal had been required to move and remain still at all locations along the track. Such data would be interesting (though optional)? If the authors do not already have this data, this issue should be discussed.</p><p>3) The Moira paper is cited but not really adequately discussed despite the clear overlap in approach and findings. Both involve auditory tone CS conditioning of eyelid shock US response (freezing in their case vs. eyeblink in this study) and both demonstrate dependency on existing place field responses. The observation of CS-evoked responses during ripple-associated immobility is novel and was not addressed in the Moira study, but in that study they did examine questions regarding theta synchronization and the possibility of type II theta during CS-associated immobility. Given the conclusion of lack of CS-independent hippocampal firing rate response, these should be addressed in the present study, with further attention to possible CS-induced changes in hippocampal response that may be relevant such as CS-dependent theta-phase effects (theta phase resetting), and impact on phase precession (if possible).</p><p>4) While it does not undermine the central finding of CS-evoked responses that are predicted by underlying place fields, the absence of an unpaired CS control condition does weaken the overall interpretation in that it does not afford the opportunity to differentiate potential hippocampal correlates of simple CS-related responses from successful CS-US association. The potential contribution of CS salience and associated arousal is discussed but is not explicitly tested.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> seems to show CS associated responses restricted to the early trials suggesting perhaps a training effect. This raises the questions as to whether the reported overall place field predicted CS response changes over the course of training. Is there a change in measures such as CS response reliability over training (e.g. comparing trials 1-7 with below 50% performance and trials 8-14 with above 50% performance)?</p><p>6) Given the absence of a CS-independent hippocampal response, a related question is whether the conditioning would be successful if CS-US pairings only occurred during running when no CS modulation of hippocampal response is observed? It would seem that this is a strong and surprising prediction which could be tested.</p><p>7) Additional information should also be provided on the distribution of place fields and overall behavior. Is hippocampally-dependent conditioning potentially derived from a subset of the CS-US pairings (perhaps those associated with stopping points as suggested in the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)? What is the spatial distribution of stopping locations, and what is the result of restricting the place field and CS response analyses to those locations where CS-associated responses are observed (even if they are arousal state related as the authors suggest)? What is the result of a within-cell comparison of CS response to running and stopping (cells for which CS response can be compared during stopping and running through the same location) as opposed to the across-cell population analysis currently used which may suffer from biases sampling bias due to non-uniform running/stopping behavior as a function of location? The analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> may be adequate to address this concern given a reasonably uniform distribution of stopping locations.</p><p>8) It is interesting that from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, the US response also seems to show the same place field dependent modulation, but there is no analysis or discussion of this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14321.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The paper is well-written and well-illustrated and makes an important contribution to our understanding of the role of the hippocampus in conditioned responses.

We did not intend to endorse only one of these explanations, and have reworded our conclusion to avoid this implication.</p><p>We have also clarified our suggestion that spatial information may be necessary for space-invariant learning. Providing the occasion-setting input that promotes the learned association—even when the CS and US are non-spatial in nature—is consistent with the role that we envision the place cell firing may play, and we have incorporated the reviewers’ suggestion in our Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Since animals spend most of their time in the end goal boxes and therefore most of the CS's were delivered there (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) there is a potential confound between location and behavior.

(2003) that “CS responses of place cells are gated by the location-specific activity of the cells.”</p><p>However, our key finding is that these CS-evoked changes in firing rate are absent when the animal is running. This observation rules out the CS-place conjunctive coding hypothesis endorsed by Moita et al., and we have expanded our discussion of this result.</p><p>The key differences in approach that enabled this new finding include a less disruptive conditioned response (blinking vs. freezing) and a shorter CS-US interval (500 ms vs. 20 seconds), which allowed us to study the case where the animal remained running throughout the trial. A larger sample size (1264 vs. 47 cells) enabled us to perform a more quantitative analysis, and studying a hippocampally-dependent task (trace eyeblink conditioning vs. cued fear conditioning) underscores the relevance of the results.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we now include analysis of CS- and US-related theta phase effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although we find a statistically significant alignment of theta phase following the CS and US, we observed this in only one of three animals and we show that it arises from a subtle perturbation of ongoing theta rhythm rather than a reset to a fixed phase. We also investigated the impact on phase precession and found no evidence for differences between CS-evoked firing and usual place cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) While it does not undermine the central finding of CS-evoked responses that are predicted by underlying place fields, the absence of an unpaired CS control condition does weaken the overall interpretation in that it does not afford the opportunity to differentiate potential hippocampal correlates of simple CS-related responses from successful CS-US association. The potential contribution of CS salience and associated arousal is discussed but is not explicitly tested.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the inclusion of an unpaired CS condition would have been a valuable addition to our experimental design. However, the key result in our study is the finding that CS-evoked changes in firing rate are absent when the animal is running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), without any impairment of task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Regardless of whether these firing rate changes are simple CS-related responses or the product of successful CS-US association, we have shown that they are not necessary to perform the task.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that pseudoconditioned animals (those that received unpaired CS and US) exhibit fewer CS-evoked changes in firing rate than trained animals (Weiss et al., 1996), and this difference arises around the same time that trained animals begin to develop behavioral responses to the CS (McEchron and Disterhoft, 1997). This is consistent with our interpretation that the unpaired CS does not acquire behavioral relevance and thus has little efficacy in driving a brain state change.</p><p>We explored the potential contribution of CS salience and associated arousal by showing that dorsal CA1 firing is agnostic to the CS when the animal is already engaged in an active brain state (i.e. running). Demonstrating the converse—that any salient stimulus would produce the same response as the paired CS-US when presented in the appropriate brain state—would be a more explicit test of this hypothesis. Identifying a set of equivalently salient stimuli and performing a within-cell comparison of responses to the CS and responses to these other stimuli is a promising direction for future studies.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> seems to show CS associated responses restricted to the early trials suggesting perhaps a training effect. This raises the questions as to whether the reported overall place field predicted CS response changes over the course of training. Is there a change in measures such as CS response reliability over training (e.g. comparing trials 1-7 with below 50% performance and trials 8-14 with above 50% performance)?</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows responses from a single training session (out of 14 total for this animal). We have included additional examples from other cells in the same session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which show that a different subset of place cells become active in later trials, when the animal moves to a different location in the environment. These data show that the animal’s location, rather than the course of training, determines whether a given cell fires after the CS.</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewers that learning-related changes are a very compelling topic for further investigation. However, in light of our finding that the CS response depends on the animal’s brain state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), we do not believe that we can satisfactorily perform this analysis within the scope of this paper. In freely-behaving animals, many behaviors change over the course of training: besides learning the conditioned response, the animals also ran faster and exhibited shorter bouts of immobility. Hence it is likely that the distribution of pre-trial brain state also shifts over the course of training. Given the striking differences in CS response under different brain states, it is necessary to distinguish genuine learning-related changes from the side effects of this shift in pre-trial brain state. Additional controls are necessary to properly interpret any observed changes over the course of training.</p><p><italic>6) Given the absence of a CS-independent hippocampal response, a related question is whether the conditioning would be successful if CS-US pairings only occurred during running when no CS modulation of hippocampal response is observed? It would seem that this is a strong and surprising prediction which could be tested.</italic></p><p>Indeed we find that conditioning was successful even when an animal received the vast majority of conditioning trials while running (animal A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although this is only one animal, it suggests that CS-evoked changes in the firing of dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells are not necessary for learning the CS-US association. As we discuss, there are many ways in which the dorsal hippocampus may still contribute to learning and performing the task, but it seems that CS-evoked firing rate changes are not one of them.</p><p><italic>7) Additional information should also be provided on the distribution of place fields and overall behavior.</italic> </p><p>We have added more single-cell examples and a discussion of their corresponding place fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is in addition to the overall distribution of place fields that we previously presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We have also added figures showing the distribution of animal location and behavior during eyeblink trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Is hippocampally-dependent conditioning potentially derived from a subset of the CS-US pairings (perhaps those associated with stopping points as suggested in the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>Previous studies have shown that presenting CS-US pairings during periods of high theta power (Berry and Thompson, 1978; Nokia et al., 2009) or ripples (Nokia et al., 2010) are both associated with faster learning, suggesting that a subset of CS-US pairings may be disproportionately responsible for conditioning.</p><p>However, identifying the subset of trials responsible for conditioning would require comparing the learning rates of animals trained under different conditions, so in general this is not a question that we are able to answer with our data.</p><p>As to the specific hypothesis that hippocampally-dependent conditioning is associated with eyeblink trials delivered while the animal is sitting, we found that conditioning was successful even when an animal received the vast majority of conditioning trials while running (animal A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that sitting still—and the associated CS-evoked changes in CA1 pyramidal cell firing—is not necessary for successful conditioning.</p><p>Berry SD, Thompson RF. 1978.
