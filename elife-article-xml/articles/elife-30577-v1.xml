pigmentosa (RP). We previously reported on a small molecule modulator of the rod transcription factor Nr2e3, Photoregulin1 (PR1), that regulates the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes. Although PR1 slows the progression of retinal degeneration in models of RP in vitro, in vivo analyses were not possible with PR1. We now report a structurally unrelated compound, Photoregulin3 (PR3) that also inhibits rod photoreceptor gene expression, potentially though Nr2e3 modulation. To determine the effectiveness of PR3 as a potential therapy for RP, we treated <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> mice with PR3 and assessed retinal structure and function. PR3-treated <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> mice showed significant structural and functional photoreceptor rescue compared with vehicle-treated littermate control mice. These results provide further support that pharmacological modulation of rod gene expression provides a potential strategy for the treatment of RP.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30577.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are several diseases that cause people to lose their eyesight and become blind. One of these diseases, called retinitis pigmentosa, kills cells at the back of the eye known as rod cells. At first, it affects vision in low light and peripheral vision, but later it affects vision during the daytime as well. There are no effective treatments for patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Yet previous genetic studies have shown that disrupting the activity of genes in rod cells can slow the progression of the disease and preserve vision in mice.</p><p>As for all genes, proteins called transcription factors regulate the activity of rod cell genes. Nakamura et al. now report the discovery of a small drug-like molecule, that they name Photoregulin3, which alters the activity of a transcription factor that regulates rod genes. In follow-up experiments, mice with a mutation that replicates many of the features of retinitis pigmentosa were given Photoregulin3 to see if it could slow the progression of the disease. Indeed, Photoregulin3 could stop many of the rod cells from degenerating in the treated mice. At the end of the experiment, the mice treated with this small molecule had about twice as many rods as the control mice. The treated mice also responded better to flashes of light.</p><p>Nakamura et al. hope that the findings will one day benefit patients with retinitis pigmentosa. But first more research needs to be done before testing Photoregulin3 in humans. For example, the drug-like molecule needs to be made more potent, and if possible adapted to work when given orally, meaning patients could take it as a pill.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>photoreceptor dystrophy</kwd><kwd>ligand</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reh</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shimchuk</surname><given-names>Andy A</given-names></name><name><surname>DeGolier</surname><given-names>Kole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

More than 3,000 mutations in about 60 genes have been identified to be associated with RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daiger et al., 2013</xref>). Most of these mutations are in genes essential for rod photoreceptor development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>). There is currently no approved medical therapy that slows or prevents rod degeneration in these individuals.</p><p>One emerging approach to treating retinal degeneration is through targeting the factors that regulate rod gene expression. Studies of retinal development have identified several transcription factors that regulate photoreceptor gene expression. For example, loss of function mutations in the rod-specific transcription factors Nrl or Nr2e3 cause rods to acquire a more cone-like identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mears et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Montana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haider et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbo and Cepko, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Knockout/down strategies have shown that Nrl and Nr2e3 are necessary even in mature rods to maintain their normal levels of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Montana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the reductions in rod gene expression from deletion of <italic>Nrl</italic> or <italic>Nr2e3</italic>, with either conditional deletion or CRISPR-Cas9 deletion, were sufficient to promote the survival of photoreceptors in multiple models of recessive and dominant RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Montana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We have recently reported that this regulatory pathway can be modulated using small molecule modulators of rod gene expression that we have named Photoregulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). Treatment of developing or mature retina with Photoregulin1 (PR1) reduces rod gene expression and increases the expression of some cone genes. In addition, treatment of two mouse models of RP (mice with the <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> and the <italic>Pde6b<sup>Rd1</sup></italic> mutations) with PR1 slows rod degeneration in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). However, in vivo analyses of PR1 were limited by the compound's potency, solubility, and stability in vivo. In this study, we have identified a structurally unrelated compound, Photoregulin3 (PR3) that also significantly represses rod gene expression, but is more amenable for in vivo studies. With PR3 treatment, we show anatomical and functional preservation of the retina in <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> mice, providing in vivo proof-of-concept of this novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro characterization of PR3</title><p>In order to identify compounds that may target Nr2e3, we searched PubChem (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) for top-scoring hit compounds previously identified to interact with Nr2e3 in transfected CHO-S cells in a luciferase-based assay (PubChem Assay IDs: 602229, 624378, 624394, and 651849).

To determine if PR3 treatment also affects cone gene expression, we explanted intact retinas from P11 wild type mice in media containing DMSO or PR3 for 3 days. We used intact retinas for this experiment to assess changes in dorsal and ventral retina independently. After fixation and whole mount immunostaining, we counted S Opsin+Â cells in the dorsal and ventral retina. Similar to <italic>Nr2e3</italic> mutations, treatment with PR3 resulted in an increase in the number of S Opsin+Â cells in the ventral, but not dorsal retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>).</p><p>PR3 was initially identified as a chemical modulator of Nr2e3 in a luciferase-based assay that identified ligands by disruption of the Nr2e3-NCoR dimer complex and had a calculated IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.07 Î¼M in this assay (PubChem Assay IDs: 602229, 624378, 624394, and 651849). To confirm a direct Nr2e3-PR3 interaction, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Consistent with our other assays, ITC qualitatively showed a direct interaction between PR3 and Nr2e3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; estimated K<sub>d</sub> of 67 Î¼M using a one site model). The initial screen that identified PR3 demonstrated its effects on Nr2e3 in a co-repression assay with NCoR; however, the effects we observed on rod gene expression suggested that PR3 also inhibits the co-activator function of Nr2e3. To explore this possibility, we assessed the effects of PR3 on the ability of Nr2e3 to cooperate with Nrl and Crx, two other transcription factors known to form a co-activation complex for rod gene expression. We first transfected HEK cells with Nr2e3, Nrl, and Crx and measured activation of the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> promoter in the presence of DMSO or PR3. PR3 strongly reduced <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> promoter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We next used co-immunoprecipitation to assess whether PR3 affects the interaction between Nr2e3 and Nrl in HEK 293 cells. We found that PR3 caused an increase in the binding of Nr2e3 to Nrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). Several reports have shown that ligand binding to nuclear receptors stabilizes interactions with co-activators by stabilizing the structure of the ligand-binding domain and co-activator binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Onishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forrest and Swaroop, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). It is not clear why stabilizing the complex would reduce its activity; however, it may be that stabilizing interactions with Nr2e3 prevents Nrl and Crx from interacting with consensus sites on the DNA, or alternatively prevents the recruitment of other components of the transcriptional machinery. Nevertheless, our results indicate that PR3 affects the formation or stabilization of the complex among these critical rod gene regulators.</p><p>Although PR3 was identified in an assay for Nr2e3, it is also possible that it interacts with other nuclear receptors. Two related nuclear receptors that are expressed in photoreceptors are <italic>Errb</italic> and <italic>Rorb</italic>. Deletion of these genes inÂ miceÂ has effects on rod gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Onishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forrest and Swaroop, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). However, small molecule modulators of ERRb induce rapid rod death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Onishi et al., 2010</xref>), and so it is unlikely that PR3 acts through this pathway. Loss of function <italic>Rorb</italic> mutations reduce rod gene expression and lead to a phenotype more like what we observe with PR3 treatment. To determine whether PR3 might also act through antagonism of RORb we transfected HEK 293 cells with RORb and Crx and measured activation of the <italic>S Opsin</italic> promoter, a known target of RORb. In transfected HEK 293 cells, RORb and Crx synergistically activate the <italic>S Opsin</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srinivas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Treatment with PR3 did have a small effect on RORb-Crx driven activation of the <italic>S Opsin</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>); however, this effect was much smaller than what we found for PR3 on activation of the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> promoter by Nr2e3, Nrl, and Crx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To further evaluate a role for PR3 as an RORb antagonist, we analyzed downstream RORb target gene expression in developing retina.

We explanted adult (P23-35) retinas from wild type and Rd7 mice in media containing DMSO or PR3 and measured <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> expression by qPCR. Consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of PR3 on rod gene expression are mediated through Nr2e3, PR3 caused a significant reduction in <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> expression in wild type retinas but not in retinas from Rd7 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). While this experiment confirms Nr2e3 specificity of PR3, it remains unclear why Rd7 retinas exhibit only moderate reductions in rod gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbo and Cepko, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haider et al., 2001</xref>), while PR3 treatment or CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) result in substantial decreases. This suggests that there is some developmental compensation that is not present when the gene is deleted or inhibited in postmitotic rods; alternatively, PR3 may be acting in a dominant-negative manner, and inhibiting the ability of the Nr2e3-Nrl-Crx complex to function properly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vivo characterization of PR3</title><p>Nr2e3 signaling is important for rod photoreceptor cell fate, development and maturation, and maintenance of expression.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Small molecule Photoregulin3 prevents retinal degeneration in the <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been reviewed by three expert reviewers, and their assessments together with my own (Jeremy Nathans) as Reviewing Editor, forms the basis of this letter. The process was overseen by Senior editor Gary Westbrook. I am also including the three reviews in their original form at the end of this letter, as there are many specific and useful suggestions in them that will not be repeated in the summary here. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joseph C Corbo (Reviewer #2) and Bo Chen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers and I think that the identification of small molecule Nr2e3 antagonists is important and that exploring the application of these antagonists in a rod-to-cone conversion strategy for treatment of RP is exciting. However, we have concerns about the incompleteness of the data and its interpretation. In particular, our central concern is that it is not clear whether PR3 action in vivo is through Nr2e3 or might be an off-target effect (or a combination of the two).</p><p>Reproduced below is an edited version of our on-line discussion that captures this critique and includes a specific proposal for a follow-up experiment with the Nr2e3 KO (=rd7) mouse that would clarify the target of PR3. We think that this experiment would greatly enhance the value of your manuscript. [A more extensive experiment in which the rd7 allele is crossed into the P23H background would also be enlightening but would take substantially longer, assuming that one is starting from scratch with the crosses.]</p><p>&quot;There is an apparent discrepancy between the Nr2e3 KO phenotypes and the implied mechanisms of PR3 rescuing P23H degeneration, namely the mild rod gene reduction and strong cone gene derepression in the Nr2e3 KO versus the strong rod gene reduction and relatively normal cone gene expression in the in vivo PR3 treatment. A discrepancy between a genetic KO and pharmacological perturbation certainly could be due to interesting real biology (elaborated below), but could also be a red flag for the not-so-uncommon off-target effects. In either case, I feel it is necessary to establish whether PR3 acts through NR2E3. This is important because if off-target, it requires a major reinterpretation and because in its current form, the manuscript seems misleading for the field by equating Nr2e3 inhibition to Nrl inhibition with regard to retarding retinal degeneration.</p><p>As pointed out already, we could ask for data showing whether genetic deletion of Nr2e3 is protective in the P23H model. If the data are unavailable or contradictory (i.e. no protection), the observed rescue could be due to effects from acute pharmacological inhibition that can only be modeled by a conditional knock-out model (e.g. some compensatory mechanism leading to a milder phenotype in the germline Nr2e3 null). Alternatively, PR3 might function as an inverse agonist and induce some gain of function from the NR2E3 protein, as Joe suggested. There are at least two conceivable scenarios. First, NR2E3 binds to both rod and cone gene promoters and functions as a weak activator for rod genes (possibly inhibited by NRL/CRX) but a strong repressor for cone genes (on its own). PR3 somehow locks NR2E3 into a strong repressor on both rod and cone promoters. Second, PR3 enhances interaction between NR2E3 and NRL/CRX such that PR3-bound NR2E3 depletes NRL/CRX that would otherwise activate rod genes. Interestingly, their first compound PR1 was reported in their IOVS paper to enhance NR2E3/NRL/CRX complex formation in a heterologous system, although no explanation was given. Regardless of the actual mechanisms, the effect of PR3 in reducing rod genes beyond the Nr2e3 genetic null should depend on the presence of NR2E3 protein; this could be tested by treating Nr2e3 KO with PR3. Specifically, one could measure the reduction in rhodopsin expression under the treatment regimen (not just 24 hrs) in wildtype mice; this reduction is expected to disappear in the Nr2e3 KO if PR3 acts through NR2E3. This doesn't require crossing mice and should be do-able within a reasonable time frame. This could at least rule out a trivial explanation of the rescue: non-specific developmental delay in mutant rhodopsin expression and hence delay in manifestation of retinal degeneration. In any event, the possibility of off-target effects should certainly be discussed, and the 67 Î¼m Kd in ITC explained.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript is an addition to the emerging theme of treating rod degeneration via rod-to-cone reprogramming. Proof-of-principle studies by other labs showed that genetic deletion of Nrl leads to functional improvement in multiple mouse models of retinal degeneration. The authors sought to pharmacologically inhibit Nr2e3, a transcription factor downstream of Nrl, and identified in a chemical screen several Nr2e3 inhibitors, one of which (PR1) they have published and inhibits rod gene expression while increasing cone gene expression in culture. In this manuscript, the authors reported a structurally unrelated chemical (PR3) and tested its effect on rod/cone gene expression and rescuing retinal degeneration in a mouse model carrying a dominant rhodopsin mutation. While the clinical significance and striking rescue phenotypes would be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, this reviewer would like to see additional evidence to rule out off-targets given the potential discrepancy between genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Nr2e3.</p><p>The Nrl mutant retinas expresses little rhodopsin, but the Nr2e3 mutant retinas have a very limited decrease in rhodopsin expression, especially at 2-3 postnatal weeks that are of interest here. This, together with the likely partial inhibition characteristic of pharmacological approaches, raises the question whether a partial inhibition of Nr2e3 would lead to a functionally-relevant decrease in mutant rhodopsin expression, as achieved via genetic deletion of Nrl. In the absence of genetic deletion of Nr2e3 (similar to the Nrl experiments), a necessary experiment would be to measure rhodopsin downregulation in wild type mice under the same treatment regimen as in the rhodopsin mutant mice (not just 24 hr post treatment at a different postnatal day). How do the authors rule out the possibility that the rescue of degeneration is simply due to a non-specific delay in development and hence a delay in degeneration? Other retinal cells might not be the best control if they are not actively developing during this time window. Are there other organs/cells known to develop rapidly at the time of PR3 treatment?</p><p>Related to this, this reviewer is confused about why the ITC Kd measuring the direct interaction is 100 times higher than the effective biological concentration in culture.</p><p>This reviewer doesn't see &quot;rod nuclei of PR3-treated retinas contained smaller patches of densely packed heterochromatin&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. This needs to be quantified or deleted.</p><p>The original chemical screen is based on disruption of the interaction between Nr2e3 and a transcriptional co-repressor, NCoR. It should be discussed how such disruption and presumable loss of transcriptional inhibition lead to, counterintuitively, a decrease in rhodopsin expression and/or disruption of the suggested Nrl/Nr2e3/Crx complex.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this exciting study, the authors present the identification of a small molecule (photoregulin3 or PR3) which is capable of retarding the progression of photoreceptor degeneration in the RhodopsinP23H mutant mouse, a model for retinitis pigmentosa. This study is a follow-up on a previous study from the same group (Nakamura et al., 2016) which identified another small molecule, photoregulin1, with related properties. These two reports form part of a growing body of work from several groups which suggests that genetic or chemical inhibition of the transcriptional pathway regulating rod gene expression (Nrl -&gt; Nr2e3) can confer protection against photoreceptor degeneration in a range of genetic models of blindness. The present study is important because it is the first to demonstrate efficacy of a small molecule (PR3), putatively targeting this pathway, in preventing photoreceptor degeneration in vivo.</p><p>There are several issues that, if addressed, would strengthen the conclusions of the study. First, some of the experiments appear to have been performed in very few, or even a single, biological replicate. For example, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (the effects of PR1 and PR3 on Rho expression by qPCR) show a single biological replicate. To solidify this result, three biological replicates should be presented. Similarly, only two biological replicates are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. I suspect that addition of a third biological replicate is unlikely to materially affect the conclusions derived from this experiment, but I would normally have expected at least three biologic replicates for an experiment of this sort. It was unclear from the text how many biological replicates were performed for the RNA-seq experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. At a minimum, two biological replicates are needed and three are preferred.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Nakamura et al. presented results reporting that photoregulin3 (PR3), identified from a small molecule screen as an inhibitor of Nr2e3, regulates photoreceptor gene expression and morphology in the wildtype retinas, and very interestingly, in vivo treatment with PR3 preserves both rod and cone photoreceptors and rescues retinal function in Rho-P23H mice, a knock-in mouse model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). Ne2e3 is located downstream of Nrl to promote rod cell fate while suppressing the expression of cone genes. Reduction of Nrl expression by targeted deletion (Matana et al., 2013) or Crispr/Cas9-mediated knockdown (Yu et al., 2017) retarded retinal degeneration and partially preserved retinal function, through a mechanism that rods could be partially converted to cones in the adult mouse retina. The authors presented convincing evidence that similar to Nrl knockdown, chemical inhibition of Ne2e3 by PR3 suppressed rod phenotype, although not completely clear if rods were undergoing conversion to cones, and prevented photoreceptor death in Rho-P23H mice at young age (postnatal day 21). The research is well presented with a potentially high impact for the treatment of adRP with PR3.</p><p>Here are some points to consider and to make sure the interpretations are thoroughly supported:</p><p>1) The P23H homozygous mice were used in the retinal degeneration studies. The use of P23H/WT rhodopsin heterozygous mice would have been more appropriate to mimic the human disease as the P23H mutated protein is co-expressed with the wild-type rhodopsin protein.</p><p>2) Please show representative images that PR3 treatment reduced rhodopsin expression in dissociated retinal cultures.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the authors showed that PR3 treatment enhanced s-opsin expression in the ventral retina. What happens to the s-opsin expression in the dorsal retina?</p><p>4) Does IP injection of PR3 in intact mice at P13 lead to upregulation of s-opsin as happens to the explants culture?</p><p>5) Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the authors claimed that PR3 treatment affected photoreceptor outer segment development. The outer segments consist of densely packed membrane discs where visual pigments and essential proteins for phototransduction are housed. Do membrane discs appropriately form in the PR3-treated retinas? Please show high-resolution EM pictures to clarify.</p><p>6) To rescue photoreceptors in P23H homozygous mice, PR3 treatment started at P12-P14, and the results were analyzed a week later at P21. adRP caused by P23H mutation is a chronic degenerative condition, commonly spanning decades in human patients. It is interesting to know how long the protective effects last. Are photoreceptors still protected when the treated mice are analyzed at 6 or 8 weeks of age?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30577.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] âSpecifically, one could measure the reduction in rhodopsin expression under the treatment regimen (not just 24 hrs) in wildtype mice; this reduction is expected to disappear in the Nr2e3 KO if PR3 acts through NR2E3. This doesn't require crossing mice and should be do-able within a reasonable time frame. This could at least rule out a trivial explanation of the rescue: non-specific developmental delay in mutant rhodopsin expression and hence delay in manifestation of retinal degeneration. In any event, the possibility of off-target effects should certainly be discussed, and the 67 Î¼m Kd in ITC explained.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful reviews and critiques. We have carried out most of the experiments you and the reviewers have suggested; many of these concerns had to do with potential other targets of PR3 and we have done our best to evaluate this possibility. Since we cannot rule out that there may be other targets in the retina for PR3, we have modified the Abstract and text in many places to leave open this alternate interpretation. Nevertheless, we were able to carry out the critical experiment that was raised in the Discussion section with the reviewers and the results support the hypothesis that Nr2e3 is at least one important target of PR3:</p><p>As requested by the reviewers we have carried out the above experiment. We were not able to obtain the Nr2e3 knockout mouse, because this strain is no longer available; however, the Rd7 mouse has a spontaneous insertion in the Nr2e3 gene and is considered a null in the field. We found that PR3 no longer has a significant effect on <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> expression in the Rd7 retina. The results are described in the new text added to the manuscript (Results and Discussion, fifth paragraph):</p><p>&quot;To further evaluate whether PR3 has other targets in the retina, we tested PR3 in Rd7 retinas, which harbor a spontaneous mutation in Nr2e3 [27-29]. We explanted adult retinas from wild type and Rd7 mice in media containing DMSO or PR3 and measured Rhodopsin expression by qPCR. Consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of PR3 on rod gene expression are mediated through Nr2e3, PR3 caused a significant reduction in Rhodopsin expression in wild type retinas, but not in retinas from Rd7 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). While this experiment confirms that Nr2e3 is a key target of PR3, it remains unclear why Rd7 retinas exhibit only moderate reductions in rod gene expression [11-13, 28], while PR3 treatment or CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of Nr2e3 [14] result in substantial decreases. This suggests that there is some developmental compensation that is not present when the gene is deleted or inhibited in postmitotic rods; alternatively, PR3 may be acting in a dominant-negative manner, and inhibiting the ability of the Nr2e3-Nrl-Crx complex to function properly.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] The Nrl mutant retinas expresses little rhodopsin, but the Nr2e3 mutant retinas have a very limited decrease in rhodopsin expression, especially at 2-3 postnatal weeks that are of interest here. This, together with the likely partial inhibition characteristic of pharmacological approaches, raises the question whether a partial inhibition of Nr2e3 would lead to a functionally-relevant decrease in mutant rhodopsin expression, as achieved via genetic deletion of Nrl. In the absence of genetic deletion of Nr2e3 (similar to the Nrl experiments), a necessary experiment would be to measure rhodopsin downregulation in wild type mice under the same treatment regimen as in the rhodopsin mutant mice (not just 24 hr post treatment at a different postnatal day). How do the authors rule out the possibility that the rescue of degeneration is simply due to a non-specific delay in development and hence a delay in degeneration? Other retinal cells might not be the best control if they are not actively developing during this time window. Are there other organs/cells known to develop rapidly at the time of PR3 treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We also find it interesting that Photoregulin3 (PR3) treatment leads to such a large change in rod gene expression, whereas the germline deletion of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> or the Rd7 mutation does not; however, this may be due to compensation from loss of the gene in development by other rod transcription factors, and this compensation may not occur in PR3 treated retinas or adult deletion of <italic>Nr2e3</italic>.</p><p>Since we submitted our manuscript, we became aware of another study that used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete <italic>Nr2e3</italic> in postnatal mice (Zhu et al., 2017); deletion of this gene in adult photoreceptors caused a large reduction in rod gene expression and an increase in cone gene expression, very similar to the CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of <italic>Nrl</italic> (Figure S1 of Zhu et al., 2017).</p><p>Furthermore, this recent study demonstrated that deletion of Nr2e3 by CRISPR-Cas9 is protective in the Rd1 and Rd10 models of RP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Zhu et al., 2017), similar to what was found with <italic>Nrl</italic> deletion and similar to the effects we observe with PR3 on <italic>Rho<sup>P23H</sup></italic> mice. Thus, the CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> shows that targeting Nr2e3 can cause a functionally relevant decrease in rod gene expression.</p><p>As for whether PR3 causes a non-specific delay in development of the animal or the retina, we have not observed any change in body mass or age of eye opening in treated mice, and the other cells in the retina appear to be similar in both treated and control mice. Additionally, the RNAseq shows primarily changes in photoreceptor genes. For example, we see no change in the expression of Muller glial genes <italic>Rlbp1, Slc1a3</italic> (Glast), or <italic>Glul</italic>. Muller glia are the last-born cells of the retina and are still maturing at this time.</p><p>To further control for this possibility we tested PR3 on adult wild type retinas in explant cultures. We found that after two days there was a 60% reduction in <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> expression in the PR3 treated retinas, as compared to the DMSO control. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, this reviewer is confused about why the ITC Kd measuring the direct interaction is 100 times higher than the effective biological concentration in culture.</p></disp-quote><p>For ITC, we used Nr2e3 protein purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Proteins purified from bacterial cultures do not have any post-translation modifications and may not be completely folded correctly, and these differences may contribute to this discrepancy. It is also possible that Nr2e3 changes conformation in the presence of co-activators or co-repressors and PR3 then has a higher affinity. In HEK 293 cells, transfected with Nr2e3, Crx and Nrl, we see effects of PR3 at 1 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Additionally, the original screen used a different mammalian cell line (CHO-S) transfected with Nr2e3 and NCoR and calculated an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.07 Î¼M for this compound (PubChem Assay ID 624394).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewer doesn't see &quot;rod nuclei of PR3-treated retinas contained smaller patches of densely packed heterochromatin&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.

It should be discussed how such disruption and presumable loss of transcriptional inhibition lead to, counterintuitively, a decrease in rhodopsin expression and/or disruption of the suggested Nrl/Nr2e3/Crx complex.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the results we observe on rod gene expression would not necessarily be predicted from a screen that assayed the interactions between Nr2e3 and a co-repressor. We have therefore added the following text to the manuscript (Results and Discussion, fourth paragraph):</p><p>&quot;The initial screen that identified PR3 demonstrated its effects on Nr2e3 in a co-repression assay with NCoR; however, the effects we observed on rod gene expression suggested that PR3 also inhibits the co-activator function of Nr2e3. [â¦] It is not clear why stabilizing the complex would reduce its activity; however, it may be that stabilizing interactions with Nr2e3 prevents Nrl and Crx from interacting with consensus sites on the DNA, or alternatively prevents the recruitment of other components of the transcriptional machinery.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>There are several issues that, if addressed, would strengthen the conclusions of the study.
