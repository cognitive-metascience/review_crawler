domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and in some cases are autophagy receptors for selective ER turnover. We have found that maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 control ER homeostasis and autophagic flux in endosperm aleurone cells, where the ER accumulates lipid droplets and synthesizes storage protein accretions metabolized during germination. Maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 are expressed in the endosperm, localize to the ER, and re-model ER architecture in a dose-dependent manner. Rtn1 and Rtn2 interact with Atg8a using four Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs) located at the C-terminus, cytoplasmic loop, and within the transmembrane segments. Binding between Rtn2 and Atg8 is elevated upon ER stress. Maize <italic>rtn2</italic> mutants display increased autophagy and up-regulation of an ER stress-responsive chaperone. We propose that maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 act as receptors for autophagy-mediated ER turnover, and thus are critical for ER homeostasis and suppression of ER stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>endosperm</kwd><kwd>ER-phagy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Maize</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1840687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agriculture Hatch Act Formula Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WIS01791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-133932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vierstra</surname><given-names>Richard David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hatch Act Formula Fund WIS0179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otegui</surname><given-names>Marisa S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007015</institution-id><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Xinxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plant reticulons bind Atg8 under ER stress to promote reticulophagy and ameliorate ER stress in the maize endosperm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the most extensive and versatile organelle in plants, consisting of a complex three-dimensional network of tubules and cisternae within each cell, and projections that provide cell-to-cell connections through plasmodesmata. Besides being a site of synthesis, folding, and modification of proteins, lipids, and hormones, and the entry point for nascent proteins into the secretory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stefano and Brandizzi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helliwell, 2006</xref>), the ER participates in calcium-mediated signaling, and the perception and response to protein folding stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Srivastava et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>ER stress occurs in response to a number of physiological and pathological conditions that saturate ER protein folding capacity, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. As a consequence of ER stress, eukaryotic cells: i) up-regulate expression of stress-responsive genes to restore protein-folding capacity in the ER <italic>via</italic> a mechanism called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hetz, 2012</xref>); ii) expand ER volume to accommodate the increased protein load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schuck et al., 2009</xref>); iii) promote ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of unfolded or misfolded proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mehrtash and Hochstrasser, 2019</xref>); and iv) trigger turnover of selected ER domains via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rashid et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ER is constantly adjusting its size, shape, and activity in response to developmental cues and cellular demands. Its dynamic shape is controlled by a large number of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hu et al., 2011</xref>), including the reticulon (RTN) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nziengui and Schoefs, 2009</xref>). RTNs contain a signature reticulon homology domain (RHD) with two major hydrophobic segments forming a pair of V-shaped transmembrane wedges joined by a cytosolic loop, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breeze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kriechbaumer et al., 2015</xref>). RTNs are generally required for the formation of ER tubules, although some RTNs preferentially locate to ER cisternal edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>). The mechanisms that control ER homeostasis and restore ER normal size upon cessation of ER stress are not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loi et al., 2018</xref>), but appear to involve autophagy and RTNs in both animals and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernales et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Selected portions of the ER and other organelles can be degraded through autophagy. In plants, two major autophagic routes have been identified: macro- and micro-autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). During macro-autophagy, a cup-shaped, double membrane structure called the phagophore emerges from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>), expands, and sequesters cytoplasmic contents as it closes to form a sealed autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with the tonoplast to release the internal membrane-bound core as an autophagic body into the vacuolar lumen where it is catabolized by vacuolar hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). Macro-autophagy is mediated by multiple AUTOPHAGY-RELATED (ATG) proteins. Among them, members of the ATG8 family (known as MAP1LC3 or GABARAP in mammals) are critical components for autophagosome assembly and cargo selection. Upon autophagy induction, ATG8 becomes conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine and is subsequently incorporated into the inner and outer phagophore membranes, where it participates in phagophore expansion and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weidberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yu and Melia, 2017</xref>), tethering of appropriate autophagic cargo through its association with cargo receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>), and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes or vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). Like in other members of the ubiquitin-fold superfamily, ATG8 conjugation involves the E1 activating enzyme ATG7, the E2 conjugating enzyme ATG3, and an E3 ligase complex, which consists of a conjugate of ATG12 and ATG5 bound to their partner ATG16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaufmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Walczak and Martens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). ATG8 engages autophagy receptors either through ATG8-interacting motifs (AIMs; known as LC3-interacting regions or LIRs in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Noda et al., 2010</xref>) or through recently discovered ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marshall et al., 2019</xref>), thus tethering the receptors and their associated cargo to autophagic membranes. During micro-autophagy, the tonoplast directly engulfs cargo by internalizing and pinching off vacuolar membrane domains, thus directly trapping cytoplasmic cargo in autophagic bodies, which are either stably stored or degraded inside the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Müller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sakai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chanoca et al., 2015</xref>). Both macro- and micro-autophagy can be either non-selective (bulk autophagy) or highly selective for specific cargo depending on physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marshall and Vierstra, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The ER is connected to autophagy in at least three distinct capacities; i) the ER provides membrane for building phagophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhuang et al., 2017</xref>); ii) autophagy is triggered upon ER stress to prevent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ogata et al., 2006</xref>); and iii) the ER is itself a target for selective autophagy. This selective autophagic removal of the ER, called ER-phagy (or reticulophagy), is triggered by ER stress and other stimuli such as starvation. In yeast, starvation induces Atg8-dependent macro-ER-phagy, whereas perturbations of ER redox homeostasis and the UPR lead to engulfment of ER sub-domains directly by the vacuole <italic>via</italic> a micro-ER-phagy route independent of Atg8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schuck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schäfer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the past few years, multiple macro-ER-phagy receptors, some of which harbour RHD sequences, have been identified in both yeast and mammals whereas only one receptor was identified in plants. In yeast, the ER-resident proteins Atg39 and the RHD-containing protein Atg40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) directly interact with Atg8 to mediate ER-phagy of the nuclear envelope and cortical ER membranes, respectively, under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mochida et al., 2015</xref>). Atg40 in particular interacts with Lunapark protein 1 (Lnp1), which resides at three-way tubular junctions of the ER, to bring Atg40-containing ER regions to the sites of phagophore initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Atg40 also interacts with components of the COPII assembly machinery to sort ER domains into autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). In mammals, the pair of RHD-containing proteins RTN3L (the long isoform of RTN3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grumati et al., 2017</xref>) and FAM134B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhaskara et al., 2019</xref>) act as ER-phagy receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), together with four other ER-resident proteins that lack RHD domains, namely CCPG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith et al., 2018</xref>), SEC62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chino et al., 2019</xref>), ATL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and TEX264 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2019</xref>). All reside in the ER, bind ATG8/MAP1LC3/GABARAP via AIMs or GIMs (GABARAP interacting motifs), and are required for cargo selection during ER-phagy. In plants, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> SEC62 seems to play a conserved role as an ER-phagy receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the identities of other plant ER-phagy receptors, as well as their regulation and molecular mechanisms of action, are yet not known.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 are reticulon proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams of reticulon proteins with functions in ER-phagy.

The ER is extensively modified in both cell types; the starchy endosperm accumulates protein accretions called protein bodies inside the ER lumen, whereas the aleurone accumulates lipid droplets between the phospholipid leaflets of the ER membrane, both of which are consumed during seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Larkins and Hurkman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pedrazzini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>). Maize aleurone cells also transiently accumulate protein accretions in the ER, but deliver them to vacuoles by a poorly understood Atg8-independent autophagic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To help understand the functions of reticulon proteins in ER dynamics of cereal endosperm cells, we performed an in silico expression analysis and found that two highly similar RHD proteins, Rtn1 and Rtn2, are expressed in the maize endosperm cells during the accumulation of storage proteins and lipids. Here, we analyzed the functions of Rtn1 and Rtn2 using genetic, biochemical, and imaging analyses, and found that both act as AIM-containing ER-phagy receptors that protect maize aleurone cells against ER stress. The binding of Rtn proteins to Atg8 is positively regulated by ER stress, thus providing a mechanism to help promote ER turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Rtn proteins in maize</title><p>To identify Rtn proteins with potential functions in ER dynamics and autophagic turnover during the accumulation of storage proteins and lipids in maize endosperm cells, we first examined the phylogenetic relationships of the Rtn family proteins in maize and other plants. Whereas yeast and mammals have only two and four loci encoding RHD-containing proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oertle et al., 2003</xref>), plants harbour large gene families with predicted RHD sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nziengui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kriechbaumer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nziengui and Schoefs, 2009</xref>).

Using the longest transcript for each locus, we identified a large Rtn clade containing Rtn1-18 (clade 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Seven positionally-conserved AIMs were predicted in Rtn1/2, including one in the cytoplasmic loop, one in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, and five within the transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To map the Atg8-interaction sites in Rtn2 by Y2H, we first tested the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails as well as a fragment encompassing the cytoplasmic loop, and found that only the C-terminal region of Rtn2 interacted with Atg8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which is consistent with the presence of a single functional AIM at the C-terminus of both mammalian FAM134B and yeast Atg40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mochida et al., 2015</xref>). However, substitutions replacing the predicted C-terminal AIM with alanine residues in both Rtn1 and Rtn2 (Rtn1-mAIM1 and Rtn2-mAIM1) largely retained Atg8a binding in a split ubiquitin Y2H assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), prompting us to investigate other putative AIMs by both Y2H and co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>, only when alanine substitutions were collectively introduced into the predicted AIMs within the cytoplasmic loop (predicted AIM6), two other AIMs located at the transmembrane regions close to the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (predicted AIM2 and AIM5), and AIM1 within the C-terminal tail, did we successfully abolish Atg8a binding. Mutations in AIM6 at the cytoplasmic loop had a less pronounced effect on Atg8a binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>), suggesting that although each one of these four AIMs promotes the association of Rtn1/2 with Atg8a, their contributions are not equal. Importantly, these AIM mutations did not appear to alter the localization of Rtn2 in the ER membranes, as confirmed by their ability to interact with Rtn1-GFP in co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and to colocalize with the CFP-KDEL ER-marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the mutations in the AIMs located at the transmembrane regions affect Rtn2 protein stability, we detected both HA-Rtn2 and HA-Rtn2(mAIM1,2,5,6) by immunoblot assays upon inhibition of protein synthesis by cyclohexamide (CHX) in Arabidopsis protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

To further confirm that these AIMs are required for the autophagy-mediated degradation of Rtn2, we performed a similar CHX chase using Arabidopsis <italic>atg7</italic> mutant protoplasts, which are unable to perform macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doelling et al., 2002</xref>). In this situation, both HA-Rtn2 and HA-mRtn2(AIM1,2,5,6) showed similar stability, strongly implying that the degradation of HA-Rtn2 during the CHX treatment depends on macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>Since AIM2 and AIM5 are predicted to be at least partially embedded into the ER membrane, we speculated that Atg8a lipidation, and therefore incorporation of Atg8a into membranes, could influence Rtn1/2 binding.

An approximately 3-fold increase in the binding between GFP-Atg8a and HA-Rtn2 was seen upon DTT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similar results were observed when we performed a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of HA-Rtn2 with anti-GFP antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We also tested the effect of tunicamycin, which induces ER stress by impairing N-glycosylation of nascent proteins inside the ER.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, no increase in Atg8a binding was seen for the Rtn2(mAIM1) protein, indicating that AIM1 within the C-terminal tail of Rtn2 was required for the increased binding of Rtn2 to Atg8a upon DTT exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Under similar co-immunoprecipitation conditions, the HA-Rtn2(mAIM1,2,5,6) mutant protein did not appreciably interact with GFP-Atg8a, either in the presence or absence of DTT, again confirming that Rtn2 employs several AIMs to bind Atg8. To confirm that the interaction between Atg8a and Rtn2 after DTT treatment was solely dependent on AIM-mediating binding, we introduced two point mutations (Y50A, L51A) in the LIR/AIM docking site (LDS) of maize Atg8a that should abolish AIM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marshall et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, GFP-Atg8a(mLDS) did not interact with HA-Rtn2 in protoplasts incubated with or without DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>DTT is a reducing agent that causes protein misfolding in the ER by breaking disulfide bridges between cysteines. We noticed that both Rtn1 and Rtn2 contain four positionally conserved cysteines within the N-terminal and the C-terminal hairpin transmembrane segments of the RHD that are predicted to form hinges near the ER lumen (C107, 109, 190, and 191; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on the topology of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RTNLB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sparkes et al., 2010</xref>) and modeling predictions of maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 by TOPCONS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://topcons.cbr.su.se">http://topcons.cbr.su.se</ext-link>), these cysteine-rich regions could be fully or partially exposed to the ER lumen, and thus could act as ‘sensors’ of oxidative stress in the ER by enhanced binding of Rtn1/2 to Atg8a after DTT treatment. To test this notion, we replaced the four cysteines in Rtn2 with alanines and assayed for altered interactions between this HA-Rtn2(CA) mutant and GFP-Atg8a in protoplasts. However, HA-Rtn2 and HA-Rtn2(CA) bound Atg8 at similar levels with or without DTT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Likewise, we found that lipidation of Atg8a was not required for its increased binding to HA-Rtn2 upon DTT treatment, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays between HA-Rtn2 and GFP-Atg8a(G150A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B was shown to interact with the ER-resident transmembrane chaperone calnexin, which is part of the ER protein folding machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forrester et al., 2019</xref>). This interaction occurs through the transmembrane region of FAM134B and is needed for disposing misfolded proteins such as procollagen <italic>via</italic> ER-phagy. However, FAM134B binding to calnexin was reported to remain unchanged during misfolded protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forrester et al., 2019</xref>). To test whether Rtn2 similarly interacts with the maize ER protein folding machinery as a potential sensing mechanism for recruiting Atg8a during ER stress conditions, we tested for the ability of Rtn2 to bind calnexin and two ER-lumen soluble proteins involved in protein folding, Bip and Protein disulfide isomerase (Pdi). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, HA-Rtn2 not only co-immunoprecipitated all three ER proteins, but this binding was increased upon DTT treatment. While the change in the abundance of Bip, calnexin, and Pdi between DTT-treated and untreated protoplasts made it difficult to estimate changes in their binding affinity for Rtn2, their increased abundance under ER stress nevertheless resulted in a higher association. Other ER-localized proteins, such as the ER calcium channel ACA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper et al., 1998</xref>) or the ER lumen marker CFP-KDEL, failed to co-immunoprecipitate with HA-Rtn2 in either DTT-treated or untreated Arabidopsis protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the association of Rtn2 and the ER chaperones is specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Characterization of <italic>rtn1</italic> and <italic>rtn2</italic> mutants in maize</title><p>To examine the functions of Rtn1 and Rtn2 in maize, we identified a collection of mutants generated by <italic>UniformMu</italic> transposition that were predicted to impact expression of both genes.

Interestingly, the <italic>atg12-2</italic> mutant also showed a 2-fold increase in the accumulation of <italic>Bip2</italic> transcripts in aleurone but not in starchy endosperm cells, though the combination of both <italic>atg12-2</italic> and <italic>rtn2-2</italic> mutations did not lead to a further increase in <italic>Bip2</italic> transcript levels in aleurone cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Given their high expression levels in both the maize starchy endosperm and aleurone tissues, we hypothesized they could strongly influence ER functions, especially during the accumulation of lipid droplets and protein bodies. In this study, we showed that these two reticulon proteins help promote ER homeostasis in the aleurone cells of the maize endosperm. We also found that Rtn1 and Rtn2 act as ER-phagy receptors in plant cells under ER stress by binding to Atg8 <italic>via</italic> one or a combination of four AIMs, one at the C-terminal region, one at the cytoplasmic loop, and two within the predicted transmembrane regions close to the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane. Why Rtn1/2 harbor multiple AIMs is unclear but their presence could help these reticulons maintain contact with Atg8-decorated autophagic membranes as the ER pinches off in small fragments during ER-phagy.</p><p>At least for Rtn2, ER stress increases its association with Atg8a, likely through increased affinity of the C-terminal AIM1 with the LDS binding pocket in Atg8. Our studies on <italic>rtn2</italic> mutants revealed that Rtn2 is not essential for maize growth and development, but critical for ameliorating ER stress in the aleurone cells, likely through their role(s) in ER-phagy. Loss of Rtn2 instead leads to elevated bulk autophagy likely as a compensatory mechanism when ER-phagy is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Involvement of reticulons in ER-phagy</title><p>ER-phagy is essential for cell survival, especially under conditions that trigger ER stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pérez-Martín et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ogata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>). In animals, six different ER-resident proteins (ATL3, CCPG1, FAM134B, RTN3L, SEC62, and TEX264) with different localization and expression patterns are known to act as ER-phagy receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grumati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chino et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with a complex spatial and temporal cargo selection pattern. In response to starvation, RTN3L and ATL3 mediate constitutive clearance of ER tubules, whereas FAM134B removes ER sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grumati et al., 2017</xref>). CCPG1 localizes to perinuclear and cortical ER, is up-regulated in response to ER stress, and protects against ER lumenal protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith et al., 2018</xref>), while SEC62 is part of the translocon complex and regulates ER turnover after transient ER stress as a mechanism to adjust ER volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>). TEX264 is required for ER-phagy under both basal and starvation conditions and is expressed more ubiquitously than the other mammalian ER-phagy receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>All six mammalian ER-phagy receptors are tethered to the ER membrane through one or more transmembrane regions. It has been hypothesized that the known ER-phagy receptors with one or two transmembrane domains (<italic>e.g</italic>. CCPG1, SEC62, and TEX264) act early as linkers connecting the ER with autophagic membranes, whereas the RHD-containing receptors with multiple transmembrane segments participate at later stages in re-modeling and/or fragmenting ER domains for their sequestration into autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilkinson, 2020</xref>). In fact, some reticulons work together with TEX264, which has been postulated to act as a master receptor for ER-phagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). However, no obvious TEX264 homologues can be found outside vertebrates, suggesting that the regulation and mechanistic action of ER-phagy receptors differ significantly among taxa.</p><p>The six mammalian ER-phagy receptors contain one (CCPG1, FAM134B, and SEC62), two (ATL3), or six (RTN3L) AIMs/LIRs or GIMs that associate with Atg8/LC3 or the Atg8-type protein GABARAP, respectively. In all these cases, the AIM/LIR/GIM sequences are located within the cytoplasmic regions of the receptors, with the six AIMs of RTN3L found near the N-terminus and the single AIM of FAM134B within the C-terminal tail. We identified four functional AIMs in maize Rtn1/2, one located within the C-terminal tail similar to FAM134B, one in the cytoplasmic loop, and two additional AIMs in transmembrane regions. The presence of two functional AIMs at the transmembrane segments is puzzling. However, these AIMs are predicted to be near the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane and therefore, could be partially accessible to Atg8 for binding. In addition, reticulon proteins are known to induce membrane stretching, which could increase the accessibility of transmembrane domains to cytosolic proteins. A recent study of FAM134B shows that the two wedge-shaped transmembrane helical hairpins of the RHD domain tend to create membrane asymmetry by stretching the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhaskara et al., 2019</xref>). This membrane deformation is enhanced by the oligomerization of FAM134B mediated by interactions through the transmembrane domains. One could envision that membrane stretching on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane mediated by the RHD domain induces a change in the packing of phospholipids around the transmembrane domains, increasing access of Atg8 to the transmembrane AIMs in Rtn2 as the ER membranes become increasingly curved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>TEX264 has been shown to concentrate in three-way ER junctions prior to its incorporation into autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that phagophore loading during ER-phagy happens at specific subdomains of the ER. Maize Rtn2 also showed a preferential localization within three-way tubular ER junctions, but it did not change its localization upon induction of ER stress by DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Instead, Rtn2 binds more Atg8 under ER stress, a property that has not been reported for any other known ER-phagy receptor. The increased binding of Rtn2 to Atg8a occurred within 3 hr of DTT treatment and required the C-terminal AIM of Rtn2. How exactly ER stress translates into increased binding of Rtn2 to Atg8 is presently unknown, but it does not seem to involve either the lipidation of Atg8 or the cysteine residues of Rtn2 located close to the lumenal face of the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Recently, calnexin was shown to act as a co-receptor with FAM134B to mediate the degradation of procollagen through ER-phagy, with calnexin binding misfolded procollagen polypeptides through its ER luminal domain and FAM134B through its transmembrane domain. FAM134B then binds Atg8/LC3 to sequester ER domains containing FAM134B, calnexin, and misfolded procollagen into autophagosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forrester et al., 2019</xref>). However, the binding between FAM134B and calnexin was found to be stable and did not change with increasing concentrations of misfolded procollagen. We found here that maize Rtn2 binds calnexin and two additional proteins involved in protein folding, Bip and Pdi. As the three proteins became more abundant during DTT treatment, they also increased their association with Rtn2. A possible scenario is that the increasing number of calnexin, Bip, and/or Pdi molecules associated with Rtn2 under ER stress triggers either a conformational change or a post-translational modification within the C-terminal domain of Rtn2 to increase the accessibility and/or affinity of its AIM1 for Atg8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We found that over-expression of Rtn2 in protoplasts altered ER morphology and reduced diffusion of an ER lumen marker, consistent with the formation of very narrow tubular constrictions like those generated by the over-expression of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RTNLB13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tolley et al., 2008</xref>). However, unlike mammalian FAM134B and yeast Atg40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>), the overexpression of plant Rtn proteins does not seem to mediate ER fragmentation, which is needed to deliver ER domains into autophagosomes. The mechanism by which ER domains are fragmented during autophagy is still unclear, but a recent study showed that human atlastin 2 (ATL2), a GTPase that mediates homotypic fusion of the ER, is required for FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy and ER fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liang et al., 2018</xref>).

Whether these are required for ER-phagy is currently unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Reticulons help regulate ER stress</title><p>The up-regulation of ER stress-responsive chaperones in aleurone cells of maize <italic>rtn2</italic> mutants suggests that Rtn2 helps repress ER stress in these cells. This response was unexpected considering that, at least in human kidney cells, RTN proteins are needed to trigger ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). For example, RTN1A over-expression is sufficient to induce ER stress and apoptosis in renal cells, whereas reduced expression of RTN1A attenuates ER stress induced by tunicamycin, albumin, and hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). RTN1A promotes ER stress through its interactions with the ER stress sensor PERK. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of RTN1A interact with PERK and are needed for ER stress promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). However, the positive role of RTN1A in ER stress might not extend to the rest of the RTN family. RTN1A is one of the three isoforms of mammalian RTN1 and contains an N-terminal domain of over 550 amino acids. RNT1C, another isoform of RTN1, has short N- and C-terminal domains similar to maize Rtn1 and Rtn2, and does not participate in ER-stress induction in kidney cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the long N-terminal extension of RTN1A is critical for engaging PERK1 and inducing ER stress. The specialized role of RTN proteins with long N-terminal extensions has also been documented in plants. For example, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RTNLB20 does not modify ER morphology when over-expressed, but its N-terminal extension is involved in sterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kriechbaumer et al., 2018</xref>). Whether the other plant Rtn proteins with long N-terminal extensions (<italic>e.g.</italic> maize Rtn22 and Rtn23) play similar roles to RTN1A in promoting ER stress remains to be determined. However, given that PERK-like proteins have not been identified in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ruberti et al., 2015</xref>), it remains possible that plant Rtn proteins do not participate in ER stress induction.</p><p>It is notable that the up-regulation of ER stress genes such as <italic>Bip2</italic>, and the consequent increase in autophagic flux in <italic>rtn2</italic> mutants are more pronounced in aleurone cells than in the starchy endosperm. The starchy endosperm can experience ER stress, and, in fact, the plant UPR was first described in maize endosperm cells expressing mutant storage proteins that cause abnormal protein body assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marocco et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fontes et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boston et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, the stronger up-regulation of the ER stress responsive gene <italic>Bip2</italic> in <italic>rtn2</italic> aleurone cells might be connected to a more critical requirement for Rtn1/2 during ER homeostasis in aleurone versus starchy endosperm cells, as aleurone cells actively export ER protein accretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reyes et al., 2011</xref>) and re-model their ER to accommodate lipid droplets. Although we cannot determine at this time whether ER-stress in <italic>rtn2</italic> mutant aleurone cells is triggered by deficient ER-phagy or by an autophagy-independent Rtn2 function, it is remarkable that <italic>Bip2</italic> up-regulation in aleurone cells followed a very similar pattern in <italic>rtn2</italic>, <italic>atg12</italic>, and <italic>rtn2 atg12</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that specific requirements for efficient ER-phagy in aleurone cells could indeed be the common ER stress trigger in both <italic>rtn2</italic> and <italic>atg12</italic> mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A Key Resource Table can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Zea mays</italic> lines W22, Mu-08559 (<italic>rtn1-1</italic>), Mu-02254 (<italic>rtn2-1</italic>), Mu-03723 (<italic>rtn2-2</italic>), and Mu-00381 (<italic>rtn2-3</italic>) were obtained from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center.

for maintaining homeostasis in yeast, plant and mammalian cells. In this work, the authors identified putative homologues of the mammalian RTN3L protein in maize, and used an impressive variety of assays in vitro and in whole plants to probe the cellular role of two plant reticulon proteins (Rtn1 and Rtn2) in ER homeostasis and reticulophagy. The functions and behaviors of the plant proteins were mostly shared with RTN3L in mammals, including interactions with Atg8, however they also identified some unique structural and regulatory features of the interaction. Their analysis of maize mutants revealed that Rtn1 and Rtn2 are required to ameliorate ER stress at a critical point in development. In specialized aleurone cells that coordinate the mobilization of nutrients to the embryo during germination loss of Rtn1/2 alters bulk autophagy. This work, therefore, is exciting from both a basic science and potentially an agronomic viewpoint.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reticulon proteins modulate autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum in maize endosperm&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the past few years, autophagy, and in particular, reticulophagy (ER removal and degration) has emerged as critical mechanism for maintaining homeostasis in yeast, plant and mammalian cells. Several reticulophagy receptors in mammals and their mechanisms of action are an area of active interest. After identifying putative homologues of the mammalian RTN3L protein in Maize, the authors use a number of biochemical and protoplast assays to probe the cellular role of two plant reticulon proteins in ER homeostasis and reticulophagy. Analysis of Maize mutants suggests a role in preventing ER stress in the seed endosperm.</p><p>Overall, reviewers found the topic important from a basic science and potentially an agronomic viewpoint. The findings here were mostly similar to those from studies of RTN3L in mammals, which isn't to say that the findings here aren't interesting or important. Two expert reviewers did a very thorough analysis of the text and figures and recommend a number of critical control experiments to solidify the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The use of heterologous systems to test the Rtn1 and Rtn2 proteins was deemed acceptable, but necessitates additional controls. Details on such controls are described nicely in reviewer 2, major comment 1.</p><p>2) More evidence (by additional or improved IPs) of the interactions and stoichiometry of the complex is needed.</p><p>3) It needs to be clarified how AIM motifs buried in the intramembrane regions of the rtn1/2 proteins could be functional for binding.</p><p>4) The quality of the figures (resolution) in the main text and the supplemental must be improved. We recognize some of the compression during journal file production exacerbated this issue, but there were several concerns about blots in the supplemental and low resolution and/or low magnification images of vacuoles and Atg8a puncta.</p><p>5) The overall flow of the Introduction could be improved. Reviewer 3 has some suggestions for this; it is not necessary to format in precisely the way they suggestion, but please take note of the reasoning behind their suggestions. In addition, sticking to conventional nomenclature will make this work more easily integrated and evaluated within the field.</p><p>6) In your revision, please include a response to the experiments described in the major comments from the reviewers-if a control cannot or was not done, please explain why and also consider rewording conclusions if the experiment cannot be done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) I think it is totally fine to use heterologous systems. However they may have some limitations that need to be considered. As the authors express maize RTNs in Arabidopsis and RTNs are well known to form higher order structures, do maize RTNs also interact with Arabidopsis RTNs? If they do, it would be difficult to interpret protoplast coIP assays and flux assays, as Arabidopsis RTNs are also likely to function as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, the results in Figure 3K suggest, the AIM mutant is still recruited to the autophagosomes. Is this due to the interaction with the Arabidopsis RTNs?</p><p>2) Why did the authors focus on RTN1 and RTN2? Is there any other reason than higher expression in the seeds? In RTN3L, Dikic and colleagues clearly showed the extended region contained the multiple AIMs, explaining why this specific RTN was mediating reticulophagy. Is this the case of RTN1 and RTN2? Are the AIMs specific to these two isoforms? If yes, the manuscript would really benefit from using another RTN as a negative control.</p><p>3) As the authors also explain in the text, all the AIMs in the known ER-phagy receptors are in exposed regions, not buried in transmembrane domains. Although the authors tried to come up with an explanation like stretching exposing these AIMs, I think they still need to strengthen this part. I don't know how DTT treatments could stretch the membranes. As in their heterologous systems, they overexpress their proteins; another possible explanation could be misfolded proteins, rather than membrane stretching. Have the authors tested the stability of the AIM mutants? In Figure 2F, the protein levels in the input are not the same. Is this due to changes in protein folding and/or stability?</p><p>4) Figure 2B, where the authors showed the interaction with the ATG8A using HA pull downs, should be supported with reverse pull downs. This way, we will be able to know if ATG8 is interacting with RTN monomers or oligomers. Figure 2F would also benefit from reverse IP. These reverse IPs would also be very useful in the DTT treated coIP assays.</p><p>5) Also in Figure 2F, could the authors please check if the input and IP HA blots are switched? The input bands look stronger than the IPed ones and compared to Figure 2B, the oligomer bands are much weaker.</p><p>6) Figure 3K: the induction with DTT seems very minor without ConA. With ConA, colocalization is very difficult as particles inside of the vacuoles move so fast. The authors could perform time course experiments to test if extending the DTT treatment would increase colocalization.</p><p>7) The experiments where the authors tested if RTNs also need a coreceptor desperately need a negative control. BiPs, PDIs are well known to be sticky proteins that always interact with protein of interest. As their concentration will increase upon DTT treatment, the intensity of the bands in the IPs could also interact. The authors should use an ER-membrane protein that does not contain AIMs as a negative control in these experiments.</p><p>8) Also the western blots in the supplementary figures look highly modified. Different lanes have different backgrounds and in some cases different bands look identical, at least in the version that we could analyze (Figure 2—figure supplement 1: In the GFP input, lanes 4 and 5 seems identical. Figure 4—figure supplement 1 GFP input 7 and 8th lanes are identical). Could the authors please clarify this? I would strongly suggest that the authors add the full blots as a supplementary figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) The data presented in this study showed the identification of Rtn proteins involved in ER-phagy in maize. it was published the AtSEC62 ER-phagy receptor is the first case characterized in plants. I suggest including this example and then reorganize the Introduction because is too extended and not clear. Also the concept of reticulophagy receptors needs to be more clearly and broadly defined in the Introduction as this is the major focus of this study.</p><p>2) It is important to clarify How AIM motifs within intramembrane regions of the RHD domain in Rtns proteins could be functional. How this motif is available to interact with Atg8a? Are the constructs localized in the ER membranes? Even though it was mentioned in the text and tested by co-immunoprecipitation experiments is not enough evidence to a successful insertion into the ER membranes. This is an important point to consider and clarify and also how these proteins are folded if they were mutated for alanine residues and especially in these hydrophobic regions.</p><p>3) The authors mainly tested DTT as an unfolding protein response trigger. Generally, in this kind of studies, will be important to include other stressors as thapsigargin due to the important role of ER during calcium homeostasis that will be nicely correlated with the increased interaction with the chaperones under stress. These chaperones are mainly calcium sensitive. For other hand, could be important and interesting to include the stress abiotic as a model for ER stress induction. Cereal crops are usually exposed to abiotic stress that cannot be avoided. Hence interesting mechanisms of tolerance and adaptability could be evidenced when ER-phagy will be involved. Additionally, the identification of the Rtn proteins was in cereal cells, could be possible that the function of these proteins change between the different tissues? i.e. mesophyll cells protoplasts versus aleurone or endosperm cells.</p><p>4) The authors are advised to follow the nomenclature of published receptors that mediate ER remodelling. The process of reticulophagy was described some 10 years ago as a response of ER to the stress. The work of Walter's lab coined the nomenclature ER-phagy by describing the details of genetic and molecular characterization of this process. Since 2015 there are 8 distinct receptors that can mediate ER-phagy published including those from the yeast, plants and mammalian systems.

However they may have some limitations that need to be considered. As the authors express maize RTNs in Arabidopsis and RTNs are well known to form higher order structures, do maize RTNs also interact with Arabidopsis RTNs? If they do, it would be difficult to interpret protoplast coIP assays and flux assays, as Arabidopsis RTNs are also likely to function as ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, the results in Figure 3K suggest, the AIM mutant is still recruited to the autophagosomes. Is this due to the interaction with the Arabidopsis RTNs?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, most likely the Arabidopsis and maize Rtn proteins have redundant functions and are able to interact with each other. This is not only a potential problem when using Arabidopsis protoplasts in a heterologous system but also when using maize cells. There are 23 Rtn proteins in maize and 21 in Arabidopsis; with the exception of maize Rtn1 and Rtn2, we currently do not know how many other Rtn proteins could act as ER-phagy receptors during ER stress.

In addition, the fact that these proteins show reduced interaction with Atg8 in a yeast-two hybrid assay further support the notion that these domains are functional AIMs. We have made changes in the text to make the reader aware of this potential caveat in our protoplast assays (subsection “Rtn1 and Rtn2 as autophagic receptors for ER turnover during ER stress”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why did the authors focus on RTN1 and RTN2? Is there any other reason than higher expression in the seeds? In RTN3L, Dikic and colleagues clearly showed the extended region contained the multiple AIMs, explaining why this specific RTN was mediating reticulophagy. Is this the case of RTN1 and RTN2? Are the AIMs specific to these two isoforms? If yes, the manuscript would really benefit from using another RTN as a negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on Rtn1 and Rtn2 because of their relatively high expression in endosperm. Different from RTN3L, Rtn1 and Rtn2 do not have an extended N-terminal region (see first paragraph of Results). This is the case for the products of the three splicing versions of the <italic>Rtn1</italic> transcript and the predicted product of the only known transcript of <italic>Rtn2</italic>. Maize Rtn3 to Rtn18 have also short N- and C-terminal domains. All these 18 Rtn proteins plus the additional five Rtn proteins with extended N- or C-terminal domains in maize have predicted AIM domains, some on the same regions as Rtn1 and 2, some in other regions. However, the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of AIM domains is highly unreliable and needs to be confirmed by Atg8-binding assays. Therefore, we did not have any reliable way to predict which Rtn protein could be used as a meaningful negative control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As the authors also explain in the text, all the AIMs in the known ER-phagy receptors are in exposed regions, not buried in transmembrane domains. Although the authors tried to come up with an explanation like stretching exposing these AIMs, I think they still need to strengthen this part. I don't know how DTT treatments could stretch the membranes. As in their heterologous systems, they overexpress their proteins; another possible explanation could be misfolded proteins, rather than membrane stretching. Have the authors tested the stability of the AIM mutants? In Figure 2F, the protein levels in the input are not the same. Is this due to changes in protein folding and/or stability?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained paragraph three of subsection “Involvement of reticulons in ER-phagy”, the RHD domains of reticulon proteins can induce membrane curvature by creating membrane asymmetry through the stretching of the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER (Bhaskara et al., 2019). This membrane deformation effect is enhanced by oligomerization mediated by interactions through the transmembrane domains. It is possible that once the RHD domains induce stretching on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane, Atg8 gains increased access to the transmembrane AIMs in Rtn2 as the ER membranes become increasingly curved.</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s question, we have tested the stability of the mutant and wild type Rtn2 proteins by treating protoplasts with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis and chasing protein content over time. These results are now included in Figure 2H. Based on this assay, we found that HA-Rtn2(mAIM1,2,5,6) seemed to be more stable than HA-Rtn2 after 180 min of CHX treatment. However, when the same CHX chase assay was done in Arabidopsis <italic>atg7</italic> mutant protoplasts, which are unable to perform macroautophagy, both HA-Rtn2 and HARtn2(mAIM1,2,5,6) showed similar stability. These new results indicate that a) the mutations AIM domains located at transmembrane domains do not render Rtn2 unstable; b) the identified AIM domains are required for the autophagic degradation of Rtn2 during cycloheximide treatment. We also performed a colocalization analysis between the three Rtn2 proteins fused to mCherry with the ER lumenal marker CFP-ER (now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C of the revised manuscript). We found no differences in the Pearson’s colocalization coefficients for the three m-Cherry fusions co-expressed with similar amounts of CFP-KDEL. Based on the fact that wild type and AIM-mutated Rtn2 proteins a) show similar or even higher stability (Figure 2H); b) show similar ER localization (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C); c) are equally able to interact with Rtn1 at the ER (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), we assume that the AIM-mutated proteins are properly folded and inserted in the ER, indicating that the AIM domains at the transmembrane domains are indeed important for the interaction with Atg8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2B, where the authors showed the interaction with the ATG8A using HA pull downs, should be supported with reverse pull downs. This way, we will be able to know if ATG8 is interacting with RTN monomers or oligomers. Figure 2F would also benefit from reverse IP. These reverse IPs would also be very useful in the DTT treated coIP assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the reciprocal IP requested by the reviewer (Figure 4—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). We co-expressed Rtn2-HA and GFP-Atg8a with or without DTT treatment and used anti-GFP antibodies for the IP. The new results confirm the interaction between Rtn2 and Atg8 shown by the co-immunoprecipitations with anti-HA antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Also in Figure 2F, could the authors please check if the input and IP HA blots are switched? The input bands look stronger than the IPed ones and compared to Figure 2B, the oligomer bands are much weaker.</p></disp-quote><p>We have double-checked and there was no inadvertent switching of blots in this experiment. The reviewer raises an interesting point regarding the intensity and appearance of the oligomeric bands between different experiments (sometimes more apparent than others, sometimes more a single band and other times more of a smear); at this time, we do not know the reasons behind this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3K: the induction with DTT seems very minor without ConA. With ConA, colocalization is very difficult as particles inside of the vacuoles move so fast. The authors could perform time course experiments to test if extending the DTT treatment would increase colocalization.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3K shows the percentage of protoplasts with autophagic bodies inside the vacuole that contain both mCherry (from Rtn2 proteins fused to mCherry) and GFP (from GFP-Atg8) signals. When we treat protoplasts with DTT but no ConA, we cannot detect autophagic bodies because they are quickly degraded inside the vacuole. Treatment with ConA stabilizes autophagic bodies by decreasing/blocking vacuolar degradation and therefore, it facilitates their visualization. With fast scanning settings, we had no problem capture the autophagic bodies inside the vacuoles. The main purpose of Figure 3K is to show that under similar ER stress conditions (DTT-treatment) and when vacuolar degradation is blocked (ConA treatment), there is a decrease in the percentage of protoplasts with GFP-Atg8-positive autophagic bodies that contained AIM-mutated Rtn2-mCherry proteins compared to those that contain wild type Rtn2 fused to mCherry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The experiments where the authors tested if RTNs also need a coreceptor desperately need a negative control. BiPs, PDIs are well known to be sticky proteins that always interact with protein of interest. As their concentration will increase upon DTT treatment, the intensity of the bands in the IPs could also interact. The authors should use an ER-membrane protein that does not contain AIMs as a negative control in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now repeated the co-immunoprecipitation of HA-Rtn2 in Arabidopsis protoplasts and detected the presence of two ER-resident proteins, the calcium channel ACA2 (ER membrane) and CFP-KDEL (ER lumen). Although both proteins (ACA2 and CFP-KDEL) were readily detected in the input fraction, we were unable to detect them in the co-immunoprecipitate (even after long exposures), suggesting that the association between HA-Rtn2 and the ER chaperones is indeed specific. This new co-immunoprecipitation is now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Also the western blots in the supplementary figures look highly modified. Different lanes have different backgrounds and in some cases different bands look identical, at least in the version that we could analyze (Figure 2—figure supplement 1: In the GFP input, lanes 4 and 5 seems identical. Figure 4—figure supplement 1 GFP input 7 and 8th lanes are identical). Could the authors please clarify this? I would strongly suggest that the authors add the full blots as a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken extreme care to provide the best possible quality western blots since they are critical for quantification. Close inspection of the high-resolution images will show that the bands indicated by the reviewer may be similar but not all identical. The original images containing the full western blots have been provided to the journal office for their independent scrutiny.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The data presented in this study showed the identification of Rtn proteins involved in ER-phagy in maize. It was published the AtSEC62 ER-phagy receptor is the first case characterized in plants. I suggest including this example and then reorganize the Introduction because is too extended and not clear. Also the concept of reticulophagy receptors needs to be more clearly and broadly defined in the Introduction as this is the major focus of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the Introduction and incorporated the reference about AtSEC62 as an ERphagy receptor in plants. We have also changed in the entire manuscript the word “reticulophagy” with “ER-phagy”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is important to clarify How AIM motifs within intramembrane regions of the RHD domain in Rtns proteins could be functional. How this motif is available to interact with Atg8a? Are the constructs localized in the ER membranes? Even though it was mentioned in the text and tested by co-immunoprecipitation experiments is not enough evidence to a successful insertion into the ER membranes. This is an important point to consider and clarify and also how these proteins are folded if they were mutated for alanine residues and specially in these hydrophobic regions.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these concerns, we have included in the revised manuscript two new assays:</p><p>1) We tested the stability of the mutant and wild type Rtn2 proteins by treating protoplasts with cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis and detecting protein content by western blotting over time.

In the text, we explain that these AIM domains are predicted to be in the transmembrane regions but in close proximity to the ER cytoplasmic face. We speculate that in highly curved ER domains, the stretching of the outer leaflet of the ER membrane could facilitate the exposure of these AIM domains to Atg8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors mainly tested DTT as an unfolding protein response trigger. Generally, in this kind of studies, will be important to include other stressors as thapsigargin due to the important role of ER during calcium homeostasis that will be nicely correlated with the increased interaction with the chaperones under stress. These chaperones are mainly calcium sensitive. For other hand, could be important and interesting to include the stress abiotic as a model for ER stress induction. Cereal crops are usually exposed to abiotic stress that cannot be avoided. Hence interesting mechanisms of tolerance and adaptability could be evidenced when ER-phagy will be involved. Additionally, the identification of the Rtn proteins was in cereal cells, could be possible that the function of these proteins change between the different tissues? i.e. mesophyll cells protoplasts versus aleurone or endosperm cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In the plants, chemical-induced ER stress is usually triggered by TM or DTT. We have used both drugs in our manuscript and found similar results (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D and E). Thapsigargin is a specific inhibitor of most animal SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase-type) Ca<sup>2+</sup>pumps. Whereas thapsigargin has been reported to affect root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (Urbina et al. 2006, Biol Res 289-296), it is unclear what its specific molecular targets are in plants and where they localize. For example, thapsigargin has been reported to inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity in Golgi vesicles isolated from pea epicotyls (Ordenes et al., 2002, Plant Physiol 129: 1820-1828) and to inhibit the AtHMA1 Calcium/heavy metal pump that localizes to the chloroplast envelope (Moreno et al. 2008, J. Biol Chem 283:9633). Based on the limited current knowledge of thapsigargin action in plant cells, we consider that in our study, it is best to trigger ER stress with TM or DTT. We agree with the reviewer that studying the function of Rtn1 and Rtn2 in multiple tissues and different abiotic stress conditions is very relevant and we plan to follow these lines of research in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors are advised to follow the nomenclature of published receptors that mediate ER remodelling. The process of reticulophagy was described some 10 years ago as a response of ER to the stress.

Since 2015 there are 8 distinct receptors that can mediate ER-phagy published including those from the yeast, plants and mammalian systems.

The presence of two functional AIMs at the transmembrane segments of Rtn1/2 is puzzling. However, these AIMs are predicted to be near the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane and therefore, could be partially accessible to Atg8 for binding. In addition, reticulon proteins are known to induce membrane stretching, which could increase the accessibility of transmembrane domains to cytosolic proteins. A recent study of FAM134B shows that the two wedge-shaped transmembrane helical hairpins of the RHD domain tend to create membrane asymmetry by stretching the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER (Bhaskara et al., 2019). This membrane deformation is enhanced by the oligomerization of FAM134B mediated by interactions through the transmembrane domains. One could envision that membrane stretching on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane mediated by the RHD domain induces a change in the packing of phospholipids around the transmembrane domains, increasing access of Atg8 to the transmembrane AIMs in Rtn1/2 as the ER membranes become increasingly curved (Figure 7C).”</p><p>We also add a sentence closing the first paragraph of the Discussion to highlight the potential relevance of the multiple AIM domains in Rtn1/2.</p><p>“Why Rtn1/2 harbor multiple AIMs is unclear but their presence could help these reticulons maintain contact with Atg8-decorated autophagic membranes as the ER pinches off in small fragments during ER-phagy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It was suggested that in Figure 1, because Maize Rtn1 and Rtn2 are reticulon proteins.

The manuscript says:</p><p>“Consistent with most aspects of autophagy being normal in the rtn2 mutant lines, we failed to see increases in the abundance of Atg8 and the autophagy receptor Nbr1 in either aleurone or starchy endosperm cells from the rtn2-1, rtn2-2, and rtn2-3 plants, while both proteins hyper-accumulated in endosperm samples from the atg12-2 and rtn2-2 atg12-2 plants (Figure 5K).”</p><p>Therefore, we do not claim that the increase in Atg8 abundance in the maize <italic>atg12</italic> mutant is a consequence of increased autophagy but to impaired autophagy as demonstrated previously by our groups (Li et al., 2015); the <italic>rtn2</italic> mutants do not show abnormal accumulation of endogenous Atg8 compared to controls.</p><p>Figure 6J shows a western blots of cleaved YFP and full length YFP-Atg8 expressed in W22 (control), <italic>rtn2, atg12</italic> and <italic>rtn2 atg12</italic> endosperm samples. Figure 6K is the quantification of the YFP to YFP-Atg8 band intensities based on three western blots. Here we see increased relative abundance of cleaved YFP (derived from YFP-Atg8 delivered to vacuoles) in relationship to full length YFP-Atg8 (in the cytoplasm) in the <italic>rtn2</italic> mutant aleurone cells, which means that a larger proportion of the YFP-Atg8 pool is sent to the vacuole via autophagy in <italic>rtn2</italic> than in W22 aleurone cells. The cleaved YFP fragment is only seen in cells that are able to perform autophagy and, as expected, is absent in <italic>atg12</italic> and the <italic>atg12 rtn2</italic> mutant samples (Figure 6K).</p><p>This ratiometric assay is widely used in animal cells, plants and yeast and it was developed in the first place to be able to quantify autophagic flux independently of the amount of Atg8 in tissues/cell. In addition, the YFP-Atg8 reporter is not driven by its endogenous promoter but by the maize UB10 promoter. We have not observed changes in the abundance of this reporter in the different genotypes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
