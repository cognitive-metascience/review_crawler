After HPV binding to cell surface receptors, a cascade of molecular interactions mediates the infectious cellular internalization of virus particles. Aside from the virus itself, important molecular players involved in virus entry include the tetraspanin CD151 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). To date, it is unknown how these components are coordinated in space and time. Here, we studied plasma membrane dynamics of CD151 and EGFR and the HPV16 capsid during the early phase of infection. We find that the proteinase ADAM17 activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway by the shedding of growth factors which triggers the formation of an endocytic entry platform. Infectious endocytic entry platforms carrying virus particles consist of two-fold larger CD151 domains containing the EGFR. Our finding clearly dissects initial virus binding from ADAM17-dependent assembly of a HPV/CD151/EGFR entry platform.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microdomains</kwd><kwd>entry receptor complex</kwd><kwd>oncogenic Papillomavirus</kwd><kwd>growth factors</kwd><kwd>ADAM17</kwd><kwd>tetraspanin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikuličić</surname><given-names>Snježana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC877 (A4)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reiss</surname><given-names>Karina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LA 1272/8-1, FL 696/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Thorsten</given-names></name><name><surname>Florin</surname><given-names>Luise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ADAM17 is a key player in the non-canonical endocytosis pathway that is used by oncogenic papillomaviruses as it allows virus/receptor platform assembly by activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral infections by human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause benign warts and malignant tumors. The small, non-enveloped virus is constituted of a circular DNA genome surrounded by a capsid mainly built of the L1 protein. More than 240 papillomavirus types have been characterized in diverse hosts, including mammals, birds and reptiles. For instance, the oncogenic HPV types 16, 18, and 31 are responsible for severe human cancers, including cervical cancer and anogenital, head and neck tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doorbar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>HPV infections require a micro-wound enabling virion binding to mitotically active basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doorbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozbun, 2019</xref>). However, virus internalization is asynchronous and slow, with a halftime of several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sapp and Bienkowska-Haba, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schelhaas et al., 2012</xref>). The long halftime points toward a complex cascade of events at the cell membrane prior to virus entry into host cells. It is assumed that the sequence is initiated upon virus binding to a primary receptor, from which the virus is released in a modified form, followed by re-binding to a secondary receptor complex, which is then endocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozbun, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikuličić and Florin, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To date, the requirements for virus association with the secondary entry receptor and the composition of the receptor complex are not well understood. One of its main components is the tetraspanin CD151. It localizes to the cell surface, enriched in domains that associate with HPV16 particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spoden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheffer et al., 2013</xref>). CD151 is essential for viral endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spoden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spoden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scheffer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fast et al., 2018</xref>) and co-internalizes with the virus via a clathrin-, caveolin-, and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spoden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spoden et al., 2013</xref>). Integrin complexes (α6β1/β4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McMillan et al., 1999</xref>), the annexin A2 heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woodham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dziduszko and Ozbun, 2013</xref>), the cytoskeletal adaptor obscurin-like one protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wüstenhagen et al., 2016</xref>), and the tetraspanin CD63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spoden et al., 2008</xref>) are further components of the entry receptor complex. In addition, growth factor receptors (GFR), in particular the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were proposed as entry receptors for HPV16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>) and multiple other viruses such as vaccinia, cytomegalo, herpes simplex, influenza, and hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schäfer et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, signal transduction like the activation of EGFR and ERK signaling is a prerequisite for HPV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schelhaas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The activation of signaling pathways indicates that only cells in a defined activation state are susceptible for infection. What type of molecules may trigger that state? Is there a link between signaling and the entry complex?</p><p>Recent data indicate that metalloproteases are involved early in HPV16 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>). From the many known metalloproteases, members of &quot;A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease&quot; (ADAMs) family regulate multiple cell signaling pathways by the release of bioactive proteins like GFR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gooz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>). Thereby, ADAMs may represent a connection between cell signaling and components of the viral entry complex. Here, we set out to study which ADAM family member may play a role and how it may regulate the cascade of the infection pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A strong requirement of ADAM17 for the infection with oncogenic HPV pseudoviruses</title><p>Recently, it was suggested that a metalloprotease mediates early steps in HPV16 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, the broad-spectrum inhibitors did not differentiate between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ADAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parvathy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustafi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amour et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Meijer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasmussen and McCann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2011</xref>). From the ADAM family, ADAM10 and ADAM17 are the most likely candidates as they are highly expressed in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maretzky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sommer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirayama et al., 2017</xref>) and involved in the shedding of numerous substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiss and Saftig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Infecting HaCaT keratinocytes with HPV16 pseudovirions (PsVs), we applied the broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-0, the preferential ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X (GI) and the mixed ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor GW280264X (GW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TAPI-0 and GW diminished infection, whereas the ADAM10 inhibitor GI showed no significant effect. This is pointing toward a requirement of ADAMs, in particular of ADAM17 rather than ADAM10. To differentiate between these two ADAMs with a more specific approach, ADAM17 or ADAM10 were depleted by siRNA knockdown. For ADAM10 and ADAM17, respectively, two different siRNAs were employed in three epithelial cell models, including HeLa cells, HaCaT cells, and primary normal human epithelial keratinocytes (NHEK). Under all conditions ADAM17 depletion consistently and strongly decreased infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In contrast, ADAM10 depletion showed no clear effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). ADAM17 was also required for the infection by two other highly oncogenic HPV types, HPV18 and HPV31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Altogether, this indicates that ADAM17 is important for the infection with oncogenic human papillomaviruses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44345.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ADAM17 is required for HPV infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa, (<bold>B</bold>) HaCaT and (<bold>C</bold>) NHEK cells were treated with each one of two specific ADAM17 siRNAs and 48 hr later incubated with PsVs.

Therefore, we asked whether ADAM17 is required for the association of HPV16 with CD151. Prior to testing the role of ADAM17, we characterized the time course of virus colocalization with the entry receptor component CD151. HaCaTs were incubated with PsVs for 15 min, washed, and fixed or incubated up to several hours prior to fixation. Directly after virus incubation (marked as time point 0:00), we found virus particles associated with the cell surface, but they poorly overlapped with CD151-enriched domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). One hour after adding PsVs (corresponds to time point 0:45), there was a moderate increase in CD151-L1 overlap that further increased in the next 2 hr, apparently plateauing after about 5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in line with our previous time course analyses of the CD151-L1 interaction on HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spoden et al., 2008</xref>). This slow association of viral particles with CD151-enriched domains implies the idea of a slowly maturating HPV16 entry platform.</p><p>To learn more about this process, we analyzed the CD151-enriched domains employing nanoscopy as previously done for other tetraspanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Homsi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zuidscherwoude et al., 2015</xref>). Superresolution STED microscopy revealed a defined nanocluster pattern suggesting that larger CD151-enriched domains, as recorded by diffraction-limited microscopy, are in fact closely associated CD151 nanoclusters. The resolved nanocluster pattern enabled us to determine the distance between a bound viral particle to its next nearest CD151 nanocluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The average size of a CD151 cluster is roughly 200 nm (see Figure 4), and an HPV particle has a size of 55 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 1991</xref>). Therefore, distances shorter than 150 nm allow for physical contact between a viral particle and a CD151 nanocluster. Interestingly, we uncovered a large fraction of PsVs in close proximity to CD151 nano-clusters already directly after virus binding. The fraction of such closely associated viral particles strongly increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We cannot exclude that we underestimate the increase of this fraction due to preferential internalization of tight CD151-viral particle associates.

With TIRF microscopy, we studied the dynamics of viral particles and CD151. While viral particles were clearly immobile, CD151 moved fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations are in line with previous reports showing HPV16 PsV confinement on the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schelhaas et al., 2008</xref>) and that CD81 tetraspanin clusters are stable only for a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Homsi et al., 2014</xref>). We cannot exclude that in our CD151 tracking study, in which diffraction limited microscopy did not well resolve individual CD151 nanoclusters, we monitor larger intracellular vesicles. However, if viral particles are stationary and tetraspanins are mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Espenel et al., 2008</xref>), platform maturation presumably involves CD151 nucleation at viral particle binding sites. The increase in CD151 intensity at PsVs binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) illustrates this is a slow process that can take up to several hours.</p><p>Next, we tested whether ADAM17 plays a role in the association of viral particles and CD151-enriched domains in two different epithelial cell lines. 5 hr after initial PsVs contact, we found a significant effect. ADAM17 depletion reduced virus-CD151 overlap by roughly a third in HaCaTs or NHEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). The data reveals ADAM17-dependent spatial proximity between virus and CD151. Still, it is possible that viral particles and CD151 domains, although overlapping in the micrographs and exhibiting distances to each other below 150 nm, do not physically interact with each other. To corroborate spatial proximity with a better resolution, we turned to the Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fredriksson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>). In the PLA bright fluorescent spots form at sites where two different molecular entities are closer than ≈ 40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mendez and Banerjee, 2017</xref>). Hence, in this assay fluorescent spots indicate sites at which viral particles and CD151 domains should indeed be close enough to interact physically. In the PLA, we found that the PLA signal was strongly dependent on ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). Thus, the microscopic analysis and the PLA suggest that ADAM17 mediates close association between HPVs and CD151-enriched domains. This means that ADAM17 either is required for initial virus binding, or it plays a role somewhere between binding and endocytic platform formation, for example for L1 cleavage/priming by ADAM17 or another protease.</p><p>To investigate a role of ADAM17 in virus binding, we employed flow cytometry analysis testing whether ADAM17 depletion diminishes the number of PsVs on the cell surface, which was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, we exclude ADAM17 requirement for initial virus binding to the cell surface. Investigating the activity of ADAM17 (using TGF-α as positive control) and the cleavage pattern of the viral L1 protein (L1 priming), we find that L1 is neither a substrate for ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>) nor is internalization of viral particles efficiently inhibited by ADAM17 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C–D</xref>). Instead, L1 cleavage products substantially decreased in ADAM17-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E and F</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that ADAM17 activity is required for viral particle association with L1-priming proteases such as kallikrein-8 prior to endocytosis and additional proteases in intracellular compartments of the infectious entry pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cerqueira et al., 2015</xref>).

The experimental setup restrains direct cell-to-cell contact, but allows exchange of soluble compounds like viruses and bioactive molecules, for example growth factors (GF), between donor and recipient cells. In this assay, cells releasing substances are called donor cells (donors). They are cultured in inserts above recipient cells (recipients) placed in the same chamber and thus able to receive substances released from donors.</p><p>It has been previously shown that donor cells support infection of recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>). In our assay, control donor or ADAM17-depleted HaCaT cells were incubated with HPV16 PsVs for 1 hr, intensively washed to remove unbound virus, placed above recipient cells, and the next day assayed for infection. As expected, ADAM17 depletion in donor cells strongly diminished their infection, but also halved the infection of non-ADAM17-depleted recipient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This demonstrates that virus particles were released from donor cells and diffused to the recipient cells. However, there are several possible explanations for the lower infection rate of non-ADAM17-depleted recipient cells: recipients have received (i) less virus particles, (ii) the same amount but less infectious particles, or (iii) less bioactive molecules required for signaling pathway activation.</p><p>For clarification, we examined whether the quantity of L1 protein in the supernatant, which is an indicator for released viral particles, is ADAM17-dependent. We found no difference between control and ADAM17-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that the release of virus particles from primary attachment receptors does not require ADAM17, which is in line with our previous finding where the quantity of surface bound virus particles was shown to be ADAM17-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, no difference in released L1 excludes the possibility that recipient cells receive less virus particles.</p><p>Are then virus particles less infectious when released from ADAM17-depleted cells? To test this, the co-culture assay was performed under inverted conditions. Non-treated donor cells were incubated with HPV16 PsVs to ensure the release of identical virus particles for control and ADAM17-depleted recipient cells. In the case that released viral particles require ADAM17 for being infectious, ADAM17 depletion in recipient cells should have no effect on their infection rate. However, we observed the opposite, infection in recipient cells was almost completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, lower panel). Therefore, the involvement of ADAM17 in the release of soluble bioactive compounds, as for example growth factors, which activate specific signaling pathways for infection and can also decorate the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>), might explain these findings. Hence, bioactive molecules are required for viral infection, no matter whether the viral particle is released and re-binds to the cell or not. The hypothesis on the involvement of released growth factors is supported by the observation that the non-ADAM17-depleted donor cells in the inverted assay configuration are significantly less infected when the corresponding recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, upper panel). In contrast to one-directional diffusion of virus particles, bioactive compounds are exchanged in both directions, meaning that the donor cells sense less bioactive compounds when the recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted. However, the effect is small, suggesting that biomolecules rather act locally and do not diffuse over large distances. We further speculate that, although viral particles are released, they relatively fast rebind to cell surface receptors, explaining the large fraction of virus particles binding close to CD151 clusters already after 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ADAM17 triggers virus entry platform formation via the ERK signaling pathway</title><p>What may be the type of released biomolecules or signaling pathway?

Up to now, the mechanisms underlying the formation of the secondary entry receptor complex are unknown.

Because viral particles are almost immobile when attached to the cell body, as intensively investigated and discussed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schelhaas et al., 2008</xref>), we suggest that CD151 is recruited to the virus binding site.

In contrast, bioactive molecules, like growth factors, exchange in both directions.</p><p>The co-culture assay provides a couple of important observations. First, ADAM17 acts after virus primary binding/release, because infection is almost blocked in ADAM17-depleted recipient cells, receiving viral particles from control donor cells. The second observation is that ADAM17-depleted donor cells infect at a lesser extent their respective recipient cells, and in parallel, that control donor cells are less infected when recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted. This mutual influence is explained by an exchange of bioactive molecules between donor and recipient cells in both directions. The association of bioactive molecules with the viral capsid as proposed by the Ozbun group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>) may increase the effect.</p><p>Consistently, additional findings pointed toward an involvement of the EGFR as the receptor that mediates the action of these biomolecules. For example, EGF increases the infection rate of ADAM17-depleted cells, EGF increases the proximity between L1 and CD151 after ADAM17 knockdown, and ADAM17 knockdown diminishes the overlap between L1 and EGFR. However, EGF is not classically generated by the action of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we tested the involvement of additional EGFR ligands generated by ADAM17 ectodomain shedding. We find less AREG and TGF-α in the supernatant of ADAM17-depleted cells, corroborated by a reduction of the infection rate after treatment with AREG and TGF-α neutralizing antibodies. Adding ADAM17 cleavage products such as AREG, TGF-α, and HB-EGF to the supernatant of serum-starved or ADAM17-depleted cells increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and infection. The effect of EGFR, AREG or TGF-α inhibition is much lower than that of the ADAM17 siRNA, therefore, we have to assume that ADAM17 activates not only the EGFR but also the additional GFRs.</p><p>Together, these results provide a link between ADAM17-mediated GF-shedding, activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and HPV16 infection. This hypothesis combines previously reported observations that ADAM17 activity regulates multiple cell signaling pathways by the release of bioactive proteins like EGFR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gooz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Göoz et al., 2006</xref>) and cell signaling plays a role in early events of HPV16 entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schelhaas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Surviladze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abban and Meneses, 2010</xref>). In line with our results, it has been shown by the Ozbun group that HPV16 particles associate with GFs like AREG or HB-EGF forming an infectious complex able to bind to the HPV16 entry receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Surviladze et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the plethora of ADAM17 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gooz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiss and Saftig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 2008</xref>) and the complex crosstalk between signaling pathways, also, ADAM17-dependent shedding of additional membrane-bound precursors and cleavage of integral membrane proteins might be involved in this scenario.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Internalization of the HPV/CD151 complex and L1 cleavage</title><p>CD151 is co-internalized with viral particles during virus endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheffer et al., 2013</xref>), a mechanism supposed to decrease the content of CD151 in the plasma membrane. Accordingly, we observed a reduction of CD151 levels in the plasma membrane only in the presence of PsVs and ADAM17. Furthermore, we observed an ADAM17-dependent cleavage of the L1 protein. It has been described that L1 cleavage occurs by the action of specific proteases on the cell surface and after internalization via the infectious entry pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cerqueira et al., 2015</xref>). However, our findings suggest that ADAM17 has no direct effect on extra- or intracellular processing of the virus particle or virus internalization. Instead, affected L1 cleavage is a consequence of virus internalization into a non-infectious pathway and reduced capsid interaction with proteases resident within the entry platform complex or in the endosomal pathway. Thus, ADAM17 mediates virus association with the functional HPV-endocytic platform enabling host cell entry via the infectious pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A generalized scheme</title><p>Consistent with the idea of an entry platform containing EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Surviladze et al., 2012</xref>), we showed a significant reduction of the HPV16-EGFR association upon ADAM17 depletion. In agreement with this, it has been recently shown that EGFR acts as a cofactor for HCV entry by promoting specific tetraspanin interactions with other proteins that result in the assembly of the HCV entry receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruening et al., 2018</xref>). This points toward a general scheme in viral uptake independent from the virus structure, further supported by the notion that tetraspanins stand for essential components of entry receptor complexes for corona-, influenza-, hepatitis C and other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Earnest et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fast et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florin and Lang, 2018</xref>). We propose a model in which GF/GFR complex formation and GFR-mediated ERK signaling is a prerequisite for the formation of virus-associated tetraspanin entry platforms for many types of viruses.</p><p>It seems plausible that the GFR-dimerization triggered by the interaction of growth factors with its cognate receptors induces local accumulation of the associated tetraspanins, including CD151. Thus, clustering of cell factors might explain a more than two-fold increase in the CD151 microdomain size and internalization of the virus-associated entry platform. Furthermore, tetraspanin CD151 regulates integrin activities by influencing their positioning within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berditchevski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stipp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Crowding of CD151 at the sites where virus particles are bound results in co-accumulation of additional virus interacting molecules, laminin and integrin complexes, which is in line with our previous analysis on CD151 mutants demonstrating the importance of CD151/integrin complex formation in HPV16 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheffer et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the membrane-associated protein annexin A2 has been identified in virus/GFR complexes and is utilized by many viruses during cell entry, including HPV16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikuličić and Florin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dziduszko and Ozbun, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, much work has been done to unveil the process of human papillomavirus entry. Although for this puzzling process diverse host cell factors and many steps have been proposed so far, the precise description still remains controversial. In order to deepen our understanding of these early steps of infection, we investigated the requirements for HPV16 entry platform formation. We propose a model in which ADAM17 acts by the shedding of growth factors. These molecules trigger ERK signaling activation and thereby mediate the co-clustering of preformed larger CD151-EGFR microdomains and HPV16 in the plasma membrane. These events lead to the assembly of a functional virus entry platform, priming of the HPV capsid proteins, endocytosis into the infectious pathway and eventually infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HaCaT cells</td><td>Cell Lines Services (CLS)</td><td>Cat. #: 300493;

One day after siRNA transfection, HeLa cells were transfected with AP-TGFα plasmid using polyethylenimine [(PEI), Sigma-Aldrich]. 24 hr after, the medium was replaced by fresh DMEM without FCS and cells were either exposed to the rhADAM17 protein or left non-treated. After incubation of 3 hr at 37°C, supernatants were collected and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mM EDTA and 2.5% Triton X-100 in water. The phenanthroline has been shown as a metalloprotease inhibitor of ADAM17 catalysis .(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlöndorff et al., 2000</xref>). For experiment with rhADAM17, the changes in the AP activity correlate with the activity of rhADAM17 that is responsible for shedding of the membrane-bound TGFα. The AP activity was assessed after administration of AP substrate 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) by measuring absorbance at 405 nm.

Fixed cells were stained using primary, Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Hoechst33342 (Invitrogen). Fluorescence imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 100x (1.4 NA) and Axiovision deconvolution and colocalization software 4.7 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For determining amount of L1 (viruses) colocalizing either with CD151 or EGFR at 5 hr after PsVs exposure, we used randomly chosen rectangular areas of ~130 µm² and normalized assessed L1 pixels colocalizing with CD151 to the total L1 pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA)</title><p>HaCaT cells were transfected with specific siRNA for 48 hr and either left non-treated or treated with soluble EGF (20 ng/ml) for 5 min before incubation with 100–500 HPV16 PsVs particles per cell.

Two-color STED-microscopy was realized by sequential imaging of the two channels, using pulsed 561 nm and 640 nm lasers for the excitation of Alexa 594 and 647, respectively. For depletion, a pulsed 775 nm STED laser was used. Signals emitted from Alexa Fluor 594 and Alexa 647 dyes were detected using 580–630 nm and 650–720 filters, respectively. Depending on the experiment, pixel size was set to 15 nm for membrane sheets and 25 nm for cells. For all images, pinhole size was set to 60 µm. For the imaging of membrane sheets, the focal plane was adjusted slightly above and below the membrane sheet in order to check its two-dimensional structure briefly before imaging. This is possible because membrane sheets become immediately unfocussed when the focal plane is displaced in the z-axis, whereas cells or incompletely generated membrane sheets still show structural elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>STED microscopy image analysis</title><p>In imageJ, regions of interest (ROIs) were selected in the far-red channel (Alexa-647; displaying CD151), and propagated to the other respective channel. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between two channels was calculated with a custom ImageJ macro. For analyzing maxima parameters (size, distances, intensity), a custom ImageJ macro was used. The macro is based on the ImageJ function ‘Find Maxima’ which is used to detect clusters or viral particles and gives their position in pixel coordinates. Prior to maxima detection, images were smoothed with a Gaussian blur (σ = 1) to reduce false positive maxima due to noise. Cluster intensities were calculated by centering five pixel diameter circular ROIs onto the cluster positions. Cluster intensities were averaged for each cell. The exact cluster and PsV positions were determined by calculating the center of mass of fluorescence within the circular ROIs and used for further analysis. Maxima with low mean intensity (&lt; 2 - 5 a.u., depending on the experiment and channel) were excluded. Intensity measurements were corrected for local background measured next to the cell. For each PsV, the distances to the CD151 clusters were calculated, and the shortest distance was determined. In some cases, we found only a few PsVs per cell. Therefore, all PsV distances were averaged for one condition from one biological replicate (roughly 20 cells). The cluster size was determined by applying a horizontal and a vertical 3 × 31 pixels line scan centered at the cluster position. The linescans were fitted to a Gaussian yielding the full width at half maximum, which corresponds to the cluster size. Depending on the fit quality, either the value from the horizontal or vertical line scan was used. Clusters that have both fits with a R-square R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.8 (centered peak) were excluded. The cluster size values for each membrane sheet were averaged. Measurements of the CD151 level were performed in the same ROIs as used for the cluster size analysis. Intensity measurements were corrected for local background measured next to the membrane sheets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Tracking of PsVs and CD151-CFP</title><p>HPV16 PsVs and CD151-CFP accumulations were tracked using the ‘Find Maxima’ function of ImageJ. For determining the exact object position, a circular ROI with a diameter of 5 pixels was centered on the detected maxima and the center of mass of the fluorescence within the ROI was measured. The objects were tracked over a period of maximally 180 s with a time interval of 6 s between frames, yielding x- and y-positions of the objects over time. The mean-square displacement (MSD) was calculated like described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lang et al., 2000</xref>) and plotted against the time intervals. For CD151 MSD versus time plot indicated unidirectional flow, which was ignored when determining the diffusion coefficient from a fitted linear regression line (D). The coefficient was calculated for each single track and an average diffusion coefficient was calculated. Five movies recorded by TIRF microscopy, published and described in Scheffer et al., were analyzed (for details of TIRF microscopy see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheffer et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Statistical Software R (2017, version 3.3.3) from R Core Team (R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All values from two conditions that were compared in each statistical assay were tested for normality using Shapiro-Wilk test. If the values followed normal distribution (p&gt;0.05), they were further tested for homogeneity of variances using Bartlett, Fligner-Killeen and Levene‘s test. Samples were considered as homoscedastic if all three tests displayed p&gt;0.05, and as heteroscedastic if one of them displayed p≤0.05. Differences between the groups for homoscedastic samples were analyzed using two sample t-test and for heteroscedastic with Welch two sample t-test. In the case that values did not follow normal distribution (p≤0.05), Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied. Exact p-values are given for each statistical test where the specific sample (stated in brackets in the Fig. legend if more statistical assays were applied on the same blot or graph) was compared to the control. The ‘n’ for each presented analysis (stated in Fig. legend) denotes the sample size. Differences between the groups were considered statistically significant when p≤0.05 with the statistical significance marked in the graph (p≤0.05 *, p≤0.01 **, p≤0.001 ***, ns = not significant). All experiments were repeated independently at least three times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Björn Ahrens, Kirsten Freitag, Konstanze Scheffer, and Anna-Lena Loster for technical support, Dr. Niels Lemmermann for his comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Baki Akgül (Reviewer #1) and Gisa Gerold (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their interesting manuscript &quot;ADAM17-mediated signaling is required for virus entry platform assembly,&quot; the authors study the molecular events associated with infectious cellular internalization of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) by keratinocytes. They use a rich combination of molecular biology and fluorescence microscopy techniques to show that the proteinase ADAM17 activates signaling that triggers the formation of the endocytic platform to which the virus binds. This secondary entry receptor complex is a cluster of proteins, among which include the tetraspanin CD151 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The arguments are convincing and this work clearly represents an important step to clarify the issue under study. Overall, this paper provides novel mechanistic insights into how the HPV entry platform is formed, and the data are mostly convincing and robust. We believe that addressing the following major concerns would greatly improve the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;Hence, virus contact to the cellular surface does not activate the signaling pathway for which ADAM17 is required.&quot; Figure 6A shows a western blot for contr.si cells treated with pseudovirus. Here, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 can be seen. Therefore, in order to show that the virus does not lead to p-ERK1/2, a blot with extracts from contr.si cells without virus treatment needs to be included. Please also include the information in the figure, whether the extracts are from virus-infected or from non-infected cells.</p><p>2) Figure 4: An internalization assay would be needed to prove reduced internalization. If such an assay is technically challenging, the percentage of L1 at the surface and in intracellular compartments at different time points post temperature shift should be quantified.</p><p>3) Figure 5: To exclude that modified virions are transferred between donor and recipient cells, it would be beneficial to purify the virions released from the donor cells and add purified virions onto naïve cells.</p><p>4) Figure 6: A clear link between ADAM17 and EGF is missing. The fact that the KD phenotype can be reversed (under serum starvation conditions) by exogenous EGF, only implies that EGF can enhance uptake. Here the control siRNA treatment +/- EGF is missing to clarify whether EGF also enhances HPV entry in the presence of ADAM17. A clear link could only be shown using a combination of active site mutant ADAM17, EGF (or other ADAM17 substrate) quantification in the extracellular milieu, EGF neutralization, and EGFR inhibition assays.</p><p>5) Figure 6: ADAM17 processes a variety of membrane-bound precursors of growth factors and cytokines, e.g., TNF or Notch, but also integral membrane proteins, e.g., TNF receptor or growth hormone receptor; thus the link to EGF shedding should be more clearly worked out.</p><p>6) Figure 6: Which of the many EGFR ligands or other growth factor receptor ligands is involved?</p><p>7) Figure 6: EGFR signaling is regulating expression of multiple genes. 48 h post siRNA transfection expression profiles of several proteins critical for HPV entry may have changed. Additional experiments with short-term inhibitor treatment could solve this problem.</p><p>8) The whole virus/platform colocalization process is long and takes several hours. A question that is not fully tackled by the authors is the explanation for this duration. Can the proposed model of molecular cascade provide explanations, at least hints? Could it be quantified in terms of diffusion coefficients of the molecular partners? This would strengthen the model by making it realistic from a quantitative perspective.</p><p>9) One of the strengths of this work is the use of modern super-resolution microscopy (dual color STED) to go beyond the diffraction limit. In this work, it is notably used to measure CD151 cluster sizes. I also understand that CD151-L1 colocalization quantification was performed by STED. Why hasn't the same approach used to quantify the colocalization of CD151 and EGFR, in order to strengthen the conclusions of Figure 3? The same remark holds for Figure 2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44345.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) &quot;Hence, virus contact to the cellular surface does not activate the signaling pathway for which ADAM17 is required.&quot; Figure 6A shows a western blot for contr.si cells treated with pseudovirus.

Please also include the information in the figure, whether the extracts are from virus-infected or from non-infected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Control si cells with and without PsV were shown in the original manuscript in the Figure 6B (+PsV) and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A (-PsV) (now labeled in the figure). No difference was observed. To be more specific, we now investigated in detail the effect of PsV preparation on ERK phosphorylation in non-treated cells. The finding is now shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C. A mock preparation was used as control. During mock preparation (M), cells not-expressing HPV16 capsid proteins undergo the same procedure as cells expressing HPV capsid proteins for PsVs preparation (V). On the one hand, no difference in ERK activation was observed after mock or PsVs treatment supporting our statement that “virus contact to the cellular surface does not activate the signaling pathway for which ADAM17 is required”. On the other hand, we detected a difference between ERK levels of non-treated and treated cells independent of the presence of PsVs which indicates that in our PsVs preparation we co-purify ERK activating molecules which are also present in the mock control. For these reasons a true non-PsV negative is not possible. Therefore, we now removed our earlier statement, which however is not relevant for our main conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4: An internalization assay would be needed to prove reduced internalization. If such an assay is technically challenging, the percentage of L1 at the surface and in intracellular compartments at different time points post temperature shift should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>An HPV internalization assay (as published previously by Milne 2005, Wüstenhagen, 2016) is now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 4C and D. Internalized virus particles are protected from degradation by proteinase K. Cytochalasin D blocks virus internalization and enables proteinase K-mediated degradation of extracellular viral L1 capsid protein. By contrast, L1 in control or ADAM17 siRNA treated cells showed comparable L1 protection. Hence, 24h post infection, comparable amounts of PsVs are internalized. Still, ADAM17 depletion reduces infection and L1-cleavage.</p><p>These observations suggest that although ADAM17 depletion reduces viral particles entry into the infectious pathway, it concomitantly increases PsVs internalization into a non-infectious pathway. This argument has been added “Investigating the cleavage pattern of the viral L1 protein (L1 priming), we find that L1 is neither a substrate for ADAM17 (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B) nor internalization of viral particles is blocked by ADAM17 depletion (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C-D). Instead, L1 cleavage products substantially decreased in ADAM17-depleted cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4E and F). Therefore, we speculate that ADAM17 activity is required for viral particle association with L1-priming proteases such as kallikrein-8 prior to endocytosis and/or in intracellular compartments of the infectious entry pathway (47). Inhibition of these early steps on the plasma membrane rather leads to virus internalization into a non-infectious entry pathway as described earlier (48).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5: To exclude that modified virions are transferred between donor and recipient cells, it would be beneficial to purify the virions released from the donor cells and add purified virions onto naïve cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We actually do not exclude but assume that modified virions are transferred. To avoid any confusion we have added to the Discussion “In the co-culture transwell assay modified viral particles are transferred only from the donor cells to the recipient cells”.</p><p>We also discuss the possibility that released PsVs are decorated with different amounts of GFs: “This mutual influence is explained by an exchange of bioactive molecules between donor and recipient cells in both directions. The association of bioactive molecules with the viral capsid as proposed by the Ozbun group (Surviladze, Dziduszko and Ozbun, 2012) seems to increase the effect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6: A clear link between ADAM17 and EGF is missing. The fact that the KD phenotype can be reversed (under serum starvation conditions) by exogenous EGF, only implies that EGF can enhance uptake. Here the control siRNA treatment +/- EGF is missing to clarify whether EGF also enhances HPV entry in the presence of ADAM17. A clear link could only be shown using a combination of active site mutant ADAM17, EGF (or other ADAM17 substrate) quantification in the extracellular milieu, EGF neutralization, and EGFR inhibition assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important issue. EGF is only one out of seven known EGFR ligands. Therefore, the EGF effects only point towards the EGFR being involved in signaling, but not necessarily towards EGF as a ligand. Actually, EGF is an unlikely candidate, because its production depends more on shedding of other ADAM family members. The functional importance of EGFR is now shown as new Figure 6A by performing EGFR inhibition assay.</p><p>Candidates for GFs depending on ADAM17 sheddase activity include HB-EGF, TGF-α, and AREG. We now show reduced levels of AREG and TGF-α in the supernatant of ADAM17 depleted cell, confirming that also in our system the production of AREG and TGF-α depends on ADAM17. We also analyzed HB-EGF, but were not able to detect it in the western blot, most likely because after cleavage it does not diffuse into the supernatant but remains immediately bound to HSPGs.</p><p>AREG and TGF-α play a role in infection because infectivity is reduced after adding neutralizing antibodies. Finally, adding AREG, TGF-α, and HB-EGF to the supernatant of serum-starved or ADAM17-depleted cells increases ERK phosphorylation and infection.</p><p>Together, the new data incorporated as Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 provide a link between ADAM17-mediated GFs shedding, activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and HPV16 infection. We added a paragraph with a detailed discussion to “ADAM17-released growth factors”.</p><p>We would like to thank again the reviewers for pointing out this important issue, which helped us to improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6: ADAM17 processes a variety of membrane-bound precursors of growth factors and cytokines, e.g., TNF or Notch, but also integral membrane proteins, e.g., TNF receptor or growth hormone receptor; thus the link to EGF shedding should be more clearly worked out.</p></disp-quote><p>The link between ADAM17 and GFs is now shown in new Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Please see our detailed reply above.</p><p>However, we did not find a specific GF, which is not expected, as the EGFR has many ligands. We also cannot exclude the involvement of further ligands. We state in the Discussion: “The effect of EGFR, AREG or TGF-α inhibition is much lower than that of the ADAM17 siRNA, therefore, we have to assume that ADAM17 not only activates the EGFR but also activates additional</p><p>GFRs.” and “Due to the plethora of ADAM17 substrates (Gooz, 2010; Reiss and Saftig, 2009; Edwards, Handsley and Pennington, 2008) and the complex crosstalk between signaling pathways, also, ADAM17-dependent shedding of additional membrane-bound precursors and cleavage of integral membrane proteins might be involved in this scenario.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6: Which of the many EGFR ligands or other growth factor receptor ligands is involved?</p></disp-quote><p>The involvement of AREG, TGF-α, and HB-EGF is now uncovered. Please see our reply to the previous point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6: EGFR signaling is regulating expression of multiple genes. 48 h post siRNA transfection expression profiles of several proteins critical for HPV entry may have changed. Additional experiments with short-term inhibitor treatment could solve this problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We now performed experiments using Cetuximab, a blocking-antibody of EGFR, which we incubated for only 1h prior to PsVs addition. (Results are shown in as new Figure 6A). Effect of ADAM17 short-term inhibitors TAPI-0 and GW is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The whole virus/platform colocalization process is long and takes several hours. A question that is not fully tackled by the authors is the explanation for this duration. Can the proposed model of molecular cascade provide explanations, at least hints? Could it be quantified in terms of diffusion coefficients of the molecular partners? This would strengthen the model by making it realistic from a quantitative perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the mobility of viral particles. They are essentially immobile (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) as intensively investigated and discussed by Schelhaas et al., 2008. This is in contrast to tetraspanins, known to move in the cell membrane (please note that as well we tracked CD151 structures but the pattern in the TIRF field was not well resolved).</p><p>In response to the next point, we analyzed by superresolution microscopy the overlap between CD151 and L1, which increases over time when analyzed with conventional microscopy (old Figure 2). Using STED microscopy, we find 30% of the viral particles readily associating with CD151 clusters already 15 min after addition. In the next few hours, this fraction increases to almost 50%, and the CD151 signal at the viral binding sites becomes brighter (new Figure 2 A-C). Both effects explain the increase in overlap seen with conventional microscopy (this data is still in the manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>All findings together indicate that platform maturation is associated with the recruitment of CD151 molecules to an essentially immobile, cell surface bound viral particle, which takes a few hours. This is discussed in the subsection “Antibodies and plasmids”.</p><p>Surprisingly, nanoscopy uncovered the above-mentioned large fraction of viral particles associated with CD151 clusters already present briefly after binding. It is possible that virus platform formation does not strictly depend on virus unbinding and rebinding, which occurs as documented in the trans-well assay, but may not be essential for infectivity. We have added to the Discussion: “Examining at nanoscale resolution the secondary entry receptor complex component CD151, briefly after binding, we find viral particles associated with CD151 clusters and over the next hours an enrichment of CD151 at the virus binding site.” And modified the current model accordingly. “It is possible that a large fraction of viral particles are not released from the cell surface, as expected from the primary receptor/secondary receptor model, but can remain at or in close proximity to the initial binding site.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) One of the strengths of this work is the use of modern super-resolution microscopy (dual color STED) to go beyond the diffraction limit. In this work, it is notably used to measure CD151 cluster sizes. I also understand that CD151-L1 colocalization quantification was performed by STED.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not employed STED microscopy in old Figure 2, showing that the overlap between CD151 and L1 increases over time. This experiment has been repeated with STED microscopy and revealed the above-mentioned interesting details, allowing for a better understanding of platform formation (see Figure 2A-C and reply to previous point).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why hasn't the same approach used to quantify the colocalization of CD151 and EGFR, in order to strengthen the conclusions of Figure 3?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have analyzed the colocalization between CD151 and EGFR by STED microscopy. We confirm colocalization see with conventional microscopy, which however is not dependent on ADAM17 (See new Figure 3C and D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The same remark holds for Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Has been done (see previous point).</p></body></sub-article></article>
