function are poorly understood. We have characterized ligand-induced dimerization and multimerization of EGFR using single-molecule analysis, and show that multimerization can be blocked by mutations in a specific region of Domain IV of the extracellular module. These mutations reduce autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of EGFR and attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which is recruited by EGFR. The catalytic activity of EGFR is switched on through allosteric activation of one kinase domain by another, and we show that if this is restricted to dimers, then sites in the tail that are proximal to the kinase domain are phosphorylated in only one subunit. We propose a structural model for EGFR multimerization through self-association of ligand-bound dimers, in which the majority of kinase domains are activated cooperatively, thereby boosting tail phosphorylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14107.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14107.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>stoichiometry</kwd><kwd>multimerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2RO1CA09650406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15EY024451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Adam W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM117051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isacoff</surname><given-names>Ehud Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multimerization plays a functional role in EGFR activation and can be blocked by mutations in a specific region of Domain IV.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that couples the binding of extracellular ligands, such as EGF and transforming growth factor-a (TGF-α), to the initiation of intracellular signaling pathways that control cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kovacs et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leahy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>). Human EGFR is one of four closely related receptors that form homodimeric or heterodimeric combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001</xref>). EGFR and one other member of the family (human epidermal growth factor receptor 4, HER4, also known as ErbB4) bind to specific ligands, and respond by activating their intracellular kinase domains. The two other members of the family, HER2 and HER3, are potent signaling receptors in combination, with HER3 switching on the kinase activity of HER2 in response to ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Citri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sliwkowski et al., 1994</xref>). Aberrant signaling from EGFR family members underlies the onset of many cancers, and there is intense interest in understanding how these receptors are regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slamon et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The canonical view of EGFR activation considers the monomeric receptor to convert to a dimeric form upon the addition of EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemmon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlessinger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">1987b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Dimerization activates the intracellular kinase domains of the receptor, resulting in autophosphorylation of a ~230 residue C-terminal tail and the initiation of downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margolis et al., 1989</xref>). The extracellular module of EGFR consists of four domains, denoted Domains I, II, III and IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Domains I and III form the ligand-binding site of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>). Domain II, which bridges the ligand-binding domains, contains a 'dimerization arm' that interacts with the corresponding element in the other subunit in a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dawson et al., 2005</xref>). Domains I, II and III form a compact unit that we refer to as the 'head' of the extracellular module, of which Domain IV forms an elongated 'leg'. In the absence of ligand, the extracellular module adopts a tethered and autoinhibited conformation, in which the dimerization arm is buried between the head and the leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>). Ligand binding converts the receptor to a straightened form, releasing the dimerization arm, which then interacts to form a back-to-back dimer in which ligands do not participate directly in the inter-subunit interfaces.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14107.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagrams of EGFR structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The canonical model for the monomer to dimer transition in EGFR that is triggered by ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kovacs et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>).

This allosteric interaction involves the C-lobe of one kinase (the 'activator') forming a tight interface with the N-lobe of another (the 'receiver'), which stabilizes the receiver in an active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The transmembrane helices, which connect the extracellular module to the intracellular module, also dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendrola et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mineev et al., 2010</xref>), and this dimer is coupled to the asymmetric dimer of kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkhipov et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jura et al., 2009a</xref>). This model for EGFR dimerization explains how a variety of ligands can activate the receptor, how heterodimeric combinations of the four EGFR family members can form, and how the catalytically impaired member of this family, HER3, can activate HER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Endres et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jura et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kovacs et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In their seminal analysis of the activation of EGFR by EGF, Yarden and Schlessinger showed that the addition of EGF to EGFR results in the formation of dimers or higher-order multimers in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">1987b</xref>). Although subsequent discussion of the activation of EGFR has focused on a monomer to dimer transition, Clayton, Burgess and colleagues concluded that EGFR forms tetramers upon activation, and that the tetramers are essential for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clayton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozer et al., 2013</xref>). Single-molecule tracking studies of EGFR in live cells show that EGFR forms large clusters after activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, higher-order multimerization and clustering are important correlates of EGFR activation, but the structural details and functional consequences of larger assemblies are not clear.</p><p>We now present an analysis of the stoichiometry of EGFR complexes before and after activation, using stepwise photobleaching of fluorescently-tagged proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). We find that EGFR exists as a monomer prior to ligand binding. Addition of EGF results predominantly in higher-order multimers, rather than just dimers. We have identified, through modeling and mutagenesis, a region within Domain IV of the extracellular module that is important for multimerization of the receptor, but is not required for dimerization. These data suggest that EGFR multimers are comprised of EGFR dimers that self-associate through Domain IV to form higher-order structures.</p><p>We also used pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith, 2015</xref>) to study human EGFR transfected into mammalian COS-7 cells. We show that EGF addition to EGFR in COS-7 cells results in the formation of multimers, rather than just dimers. Importantly, introduction of a Domain IV mutation that blocks multimerization of EGFR in the Xenopus oocyte assay prevents the formation of multimers in mammalian cells, with the response to EGF of the mutant EGFR being limited to dimer formation.</p><p>We tested the importance of multimer formation for EGFR activity in a human cell line (HEK-293). The mutations in Domain IV that reduce multimerization also reduced phosphorylation of Tyr 992, a site in the C-terminal tail that is proximal to the kinase domain, and Tyr 1173, a distal site. These mutations attenuate the phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which binds to Tyr 992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is activated by distal phosphorylation of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batzer et al., 1994</xref>), is not affected by these mutations. Our data suggest that this differential effect on proximal phosphorylation may arise from the structure of the asymmetric dimer of kinase domains, in which the proximal sites on the activator kinase cannot reach the active site of the receiver kinase, and would therefore be poorly phosphorylated in isolated dimers. We speculate that multimerization results in the formation of chains of kinase domains, in which the majority of kinase domains would be stabilized in the active form, allowing stronger phosphorylation in general, and more complete phosphorylation of proximal sites <italic>in cis</italic>.</p><p>We have constructed a model for a ligand-bound EGFR tetramer, using several criteria that emerged from our experiments. This model generates a spacing between dimers of the extracellular domain that is consistent with linkage to a head-to-tail chain of kinase domains, which serve as receivers and activators for each other. The tetramer constructed in this way is open-ended, and can potentially engage additional dimers to extend the chain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of the stoichiometry of human EGFR by expression in Xenopus oocytes</title><p>We measured EGFR stoichiometry by transient transfection in Xenopus oocytes, which provides a convenient experimental system for controlled and reliable protein expression at very low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>).

The spots are stable in position, allowing their photobleaching properties to be studied readily. The surface density of the receptor is estimated to be ~1 to ~5 molecules per μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The effective local density of EGFR may be higher, because the membrane surface of the oocytes forms microvilli, within which the receptors are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinzmann and Höfler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sonnleitner et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the expression level of EGFR in these cells is very low when compared to that seen in typical mammalian-cell based experimental systems. For comparison, the surface densities of EGFR in the cancer cell lines A431, HeLa and A549 are ~600, ~300 and ~100 molecules per μm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EGFR is predominantly monomeric in the absence of ligand</title><p>To monitor photobleaching, a 13 µm x 13 µm field of view was illuminated in the TIRF mode by a laser and movies of 500–800 frames were recorded at a frame rate of 20 Hz. Frames from these movies were analyzed to measure the time-dependent decrease in the fluorescence intensities of individual spots, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Analysis was restricted to spots that showed no overlap with nearby spots. In the absence of ligand, most spots undergo photobleaching in a single step, although some are observed to decay in two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We do not see any spots with more than two steps in the photobleaching trace. We analyzed over 900 individual spots from ~15 cells to generate a histogram of one-step and two-step photobleaching events, which shows that ~94% of the spots show a single step-wise reduction in fluorescence intensity to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To do this, we expressed Claudin-16, a transmembrane protein that is known to be monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong et al., 2015</xref>), at level comparable to that for EGFR in our experiments, and counted the number of one-step and two-step photobleaching events. For Claudin 16, ~3% of the spots show two-step photobleaching. We subtracted this baseline fraction of two-step bleaching events from all the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. With this correction, the fraction of two-step photobleaching events for EGFR is ~3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is comparable to the level of ligand-independent preformed dimers reported in mammalian cells expressing EGFR at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>). Note that ~25% to ~35% of EGFP molecules are dark, due to incomplete maturation of the fluorophore, which results in fewer photobleaching steps than the number of subunits in a multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). Thus, two-step photobleaching may arise from dimers as well as a small population of higher-order multimers.</p><p>We deleted the dimerization arm of the extracellular module, involving residues 242–259 (the mutant is denoted Δ-arm). This resulted in an increase in the fraction of two-step photobleaching events, from ~3% to ~9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The increase in apparent dimerization upon deletion of the dimerization arm is unexpected, given that that this element forms a major part of the extracellular dimer interface. A possible explanation is that the dimerization arm is also important for maintaining the tethered and autoinhibited conformation of the extracellular module, and deletion of the dimerization arm is expected to release autoinhibition, and thereby facilitate dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>). To test this idea we introduced mutations on the other side of the tethered interaction, which is in Domain IV rather than in the dimerization arm of Domain II. We introduced two point mutations (D563A, H566A) and also deleted a loop (residues 575 to 585) in Domain IV. A similar mutation in EGFR has been shown to abolish the tethering interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawson et al., 2007</xref>). This mutation, which we refer to as Δ-tether, has the dimerization arm intact, and it also increases the fraction of two-step bleaching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results are consistent with the accepted view, which is that the autoinhibited conformation of the extracellular domain provides a steric block to dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>). Once this block is released, the extended shape of the extracellular module permits dimerization even if the dimerization arm is deleted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Addition of EGF to EGFR generates dimers and higher-order multimers</title><p>We added EGF at 15 nM concentration to Xenopus oocytes expressing EGFR.

We analyzed photobleaching data for an EGFR variant in which the catalytic base is mutated (D813N).

We conclude that neither EGF nor TGF-α is likely to be at the interfaces between protomers in the multimers. The binding of EGF to EGFR exhibits negative cooperativity, which has been interpreted in terms of half-site binding of EGFR to EGF (i.e., at a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1) at low ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipov et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pike, 2012</xref>).

This construct was studied by photobleaching, and it exhibited one-step and two-step photobleaching, with no evidence for multistep photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that the transmembrane helices do not form multimers by themselves at the low expression levels used in our experiments. An interesting aspect of these data is that the extent of dimerization for the isolated transmembrane helices (~13%) is greater than that seen for full-length EGFR (~3%) without EGF (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figures 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We wondered whether the extracellular domain has an interface that is required for multimerization, but not for dimerization or ligand binding. Packing interactions in crystal structures of the extracellular domains of EGFR family members do not provide obvious clues concerning such an interface. We therefore turned to computational docking to see if there are ways in which the extracellular domains might self-associate.</p><p>We first ran the docking program ClusPro, which emphasizes shape complementarity between protomers in generating models for protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozakov et al., 2013</xref>), using the structures of the entire dimeric extracellular module (PDB code: 3NJP) or a dimer containing just the ligand-bound head (PDB code: 1MOX), with no constraints. This led to docking solutions that were either physically implausible (i.e., the two dimers of the extracellular module could not be connected to the same membrane), or that had EGF at the interface between dimers. Since our experiments made it unlikely that EGF bridges EGFR dimers in a multimers, we concluded that ClusPro is unable to provide plausible models for self-interaction, which we expect to be very weak in the absence of organization on the membrane.</p><p>We then ran ClusPro using a single copy of the structure of the Domain IV leg alone. Although this did not result in one clear solution, we were intrigued by a family of solutions in which one face of Domain IV was packed upon itself in a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These solutions have a surface containing several hydrophobic residues at the interface between two Domain IV molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This surface is not involved in formation of the EGF-bound EGFR dimer, and it is distal to the surface of Domain IV that forms the tethering interaction in autoinhibited ligand-free EGFR.

We found that the effect on EGFR activity of a double mutation (I545K and I556K; 'II/KK') is similar to that of the IIIV/KKRE quadruple mutation (not shown).

We are uncertain of the nature of the multimers formed by the GCN4-ICM construct, because introduction of mutations at the asymmetric dimer interface (I682Q, V924R) does not disrupt these multimers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Functional role of multimerization in EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling</title><p>The multimerization of EGFR has been reported before, and it has been noted that the formation of tetramers is correlated with the recruitment of the adapter protein GRB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clayton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kozer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2014</xref>). Nevertheless, a functional role for ligand-dependent multimerization has yet to be established definitively. The mutations that we have identified in Domain IV of EGFR that block multimerization, but not dimerization, provide an opportunity to identify the effects of multimerization on EGFR function. To test the effect of these mutations on the activity of EGFR, we used transient transfection in mammalian cells (HEK293T), followed by measurement of phosphorylation on EGFR and downstream signaling effector proteins by FACS assay, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2015b</xref>).

To do this we made a construct in which an HA epitope tag is fused to the N-terminus of EGFR, with a fluorescent protein (Venus) fused to the C-terminus. This construct was transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, as for the activity assays shown above. An HA-specific antibody was used to visualize surface-exposed EGFR in individual cells using a fluorescence microscope, and the total expression of EGFR was monitored by detecting fluorescence of the Venus protein tag. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, there is no difference in the ratio of surface-exposed to total EGFR for wild type compared to the II/KK mutant, over the entire range of EGFR expression in the experiment.</p><p>We note that one of the glycosylation sites in EGFR, Asn 544 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhen et al., 2003</xref>), is located close to residues Ile 545 and Ile 556 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We wondered whether mutations in Domain IV could be affecting this glycosylation site, and perhaps altering multimerization and signaling in that way. We made two EGFR variants in which Asn 544 was replaced by either aspartate or glutamine. Both mutant receptors show no reduction in EGFR tail phosphorylation (data not shown).</p><p>We also monitored the phosphorylation of two proteins that are expected to be activated as a consequence of distal and proximal phosphorylation of the EGFR tail, respectively. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) is activated by distal phosphorylation of EGFR, through the docking of the adapter proteins GRB2 and SHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batzer et al., 1994</xref>). Signaling from proximal sites in EGFR is less well characterized than for distal sites, but a comprehensive study of EGFR phosphopeptides binding to other proteins showed that the SH2 domains of the α and β isoforms of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and that of phospholipase C-γ, bind with high affinity only to sites in the proximal segment of the EGFR tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). We monitored PI3K, and found that mutations in Domain IV result in attenuation of PI3K phosphorylation, to ~30% of the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, the phosphorylation of ERK by the MAP-kinase pathway is not affected by Domain IV mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>To understand why mutations that reduce multimerization affect phosphorylation of the EGFR tail, we carried out co-transfection experiments using EGFR variants that are activator-impaired (i.e., a mutation prevents their kinase domains from taking the activator position in an asymmetric dimer) or receiver-impaired (a mutation prevents their kinase domains from taking the receiver position, but they can serve as activators; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> for a schematic representation of these mutants). We showed previously that for such combinations the activator tail is phosphorylated slightly more efficiently than the receiver tail, but we could not distinguish between distal and proximal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2015b</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14107.014</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proximal and distal tail phosphorylation of EGFR in co-transfections with activator-impaired and receiver-impaired mutants.</title><p>In these experiments, activator-impaired EGFR (V924R; denoted VR; salmon subunit) is fused to EGFP at the C-terminus and receiver-impaired EGFR (I682Q; denoted IQ; yellow subunit) is fused to mCherry.

Phosphorylation of Tyr 1173 clearly occurs in both receiver and activator tails, with higher efficiency for the activator tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), which is consistent with our previous study. For Tyr 992, in the proximal part of the tail, the phosphorylation level in the activator tail is much lower compared to that in the receiver tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Tyr 992, in the proximal part of the tail, can only access its own kinase domain in an asymmetric dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koland, 2014</xref>). In a combination of receiver-impaired and activator-impaired EGFR molecules, the activator kinase domain is not itself activated, and so Tyr 992 in the activator tail cannot be phosphorylated efficiently. These results suggest that if phosphorylation occurred only within a dimer, then only half the proximal sites would be phosphorylated efficiently, unless the receiver and activator kinases swapped positions.</p><p>In considering the potential relevance of multimerization for EGFR activity, we also wondered about the extent to which activated EGFR molecules ('enzymes') could phosphorylate other EGFR molecules ('bystander substrates') through random encounters, without the necessity for formation of a specific organization. It has been shown previously, using co-transfection of wild-type and chimeric variants of EGFR, that the phosphorylation of bystander EGFR kinase domains does not occur efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muthuswamy et al., 1999</xref>). We addressed this issue by co-transfecting active EGFR variants lacking Tyr 1173 in the tail ('Enzyme-EGFR') with EGFR variants that are kinase-dead, but contain Tyr 1173 ('Substrate-EGFR'; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14107.015</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Lateral phosphorylation of the tail of EGFR.</title><p>Top) Schematic of kinase-active EGFR (Enzyme-EGFR) that is co-transfected with a kinase-dead variant (D813N; Substrate-EGFR), as shown in the schematic diagram.

Phosphorylation of Tyr 1173 is also observed when the Substrate-EGFR is receiver-impaired (I682Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Strikingly, if the Substrate-EGFR is activator-impaired (V924R), then phosphorylation of Tyr 1173 is not efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Likewise, phosphorylation of Tyr 1173 is also not efficient if the substrate-EGFR is both activator-impaired and receiver-impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Although a previous study had inferred that lateral phosphorylation of EGFR tails is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruan and Kannan, 2015</xref>), our results lead us to conclude that lateral phosphorylation of the tail in bystander substrates is inefficient, and that for efficient tail phosphorylation to occur, the kinase bearing the tail has to be part of an asymmetric dimer.</p><p>These results suggest that multimerization involving chains of asymmetric dimers of kinase domains might be a mechanism for boosting the phosphorylation of both proximal and distal sites on the tail. In such a multimer model, where the majority of kinase domains are sandwiched by other kinase domains, they function as 'activators' and 'receivers' simultaneously. Therefore, phosphorylation of the EGFR tail would be potentiated and more easily propagated in response to EGF.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>A model for EGFR multimers</title><p>We have constructed a plausible model for an EGFR multimer that is consistent with the constraints implied by our findings (a summary of the key results that we used in constructing this model is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement1</xref>). The components of the model are the known dimeric arrangements of the extracellular module, the transmembrane helices and the kinase domains, which are connected together to produce a model for dimeric full-length EGFR, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkhipov et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endres et al., 2013</xref>). We then modeled tetramers of EGFR by packing the dimers against each other as rigid bodies. This model is simply a useful construct for considering how tetramerization might occur, and is not based on detailed energy calculations. Also, the limited set of mutations we have made does not allow us to conclude definitively that the residues that we have identified as being important are responsible for a direct and stereospecific interaction between dimers. Thus, the models should be considered as structural hypotheses that await more rigorous experimental tests.</p><p>We began by docking two dimers of the extracellular module to generate a tetramer. There are, at present, only two crystal structures for intact extracellular modules of EGFR-family members bound to ligands, EGFR bound to EGF (PDB code: 3NJP; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>]), and HER4 bound to neuregulin-1β (PDB code: 3U7U; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>]). The principal difference between these is that the EGFR extracellular module is closed, with the C-terminal tips of the extracellular module are close together, whereas in HER4 they are separated. These differences reflect an intrinsic flexibility in the extracellular module, rather than fundamental difference between EGFR and HER4, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkhipov et al., 2013a</xref>). We found that a closed structure, with the tips of Domain IV close together, is more suitable for the generation of multimers in which each subunit retains connection to a planar membrane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Using the EGFR dimer (PDB code: 3NJP), we ran ClusPro to generate tetramers, with the constraint that the seven residues in Domain IV that are important for multimerization are at the interface between dimers. This resulted in the generation of a family of tetrameric arrangements of the extracellular module that resemble each other in general (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref> for a representative model for an extracellular tetramer). The ligand-bound heads of the receptors (Domains I to III) are stacked in a parallel arrangement, with a Domain IV leg from one dimer interacting with a Domain IV leg from the other. These dimers are open structures, and higher-order multimers can be formed readily by adding additional dimers through propagation of the Domain IV-Domain IV interaction. We checked that the selected ClusPro solutions did not place any of the documented glycosylation sites at the interface between dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhen et al., 2003</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14107.016</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A model for EGFR multimerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two orthogonal views of a tetramer of extracellular modules, selected manually from ClusPro solutions for docking dimers (PDB code: 3NJP) with the constraint that the residues in Domain IV that affect multimerization are located at the interface between dimers.

In these chains, the rotation between adjacent kinase domains is 90°, rather than 120°, due to rotation of the N-lobe of the kinase domain with respect to the C-lobe. This intrinsic flexibility in the kinase domain may allow maintenance of the juxtamembrane interactions along the chain, but we have not investigated this further.</p><p>Our model for extended multimers relies on the C-terminal tips of the extracellular module being close together (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2</xref>). A closed conformation of the extracellular module would be stabilized by the dimerization of the transmembrane helices, which brings the N-terminal ends of the helices close together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mineev et al., 2010</xref>). Such coupling may explain the critical importance of the transmembrane dimer for multimerization. In the Xenopus oocyte assay, we found that disruption of the transmembrane dimer interface resulted in a substantial reduction in the extent of multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, the deletion of the dimerization arm in the extracellular module (Δ-arm) had very little effect. In terms of its effect on activity, EGFR that is mutated in the transmembrane helix behaves similarly to EGFR with Domain IV mutations that block multimerization, with strong inhibition of PI3K phosphorylation, and only a mild effect on ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Deletion of the dimerization arm compromises EGFR function in a more general way, blocking both PI3K and ERK phosphorylation (not shown). This differential effect of mutations in the transmembrane helices on proximal versus distal sites may explain why it has been difficult to observe strong effects on EGFR activity by disrupting transmembrane dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that this model for multimerization may apply to other human EGFR family members as well. Examination of the Domain IV multimerization interface shows that although there are changes in the identity of residues within this region, the general hydrophobicity of residues in this surface region is conserved. For heterodimers of HER2 and HER3, an interesting possibility is that a tetramer could have two HER2 kinase domains sandwiched between HER3 kinase domains. The HER2 tail is similar in sequence to that of EGFR, and is likely to be subject to the same constraints on the phosphorylation of proximal sites. The HER3 tail is distinctive, and includes a ~70 residue long spacer between the kinase domain and the first phosphorylation site, making HER3 less dependent on a specific organization of kinase domains for phosphorylation. The first HER2 kinase domain would be activated by HER3, and would serve as the activator for the second HER2 kinase domain. Multimerization has been shown to be important for the phosphorylation of HER2 in HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and the simultaneous activation of two HER2 kinase domains in a tetramer might account for this.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our studies on the stoichiometry of EGFR show that the receptor is predominantly monomeric in the absence of EGF, at low expression levels. More importantly, we found that ligand-induced receptor self-association does not end at dimerization, but continues with the generation of multimers. While the existence of higher-order ligand-induced multimers of EGFR has been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clayton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2008</xref>), our identification of residues in Domain IV that specifically affect multimerization rather than dimerization has allowed us to uncover a functional role of multimerization in EGFR activation. The long C-terminal tail of EGFR has two kinds of phosphorylation sites. Those that are distal to the kinase domain (e.g., Tyr 1068, and Tyr 1173, which recruit the adaptor proteins GRB2 and SHC) are phosphorylated more efficiently than those in the proximal part of the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koland, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2015b</xref>). We now show that multimerization is necessary for robust phosphorylation of PI3K, which is recruited to the proximal part of the tail.</p><p>We propose a model for an EGFR tetramer that is consistent with our experimental observations. This model is reminiscent of the arrays formed by the sensor of the unfolded protein response, IRE1, in which oligomerization of the peptide-binding module in the endoplasmic reticulum is coupled to the chaining of kinase domains in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korennykh et al., 2009</xref>). In IRE1, the chaining of kinase domains occurs in a back-to-front manner, whereas in EGFR our model has the kinase domains chained in a head to tail fashion, generating a continuous array of activator and receiver kinase domains. Such an array might boost tail phosphorylation by stabilizing the active conformations of the majority of kinase domains, and also by facilitating the phosphorylation of the proximal segments of the tail <italic>in cis</italic>.</p><p>Our understanding of the mechanism for EGFR activation relies heavily on structural information for fragments of the receptor. However, the efficient activation of EGFR and the initiation of signaling pathways on the cell membrane involves dynamic interactions between intact receptors and their surroundings, including membranes, adaptor proteins, effector proteins, and the cytoskeleton. The multimerization of EGFR may be crucial for signaling in this environment, since it increases the effective density of docking sites for downstream adaptor proteins. These adaptors are typically multivalent, and their docking could synergize with EGFR multimerization, leading to larger-scale clusters. The formation of such signaling platforms may be a central aspect of maintaining the balance between ligand-induced activation and inactivation by receptor internalization, phosphatases or ubiquitin ligases, and will continue to serve as a focus of intense study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Single-molecule imaging in live Xenopus oocytes</title><p>For experiments in Xenopus oocytes, the human EGFR gene was cloned into pGEMHE-X-EGFP vector at SalI and SacII site to generate a C-terminally EGFP tagged version of EGFR. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was then synthesized in vitro from linearized DNA using mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). For single molecule imaging by TIRF microscopy, mRNA injection for EGFR-EGFP was optimized for expression. We found that 0.25–0.5 ng of mRNA for approximately 20 hr of incubation at 18°C produced uniform diffraction-limited spots when imaged by TIRF microscopy.</p><p>In the absence of EGF, imaging of EGFR-EGFP on Xenopus oocyte membrane by TIRF microscopy was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). Briefly, 10–20 oocytes were manually devitellinized after ~20 hr of expression at 18°C, placed on high refractive index coverslips (n = 1.78; Olympus, Japan) and excited using a phoxX 488 (60 mW) laser and, imaged using an Olympus 100×, numerical aperture (NA) 1.65 oil immersion objective at room temperature. A 495 nm long-pass dichroic mirror was used at excitation in combination with a 525/50 nm band-pass filter at emission. Five hundred to eight hundred frames at the rate of 20 Hz were acquired using an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Andor iXon DV887).</p><p>The Xenopus oocytes flatten on the surface of coverslips, and we found that if we added fluorescently labeled EGF to oocytes that had already been placed on the coverslips there was limited access of EGF to the receptors. To overcome this problem we added EGF directly into the imaging buffer first, and then placed the oocytes onto the coverslip of the imaging chamber that contains EGF buffer. The EGF that is used in all other experiments is unlabeled. We noticed that upon addition of EGF the spots corresponding to the receptor were no longer fixed in space but were mobile, which complicates the analysis of photobleaching. We found that the addition of a FLAG-tag to the EGFR at the N-terminus resulted in minimization of motion of the receptor, presumably due to better adherence to the glass. We verified that the inclusion of the FLAG tag did not affect the activity of the receptor as assessed by autophosphorylation in response to EGF in mammalian cells (COS-7) (data not shown).</p><p>To observe the effect of EGF on EGFR stoichiometry, we placed the oocytes expressing EGFR-EGFP one by one directly in the chamber containing 15 nM EGF solution in ND96 buffer (5 mM HEPES/NaOH, 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, pH 7.6) placed on the TIRF microscope. Imaging was started almost immediately, with a maximum delay of 1–2 min, using the same protocol described above.</p><p>Only single, immobile, and diffraction-limited spots were analyzed. The number of bleaching steps was determined manually for each single spot included in the analysis; 1000–2000 spots from 5 to 10 oocytes from three to five different batches were analyzed for most of the constructs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pulsed interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS)</title><p>Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements were done on a modified inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti; Nikon Instruments) with customized illumination and detection paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Comar et al., 2014</xref>). The sample was illuminated with two overlapping laser beams picked from a 5 ps pulsed supercontinuum fiber source (SuperK NKT Photonics, Birkerod, Denmark). The two beams were spatially separated from the parent white light source with a series of dichroic mirrors and respectively filtered through a 488 nm (LL01-488-12.5, Semrock, Rochester, NY) and a 561 nm (LL02-561-12.5, Semrock, Rochester, NY) cleanup filter. The 561 nm beam was directed through an 18 m single mode fiber, and the 488 nm beam through a 3 m fiber, which introduced a 50 ns time delay for pulsed interleaved excitation. After exiting the fibers, the two beams were spatially overlapped and sent to a dichroic filter block (zt488/561rpc and zet488/561m, Chroma Technology Corp. Bellows Falls, VT) housed within the filter wheel of the microscope. The epifluorescence signal collected by the objective passed through a 50 μm pinhole positioned outside a camera port of the microscope and was split onto two detectors filtered with a 612/69 nm filter (FF01-621/69–25, Semrock, Rochester, NY) and a 520/44 nm filter (FF01-520/44–25, Semrock, Rochester, NY). The signal was detected with single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) with a 50 μm active area, 30 ps timing resolution, and 25 dark counts per second (Micro Photon Devices, Bolzano, Italy); single photon counts were recorded with a four-channel-routed time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) device (Picoharp 300, PicoQuant, Berlin, Germany).</p><p>Measurements were made on live Cos-7 cells held at 37°C with an on-stage incubator. The laser focus was positioned near the cell periphery to avoid signal from immobile or slow moving vesicles and organelles. For each cell, data was collected in five successive 15 s increments. The time-tagged data in the each of the 15 s data files is filtered according to the photon arrival time. Photons arriving at the 612/69 nm filtered detector within 50 ns of a 488 nm laser pulse are rejected from the ‘red’ fluorescence intensity trace, and photons arriving at the 520/44 nm filtered detector within 50 ns of a 561 nm laser pulse are rejected from the ‘green’ fluorescence intensity trace. This generates a time-dependent fluorescence signal, free from green-to-red bleed-through, FRET, and direct mCherry excitation by the 482 nm laser. Fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectra are calculated as described previously.

In co-transfection experiments, EGFP was replaced by monomeric variants of mCherry (Clontech) using BamHI and NotI sites. Cos-7 or HEK-293T cells grown on 6-well plates were transfected with FuGENE (Promega) and serum starved for 12 hr. These two cell lines were chosen because of their low levels of expression of endogenous EGFR and high transfection efficiency. Cells were dissociated by enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), transferred to 96-well plates, and spun down at 1800 rpm for 3 min. Samples were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 2 min at room temperature. After stimulation, cells were immediately fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min. Samples were spun down and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 30 min on ice. After rehydration in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mM EDTA), cells were stained with 1:100 dilution of primary antibody.

Only cells that are simultaneously expressing comparable levels of mCherry and EGFP, which are majority of the cells, are binned based on their expression levels of the EGFR-EGFP.

For initial docking, we excluded the Domain IV 'leg' so that docking was carried out using just the Domains I, II and III 'head' regions. We then used Cluspro to dock the entire extracellular domain against itself, with the added constraint that the residues identified by mutation studies to play a role in oligomerization (Val 526, Glu 527, Asn 528, Ile 545, Thr 548, Asn 554 and Ile 556) are at the interface. We manually filtered the ClusPro solutions using three criteria: (i) the C-terminal ends of both dimers must point towards to same plane, (ii) the rotation between the dimers must be small enough to permit the multimer to be extended while retaining connection to the same plane and (iii) documented sites of glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhen et al., 2003</xref>) should not be buried at the interface. Application of these filters yielded a family of 6 models that differed from each other only with respect to the tilt and rotation between two dimeric units.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Volker Dötsch) and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study of Huang et al. addresses the nature and importance of higher order EGFR complexes. The existence of these higher order complexes have been described previously but their function, existence, and significance have been questioned and ill defined. Part of the conundrum was due to our increased understanding of EGFR structure and function that has been gained since 2002. The field now has a detailed appreciation of extracellular and intracellular interactions that contribute to EGFR activation. However, the observation of higher order complexes complicated the interpretation of this elegant structural understanding. The present study enlightens the field as to the structural basis for these higher order complexes. In summary, this manuscript reports on some very important findings and will contribute to our basic understanding of EGFR signaling.</p><p>However, during the review several questions were raised that require revision of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The description of the modelling seems too long and should be shortened or moved in part to supplementary material. In addition, the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and Figure 12 are a concern. Although the authors stress that it is not based on detailed energy calculations, the model is too precise in what it states. Yet, given that it is not based on detailed energy calculations, it must certainly be inaccurate. It would be better to remove all but the bottom right cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>.</p><p>2) In experiments depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors subtract 3% as the baseline multimerization rate based on experiments with Claudin. It is not clear how this subtraction is done, but if there is no consideration of the error in the 3% value then the error in the value after subtraction is underestimated. Germane to that point the change in 2-step percentage from 3% to 1.5% when the V924R mutation is introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) appears well within the (perhaps too small) error and not persuasively significant. The conclusion that the asymmetric kinase dimer contributes to mediation of the &quot;preformed&quot; EGFR dimers thus does not seem justified. The effects of the V924R mutation on the increase in preformed dimers caused by Δ-arm, Δ-tether, and L834R mutations appears more robust, but it is a bit puzzling that V924R should have an effect on the Δ-arm and Δ-tethering as such mutations do not appear to result in higher activity of the receptor, which suggests the deletions results in an inactive dimer (Ogiso/Garrett/Schlessinger).</p><p>Similarly, is the difference in multistep events seen for TGFa (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and EGF (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) statistically significant? It seems to be as strong as some of the other changes reported.</p><p>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> lacks crucial controls. Only the IIIV/AARE has no influence, apparently suggesting that I545 and I556 can accommodate alanines. To strongly argue that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> identify a 'patch' involved in multimerization, mutations outside the patch that have no influence should be looked at.</p><p>4) The method used to assess EGFR autophosphorylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not allow assessment of whether cell surface expression of the mutants is a problem. Has this been looked at? If the mutants are impaired in cell surface expression, they will not be activated by EGF.</p><p>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> do not seem to be a compelling argument that 'multimerization affects proximal phosphorylation of the EGFR tail more strongly than distal phosphorylation'. To generalize like this, more sites need to be looked at. Other influences on multimerization should be assessed for the same effect too. For example, is there any reason that the region identified on domain IV could not simply be important for mediating clustering prior to endocytosis-and not be responsible for a stereospecific multimer?</p><p>Detection of phosphorylation is also based on assessing receptor phosphorylation in a transient expression system. Mass spectrometry data would be a more direct and convincing method to show the effect. Could stably expressing cell lines instead of transient expression be used?</p><p>Similarly, the arguments surrounding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> have to be clarified. What these data show is simply that loss of 'activator' function leads to loss of Y1173 phosphorylation. How does this translate into an argument that multimerization might be a mechanism for boosting phosphorylation of proximal and distal sites on the tail?</p><p>6) Likewise does dimerization arm deletion increases two-step bleaching events in any specific way, or is this a sign of aggregation. Does this form still bind EGF the same?</p><p>7) The specificity of the P-Tyr specific antibodies should be demonstrated using EGFR mutants Y955F, Y992F, Y1173F, Y1186F etc.</p><p>8) Could the GFP fusion partner alter the association/dissociation of EGFR? This is especially important as it pertains to the formation of the higher order complexes. Indeed the authors point out that their previous work with GCN4 fusions led to some unexpected associations. Could an experiment or two with antibody (Fab) Q-dots with non-GFP fused receptors be helpful?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14107.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In considering all of the points raised by the reviewers, we were struck by the importance of one issue that had not been addressed in our submitted manuscript, but was raised by the review. This issue concerned whether the mutations we had made had affected the surface display and trafficking of the receptor (Point No. 4 in the list of essential points, below). As the reviewers point out, if the mutations affect the surface expression of EGFR, then the reduction in EGF- induced activity would be difficult to interpret. We are pleased to report that we carried out new experiments that addressed this issue for one of the key mutations (denoted II/KK) for which we show a reduction in activity, and we demonstrate that there is no effect on surface expression of EGFR. Briefly, we made a construct of EGFR which has an HA tag at the N-terminus of the extracellular domain, and has the fluorescent protein Venus fused to the C-terminal end. We detected surface expression by addition of an HA-specific antibody to intact live cells. We then fixed the cells and examined them by fluorescence microscopy, and quantitated the ratio of surface-expressed EGFR to total EGFR (monitored by Venus fluorescence). There is no discernible difference in this ratio between wild-type EGFR and mutant EGFR. These data are now included in the discussion of the effects of Domain IV mutations on EGFR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Sean Peterson, who carried out these new experiments, is now included as a co-author of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Another new set of data and analysis concerns the pulsed-interleaved fluorescence cross- correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) measurements has been added to the revised manuscript. Additional PIE-FCCS data on the constructs reported in our original submission have been measured, and these data are shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> in the revised manuscript. In addition, diffusion constants have now been extracted from PIE-FCCS data, and are included as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. The mobility of each construct in the plasma membrane is directly measured with PIE-FCCS and is converted to an effective diffusion coefficient, D<sub>eff</sub>, for comparison. The diffusion coefficients of EGFR and EGFR-IIIV/KKRE before ligand stimulation are 0.60 ± 0.02 and 0.59 ± 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s respectively ( ± standard error). These values are consistent with monomeric, single-pass transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane (Marita et al., Biophys J, 2015, PMID: 26536270). Upon stimulation with EGF, the diffusion coefficient of EGFR-IIIV/KKRE drops to 0.52 ± 0.02 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>/s, consistent with a monomer-dimer transition. For wild-type EGFR, EGF stimulation causes the diffusion coefficient to drop to 0.36 ± 0.01 μm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup>/s. This drop is significantly more than seen in the mutant and consistent with the formation of multimers. Finally, the PIE- FCCS data have been displayed in an alternative way to help the reader understand these data better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, also shown below).</p><p>A detailed response to each of the comments of the Reviewers is given below. Text extracted from the review is shown in blue, and our responses are in black. We also provide a document in which changes made to the original manuscript are highlighted.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The description of the modelling seems too long and should be shortened or moved in part to supplementary material. In addition, the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and Figure 12 are a concern. Although the authors stress that it is not based on detailed energy calculations, the model is too precise in what it states. Yet, given that it is not based on detailed energy calculations, it must certainly be inaccurate. It would be better to remove all but the bottom right cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>.</italic></p><p>In response to this comment we have moved Figure 12A (results of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations) to supplemental material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We feel that it is important to retain one illustration of a molecular model for the multimers in the main figures, otherwise we worry that our arguments will be difficult to follow. We have therefore retained <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A and B</xref> in the main figures. Note that these are “collages” of actual crystal structures (or NMR structures) of the components that are connected together in a hypothetical way. The detail arises from the high resolution of the underlying component structures. The cartoon for multimerization that was originally Figure 12B is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>. The original Figure 12—figure supplement 1 has been moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s4">Figure 11—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>While we agree that the modeling we have done is “coarse”, and not much removed from packing physical models together to determine shape complementarity, we feel that it is better to retain the full description in the main body of the paper, so that readers can better assess what we have done. We worry that if we move this to Supplemental Material then the nuances of the modeling risk getting lost.</p><p><italic>2) In experiments depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors subtract 3% as the baseline multimerization rate based on experiments with Claudin. It is not clear how this subtraction is done, but if there is no consideration of the error in the 3% value then the error in the value after subtraction is underestimated. Germane to that point the change in 2-step percentage from 3% to 1.5% when the V924R mutation is introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) appears well within the (perhaps too small) error and not persuasively significant. The conclusion that the asymmetric kinase dimer contributes to mediation of the &quot;preformed&quot; EGFR dimers thus does not seem justified. The effects of the V924R mutation on the increase in preformed dimers caused by Δ-arm, Δ-tether, and L834R mutations appears more robust, but it is a bit puzzling that V924R should have an effect on the Δ-arm and Δ-tethering as such mutations do not appear to result in higher activity of the receptor, which suggests the deletions results in an inactive dimer (Ogiso/Garrett/Schlessinger).</italic> </p><p><italic>Similarly, is the difference in multistep events seen for TGFa (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and EGF (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) statistically significant? It seems to be as strong as some of the other changes reported.</italic> </p><p>We did make the appropriate adjustments to the estimated errors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that the effect of the V924R mutation on wild-type and mutant EGFR (without EGF) is unexpected. This is an interesting issue, but is not really relevant to the multimerization of EGFR in the presence of EGF. We have therefore deleted the entire discussion of the effects of the V924R mutation on EGFR without EGF. Panels D, E, F and G of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> have been removed.</p><p><italic>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> lacks crucial controls. Only the IIIV/AARE has no influence, apparently suggesting that I545 and I556 can accommodate alanines. To strongly argue that the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> identify a 'patch' involved in multimerization, mutations outside the patch that have no influence should be looked at.</italic> </p><p>We agree that we have not really restricted the potential interaction region to a “patch” that is clearly defined, because we have analyzed relatively few mutations. We have changed the language in the paper as follows:</p><p>The section heading has been changed to: “Identification of residues in Domain IV that are necessary for EGFR multimerization”, from “Identification of a region […]”. We have removed the use of the word “patch” in this section, focusing instead on the identification of residues that have an effect on multimerization. We end this section with a new sentence: “We note that we have tested only a limited set of mutations, and that therefore our list of residues within a putative interfacial region is likely to be incomplete.”</p><p>In terms of a “control”, we point out, as the reviewer recognizes, that the IIIV/AARE mutation, in Domain IV, does not reduce multimerization substantially. Likewise, mutation of the dimerization arm also behaves similarly. Thus, not all mutations in the extracellular module decrease multimerization.</p><p>We agree that a much more exhaustive set of mutations is required in order to gain confidence that we have indeed defined the full extent of the interfacial patch. The experimental tests of multimerization that we employ are very time consuming. Since receiving the reviews we have analyzed two additional mutations using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte single molecule assay. The first is a single point mutation (Lys 454 to Glu) in Domain III, at a location predicted to be at the interface between the ligand-bound heads of extracellular dimers. This results in a reduction in multimerization (from ~46% in wild type to ~26% in the mutant; see Figure below). We also tested a mutation at the C-terminal tip of Domain IV, in a region close to where the dimerization arm is docked in the autoinhibited conformation of the ligand-free extracellular domain. This mutation (Leu 595 to Arg) also results in a reduction in multimerization (to ~16%). This reduction cannot be accounted for by the dimer-dimer interfaces in our model. While we do not understand the origin of this effect, we note that the C-terminal tip of Domain IV is close to the transmembrane helices, which we have shown to be important for multimerization.</p><p>Our feeling is that without a large number of such mutations we cannot substantially advance our understanding of the multimers, so we prefer to hold these results for a later study rather than include them in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The method used to assess EGFR autophosphorylation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> does not allow assessment of whether cell surface expression of the mutants is a problem. Has this been looked at? If the mutants are impaired in cell surface expression, they will not be activated by EGF.</italic> </p><p>This is an extremely important point. We have now demonstrated conclusively that there is no difference in surface expression of the II/KK mutant EGFR, which shows reduced activity, as described in the opening paragraph above. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, and the discussion in paragraph three, subsection “Functional role of multimerization in EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling” of the revised manuscript. We thank the reviewers for pointing out this important issue.</p><p><italic>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> do not seem to be a compelling argument that 'multimerization affects proximal phosphorylation of the EGFR tail more strongly than distal phosphorylation'. To generalize like this, more sites need to be looked at.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is too strong to say that proximal sites are affected more strongly than distal sites. Throughout the manuscript, we have taken care to remove such statements. For example, in the revised manuscript, we now say: “These mutations reduce autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of EGFR and attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which is recruited by EGFR.”, where previously we said: “These mutations reduce EGFR autophosphorylation in mammalian cells, particularly for sites in the C-terminal tail that are proximal to the kinase domain, and they also attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which binds to a proximal site.”</p><p>We now say: “Each of three mutants show reduced phosphorylation of both sites compared to wild-type.”, where previously we said: “Each of three mutants show reduced phosphorylation of both sites compared to wild-type, with the effect being more pronounced for the proximal site (Tyr 992).”</p><p><italic>Other influences on multimerization should be assessed for the same effect too. For example, is there any reason that the region identified on domain IV could not simply be important for mediating clustering prior to endocytosis-and not be responsible for a stereospecific multimer?</italic> </p><p>We do not believe that endocytosis-related clustering is a component of the multimerization. We observe no multimer in the absence of ligand, so the continual internalization and recycling that the receptor undergoes in the absence of EGF is not responsible for the multimerization. When we add EGF to a kinase dead EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), we still observe multimers. So the multimerization does not require an active response to endocytosis machinery (e.g., through phosphorylation). Thus, we believe that the multimerization is a direct structural response of the receptor, without involving downstream factors. We do agree that we have not demonstrated that the multimerization is stereospecific. We now state that this is the case in the revised manuscript. At the beginning of the section on modeling we now say:</p><p>“Also, the limited set of mutations we have made does not allow us to conclude definitively that the residues that we have identified as being important are responsible for a direct and stereospecific interaction between dimers. Thus, the models should be considered as structural hypotheses that await rigorous experimental tests.”</p><p><italic>Detection of phosphorylation is also based on assessing receptor phosphorylation in a transient expression system. Mass spectrometry data would be a more direct and convincing method to show the effect. Could stably expressing cell lines instead of transient expression be used?</italic> </p><p>The activity of EGFR is dependent on the surface density of EGFR. As we have shown in detail in two previous publications (Endres et al., Cell, 2013, PMID: 23374349 and Kovacs et al., MCB, 2015, PMID: 26124280), by measuring both the expression level and the activity of the receptor, by FACS or single-cell microscopy, the use of transient transfection generates very rich datasets.</p><p>For simplicity, in this paper we select a narrow level of expression for which to report the activity – this is quite different from whole-cell Western blots, where the entire expression range is collapsed into a single measurement. Thus, in effect, our data are more akin to results obtained with stable transfection, with the advantage that we can readily choose the expression level for which we analyze the data. For the data shown in the paper, we chose an expression window just at the point where the surface expression of EGFR flattens with increasing total expression (for both wild type and mutant EGFR). This gives us readings at a level of expression where the signal to noise is high, but below a point where overexpression saturates the membrane trafficking machinery (this effect can be seen in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, which shows surface expression of wild-type and mutant EGFR).</p><p>Regarding mass spectrometry, we agree that this could be more quantitative, but the experiments that would be needed to acquire accurate and quantitative data would introduce a whole new set of experimental development that we feel is beyond the scope of the present work. We agree that this would be a fruitful avenue for future experimentation.</p><p><italic>Similarly, the arguments surrounding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> have to be clarified. What these data show is simply that loss of 'activator' function leads to loss of Y1173 phosphorylation. How does this translate into an argument that multimerization might be a mechanism for boosting phosphorylation of proximal and distal sites on the tail?</italic> </p><p>Since loss of activator function leads to loss of 1173 phosphorylation, we reasoned that in a multimer, where the majority of kinases are “activators”, phosphorylation would be boosted. We have modified the text in paragraph ten, subheading “Functional role of multimerization in EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream signaling” of the revised manuscript to clarify this reasoning.</p><p><italic>6) Likewise does dimerization arm deletion increases two-step bleaching events in any specific way, or is this a sign of aggregation. Does this form still bind EGF the same?</italic> </p><p>The nature of the two-step bleaching events we observed for EGFR and variants, in the absence of EGF, is a very interesting issue, and we would like to study this further in the future.</p><p>For the dimerization arm deletion construct, we observed increased two-step bleaching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), without seeing any sign of multistep bleaching events in the absence of EGF. When we made additional mutations at the asymmetric kinase dimer interface in this dimerization arm deletion construct, we observed a reduction of the two-step bleaching events. This suggests that these two-step bleaching events are unlikely to result from non-specific protein aggregation. We reasoned that the increased two-step bleaching events we observed for the dimerization arm deletion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the other domain IV tether deletion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) are a consequence of released autoinhibition, which converts the extracellular domain to a more extended conformation that does not impede dimerization. Note, however, that we have removed discussion of the nature of the ligand-independent dimerization from the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have not studied the binding property of the dimerization arm deletion construct. Since this matter is somewhat outside the main focus of the paper, we reserve this for future study. Mark Lemmon’s group has studied the effects of various EGFR extracellular domain mutations on EGF binding in the isolated extracellular domain, and they find a minimal effect due to the dimerization arm mutations (Dawson et al., MCB, 2005, PMID:16107719 and Dawson et al., Structure, 2007, PMID: 17697999).</p><p><italic>7) The specificity of the P-Tyr specific antibodies should be demonstrated using EGFR mutants Y955F, Y992F, Y1173F, Y1186F etc.</italic> </p><p>We have studied this carefully and reported the results in a previous publication (Kovacs et al., MCB, 2015, PMID: 26124280). Based on this study we chose antibodies against Tyr 992 and Tyr 1173 for use in this paper, because they are the most specific anti-EGFR phosphotyrosine antibodies.</p><p><italic>8) Could the GFP fusion partner alter the association/dissociation of EGFR? This is especially important as it pertains to the formation of the higher order complexes. Indeed the authors point out that their previous work with GCN4 fusions led to some unexpected associations. Could an experiment or two with antibody (Fab) Q-dots with non-GFP fused receptors be helpful?</italic> </p><p>Since antibodies bind to the surface of the extracellular domain, they may perturb the multimerization in ways that are difficult to predict. For this reason, we have avoided this approach. The FCCS experiments show that EGFP mutant used in these studies on its own does not dimerize to an appreciable extent.</p></body></sub-article></article>
