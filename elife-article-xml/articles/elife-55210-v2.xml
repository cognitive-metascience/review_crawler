This multi-vesicular release (MVR) occurs at most synapses, but its spatiotemporal properties are unknown. Nanoscale-resolution detection of individual release events in hippocampal synapses revealed unprecedented heterogeneity among vesicle release sites within a single AZ, with a gradient of release probability decreasing from AZ center to periphery. Parallel to this organization, MVR events preferentially overlap with uni-vesicular release (UVR) events at sites closer to an AZ center. Pairs of fusion events comprising MVR are also not perfectly synchronized, and the earlier event tends to occur closer to AZ center. The spatial features of release sites and MVR events are similarly tightened by buffering intracellular calcium. These observations revealed a marked heterogeneity of release site properties within individual AZs, which determines the spatiotemporal features of MVR events and is controlled, in part, by non-uniform calcium elevation across the AZ.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>presynaptic function</kwd><kwd>multi-vesicular release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS111596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klyachko</surname><given-names>Vitaly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Release site heterogeneity represents a previously unknown level of structural and functional organization within individual active zones in central synapses, which determines the spatiotemporal dynamics of multi-vesicular release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Information transmission in the brain critically relies on the number of vesicles released in response to each action potential. Not surprisingly, there have been several major efforts to model this process in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rotman et al., 2011</xref>). Although the initial hypothesis was that, at most, only a single vesicle is released by a given synapse in response to an action potential (i.e., uni-vesicular release (UVR)), we now know that two or more vesicles can be released in response to a single action potential, even within the same synaptic bouton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>). This phenomenon has been named multi-vesicular release (MVR). Indeed, MVR is a ubiquitous release mechanism, occurring at both small and large central synapses throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christie and Jahr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foster et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oertner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rudolph et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taschenberger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tong and Jahr, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wadiche and Jahr, 2001</xref>). Because the vast majority of small central synapses contain only a single active zone (AZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schikorski and Stevens, 1999</xref>), it follows that individual AZs must be capable of supporting both UVR and MVR.</p><p>MVR has been suggested to serve a wide range of functions, including enhancing synaptic reliability, controlling synaptic integration, enhancing efficient information transmission by complex spikes, and inducing synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rudolph et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite the prevalence and functional significance of MVR, the regulatory mechanisms and spatiotemporal organization of MVR events within individual synaptic AZs are poorly understood. Indeed, we know relatively little about the functional organization of vesicle release within the AZ in general—be it related to UVR or MVR events—although findings of nanoscale co-clustering of presynaptic docking factors and vesicle release machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bademosi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glebov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>) have underscored the idea that vesicles are released from relatively stable ‘release sites’. Progress toward this end is hampered by the fact that the AZ is extremely small and thus beyond the resolution limits of conventional experimental approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schikorski and Stevens, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we were able to overcome this limitation by developing a nanoscale imaging modality that is capable of resolving the locations of individual vesicle release events in active hippocampal synapses in culture with ~27 nm precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). Using these tools, we uncovered the presence of multiple, distinct release sites within individual AZs, at which vesicle fusion occurs repeatedly in response to action potentials. Having demonstrated our ability to identify individual release sites reliably, we now ask a series of questions related to the organization and regulation of these sites within a single AZ: do all sites support vesicle fusion involved in both UVR and MVR events? What controls the relative probability that a site is involved in an MVR event? And, at a more fundamental level: is the probability of release uniform across all sites?</p><p>To address these questions, we applied nanoscale imaging tools to detect and study the organizational principles of UVR and MVR events at individual hippocampal synapses in dissociated neuronal cultures. Our results reveal that release site characteristics are highly heterogeneous, even within a single AZ. Specifically, we find that the closer a site is to the center of the AZ, the higher its release probability. Interestingly, this gradient of release site properties also underlies the spatial and temporal organization of vesicle release involved in MVR events. This gradient of release site properties and the spatial features of MVR are also similarly affected by buffering intracellular calcium. Together, our analyses suggest a new level of functional organization of the AZ that is determined by the heterogeneous landscape of release site properties. The spatiotemporal organization of MVR is shaped by the gradient of release site properties across individual AZs and depends, in part, on the non-uniform elevation of calcium across the AZ following an action potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Detection of MVR events</title><p>To detect MVR events and resolve their locations in hippocampal synapses, we took advantage of a nanoscale imaging approach that we recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>), combined with the use of a pH-sensitive indicator, pHluorin, which was targeted to the vesicle lumen via vGlut1 (vGlut1-pHluorin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>). vGlut1-pHluorin was expressed in cultures of excitatory hippocampal neurons using lentiviral infection at DIV3.

Our current data are consistent with that finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and see 'Materials and methods' for details). In addition, visual examination of these recordings revealed a subset of events that involve the simultaneous fusion of two vesicles in the same bouton following a single action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To identify these double fusion events (i.e., MVR) automatically and to determine their precise spatial locations, we used a well-established mixture-model fitting approach with two fixed-width Gaussians to approximate the point spread function (PSF)-like images of each vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomann et al., 2003</xref>).

Over 90% of fusion event pairs that are involved in MVR were separated by less than 600 nm. The chances of misidentifying two events in the neighboring boutons as occurring in the same bouton is negligible, as we have previously used 3D FIB-SEM reconstruction of our neuronal cultures to show that the average bouton-to-bouton distance is an order of magnitude larger than the average event-to-event distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). At the other end of the spectrum, it is important to note that this mixture-model fitting approach does not reliably fit the subset of double fusion events that occur so close as to be nearly overlapping. We examine this subset of unresolved MVR events using additional computational tools that are presented in the subsequent sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MVR events preferentially occur at release sites with higher release probability</title><p>We first asked how the incidence of MVR is distributed in the synapse population. Previous studies suggest that the synaptic release probability is a strong predictor of a propensity for MVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christie and Jahr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, we know that AZ size is a major determinant of synaptic release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matz et al., 2010</xref>). We thus explored the relationship between AZ size (see 'Materials and methods' for details) and the probability of observing MVR events at individual synaptic boutons. We also used the number of release sites per bouton as another, functional measure of synaptic release probability. Individual release sites within each bouton were defined using a hierarchical clustering algorithm with a cluster diameter of 50 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>).

across the synapse population, we were interested in whether there is similar variability among release sites within the same synaptic bouton. In other words, are all release sites within a single bouton equally likely to support vesicle fusion involved in both UVR and MVR events or are there specific characteristics of individual release sites that make them more or less likely to support one type of fusion event over the other? We looked at the extent of release site overlap between MVR and UVR events, defining it as a ‘full overlap’ when <italic>both</italic> release sites involved in MVR were also observed as release sites during UVR events, ‘partial overlap’ when only one release site involved in MVR also served as a release site during UVR, and ‘no overlap’ when neither release site involved in an MVR event was observed as a release site for a UVR event during our observation period. We found full overlap with UVR for ~15% of MVR events, whereas ~47% of MVR events showed partial overlap, and ~38% showed no overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These results did not depend on the specific definition of release sites because we obtained essentially the same breakdown using proximity analysis of individual events without defining release sites using any clustering algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>This observation suggests that release sites can be involved in both UVR and MVR events, but that the likelihood that they are involved in one versus the other is not uniform (explored in more detail below). We also note that because we can only observe release events over a relatively short period (limited to 120 s by natural synapse displacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>]), our results cannot be interpreted as indicating that there are some specialized release sites that <italic>only</italic> support MVR or UVR. MVR is a relatively low probability event (~10% of release events are MVR under our experimental conditions), making much longer recordings necessary to determine whether sites are never involved in MVR; indeed, infinitely long recordings are required to answer this question definitively.</p><p>To understand better why some sites may be more likely to support MVR events than others, for each of the two release sites involved in an MVR event, we determined the probability that the same release site is also involved in one or more UVR events during our observation period. We found that this probability was location-dependent: of the two release sites involved in a given MVR event, the one more proximal to the AZ center was significantly more likely to be also involved in UVR events than the more distal site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the probability that a given release site was involved in both UVR and MVR events formed a gradient from AZ center to periphery, supporting the notion of heterogeneity of release site properties across a single AZ.</p><p>To further examine this notion, we quantified the release probability at each release site (P<sub>r</sub>-site) based on the number of release events detected during the 120 s observation period. We then compared P<sub>r</sub>-site separately for each of the two sites involved in the MVR event to other release sites (i.e., those involved only in UVR events) located equidistantly from the AZ center in the same bouton (i.e. within a ± 25 nm band, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We observed that both release sites engaged in an MVR event had a significantly higher release probability than other equidistant, non-MVR-involved release sites in the same bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We also observed more general patterns among release sites within a given AZ, including those involved in UVR, MVR, or both. First, release sites were highly heterogeneous in terms of release probability, which varied ~5 fold among release sites within the same AZ during the observation time (P<sub>r</sub>-site range [0.008–0.042]). Second, we observed a spatial gradient of P<sub>r</sub>-site, which decayed with distance from the AZ center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these findings provide evidence of a marked heterogeneity of release site properties within the individual AZs, characterized by a gradient of P<sub>r</sub>-site from the AZ center to the periphery. These results further suggest that, in addition to the radial distribution of release probability, release sites that have a higher propensity for MVR are characterized by a higher release probability than other sites equidistant to the AZ center.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The spatiotemporal features of resolved MVR events are generalizable to MVR events that cannot be resolved</title><p>The well-separated MVR events analyzed above had sufficient spatial separation to allow each event in the pair to be individually localized (resolved events). However, because the AZ is very small overall, a significant proportion of MVR events involve vesicle release at sites within a sub-diffraction distance from one another. Such unresolved events would not have been captured in our analyses thus far. Therefore, we next asked to what extent the findings relating to resolvable MVR events could be generalized to unresolved MVR events.</p><p>To identify unresolved MVR events, we took advantage of the quantal nature of vesicular release to distinguish MVR from UVR events based on amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). At 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>+2</sup> and at 37°C, over 90% of the events in hippocampal neurons are UVR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). Thus, we analyzed individually each synaptic bouton with a minimum of five fusion events to determine the mean and intrasynaptic variability (standard deviation) of quantal event amplitude. We then set the threshold for MVR event detection at two standard deviations above the mean quantal event amplitude for that bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). On the basis of this analysis, we estimated that in our studies, MVR events represent ~9% of all release events. Of these events, we were able to robustly identify ~50% as MVR based solely on their amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This approach does not rely on spatial information, and thus is complementary to the mixture-model fitting approach that we used above; the MVR event populations that were identified by these two approaches are partially overlapping (~20%; data not shown).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal features of resolved MVR events generalize to unresolved MVR events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MVR (red) and UVR (black) events were separated on the basis of the event amplitude.

The ratio δ<sub>1</sub>/δ<sub>2</sub>–1 (asymmetry score) represents an estimate of asymmetry of the double-event image, which correlates with the distance between the two sub-diffraction events forming the image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeCenzo et al., 2010</xref>). Distributions of asymmetry scores for the single and double events indicate that they represent two distinct populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and thus validate our approach to robustly distinguish unresolved MVR events from UVR events.</p><p>We then examined the spatiotemporal features of the unresolved MVR events. First, we observed that unresolved MVR events preferentially have smaller asymmetry scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and thus tend to occur at smaller separation distances, similarly to the resolved MVR events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we examined the localization of unresolved MVR events relative to the AZ center/periphery. We observed that more asymmetrical (more spatially separated) events occurred closer to the AZ center, whereas symmetrical events tend to be more peripheral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, top). An equivalent calculation for the resolved MVR events (see figure legend for details) showed a very similar relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, bottom), supporting the notion that the two subpopulations of MVR events have similar spatial properties. Finally, as described for the resolved MVR events above, we examined the extent to which release sites were used for either MVR or UVR, or both. Only a subpopulation of strongly overlapping MVR events (asymmetry score &lt;0.5) were used in this analysis because these highly symmetrical events could be well-approximated by a single symmetrical Gaussian fit, making this analysis comparable to that of the resolved MVR events. The extent of overlap of MVR and UVR events at individual release sites was comparable between unresolved and resolved MVR events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1F</xref>), with overlap more likely occuring closer to the AZ center in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1G</xref>). These data suggest that unresolved and resolved MVR events have comparable spatial features. Thus, our observations can likely be generalized across the entire population of MVR events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Temporal desynchronization of release events comprising MVR</title><p>We next asked whether there is also heterogeneity within the temporal properties of MVR events.

Upon initial inspection of resolved MVR events, we noticed that one of the two fusion events comprising an MVR is often noticeably larger in amplitude than the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In our experimental approach, action potentials are synchronized with the beginning of the frame acquisition; thus, considering the quantal nature of fusion events, we hypothesized that this difference in amplitude reflects imperfect synchronization between the two release events (if one release event occurs later in the recording frame, we would expect to collect a smaller number of photons for this delayed event, i.e., smaller amplitude) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal organization of release events comprising an MVR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample image (<italic>right</italic>) and intensity profile (<italic>left</italic>) of an MVR event with noticeable difference in intra-event amplitude.

We observed that the larger amplitude event (assumed to occur first) was more likely to occur closer to the AZ center than the smaller one in the pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Accordingly, the average distance to the AZ center was significantly shorter for the larger amplitude event relative to the event with the smaller amplitude within the pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Most importantly, this amplitude difference was correlated with the distance between the two events within the pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), such that larger amplitude differences were associated with larger separation distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This spatial organization parallels the gradient of release site release probability from the AZ center to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, and see below). We note that a component of the amplitude differences can arise from the uncertainty in determining the fusion event amplitude; we estimated this uncertainty to be ~10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the uncertainty in our measurements may account for the amplitude differences that we measured for the most closely spaced MVR events, but it does not account for the differences that we measured for MVR events that are further apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, the positive correlation between the amplitude difference and the spatial separation of the two events comprising MVR cannot be explained by random noise or by measurement uncertainty. We thus interpret our results as indicating that the amplitude difference between the two fusion events that comprise an MVR, at least in part, reflects imperfect synchronization.</p><p>Given the observed amplitude differences within the release pairs comprising an MVR event, and the acquisition duration of 40 ms per frame, we estimated the maximal time difference between the two events comprising MVR to be less than ~4 ms for the majority of MVR events in our recordings. We note that this value overestimates the true extent of desynchronization because, as noted above, a component of the amplitude difference arises from uncertainty in the amplitude measurement itself. Thus, we estimate the maximal time delay to be ~2 ms if the measurement uncertainty is factored in. These values are in a close agreement with previous reports, which found desynchronization within individual MVR events to be in the range of 1–5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auger and Marty, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rudolph et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We also considered the possibility that factors other than desynchronization, such as differences in vesicle size or cleft pH along the AZ plane, contribute to the difference in amplitude within MVR events and its spatial arrangement relative to the AZ center. We used Large-Area Scanning Electron Microscopy (LaSEM) micrographs of our cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maschi et al., 2018</xref>) to determine the relationship between the size of vesicles positioned near the AZ (within 100 nm, defined previously as tethered vesicles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maschi et al., 2018</xref>) and their position relative to the AZ center. Vesicle diameter did not exhibit any measurable change as a function of distance from the AZ center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), indicating that the amplitude differences that we observed are not due to systematic differences in vesicle size. We next examined cleft pH at different locales within the AZ. The peak amplitude of vGlut1-pHluorin signal during individual fusion events is determined in large part by the cleft pH. Thus, we measured peak pHluorin signal as a function of distance to AZ center. The vGlut1-pHluorin signal amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) did not measurably change as a function of distance from the AZ center, suggesting that a gradient of cleft pH is unlikely to explain the differences in MVR event amplitude. Finally, we note that in our imaging experiments, dozens of synapses are positioned in random orientation and are recorded simultaneously. Thus, in any given recording, some boutons have the center of the AZ in focus, whereas in others, only the periphery is in focus, and so on for all possible configurations in-between. Thus, there is no bias towards any one configuration or tilt of the AZ relative to the imaging plane that can lead to systematically larger fusion event amplitude at the AZ center versus that in the periphery. Indeed, this notion is highlighted by the fact that, in our measurements, the average release event amplitude is indistinguishable between events located at the AZ center versus those in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <italic>insert</italic>). Thus, we conclude that the observed differences in amplitude within the release pair comprising an MVR event are unlikely to result from a bias in AZ position relative to the imaging plane.</p><p>In summary, our results support the notion that vesicle release associated with MVR is desynchronized and follows a specific spatial organization with respect to the center of the AZ. Specifically, the first of the two events in the MVR pair is preferentially located closer to the AZ center. This spatial organization of MVR events parallels our finding that release probability and the probability that a release site is involved in an MVR also follows a center-to-periphery spatial gradient.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Double events do not result from asynchronous release overlapping temporally with synchronous events</title><p>Given the intrinsically limited temporal resolution of our imaging tools, we must consider the possibility that the double events that we observed arose not from MVR, but rather from asynchronous release events generated by preceding stimulation and temporarily overlapping with UVR. We addressed this possibility in five complementary ways.</p><p>First, if the double events do in fact arise from overlap of synchronous release with asynchronous events generated by preceding stimulation, the probability of observing such double events should increase over the course of the stimulus train. However, we detected no increase in the double event probability during the stimulus train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In fact, the probability of observing double events is slightly higher for the first stimulus, for which there is no preceding stimulation. These results argue against any significant contribution of asynchronous release to the observed double-release events.</p><p>Second, synchronous release events, including those associated with MVR, are time-locked with the stimulus and are acquired for the entire duration of the frame. Thus, the amplitude distribution of MVR events should appear as a single Gaussian peak centered at ~2 q value (twice the amplitude of a UVR event), as indeed is the case in our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, asynchronous release is, by definition, not time-locked with the stimulus and thus occurs randomly at any time during the acquisition frame. As a result, single asynchronous release events are acquired for a wide range of durations that are less than a full frame, and thus must have a skewed non-Gaussian amplitude distribution shifted towards smaller values than those produced by a full-size synchronous event. We confirmed that this is the case using asynchronous events that we recorded in 3 mM Sr<sup>2+</sup> in otherwise identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the double events in our recordings are synchronous events and have properties that are distinct from those of asynchronous release.</p><p>Third, we compared the spatiotemporal properties of the double events in our recordings with that of asynchronous release events recorded in 3 mM Sr<sup>2+</sup>. The asynchronous release events detected in the same frame in the same bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) did not exhibit the spatiotemporal patterns evident for the double events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The fact that the spatiotemporal properties of the double events are distinct from those of asynchronous events supports our conclusion that the double events in fact reflect instances of MVR.</p><p>Fourth, the synchronicity of double events in our recordings is relatively high, arguing against a significant contribution from asynchronous release. As mentioned above, we estimate that the double events in our recordings are synchronous with the stimulation within a few milliseconds. This result is consistent with previous reports of MVR, and aligns with the accepted definition of MVR events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auger and Marty, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rudolph et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we note that previous studies find minimal asynchronous release evoked by 1 Hz stimulation under nearly identical experimental conditions (37°C, 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raingo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, at least five complimentary lines of evidence strongly suggest that double events in our recordings do indeed reflect synchronous MVR events, with no significant contribution of asynchronous release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Spatiotemporal features of MVR events and release site properties are calcium-dependent</title><p>We next set out to explore the mechanistic origin of the spatial organization of MVR events relative to the AZ center. Our previous study suggested a possible role of calcium in the spatial regulation of release site properties because we observed that release site usage is regulated in an activity-dependent manner, such that site usage shifts towards the periphery during trains of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). Previous studies have also found that the propensity for MVR events increases as extracellular calcium levels increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leitz and Kavalali, 2011</xref>). However, whether calcium regulates the spatiotemporal organization of MVR events and/or the properties of the release sites remains unknown. To test this possibility, we pre-incubated neurons with a cell-permeable calcium chelator EGTA-AM (30 µm) for 20 min. EGTA does not directly affect vesicle release because it is too slow to buffer rapid calcium rise near voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), but it is effective in buffering the ensuing slower calcium elevation caused by diffusion. We observed several effects of EGTA on the spatiotemporal distribution of MVR events. First, EGTA affected MVR event desynchronization: although the amplitudes of the two fusion events comprising MVR were still different, the difference no longer depended on their separation distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; N = 225 synapses, from 57 dishes from 11 independent cultures). Second, in the presence of EGTA, a larger proportion of MVR events occurred at shorter intra-event distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), that is, pairs of release events comprising MVR were more likely to be closer to each other in the presence of EGTA. In addition, the average distances from both events in the MVR pair to the AZ center were significantly shortened in the presence of EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, calcium buffering causes MVR events to occur at shorter separation distances and more proximal to the AZ center. However, the preferential localization of the larger (earlier) event in the MVR pair closer to the AZ center was still observed in the presence of EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These effects of buffering calcium diffusion with EGTA suggest that several major spatiotemporal features of MVR events are determined, in part, by calcium diffusion following an action potential.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal features of MVR events and release site properties are calcium-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of EGTA on the correlation between the spatial separation and amplitude difference between two events comprising an MVR.

Interestingly, buffering intraterminal calcium had a larger effect on more central release sites with higher P<sub>r</sub>-site values than on the more peripheral sites with lower P<sub>r</sub>-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results are in line with our earlier findings that the release site utilization shifts in the opposite direction (i.e. from AZ center towards periphery) when intraterminal calcium is elevated during high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). It is also consistent with the shorter separation distance within MVR events in the presence of EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and the shorter distances of MVR events to the AZ center in the presence of EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We took advantage of our ability to detect individual release events at central synapses with nanoscale precision to reveal three major findings: (i) release sites within the same AZ have highly heterogeneous properties, reflecting a gradient of release probability that decreases from the AZ center to periphery; (ii) MVR events exhibit non-uniform patterns of spatial and temporal organization that parallel the center-to-periphery organization of release site release probability; and (iii) both the gradient of release site properties and the spatiotemporal features of MVR are determined, in part, by the intraterminal calcium elevation following an action potential. Together, these results suggest that the non-uniform spatiotemporal dynamics of MVR events arise from the heterogeneity of release site properties within the individual AZs.</p><p>Our results suggest a model of MVR events in which the earlier of the two events in the MVR pair is similar to a UVR event, in that it occurs closer to the AZ center because release sites with higher release probability are localized preferentially more proximally to the AZ center. A second release event is then triggered occasionally with a short delay after the same action potential, at a more peripheral release site that is primed for release, in part due to calcium spread from the AZ center. This notion is supported by the effects of calcium buffering with EGTA and by our observations that both events in the MVR pair occur at sites with higher release probability than other equidistant sites in the same bouton. These observations reveal a previously unrecognized complex landscape of release probability within the AZ, which determines the spatial organization of MVR, and arises, in part, from a calcium concentration gradient across individual AZs.</p><p>What are the molecular underpinnings of release site heterogeneity? Recent nanoscopy studies indicate that release sites colocalize with nanoclusters of presynaptic docking factors, such as RIM1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), which have been suggested to control the recruitment and clustering of VGCCs at the AZ via the RIM binding protein RIM-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davydova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hibino et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). RIM1/2 nanoclusters are more likely to be located near the center of the AZ than in the periphery, suggesting a possible structural basis for the gradient of release site properties that we observed in this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the enrichment of many scaffold/docking proteins, including RIM, Bassoon, and Munc13, within their clusters is dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bademosi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glebov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smyth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the heterogeneity of release site properties may arise, in part, from variability in cluster architecture, such as cluster size or the relative enrichment of tethering/docking/priming factors.</p><p>An additional source of heterogeneity could be the fact that variable fractions of many critical components of release machinery, including VGCCs, Syntaxin-1, and Munc18, are mobile within the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glebov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smyth et al., 2013</xref>). For example, a large proportion (&gt;50%) of VGCCs are mobile in the AZ plane and this mobility is calcium-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2015</xref>). How VGCC mobility is spatially controlled has not been explored, but differential VGCC stability at the AZ center versus the periphery could account, in part, for the heterogeneity of the calcium rise across the bouton. VGCC mobility could also affect coupling between the channels and the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miki et al., 2017</xref>). This could explain the differential effect of EGTA on peripheral versus more central release sites.</p><p>Another possibility is that release site properties are determined, in part, by extrinsic factors. For example, release site refilling and vesicle retention at release sites depends on actin and myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maschi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, a non-homogeneous spatial distribution of actin cytoskeleton could contribute to differential release site usage across a bouton. In addition, calcium influx at least through some subtypes of VGCCs is also modulated by the balance of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by CDK5 and calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim and Ryan, 2013</xref>), and is directly regulated by a number of presynaptic proteins, such as ELKS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calloway et al., 2015</xref>). Although the precise factors that drive release site heterogeneity remain to be elucidated, our results reveal a previously unknown level of structural and functional organization among vesicle release sites within individual AZs, with specific implications for the spatiotemporal dynamics of MVR events.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neuronal cell cultures</title><p>Neuronal cultures were produced from rat hippocampus as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2012</xref>).

(2003)</xref> using in-built functions in uTrack software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Unresolved MVR events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were identified on the basis of the event amplitude. The single event amplitude and its variability were determined for each bouton individually. Photobleaching was accounted for by fitting the event intensity changes over time. The threshold for MVR event detection was set at two standard deviations above the mean single event amplitude determined individually for each bouton. Localization of unresolved MVR events was determined using an asymmetrical Gaussian model fit that was based on the minimization of the residuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Definition of release sites</title><p>Release sites were defined using a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on built-in functions in Matlab as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maschi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously compared the results of this clustering analysis, obtained with the experimentally observed distribution of fusion events, with the the same number of simulated events distributed randomly across the same AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). We found that randomly distributed release events result in a very different pattern of clustering than the experimentally observed events, and do not reproduce the observed features of real release event clusters. The observed clusters thus do not arise from a random distribution of release events, but rather represent a set of defined and repeatedly reused release sites within the AZs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Release site release probability</title><p>The release probability of individual release sites was calculated based on the number of release events detected per release site, divided by the duration of the observation period. UVR and MVR events were counted equivalently in this analysis, with each of the two release events comprising an MVR counted independently as a single release event at the two release sites that harbored them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>AZ dimensions and center</title><p>The AZ size was approximated on the basis of the convex hull encompassing all vesicle fusion events in a given bouton. This measurement is in a close agreement with the ultrastructural measurements of AZ dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maschi and Klyachko, 2017</xref>). AZ center was defined as the mean position of all fusion events in a given bouton.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Event proximity analysis</title><p>To determine the spatial overlap of MVR and UVR events, a proximity analysis was performed in which overlap was defined as having at least one UVR event occurring within 25 nm of an MVR event during the observation period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Synapse identification and analysis of vesicle diameter in LaSEM data</title><p>Three characteristic features were used for synapse identification: the presence of a synaptic vesicle cluster, the postsynaptic density, and the uniform gap between pre- and postsynaptic membranes. Distance to the AZ center was determined from the projection of the vesicle center position to the AZ plane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-7"><title>Fit regression models</title><p>Nonlinear and linear fit regression models were generated using built-in functions in Matlab.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>A minimum of five detected release events per bouton was required for all analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in Matlab. Statistical significance was determined using two-sample two-tailed t-test, paired t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, one-way analysis of covariance (ANOCOVA) or chi-square test, where appropriate. The number of experiments reported reflects the number of different cell cultures tested. The value of N is provided in the corresponding figure legends and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The statistical tests used to measure significance are indicated in each figure legend along with the corresponding significance level (p value). Data are reported as mean ± SEM and p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis of the samples was not blinded to condition. Randomization and sample size determination strategies are not applicable to this study and were not performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by the R35 NS111596 grant to VAK from NINDS.

vesicles release at central synapses. Using a deconvolution approach the authors can distinguish single-vesicle and multi-vesicle release events. The key finding is that release events are inhomogeneously distributed across the active zone. Multi-vesicle events share release sites with single-vesicle events, and are more frequent at the center of the AZ, where the release probability is highest. This study provides an unprecedented view of spatial aspects of synaptic vesicles release.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Spatiotemporal dynamics of multi-vesicular release is determined by heterogeneity of release sites in central synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers and editor were excited by the approach and some of the data. However, the study is at a relatively preliminary stage and it is unlikely that the additional data and analysis required can be accomplished in two months. The <italic>eLife</italic> policy is to reject a paper under these conditions.</p><p>The mechanisms of release have often been studied with electrophysiological methods. However, these methods average over synapses, washing out interesting fluctuations that are informative about the function of single synapses. Over the last two decades a variety of postsynaptic and presynaptic imaging methods have been developed to look at synaptic transmission at single synapses. Some methods have high SNR and can be used for studying synapses in intact tissue (i.e. calcium imaging), whereas others (e.g. synaptopHluorin) promise better time resolution and spatial resolution, but are typically used in reduced preparations. The current study uses imaging synaptopHluorin to track single release events at individual synapses. The paper reports multi-vesicular release, with the dominant release site closer to the center of the active zone (AZ). Release probability was highest at the center of the AZ and dropped off towards the edge. This gradient, and spatial features of MVR, were similarly tightened by buffering intracellular calcium.</p><p>This is a nice imaging paper on vesicle release at single synapses. All reviewers agreed that the study is potentially very interesting, but don't find the data set and quantification convincing in their current state.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper has to be reframed. The Introduction might have been appropriate in the late 1990's, when UVR (&quot;one bouton, one spike, one quantum&quot;) was a reasonable hypothesis based on prior work. Obviously, UVR was interesting in principle because it would pose serious biophysical riddles. If one vesicle releases, what signal tells other docked vesicles not to release? This signal would have to travel over microsecond timescales. The UVR came from work on the NMJ (misunderstood in this context) and, famously, the Mauthner cell. The original data has been reanalyzed and the statistical analysis has been questioned (some would say debunked, see Ninio, 2007, J. Neurophysiol.).</p><p>At central synapses support for UVR was always very spotty. In contrast, imaging studies with single synapse resolution tended to show MVR, as did many excellent electrophysiological studies using more indirect analyses. Yes, individual synapses often release single quanta, but this is because their overall release probability is often low. Under conditions of elevated release probability quanta are released based on the binomial model (e.g. Oertner et al., 2002; reviewed in Rudolph et al., 2015). It seems there is no evidence for UVR left and the whole thing is best forgotten except as a lesson in science sociology.</p><p>This means that MVR and UVR are likely the same process (operating independently at release sites/docked vesicles with different individual release probs). The authors have demonstrated that sites that host MVR could also harbor a UVR event later. This interchangeability actually suggests that they may be similarly regulated. In fact, none of the reviewers see support for a difference in spatial or temporal profile between MVR and UVR. Please analyze the distributions of time intervals for a UVR occurring at sites of an MVR, an MVR occurring at sites of an MVR, a UVR occurring at sites of a UVR, and a UVR occurring at sites of a UVR to see any difference. In Figure 1I the authors did not classify UVR into distal UVR and proximal UVR, as they did for MVR. This may have biased the comparison.</p><p>2) The authors concluded that they observed desynchronization of MVR events based on the ~8-10% difference in fluorescence intensity profiles of doublet events. However, from Figure 3A, the difference in the peak fluorescence intensities of two events is surely larger than 25%. Given 40 ms exposure time, it is hard to believe that ~4 ms of desynchronization generated such a large difference in fluorescence intensities. Moreover, if it is truly due to desynchronization, we would expect that the fluorescence intensity profiles of two events reversed over the next time point. Please explain.</p><p>3) Related to above. The second main finding is a desynchronization of MVR, with the more central release site leading and the peripheral site lagging by up to 4 ms. This evidence is indirect (via amplitude) and somewhat unconvincing (see above). How do we know that the amplitude difference is due to timing and not due to other factors (cleft pH, out-of-focus release, vesicle size etc.)?</p><p>As discussed in the 2017 Neuron paper, AZs may be tilted relative to the imaging plane, which could also affect the measured amplitude of distal events. Given these alternative explanations, it would be reassuring to have confirmatory evidence for delayed release events. A 4 ms delay is huge, twice the typical synaptic delay. Such delayed events, even if rare, should be readily visible in voltage clamp recordings. This is all a bit puzzling and needs to be explained better.</p><p>4) The authors argue that EGTA &quot;affected the MVR event de-synchronization&quot; and abolishes &quot;the preferential localization of the earlier event in the MVR pair closer to the AZ center&quot;. In both cases, a significant difference under control conditions (Figure 3E, Figure 3C) was found 'non-significant' in EGTA (Figure 4B, Figure 4D). However, the number of analyzed synapses was more than twice as high under control conditions, which could account for the higher significance found in the t-tests. To compare t-tests of identical power, it may be necessary to conduct additional EGTA experiments. More importantly, the correct comparison is testing for changes in the difference between smaller and larger with and without EGTA. As is, the analysis is statistically flawed. This likely requires more experiments and analysis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Spatiotemporal dynamics of multi-vesicular release is determined by heterogeneity of release sites in central synapses&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, while the reviewers and editors found the manuscript much improved, they felt that a complete rewrite would still be necessary, and therefore this version still falls short of what is needed. One reviewer stated:</p><p>“In my opinion, the results strongly suggest that active zones close to the center of a synapse have a higher release probability than more distal AZs. This is an important and interesting finding that should be simple to understand. Unfortunately, it is (still) obfuscated by their MVR/UVR site classification, which they now partially take back (&quot;our results cannot be interpreted to indicate that there are some specialized release sites that only support MVR or UVR&quot;). But the confusion already starts at Figure 1A, where a release site is labeled in red (for MVR) that has in fact released only a single vesicle. So while it makes sense to talk about UVR and MVR <italic>events</italic>, it is very confusing to talk about UVR and MVR <italic>sites</italic>, only to state at the end that they are probably not fundamentally different. (Since typically only a single MVR event was observed per bouton, meaningful single bouton statistics is not possible). What is needed is a complete rewrite of the manuscript, including a change in nomenclature and analysis strategy, not just the addition of some text blocks.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55210.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper has to be reframed.

We now state in the Introduction that:</p><p>“Although initially it was hypothesized that, at most, only a single vesicle can be released from a given synapse with each action potential (i.e. uni-vesicular release (UVR)), it is now widely accepted that two or more vesicles can fuse simultaneously in response to a single action potential in the same synaptic bouton, leading to the notion of multi-vesicular release (MVR) (Rudolph et al., 2015). […] Despite its prevalence, spatiotemporal organization of MVR within the synaptic active zone (AZ) and its regulation are poorly understood (Rudolph et al., 2015)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This means that MVR and UVR are likely the same process (operating independently at release sites/docked vesicles with different individual release probs).

This may have biased the comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important point and agree. We note that this concern is caused in a large part by a misunderstanding due to lack of clarity in the original version of our manuscript. We did indeed classify UVR into distal and proximal in Figure 1I, as we did for MVR, but we failed to note this clearly in the figure. We now clarify that this analysis was performed on MVR and UVR events equidistant to the AZ center (Figure 1H). In other words, for each MVR event pair, the proximal MVR site was compared only to the proximal UVR sites, and the distal MVR site was compared only to the distal UVR sites. These results show that the release sites that are more likely to harbour both UVR and MVR are characterized by higher release probability than other equidistant sites.</p><p>We also completely agree with the reviewers that our results do not indicate that there are specialized sites of UVR vs. MVR, but rather the same sites can harbor both types of events. In fact, our finding that MVR sites have higher release probability is based on observation that UVR events occur more frequently at the release sites at which MVR events are observed. We have now expanded the description of the results to clarify this point. We also stated in the Results that “our results cannot be interpreted to indicate that there are some specialized release sites that <italic>only</italic> support MVR or UVR”.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we also attempted to compare the distributions of time intervals of UVR and MVR events occurring at sites of UVR or MVR and vice versa. However, we came to realization that this analysis is not possible within our current approach because we cannot determine the distribution of time intervals between MVR events at any given release site. This is because the very low probability of observing MVR events, which is typically only 1-2 per bouton within the 120 sec observation window. As a result, MVR events were almost never observed at the same release site more than once in the same bouton during this time period, thus making analysis of inter-event intervals not feasible. We previously showed that intrinsic slow displacement of synaptic boutons precludes precise analysis of release event localization for much longer time periods, which is what would be required for such analysis.</p><p>In summary, we have revised the manuscript to include these points and to clarify that our data does not suggest that there are specialized sites of MVR vs UVR, but rather the same sites support both types of release. We further emphasize that it was not the intent of our study to contrast UVR vs MVR. Rather we believe that the critical finding is the highly heterogeneous properties of release sites within the individual AZs. The sites with higher release probability are located closer to the AZ center and are more likely to harbor both UVR and MVR events. The spatiotemporal features of MVR reflect this heterogeneity of release sites across individual AZs and depend, in part, on the non-uniform landscape of calcium elevation across the AZ following an action potential. Our analyses thus suggest a new level of structural and functional organization of release sites within individual AZs that determines the spatiotemporal dynamics of MVR. We have also revised the Introduction and Discussion of the manuscript to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors concluded that they observed desynchronization of MVR events based on the ~8-10% difference in fluorescence intensity profiles of doublet events. However, from Figure 3A, the difference in the peak fluorescence intensities of two events is surely larger than 25%.

Moreover, if it is truly due to desynchronization, we would expect that the fluorescence intensity profiles of two events reversed over the next time point. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these points and performed extensive additional experiments and analyses to determine origins of amplitude differences within MVR events, and to solidify our interpretation of these differences as evidence for desynchronization of MVR. Specifically:</p><p>a) Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we perform additional studies to demonstrate that amplitude differences within MVR events are not due to differences in vesicle size (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D) or changes in cleft pH (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). We also clarified in the text that due to the configuration of our experiments, the observed differences cannot arise simply from the tilt of AZs relative to the imaging plane. This is also evident in the observation that the average amplitude of UVR events is indistinguishable at the AZ center vs periphery (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, insert). These results are discussed in more detail in the response to point #3 below.</p><p>b) We performed extensive additional experiments to confirm that the observed scaling of the amplitude difference within the MVR events as a function of the intra-event separation is eliminated by EGTA-AM (and see response to point #4 below for more details).</p><p>c) We performed additional analyses to examine how much the uncertainty in determination of fusion event amplitude contributes to the observed amplitude differences within the MVR event pairs. We found that this uncertainty is comparable to the amplitude differences of the closely-spaced MVR events (~10%), but cannot account for the amplitude differences within MVR events with large separation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Moreover, the positive correlation between the spatial separation and amplitude difference of the two events comprising MVR cannot be explained by measurement uncertainty.</p><p>d) We clarified in the text that desynchronization of MVR events is a well established phenomenon, with several studies reporting MVR event desynchronization in the range of ~1-5ms in both excitatory and inhibitory central synapses (Auger et al., 1998; Auger and Marty, 2000; Crowley et al., 2007; Malagon et al., 2016; Rudolph et al., 2011). We also emphasized that our initial estimate for the maximal time difference within our double events of ~4ms is an overestimate because a component of the amplitude differences arise from measurement uncertainty. We provided a corrected upper bound estimate on the MVR desynchronization to be ~2ms, if the measurement uncertainty is factored in. These values are well within the range of 1-5ms reported previously for MVR event desynchronization in the above studies.</p><p>e) The reviewers pointed out that the fluorescence intensity profiles of two events are expected to reverse over the next time point if the differences are truly due to desynchronization. Indeed, we agree that this would be the case, but only if the dwell time of the fluorescent signal generated by the individual events is exactly the same for both events. However, unlike the precise initiation of fusion, the dwell time of individual events is highly variable, spanning from ultrafast (~150-250 ms), to fast (~5-12 s) to ultraslow (&gt;20 s) (Chanaday and Kavalali, 2018). A few initial milliseconds of desynchronization do not have any significant impact over such variability. Therefore there is no correspondence between the timing of the event start in one frame and the duration of observation of the same event in any subsequent frame.</p><p>f) The example shown in Figure 3A has a ~25% difference in amplitude within the MVR event and was chosen to highlight the differences in amplitude, which can be visually obscured by pixelation and noise. This example is reasonably representative of the differences observed for the far apart MVR events, but we can replace it with a different example if reviewers suggest it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to above. The second main finding is a desynchronization of MVR, with the more central release site leading and the peripheral site lagging by up to 4 ms.

A 4 ms delay is huge, twice the typical synaptic delay.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important point. As mentioned in the response to point #2 above, we performed extensive additional experiments to address the reviewer’s concerns. We provide more details of these experiments here:</p><p>a) Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we examined if amplitude differences within MVR events can arise from differences in vesicle size. We determine the vesicle size from the EM microscopy of our synapses in culture as a function of distance to the AZ center (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D). Vesicle size did not exhibit significant changes with distance to the AZ center (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Thus the amplitude differences within MVR events are not due to differences in vesicle size.</p><p>b) We also determined if amplitude differences within MVR events can arise from differences in the cleft pH at different locales of the AZ. If this is the case, changes in the cleft pH should similarly affect amplitudes of UVR and MVR events. Yet we did not detect any significant changes in the intensity of UVR events throughout the whole AZ (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Thus changes in cleft pH are unlikely to explain the differences in MVR event amplitude.</p><p>c) We clarified in the text that in our recordings dozens of synapses are positioned in random orientation and are recorded simultaneously. Some boutons have the center of the AZ in focus and others have the periphery, and yet others are positioned in all other possible configurations inbetween (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus there is no any systematic bias towards any one possible configuration or tilt of the AZ relative to the imaging plane that can lead to systematically larger fusion event amplitude at the AZ center vs. periphery. Indeed, this notion is highlighted by the fact that the average UVR event amplitude is invariable in our measurements, independently of the distance to the AZ center (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, insert). Thus the observed differences in MVR event amplitude are unlikely to result from tilt of AZ relative to the imaging plane.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the wide range of possible AZ positions relative to the focal plane.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55210-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Such delayed events, even if rare, should be readily visible in voltage clamp recordings.

We further emphasize that the novel observation in our study is not in the fact that MVR can be desynchronized, but in revealing a pattern of spatial organization within these MVR events relative to the AZ center, that is correlated with the gradient of release site properties and is regulated by calcium elevation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors argue that EGTA &quot;affected the MVR event de-synchronization&quot; and abolishes &quot;the preferential localization of the earlier event in the MVR pair closer to the AZ center&quot;. In both cases, a significant difference under control conditions (Figure 3E, Figure 3C) was found 'non-significant' in EGTA (Figure 4B, Figure 4D). However, the number of analyzed synapses was more than twice as high under control conditions, which could account for the higher significance found in the t-tests. To compare t-tests of identical power, it may be necessary to conduct additional EGTA experiments.

This likely requires more experiments and analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important point and absolutely agree. We performed the suggested additional experiments and have revised our statistical analyses as suggested. Specifically, the number of analyzed synapses is now 225 and 245 from 11 independent cultures each, for measurements with and without EGTA, respectively. We also corrected our initial statistical analyses and tested for changes in the slope of the dependence of the amplitude difference between smaller and larger events with and without EGTA, as reviewers suggested. We found that EGTA indeed significantly reduced it (Figure 4B). Similarly, we still observed that proportion of MVR events that had shorter intra-event separation increased significantly in the presence of EGTA (Figure 4C). Accordingly, the average distances from both events in the MVR pair to the AZ center were significantly shortened in the presence of EGTA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Thus calcium buffering causes MVR events to occur at shorter separation distances and more proximal to the AZ center. However, the larger event in the MVR pair was still localized closer to the AZ center in the presence of EGTA than the smaller one in the pair (Figure 4D). This is consistent with the observation that release sites with higher release probability are still localized closer to the AZ center in the presence of EGTA (Figure 4E) and that preferential utilization of more central release sites was exacerbated in the presence of EGTA (Figure 4E). We have revised Figure 4 and the description of these results accordingly.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, while the reviewers and editors found the manuscript much improved, they felt that a complete rewrite would still be necessary, and therefore this version still falls short of what is needed.

We made major revisions to the text and figures of the manuscript to address the reviewer’s criticism as follows:</p><p>1) We would like to clarify that the reviewer’s concern was in a large part caused by the lack of clarity in our description of the results, but not in the actual analyses themselves. Specifically, we did not classify sites into UVR or MVR sites in any of the analyses presented in the manuscript, but our description made an unintended impression that this was the case. The vast majority of analyses, except for Figures 1G-I and Figure 4E-G, examined individual UVR and MVR release events only. In the remaining analyses, we compared release probability of release sites that did or did not have an MVR event during the observation period. These analyses were based on counting all release events at each release site and did not distinguish UVR vs. MVR events in the calculation of P<sub>r</sub>-site (see below for more details). We have improved the schematics of these measurements in the figures and the presentation of these results in the text to clarify this point.</p><p>2) We changed the nomenclature used in the manuscript as the reviewer suggested. Only the terms “UVR events” and “MVR events” are now used throughout the manuscript. We completely remove any mention of “UVR release sites” or “MVR release sites”. We now use the same generic term “release site” for both forms of release throughout the manuscript.</p><p>3) We improved the presentation of UVR and MVR event measurements in Figure 1A to clarify that all release sites were considered in the same way, no matter whether the release was a UVR event or an MVR event, as the reviewer suggested.</p><p>4) We improved the schematics of the P<sub>r</sub>-site measurements in Figure 1H and 4G, and the corresponding legends and the bar graphs in the same panels, to clarify that release sites with or without an MVR event were compared. We further clarify in the Materials and methods that calculation of P<sub>r</sub>-site did not distinguish UVR vs MVR events. Each of the two release events comprising an MVR pair was counted independently as a single release event at the two release sites that harbored them.</p><p>5) Following the reviewer’s suggestion we extensively revised the Summary, Introduction, Results and Discussion of the manuscript to highlight the critical finding of a gradient of release site release probability from the AZ center to periphery.</p><p>6) We extensively revised the manuscript to improve clarity of result presentation and discussion. In summary, following the reviewer’s criticism, we have extensively revised the manuscript to clarify that our study distinguishes only UVR events and MVR events, but we do not analyze or distinguish release sites as “UVR sites” or “MVR sites”.</p><p><bold>References:</bold></p><p>Auger, C., Kondo, S., and Marty, A.
