<italic>B</italic>in-<italic>A</italic>mphiphysin-<italic>R</italic>vs (BAR) protein family. How endophilin influences endocytic membrane fission is still unclear. Here, we show that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is potently inhibited in vitro when an excess of endophilin co-assembles with dynamin around membrane tubules. We further show by electron microscopy that endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix and impairs fission by preventing <italic>trans</italic> interactions between dynamin rungs that are thought to play critical roles in membrane constriction. In living cells, overexpression of endophilin delayed both fission and transferrin uptake. Together, our observations suggest that while endophilin helps shape endocytic tubules and recruit dynamin to endocytic sites, it can also block membrane fission when present in excess by inhibiting inter-dynamin interactions. The sequence of recruitment and the relative stoichiometry of the two proteins may be critical to regulated endocytic fission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>dynamin</kwd><kwd>BAR domain</kwd><kwd>endophilin</kwd><kwd>membrane fission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>311536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_130520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA-0061-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2GM110772-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_149975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55108523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Searle scholars award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13SSP218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frost</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS036251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Camilli</surname><given-names>Pietro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TRANSPOL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie action grant #264399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galli</surname><given-names>Valentina</given-names></name><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Aurélien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The BAR protein endophilin spaces out turns of the dynamin helix, blocking its active conformational change and membrane fission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamin is a 97 kDa GTPase that mediates membrane fission in several endocytic routes. Dynamin forms tetramers in solution via the stalk domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Muhlberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reubold et al., 2015</xref>) and polymers around membrane tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takei et al., 1995</xref>). Polymeric forms have a GTPase activity increased up to a 1000-fold over basal hydrolysis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stowell et al., 1999</xref>). This increase is proposed to result from <italic>trans</italic> interactions between GTPase (G) domains of adjacent turns of a dynamin helical polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chappie et al., 2010</xref>). Constriction of the dynamin polymer is required for membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonny et al., 2016</xref>), but how GTPase activity drives constriction is still debated. The disassembly model proposes that dynamin assembles into a highly constricted helix in the GTP-loaded state and that GTP-hydrolysis-dependent disassembly is required for fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shnyrova et al., 2013</xref>). In the constriction/ratchet model, dynamin G domains are proposed to act as motor heads that use GTP hydrolysis energy to drive relative displacement of helical turns and thereby decrease the diameter of the dynamin helix to constrict the underlying membrane tube. Spontaneous fission then takes place at the edge of the constricted tube due to thermal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morlot et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the cell, dynamin is recruited to endocytic vesicle necks just before fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). The dynamin-binding N-BAR domain containing proteins are proposed to participate in this recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). N-BAR domains are a subfamily of the crescent-shaped <italic>B</italic>IN-<italic>A</italic>mphiphysin-<italic>R</italic>vs (BAR) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2004</xref>) with an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix. N-BAR proteins sense and induce membrane curvature and are thus proposed to either help induce or bind avidly to the highly curved necks of endocytic pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takei et al., 1999</xref>). The SH3 domain of N-BAR proteins binds to dynamin's proline-rich domain (PRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabs et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ringstad et al., 1997</xref>) recruiting dynamin to vesicle necks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sundborger et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>N-BAR proteins have been proposed to directly participate in membrane fission, as their N-terminal alpha-helix induces membrane curvature, thus promoting constriction and possibly fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>). However, the role of N-BAR proteins in membrane fission is still unclear: the BAR domain is also proposed to act as a stable scaffold, blocking further constriction below its preferred curvature and thereby stabilizing a tubule of a given diameter and inhibiting fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>). This scaffold was also proposed to hinder lipid diffusion, promoting fission of tubules under pulling forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Renard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simunovic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The contribution of N-BAR proteins to membrane fission mediated by dynamin is even less clear: amphiphysin was proposed to enhance dynamin-mediated membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takei et al., 1999</xref>), a stimulatory effect later found to be curvature-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). Early findings showed that endophilin inhibited dynamin-mediated membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>). However, different results were obtained in other assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meinecke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann and Schmid, 2013</xref>). Moreover, a fast endocytic pathway strictly depends on endophilinA2, which may indicate that endophilin proteins can facilitate dynamin-mediated fission in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucrot et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the differing published results, we sought to measure the direct impact of endophilin on dynamin’s oligomeric properties and membrane fission activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endophilin inhibits dynamin-mediated membrane fission</title><p>To study the effect of endophilin on dynamin-mediated fission, we generated lipid tubules from hydrated membrane sheets and recorded videos of their dynamics after protein addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roux et al., 2006</xref>). Once formed, we incubated membrane sheets either with dynamin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or sequentially with first endophilin and then dynamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the latter, fluorescently labeled proteins were used and both were detected on the tubules, confirming their co-assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The contrast of the endophilin-dynamin tubules was stronger, and these tubules appeared thicker under Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy, probably reflecting the co-assembly of endophilin and dynamin. Upon GTP addition (t = 0 s), the tubules coated by dynamin alone underwent fission within a few seconds as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roux et al., 2006</xref>), while tubules coated by endophilin and dynamin did not break nor alter their shape (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We concluded from these experiments that endophilin could inhibit dynamin-mediated membrane fission at the concentrations employed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26856.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endophilin inhibits dynamin-mediated constriction and fission.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Visualization of tubule fission using membrane sheets assay.

We first performed a GTPase malachite green assay and found that a fourfold excess of endophilin reduced the GTPase activity of liposome-bound dynamin by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>). We tested if dynamin still underwent GTP hydrolysis-driven mechano-chemical constriction in the presence of endophilin by visualizing the rotation of beads attached to dynamin-coated lipid tubules after addition of GTP into the chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roux et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As previously shown, beads rotated with an average speed of 8–9 rotations/second with dynamin alone, whereas no rotation was observed in the presence of endophilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These results showed that endophilin blocked mechano-chemical constriction of dynamin and subsequent membrane fission. However, we cannot exclude that dynamin may constrict through another mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Endophilin reduces rate and efficiency of membrane fission in a concentration-dependent manner</title><p>To better characterize and define the required molecular interactions for this apparent fission inhibition, we used an assay that enabled us to measure the rate of dynamin-mediated membrane fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We held giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) under aspiration into a glass micropipette and pulled lipid nanotubes out from the GUV using optical tweezers (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morlot et al., 2012</xref>). We injected dynamin, endophilin, and GTP simultaneously a few microns away from the membrane tube via separate injection pipettes allowing for various sequences of injection during time-lapse confocal imaging. The fission time – which is the inverse of the fission rate – was defined as the time between the start of the injection and the breakage of the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We measured fission times and plotted cumulative probability curves for various endophilin/dynamin molar concentration ratios, with the concentration of dynamin held constant at 5 µM. Exponential fits to a*(1-exp(-t/τ)) (raw data and fitting available upon request) revealed the fission efficiency (<italic>a</italic>) and characteristic time (τ) for each condition, incl. 95% confidence intervals for the two fit parameters. Fission efficiency, <italic>a,</italic> corresponds to the fraction of uncut tubes. At low endophilin/dynamin ratios (0.5x/1x), fission was delayed (39.5 ± 3.8 s for ratio 0.5x and 52.8 ± 7.8 s for ratio 1x, compared to 15.8 ± 3.7 s for dynamin alone; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>). At higher endophilin ratios, where both dynamin and endophilin are bound to the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), membrane fission was dramatically inhibited (2x) or completely inhibited (4x) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26856.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Endophilin reduces fission rate, fission efficiency and dynamin density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tube pulling setup.

The distance between turns of dynamin is increased by a factor of two in the presence of endophilin, as seen by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>). We hypothesized that this morphological difference of the dynamin coat induced by endophilin might be due to the intercalation of endophilin between the dynamin rings. Such a molecular intercalation or interleaving could, for example, block the molecular interactions that form in trans between G domains of two adjacent helical turns. These <italic>trans</italic> G domain interactions have been proposed to be responsible for GTPase-dependent conformational changes and constriction, thus precluding G domain interactings may inhibit fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chappie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappie et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the co-assembled architecture of the coat was responsible for fission inhibition, we assumed that reduced dynamin density would reflect the incorporation of endophilin within the protein coat, so we looked for a way to monitor fission rate as a function of dynamin density on the lipid tubule. We, therefore, used a lipid tube pulling assay, and tubes were decorated by co-injection of dynamin and endophilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). We assessed formation of the co-complex by measuring the fluorescence signals of both proteins and then injected GTP and measured the time to fission. The dynamin signal was lower when endophilin was co-injected, as compared to dynamin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,N</xref>), suggesting that endophilin was intercalating within the dynamin coat. The endophilin signal on the tube increased, as expected, with increasing endophilin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The dynamin fluorescence reduced by 2–3 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,O</xref>). Fission activity was dramatically reduced on tubes with the endophilin-dynamin co-complex, whereas it proceeded normally on tubes coated with dynamin only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).

We tested this by overexpressing endophilin in cells stably expressing dynamin-GFP and analyzing them through Total-Internal-Reflection-Fluorescence-Microscopy (TIRFM). SKMEL genome-edited cells (a gift of David Drubin) express dynamin-GFP at endogenous levels, which allowed us to manipulate the endophilin/dynamin ratio by overexpressing endophilin-RFP. As SKMEL cells primarily express the ubiquitous isoform dynamin2, we overexpressed endophilinA2, the ubiquitous isoform of endophilin (endophilinA2-RFP plasmid kindly provided by Emmanuel Boucrot). Indeed, overexpression of endophilinA2-RFP in SKMEL-dynamin-GFP cells correlated with much brighter dynamin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, purple arrows) than in non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, green arrows).

Indeed, SKMEL cells overexpressing endophilinA2-RFP show a lower internalization of transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). While quantifying this effect on a large number of cells, the effect was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, compare ‘NT’ and ‘tot’). However, plotting the transferrin intensity as a function of the endophilin overexpression in single cells showed a substantial decrease of transferrin uptake in the most overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). We thus plotted the average value of the transferrin fluorescence uptake in cells overexpressing endophilin-RFP with a lower value than 10,000 Fluorescence Arbitrary Units (F.A.U) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>,&lt;10,000), or with a higher value than 10,000 F.A.U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>,&gt;10,000). While the uptake of transferrin was not significantly different from the non-transfected cells when endophilin fluorescence was less than 10,000 F.A.U, the transferrin uptake was significantly reduced in cells expressing endophilin above 10,000 F.A.U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Thus, endophilin over-expression is inversely correlated to transferrin uptake in these cells.</p><p>As in our in vitro experiments, the ratio between dynamin and endophilin was a critical parameter to observe the fission inhibition, regardless of the absolute amount of the proteins. We thus tested the possibility that the inhibition of dynamin-mediated fission could be rescued in cells overexpressing endophilin by simply co-overexpressing dynamin. Indeed, when dynamin2-cherry and endophilinA2-GFP were co-overexpressed in SKMEL dynamin2-GFP cells, no significant inhibition of the transferrin uptake was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, Dyn2 OE). From these in vivo results, we concluded that co-assembly with endophilin can inhibit dynamin-mediated fission in a concentration-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have tested the effect of endophilin on dynamin's membrane fission activity. Our results show that the non-physiological 4x molar excess of endophilin inhibits fission completely by blocking dynamin constriction. We measured fission rates and efficiencies for different endophilin-dynamin molar ratios in a cell-free system and concluded that the inhibition was not only a time delay but also a decrease in fission efficiency up to a complete blockage. Deletion construct experiments indicated that both endophilin's membrane binding N-BAR domain and direct dynamin binding SH3 domain contributed to full inhibition.</p><p>We have used negative stain EM and cryoEM to visualize the endophilin-dynamin membrane bound co-complex and found that turns of endophilin intercalate between turns of dynamin polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). This structural arrangement explains the apparent increase in dynamin pitch reported earlier on blocked and elongated vesicle necks or tubular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iversen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takei et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takei et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, all known BAR, N-BAR and F-BAR partners of dynamin were shown to change the architecture of the dynamin coat in similar ways when co-assembled on membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>). This observation and our results suggest that many BAR family proteins with dynamin-binding SH3 domains can potentially inhibit membrane fission by co-assembling with dynamin polymers when present in stoichiometric excess relative to dynamin.</p><p>The role of endophilins in membrane fission has already been extensively investigated. While the N-terminal amphipathic helices have been shown to promote fission by inducing very high curvature, the crescent shape of the BAR domain counteracted this effect by fixing membrane curvature above the spontaneous fission threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucrot et al., 2012</xref>). But endophilinA2 was recently shown to be needed for fission in clathrin-independent endocytic pathways specific to G-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucrot et al., 2015</xref>), or to Shiga-toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Renard et al., 2015</xref>). EndophilinA2 polymerizes into rigid scaffolds around preformed membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simunovic et al., 2016</xref>), which block diffusion of lipids when the membrane tube is under tension, driving thinning and fission of the tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Renard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simunovic et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, we show here that overexpression of endophilin A2 inhibits fission at clathrin-coated pits, where dynamin is the primary fission machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which is consistent with the inhibitory action of endophilin on dynamin-dependent fission in our in vitro studies. While the physiological relevance of this inhibitory action may be questioned, as it only happens when endophilin is in excess, it nevertheless provides insight into the interplay of endophilin and dynamin.</p><p>Endophilin participates in the recruitment of dynamin to vesicle necks pointing to a positive role in promoting fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farsad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shupliakov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sundborger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wigge et al., 1997</xref>). Additionally, lack of all three endophilins results in delayed endocytosis at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). One potential explanation for the conflict between this positive role in dynamin’s action and the inhibitory role demonstrated by the present study, is that dynamin is assembled initially as a constriction-inhibited co-polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) at clathrin-coated pits. Endophilin and the other endocytic proteins may prepare the vesicle neck for fission by narrowing the neck and recruiting dynamin. However, the presence of BAR domain-containing proteins will also create a fission-inhibited zone of the tubule that may serve to position the dynamin-mediated fission reaction toward the junction between the cylindrical neck and the spherical vesicle. Further assembly of the dynamin polymer alone beyond the BAR-domain/dynamin co-assembly would create a fission competent dynamin collar closer to the vesicle.</p><p>While the above hypothesis is speculative, the physiological role of BIN1 (the muscle isoform of amphiphysin) and dynamin2 in T-tubule biogenesis may reveal the importance of the structural inhibition highlighted in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hohendahl et al., 2016</xref>). In T-tubule biogenesis, both mutants of BIN1 and dynamin cause centro-nuclear myopathies (CNMs), with a strong defect in T-tubule morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bitoun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nicot et al., 2007</xref>). BIN1 and dynamin2 have been directly implicated in the formation of T-tubules formed from the plasma membrane of myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). Strikingly, dynamin mutants with muscle-specific phenotype have increased fission capacities, causing T-tubules fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hohendahl et al., 2016</xref>). BIN1 mutants disrupt membrane and/or dynamin binding, but display the same fragmented T-tubule phenotype. These results suggest that the co-assembly of dynamin and BIN1 along T-tubules is a physiological example of a fission-incompetent co-assembly, providing a role for BIN1 not just in shaping the T-tubule but for structural inhibition of dynamin-mediated membrane fission.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP, 10106399001) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmBH, Mannheim, Germany.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural relationship between dynamin and endophilin at the membrane interface&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Volker Haucke (Reviewer #2); Anna Sundborger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is a consensus among the reviewers that the in vivo and in vitro experiments clearly show excess endophilin blocks dynamin mediated fission when assembled together on lipid tubes and when overexpressed in cells. This is especially convincing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> where they label for both endo and dynamin on the same tube. In these experiments both proteins are added simultaneously. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> it is not clear if dynamin binds or how much binds to the preassembled endophilin tubes since here endophilin is added prior dynamin. Either fluorescently tagged protein or images of endophilin alone compared to endophilin and dynamin would help convince the readers. As suggested by one reviewer, the statement that the Bead experiments shows endophilin blocks dynamin mediated constriction should be rephrased to state that dynamin may constrict without causing bead rotation (supercoiling). The reviewers all agree that the in vivo assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are convincing and clearly show overexpressing endophilin delays dynamin mediated fission and decreases transferrin uptake in proportion to the levels of endophilin expression.</p><p>The EM experiments have caused the most concern. It is unclear if the 2D class averages are from the cryo-EM data or negative stain. The Materials and methods suggest the 2D class averages are from cryo-EM data and if this is the case, stating this in the text and figure legends would validate the statement in the Abstract that cryo-EM was used to show the endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix. As commented by two of the reviewers, the resolution of the class averages is poor and more evidence is needed to support the model that endophilin prevents dynamin interactions in trans across the rungs of the helix. In addition, more quantification of the EM images would also help support the conclusions such as measurements between the GTPase domains in adjacent rungs, change in helical pitch and average diameter. A GTPase assay would help support the lack of G domain trans interactions.</p><p>The reviewers also agree that an expanded discussion of the results, taking into consideration other findings, would be beneficial. For example, how do the results shed light on the role of endophilin in the uptake of Shiga toxin, what is the role of endophilin's amphipathic helix, how does the data relate to physiological conditions and previously been published structural studies.</p><p>In addition, considering the main arguments supporting the conclusions are from cell biology and light microscopy results and not from structural studies, it is recommended that the title be reworded and not include the work 'Structural', which may be misleading and not reflecting the strengths of the paper.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agree that the data is of high quality and value and by incorporating their suggestions, the manuscript will be of interest to a wide audience, especially the fields of endocytosis and membrane remodeling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the EM data, improve the resolution to support the conclusions and add quantification and measurements.</p><p>2) Expand the Discussion to incorporate other findings and further discuss potential mechanisms of action in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Manuscript on membrane fission driven by dynamin. It is observed that endophilin inhibits dynamin-mediated tubule constriction and fission on model membranes by reducing fission rate and efficiency. Using cryo-EM, evidence is provided for an intercalation of endophilin between turns of dynamin oligomers. In cells, the overexpression of endophilin inhibits transferrin uptake.</p><p>The study presents a tour de force approach of modern membrane biophysics, including different model membrane systems, visual inspection of molecular dynamics at the nanoscale, optical tweezer setups, careful quantification, and some cryo-EM and cell biological experimentation. The body of data is quite convincing. The possibly biggest limitation comes from the fact that no evidence could be provided for this mechanism to operate under physiological conditions. The authors seem to be aware of this themselves, as they start the Discussion by stating that &quot;the non-physiological 4x molar excess of endophilin inhibits scission completely by blocking dynamin constriction&quot;. They then suggest that &quot;many BAR family proteins with dynamin binding SH3 domains can potentially inhibit membrane fission by co-assembling with dynamin polymers when present at a stoichiometric excess relative to dynamin&quot;. Any more direct evidence for this would clearly strengthen the physiological claim of this manuscript in a decisive manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this elegant study Hohendahl et al. have studied the debated role of the NBAR protein endophilin in dynamin-mediated fission in vitro and in living cells. They use membrane-sheet and GUV based assays to convincingly demonstrate that endophilin inhibits membrane fission of tubules coated with dynamin in a dose-dependent manner that requires its SH3 domain and, hence, association with dynamin. Further, negative stain EM analysis of lipid tubes coated with either dynamin or endophilin alone or both proteins together suggests that endophilin intercalates between dynamin-GDP rungs and thereby impairs fission triggered by adjacent GTPase domains that are predicted not to be able to interact in trans. Finally, experiments in genome engineered SKMEL cells expressing dynamin 2-GFP from its endogenous locus show that high level overexpression of endophilin A2 increases dynamin 2 lifetimes at CCPs and inhibits CME of transferrin, a phenotype rescued by co-overexpression of dynamin 2. These data are taken to suggest that endophilin and, possibly, other BAR domain proteins may create a fission-inhibited zone that could serve to restrict the dynamin-based fission reaction at the vesicle neck.</p><p>This is an interesting and scholarly study of high general interest and the data are of excellent quality. I, thus, have only a few relatively minor questions and suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) My only point of concern pertains to the (central) proposal that endophilin assemblies intercalate between adjacent dynamin rungs in co-assembled polymers. Given the low resolution of the negative stain TEM I feel that additional evidence for this is required. What is the exact distance between GTPase domains in adjacent rungs? Can GTPase domains assembled on lipid tubes be crosslinked in the presence of endophilin?</p><p>If the model was correct then addition of endophilin should inhibit lipid-stimulated GTPase activity of dynamin in a dose-dependent manner. Has this been tested using the GUV system?</p><p>2) Does inhibition of dynamin-mediated fission depend on the amphipathic helices within endophilin A2?</p><p>3) How do these data fit with the recent proposal that endophilin facilitates fission, e.g. during CIE of Shiga toxin? This point at least should be discussed. In general I feel many readers would benefit from an extended discussion of the new findings and how they relate to previous studies in the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study by Hohendahl et al. aims to resolve a hotly debated issue – do BAR proteins inhibit or promote dynamin-mediated fission? In a combination of in vitro fission assays, cryo-EM and live cell imaging, the authors show evidence of the BAR protein endophilin acting as an inhibitor of dynamin-mediated membrane fission.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors use an in vitro assay to investigate the effect of endophilin on dynamin-mediated membrane tubulation and GTP-dependent fission. They convincingly show that addition of endophilin results in the formation of tubulates that withstand addition of GTP, suggesting that endophilin inhibits dynamin-mediated fission. They further investigate whether the presence of endophilin also interferes with GTP-hydrolysis-driven constriction of dynamin assayed by rotation of beads in a chamber. The presence of endophilin blocked dynamin-mediated bead rotation, suggesting that endophilin prevents not only fission, but also dynamin-mediated conformational changes. Comments, the authors claim that these results show that endophilin blocks dynamin constriction. However, the assay in question detects coiling of dynamin-decorated lipid tubes, rather than dynamin-mediated constriction. Coiling of dynamin-decorated lipid tubes may or may not have any significance to fission in vivo. Also, recent studies show that constriction of dynamin scaffolds occur upon GTP binding rather than hydrolysis (Sundborger et al., 2014). Therefore, these results should be regarded as evidence of endophilin blocking dynamin-mediated GTP-dependent conformational changes, but not necessarily membrane constriction, which is likely to occur simultaneous to dynamin scaffold assembly.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the authors show inhibition of dynamin-mediated GTP-dependent fragmentation of nanotubes pulled from GUVs in the presence of GTP and endophilin. This inhibition is not observed in the presence of BAR domain only, indicating that the effect is dependent on SH3-PRD interactions between the two proteins. Comment: This assay fails to address the role of endophilin as a membrane remodeling protein. By using already constricted nanotubes, this assay bypasses a crucial step in the dynamin-mediated fission process – membrane constriction. Endophilin, the most likely candidate to promote constriction of the membrane upstream of dynamin recruitment, may regulate dynamin assembly as a function of curvature induction. This concept is even supported by previous work by the authors (Roux et al., 2010). Consequently, when using already-constricted tubes, the authors effectively bias their attempts to define the molecular mechanisms of endophilin-mediated inhibition of dynamin by not allowing it to act as a membrane remodeling protein, but rather as a potential recruiter of dynamin.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors use cryo-EM to visualize the endophilin-dynamin complex assembled on lipid tubes. These results show the impact of endophilin on dynamin scaffold assembly. Comments: The 2D class averages presented in this figure in the key point of the paper and should be emphasized. This data is confirming previously suggested mechanisms of endophilin inhibiting fission by preventing proper dynamin assembly. The resolution of the images does not support such claims, which should be clearly stated in the text. Furthermore, there is no evidence that endophilin actually interleaves the dynamin scaffold. The results do not clearly show if endophilin forms short scaffolds in between dynamin assemblies or a continuous scaffold under the dynamin oligomer. Also, there is no attempt to validate the presence of endophilin and dynamin in these structures. Therefore, the colors added to highlight the individual proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> must be viewed as purely speculative, which should be stated clearly in the text.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors show convincing results indicating that in cells overexpression of endophilin causes significant reduction in the rate of dynamin-dependent transferrin uptake, consistent with the notion that endophilin acts as an inhibitor of dynamin-mediated fission.</p><p>In all, this is an interesting and elegant multi-disciplinary study that aims to further our understanding of a fundamental cellular process. The authors provide evidence of the inhibitory role of endophilin in dynamin-mediated fission both in vitro and in situ, and suggest a possible mechanism underlying this function based on structural evidence. However, the majority of the data presented fails to provide further insight beyond what has been previously reported and suggested in studies by Farsad et al. 2001, Sundborger et at 2011, Meinecke et al. 2013 and Boucrot et al. 2013. Therefore, it's the opinion of this reviewer that while the novelty of this study is some-what limited, it serves an important role to confirm previously reported findings and suggested mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26856.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>There is a consensus among the reviewers that the in vivo and in vitro experiments clearly show excess endophilin blocks dynamin mediated fission when assembled together on lipid tubes and when overexpressed in cells.

It is observed that endophilin inhibits dynamin-mediated tubule constriction and fission on model membranes by reducing fission rate and efficiency. Using cryo-EM, evidence is provided for an intercalation of endophilin between turns of dynamin oligomers. In cells, the overexpression of endophilin inhibits transferrin uptake.</p><p>The study presents a tour de force approach of modern membrane biophysics, including different model membrane systems, visual inspection of molecular dynamics at the nanoscale, optical tweezer setups, careful quantification, and some cryo-EM and cell biological experimentation. The body of data is quite convincing. The possibly biggest limitation comes from the fact that no evidence could be provided for this mechanism to operate under physiological conditions. The authors seem to be aware of this themselves, as they start the Discussion by stating that &quot;the non-physiological 4x molar excess of endophilin inhibits scission completely by blocking dynamin constriction&quot;. They then suggest that &quot;many BAR family proteins with dynamin binding SH3 domains can potentially inhibit membrane fission by co-assembling with dynamin polymers when present at a stoichiometric excess relative to dynamin&quot;. Any more direct evidence for this would clearly strengthen the physiological claim of this manuscript in a decisive manner.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer has identified an important limitation of our study. As discussed in the revised version, we think that because no BAR protein is in strong excess when stoichiometrically compared to dynamin in vivo, this inhibitory effect may not be relevant. However, as stated by this reviewer, many BAR proteins could bind dynamin at the same time, and if (as we stated) all of them have an inhibitory action, the stoichiometry of all BAR proteins should be sufficient in the cell to block dynamin fission.</p><p>Our statement that “many BAR family proteins with dynamin binding SH3 domains can potentially inhibit membrane fission by co-assembling with dynamin polymers when present at a stoichiometric excess relative to dynamin” is relying on preliminary data obtained with amphiphysin and the F-BAR protein Fbp17 (not shown). This may be part of another future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] This is an interesting and scholarly study of high general interest and the data are of excellent quality. I, thus, have only a few relatively minor questions and suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1) My only point of concern pertains to the (central) proposal that endophilin assemblies intercalate between adjacent dynamin rungs in co-assembled polymers. Given the low resolution of the negative stain TEM I feel that additional evidence for this is required. What is the exact distance between GTPase domains in adjacent rungs? Can GTPase domains assembled on lipid tubes be crosslinked in the presence of endophilin?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the details reported above under Essential revisions point 1, and the cryoEM, not negative stain, images shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 2. The spacing between GTPase domains for dynamin-only structures, 1-start and 2-start, are annotated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> as nearly identical for the 1-start (13.9 nm) versus 2-start (14.0 nm) assemblies. The cryoEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) as well as negative stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref>), reveal a variable but variable, but unmistakable doubling of the space between dynamin oligomers by endophilin to 29.4 ± 5.2 nm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the model was correct then addition of endophilin should inhibit lipid-stimulated GTPase activity of dynamin in a dose-dependent manner. Has this been tested using the GUV system?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed the case as previously reported in Farsad et al. JCB 2001. We reproduced these data and have found the same results, which we have included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Does inhibition of dynamin-mediated fission depend on the amphipathic helices within endophilin A2?</p></disp-quote><p>It depends on the presence of a functional BAR domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which indicates that endophilin has to bind to the membrane in order to inhibit dynamin. Since amphipathic helix strongly participate in the membrane binding properties of endophilin (Peter et al. Science 2004), we expect that the inhibitory activity of endophilin would be strongly reduced in the absence of amphipathic helices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How do these data fit with the recent proposal that endophilin facilitates fission, e.g. during CIE of Shiga toxin? This point at least should be discussed. In general I feel many readers would benefit from an extended discussion of the new findings and how they relate to previous studies in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, we have thus extended the Discussion part (third and last paragraphs). Importantly, while endophilin1 (or A1) covers membrane tubes uniformly, endophilinA2 forms rigid scaffolds that grow like dynamin helices (see Simunovic et al. PNAS 2016) which mediates fission through a friction based mechanism while the tube is under extension forces (see Simunovic et al. Cell 2017). This effect is thought to be dominant in endocytic pathways independent of clathrin (Boucrot et al. Nature 2015) and Shigamediated endocytosis (Renard et al. Nature 2015). However, in fission of clathrin pits, where both A2 and A1 interact with dynamin, their roles may be different as we discuss in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors use an in vitro assay to investigate the effect of endophilin on dynamin-mediated membrane tubulation and GTP-dependent fission. They convincingly show that addition of endophilin results in the formation of tubulates that withstand addition of GTP, suggesting that endophilin inhibits dynamin-mediated fission. They further investigate whether the presence of endophilin also interferes with GTP-hydrolysis-driven constriction of dynamin assayed by rotation of beads in a chamber. The presence of endophilin blocked dynamin-mediated bead rotation, suggesting that endophilin prevents not only fission, but also dynamin-mediated conformational changes. Comments, the authors claim that these results show that endophilin blocks dynamin constriction. However, the assay in question detects coiling of dynamin-decorated lipid tubes, rather than dynamin-mediated constriction. Coiling of dynamin-decorated lipid tubes may or may not have any significance to fission in vivo. Also, recent studies show that constriction of dynamin scaffolds occur upon GTP binding rather than hydrolysis (Sundborger et al., 2014). Therefore, these results should be regarded as evidence of endophilin blocking dynamin-mediated GTP-dependent conformational changes, but not necessarily membrane constriction, which is likely to occur simultaneous to dynamin scaffold assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer to the reviewer’s comment, we have reformulated the sentence in the following way: “These results showed that endophilin blocked mechano-chemical constriction of dynamin and subsequent membrane fission. However, we cannot exclude that dynamin may constrict through another mechanism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the authors show inhibition of dynamin-mediated GTP-dependent fragmentation of nanotubes pulled from GUVs in the presence of GTP and endophilin. This inhibition is not observed in the presence of BAR domain only, indicating that the effect is dependent on SH3-PRD interactions between the two proteins. Comment: This assay fails to address the role of endophilin as a membrane remodeling protein. By using already constricted nanotubes, this assay bypasses a crucial step in the dynamin-mediated fission process – membrane constriction. Endophilin, the most likely candidate to promote constriction of the membrane upstream of dynamin recruitment, may regulate dynamin assembly as a function of curvature induction. This concept is even supported by previous work by the authors (Roux et al., 2010). Consequently, when using already-constricted tubes, the authors effectively bias their attempts to define the molecular mechanisms of endophilin-mediated inhibition of dynamin by not allowing it to act as a membrane remodeling protein, but rather as a potential recruiter of dynamin.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to nuance some of the statements made by the reviewer above. It is true that in the assay used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we do not directly address the role of membrane remodeling action of endophilin in the process. However, we have fully characterized with this tube pulling assay the remodeling properties of amphiphysin (Sorre et al. PNAS 2012), which is close enough to endophilin to say that at the concentrations we used in this assay, endophilin most probably participate in the tube constriction, and acts as a membrane remodeling protein. It may thus participate in dynamin recruitment to an already pre-constricted tube as proposed by the reviewer, however in this configuration, dynamin cannot fission the tube.</p><p>As a matter of fact, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we show time-lapses images of endophilin-dynamin coated tubules onto membrane sheets that were initially formed by addition of endophilin, and then subsequent addition of dynamin. In this case, dynamin is specifically recruited to the tubules formed by the membrane remodeling action of endophilin. This may have a physiological role (see Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the authors use cryo-EM to visualize the endophilin-dynamin complex assembled on lipid tubes. These results show the impact of endophilin on dynamin scaffold assembly. Comments: The 2D class averages presented in this figure in the key point of the paper and should be emphasized. This data is confirming previously suggested mechanisms of endophilin inhibiting fission by preventing proper dynamin assembly. The resolution of the images does not support such claims, which should be clearly stated in the text. Furthermore, there is no evidence that endophilin actually interleaves the dynamin scaffold. The results do not clearly show if endophilin forms short scaffolds in between dynamin assemblies or a continuous scaffold under the dynamin oligomer. Also, there is no attempt to validate the presence of endophilin and dynamin in these structures. Therefore, the colors added to highlight the individual proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> must be viewed as purely speculative, which should be stated clearly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the details reported above under Essential revisions point 1, and the cryoEM, not negative stain, images shown in revised Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
