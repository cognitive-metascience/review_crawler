Its α1 isoform binds to all three PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, ZO-1) domains of PSD-95, the principal PSD scaffold, and can occupy as many as 15% of these PDZ domains. We present evidence that synGAP-α1 regulates the composition of the PSD by restricting binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. We show that phosphorylation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Polo-like kinase-2 (PLK2) decreases its affinity for the PDZ domains by several fold, which would free PDZ domains for occupancy by other proteins. Finally, we show that three critical postsynaptic signaling proteins that bind to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 are present in higher concentration in PSDs isolated from mice with a heterozygous deletion of synGAP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16813.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16813.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16813.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The formation of memories is believed to depend on the strengthening of connections, called synapses, between neurons in the brain. When neurons are activated together, their synaptic connections become permanently strengthened to record the memory. This strengthening is called activity-dependent long-term potentiation.</p><p>As long-term potentiation develops, more protein receptors are added to the receiving side of the synapse. This allows the receiving neuron to produce a larger electrical response to the signaling chemicals it receives from the neuron on the sending side of the synapse. The addition of receptors is regulated by a set of enzymes held near the membrane of the synapse by a protein scaffold known as the postsynaptic density.</p><p>A major scaffold protein called PSD-95 contains binding sites, known as PDZ domains, that hold protein receptors and regulatory enzymes in place. One regulatory enzyme called synGAP is present in large numbers in the postsynaptic density and binds to the same PDZ domains as the receptors. Humans that have just one copy (instead of the usual two) of the gene that encodes synGAP have cognitive disabilities that are often accompanied by autism and epilepsy.</p><p>By studying purified proteins, Walkup et al. found that adding phosphate groups to synGAP reduces the enzyme’s ability to bind to the PDZ domains. This reduced binding ability could make more PDZ domains available to bind to protein receptors and hold them at the synapse.</p><p>To measure the effect of reduced synGAP levels on the proteins found at postsynaptic densities, Walkup et al. used mice that had just one copy of the synGAP gene in their neurons. These mice have less synGAP in their postsynaptic densities and more of three proteins that bind to PDZ domains. These proteins hold receptors in the synapse and help synapses to form. Thus, synGAP may restrict the binding of other proteins to the PDZ domains in order to regulate the strength of the synapse.</p><p>Further experiments are now needed to investigate the importance of restriction by synGAP of binding to PDZ domains under a variety of circumstances in which the activity of neurons alters the strength of synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16813.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16813.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SynGAP haploinsufficiency</kwd><kwd>CaMKII</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2006019582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walkup</surname><given-names>Ward G</given-names><suffix>IV</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA T32 GM07616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walkup</surname><given-names>Ward G</given-names><suffix>IV</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Integrative Study of Cell Regulation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Mary B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hicks Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Mary B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008915</institution-id><institution>Allen and Lenabelle Davis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowed Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Mary B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH095095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>Mary B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Beckman Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Protein Expression Center</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vielmetter</surname><given-names>Jost</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The α1 isoform of synGAP restricts the binding of AMPA-receptors and other regulatory proteins to PSD-95, and thus regulates synaptic strength.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We propose a new model for regulation of trapping of AMPARs and other synaptic proteins in 'slots' at the postsynaptic membrane. Numerous experiments have shown that AMPARs become immobilized at the postsynaptic membrane by a three stage process involving insertion of receptors into the perisynaptic membrane, diffusion into the synapse and 'trapping' within the structure of the postsynaptic density (PSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</xref>). The sites at which the receptors are trapped have been referred to as 'slots,' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2001</xref>) and they are believed to consist principally of PDZ domains on PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation by CaMKII of TARPs (Transmembrane AMPAR Regulatory Proteins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bredt and Nicoll, 2003</xref>) increases their affinity for PDZ domains of PSD-95 suggesting that the phosphorylation may promote trapping of new AMPARs in the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed the PDZ domains of PSD-95 act as docking sites for several synaptic regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>); including NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kornau et al., 1995</xref>), as well as neuroligins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>) and LRRTMs (Leucine Rich Repeat TransMembrane proteins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>), which nucleate new synapse formation and contribute to clustering of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>). AMPARs, NMDARs, TARPs, LRRTMs, and neuroligins comprise the most highly enriched transmembrane proteins precipitated together with PSD-95 from the PSD fraction of mouse forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dosemeci et al., 2007</xref>).The multiplicity of PDZ binding proteins at the synapse raises the question of whether and how competition for binding to the PDZ domains is regulated at individual synapses.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16813.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Competition among synaptic proteins for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95.</title><p>Each of the three PDZ domains of PSD-95 binds only one protein at a time.

The figure illustrates competition among three prominent membrane proteins (TARP, LRRTM, and neuroligin) and cytosolic synGAP-α1. Note that LRRTMs and neuroligin also bind across the cleft to presynaptic neurexins.

One prominent alternatively spliced isoform, synGAP-α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2001</xref>) contains a PDZ-domain ligand and binds to all three of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Here we propose that association of synGAP-α1 with PDZ domains of PSD-95 contributes to regulation of docking of AMPARs within the PSD and, therefore, to regulation of its overall protein composition. This function is distinct from its function as a Ras/Rap GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>). We support this hypothesis by showing that phosphorylation by at least two protein kinases on several sites in the regulatory region of synGAP-α1 reduces the affinity of synGAP-α1’s PDZ-ligand for the three PDZ domains of PSD-95. One of these protein kinases is CaMKII, which is activated when synaptic plasticity is initiated by activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The other is PLK2, a constitutively active kinase that is induced by neuronal activity and mediates homeostatic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seeburg et al., 2005</xref>). We further show that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to synGAP-α1 selectively reduces its affinity for PDZ3 of PSD-95. Finally, we show that reduction of the total amount of synGAP in heterozygous knockout mice alters the composition of PSDs in the mutant mice in a way that is most directly explained by reduced competition from synGAP-α1 for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95.</p><p>The PSD is an organized complex of signaling proteins attached to the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the central nervous system. It comprises a network of scaffold proteins, the most prominent of which is PSD-95, a member of the MAGUK family (Membrane-Associated GUanylate Kinase-like proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheng and Kim, 2011</xref>). An average PSD (~360 nm in diameter) is estimated to contain ~300 molecules of PSD-95 with 900 PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sugiyama et al., 2005</xref>). SynGAP is nearly as abundant in the PSD as PSD-95 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dosemeci et al., 2007</xref>). It is expressed as several isoforms with four different C-termini, α1, α2, β, and γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>).The α1-containing isoforms are abundantly expressed at synapses and contain the PDZ ligand. Assuming that α1 isoforms make up 30–50% of the total synaptic synGAP, and that one synGAP-α1 molecule can bind to any one of the three PDZ domains in each molecule of PSD-95, synGAP-α1 could occupy 10–15% of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 in an average PSD. Thus, it could help to regulate the size and strength of the synapse by limiting the availability of 'slots' that can bind AMPAR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>). This proposed function could explain its unusually high abundance in the PSD which, until now, has been mysterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sheng and Hoogenraad, 2007</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that, in general, PDZ domains act as flexible protein interaction points that can be modified to support changes in cytoplasmic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurakin et al., 2007</xref>). Complexes formed by PDZ domain interactions are examples of linked, multiple equilibria, the stable configurations of which are determined by the concentrations of each component and by their affinities for the relevant PDZ domains. Evidence has indicated that PSD-95 protein complexes exist in dynamic equilibrium permitting continual turnover and potential rearrangement of their composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sturgill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schapitz et al., 2010</xref>). Because synGAP-α1 is an abundant protein in the PSD with a relatively high affinity for all three PDZ domains of PSD-95, reduction of its affinity after phosphorylation will allow other components to compete more effectively for binding; thus, the composition of the PSD-95 complex will shift to a new equilibrium.</p><p>This proposed mechanism can account for many previous experimental observations. For example, two other groups used imaging to show that phosphorylation by CaMKII in living neurons triggers movement of synGAP away from the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). In the Araki study, the authors suggested that phosphorylation of synGAP results in 'dispersion' of synGAP away from the PSD and therefore has the effect of upregulating Ras near the PSD. We propose here that an additional important consequence of the decrease in binding of synGAP to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 is readjustment of the composition of the PSD resulting from increased availability of the PDZ domains of PSD-95. Indeed, the dynamics of movements of synGAP and AMPARs visualized in living neurons following synaptic stimulation are consistent with this hypothesis. Activation of NMDARs and CaMKII causes dispersal of synGAP away from the PSD within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). The same stimuli produce an equally rapid increase in the rate of trapping of AMPARs at synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the rates of these two processes, observed in living neurons, are compatible with the notion that reduced binding of synGAP to PSD-95 during induction of LTP opens up binding slots for AMPAR complexes. Dispersal of synGAP away from the postsynaptic membrane would be expected to result in increased activation of Ras and Rap, which would lead to increases in the rates of exocytosis and/or endocytosis of AMPARs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>). However, experiments show that increased exocytosis of AMPARs does not contribute to their increased trapping in the minutes following synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>). Instead, exocytosis replenishes surface AMPARs in the dendrite and perisynaptic spine membrane, and this process occurs with a slower time course than enhanced trapping.</p><p>An additional example of a previous result that is explained by this model, is the observation that absence of synGAP in hippocampal neurons cultured from synGAP KO fetuses leads to accelerated ('precocious') maturation of spines, including early movement of PSD-95 into spine heads, and ultimately larger clusters of PSD-95 in individual synapses compared to <italic>wt</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, expression of <italic>wt</italic>-synGAP-α1 in the mutant neurons rescued all of these phenotypes; however, expression of synGAP-α1 with a deletion of the five residue PDZ ligand (<italic>ΔSXV</italic>) failed to rescue any of the effects of synGAP deficiency on precocious maturation of spines. In fact, expression of synGAP<italic>ΔSXV</italic> caused an increase in the size of clusters of PSD-95 in spines compared to <italic>wt</italic> neurons. This failure to rescue the phenotypes was not a result of mislocalization of synGAP-α1; synGAP<italic>ΔSXV</italic> localized like <italic>wt</italic>-synGAP-α1 to developing spine heads. Instead, the data are consistent with the idea that synGAP-α1 normally competes with several proteins for binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95, and thus limits the size of clusters of PSD-95 and its associated proteins, as well as their movement into spine heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Yet another result supporting the model is the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMahon et al. (2012)</xref> that the α1 and α2 isoforms have markedly different effects on synaptic strength when expressed in primary cultures of forebrain neurons. For example, 12 to 36 hr after transfection of the neurons with the A1α1 isoform of synGAP, 73% of the neurons were 'silent', that is, had no miniature end-plate potentials (mEPSCs), compared with 11% of control neurons. In contrast, transfection with the A1α2 isoform, which differs from α1 only in its C-terminal 48 residues and lacks a PDZ ligand, had no effect on the proportion of silent neurons, which remained at 11%. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., (2004)</xref>, they found that the differential effect did not arise from mislocalization of the A1α2 isoform. Both isoforms of synGAP localized normally to dendrites and spines. The most straightforward explanation of this result is consistent with our hypothesis, which predicts that overexpression of the synGAP-α1 isoform bearing the PDZ ligand restricts binding of AMPAR auxiliary proteins to PDZ domains and thus interfers with their localization to the synaptic site.</p><p>Neurons cultured from synGAP deficient mice have been reported by several groups to have a higher average number of AMPARs at their synapses than <italic>wt</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>). The data presented here suggests that the increase in AMPARs in <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice may be a direct result of increased binding of TARPs and LRRTMs to PDZ domains that are made available by the reduced amount of synGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our proposed model and supporting results may help to explain the mechanism underlying a form of developmental intellectual disability (ID) resulting from synGAP haploinsufficiency. Mutations in a single copy of synGAP have been causally implicated in sporadic cases of non-syndromic ID, often associated with either autism (ASD) or epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>). The frequency of developmental ID worldwide is estimated at 1 to 3%, and 25 to 50% of cases are sporadic, meaning that the parents are not affected. Although data is still sparse, mutations causing SynGAP haploinsufficiency appear to account for 2–9% of sporadic cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that its prevalence in the population could be as high as 0.03–0.1% and placing it in the same range of frequency as Fragile-X syndrome. The amount of synGAP in the brains of mice with synGAP haploinsufficiency is reduced by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>). We show here that this reduction leads to a shift in the composition of the PSD scaffold, apparently resulting from the decrease in synGAP’s ability to compete for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95. This derangement is likely a significant factor in the human pathology leading to ID, ASD, and epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of r-synGAP-α1 by CaMKII and PLK2 reduces its binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95</title><p>SynGAP-α1 can be expressed in bacteria and purified in a soluble form by deleting the first 102 residues of its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>). This version of synGAP, termed r-synGAP-α1, retains all of the identified functional domains, the regulatory domain, and the C-terminal PDZ ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In a previous study we showed that r-synGAP-α1 is phosphorylated by CaMKII at several residues including S1283, which is 7 residues upstream of the PDZ domain ligand located at residues 1290–1293 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>). Because this phosphorylation site is so near the PDZ ligand, we wondered whether its phosphorylation, or phosphorylation of other sites by CaMKII, would interfere with binding of synGAP-α1 to PDZ domains of PSD-95. To test this, we incubated r-synGAP-α1 with affinity resins substituted with recombinant PDZ domains as described under Materials and methods. The beads contained PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, a fragment containing PDZ1 and PDZ2 (PDZ12), or a fragment containing all three PDZ domains (PDZ123) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walkup and Kennedy, 2014</xref>). Binding of r-synGAP-α1 to the beads was tested with or without a prior 10 min phosphorylation by CaMKII. As expected, without phosphorylation, r-synGAP-α1 binds specifically to each of the three PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this assay, its binding is highest to PDZ3. Binding of r-synGAP-α1 to PDZ123 reveals a substantial avidity effect; that is, the amount bound per individual PDZ domain is twice that bound to PDZ3 alone and four times that bound to either PDZ1 or PDZ2 alone.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16813.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation by CaMKII regulates association of r-synGAP-α1 with PDZ domains of PSD-95.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Association of r-synGAP-α1 with PDZ domains of PSD-95 before and after phosphorylation by CaMKII.

The fourth bar of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that the reduction in binding is not caused by phosphorylation of PDZ domains on the column by residual CaMKII. We have shown previously that as many as 10 sites on r-synGAP-α1 are phosphorylated by CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>).

We tested the effect of 10 min of phosphorylation by each of these kinases on affinity of r-synGAP-α1 for PDZ123. Phosphorylation by CDK5 had no significant effect on affinity; whereas, phosphorylation by PLK2 decreased its affinity by ~40%, less strongly than does phosphorylation by CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The first two PDZ domains are separated by 4 residues and the third is 53 residues downstream. We determined the affinities of r-synGAP-α1 for individual PDZ domains, for PDZ12 (residues 61–249) and for PDZ123 (residues 61–402) by a competition assay in which SPR is used to detect the amount of free r-synGAP-α1 in solutions containing a constant amount of r-synGAP-α1 and varying amounts of recombinant PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieba et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lazar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdiche et al., 2008</xref>). To detect the free r-synGAP-α1, recombinant PDZ domains are immobilized on the Biacore chip as described under 'Materials and methods.' We used the competition method rather than conventional Biacore measurements in which varying concentrations of r-synGAP-α1 are applied to a chip containing immobilized PDZ domains because concentrations of r-synGAP-α1 above ~100 nM produced a large bulk resonance signal caused by high viscosity that obscured the change in resonance produced by its binding to PDZ domains. The competition assay eliminates the need to apply high concentrations of r-synGAP-α1 to the chip.</p><p>We generated a standard curve in which the maximum resonance responses of a series of concentrations of r-synGAP-α1 from 0 nM to 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, grey traces) were determined and plotted against r-synGAP-α1 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, large grey dots). The data were fit with a hyperbolic curve. The maximum resonance response of a series of mixtures containing 25 nM r-synGAP-α1 and increasing concentrations of PDZ1 from 0 nM to 10 µM were measured, and the concentration of r-synGAP-α1 remaining free to bind to PDZ1 on the chip was then determined from the standard curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, small black dots).

Because, PDZ12 and PDZ123 contain more than a single PDZ domain binding site, all of which have similar affinities, we determined single 'apparent' equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>Dapp</sub>) for these two constructs. As discussed in 'Materials and methods', it is not possible to derive a unique equation incorporating two or three binding sites when the affinities of the multiple sites are similar. The best fit of the data with the equation for a single binding site provides a K<sub>Dapp</sub> that can be used to characterize the binding behavior of the constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, respectively).

We measured the amount of each protein bound to a fixed amount of CaM-Sepharose after incubation with increasing concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). Both r-synGAP-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and sr-synGAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) showed saturable binding to the CaM-Sepharose resin, and did not bind to control Sepharose beads lacking CaM (data not shown). The data were fit to hyperbolic curves and the K<sub>D</sub>’s for binding of r-synGAP-α1 and sr-synGAP to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM were calculated to be 31 ± 3 nM and 210 ± 30 nM, respectively. Thus, the high affinity site appears to be located in the regulatory disordered region of r-synGAP-α1, which is missing in sr-synGAP. The K<sub>D</sub>‘s determined by the bead-binding assay (31 ± 3 nM) and Biacore equilibrium binding (9 ± 1 nM) are in the range of those reported for calcineurin (PP2B) and CaMKII, 1–10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hubbard and Klee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen and Klee, 1988</xref>) and 40–80 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller and Kennedy, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hudmon and Schulman, 2002</xref>), respectively. We did not detect any binding when sr-synGAP was injected onto the CaM-substituted Biacore chip at concentrations from 10–2500 nM. Thus, the relatively weak binding of sr-synGAP observed in the bead-binding assay is not reproducible when measured on the Biacore chip.

Because binding equilibria are driven not only by the intrinsic affinities of the binding partners, but also by their concentrations, one prediction of our proposed hypothesis is that synGAP haploinsufficiency, which reduces the amount of synGAP in the brain by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>), will cause a significant increase in binding to PSD-95 of other prominent PSD-95 binding proteins, such as TARPs, LRRTMs, or neuroligins. Thus, PSDs isolated from <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice would be predicted to have less synGAP and more TARPs, LRRTMs, and/or neuroligins bound to PSD-95 than do PSDs isolated from <italic>wt</italic> mice. We prepared PSD fractions from the forebrains of six <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice and from six <italic>wt</italic> litter mates and measured the ratios of synGAP, TARPs, LRRTM2, neuroligin-1, and neuroligin-2 to PSD-95 in the two fractions by quantitative immunoblot as described in 'Materials and methods' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The recoveries of total protein and the amount of PSD-95 per µg protein were identical in the two preparations. As predicted, the level of synGAP is decreased in relation to PSD-95 by ~ 24% in PSDs (p=0.0007, d = 1.75) from the <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Furthermore, the ratios of TARPs 2,3,4,ɣ8, and of LRRTM2 to PSD-95 are significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B,C</xref>; TARP/PSD-95, ~12%, p=0.017, d = 0.93; LRRTM2/PSD-95, ~14%, p=0.0035, d = 0.66). This result strongly suggests that, as predicted, the increase in availability of PDZ1/2 domains on PSD-95 in the <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice enhances steady-state binding of TARPs and LRRTMs to those sites.

However, the ratio of neuroligin-2 to PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>) is increased by ~9% (p=0.019, d = 0.64). Neuroligin-2 normally associates mostly with inhibitory synapses and mediates their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levinson et al.

Thus, the effect of reduction of synGAP on the distribution of neuroligin-2 shown here is the same as the effect of over-expression of PSD-95, suggesting that both manipulations increase the number of PDZ3 domains available for binding. Taken together, these results verify the prediction that a decrease in availability of synGAP in the PSD scaffold, increases the association of TARPs, LRRTMs, and neuroligin-2 with the PSD in vivo by releasing a restriction on binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16813.019</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Altered composition of the PSD in mice with heterozygous deletion of <italic>synGAP</italic>.</title><p>Ratios of amounts of the indicated proteins to PSD-95 in each lane were measured as described in 'Materials and methods' and are reported as mean ± S.E.

It builds on previous findings that the PSD scaffold, in particular the PSD-95 complex, is dynamically regulated by activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sturgill et al., 2009</xref>), that activation of NMDARs and CaMKII leads to enhanced trapping of AMPARs within the PSD by binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2012</xref>), and that synGAP moves away from the PSD after phosphorylation by CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that binding of the C-terminus of synGAP-α1 to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 restricts binding of TARPs, LRRTM2, neuroligin-2, and perhaps additional proteins. As a result, regulation of synGAP-α1’s concentration and binding affinity for PDZ domains helps to determine the precise composition of the PSD at individual excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). A corollary of this hypothesis is that synGAP plays an important role in limiting the size and strength of excitatory synapses by limiting and helping to regulate the available 'slots' that can bind AMPAR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>).We have provided support for this notion by demonstrating that phosphorylation of several sites in synGAP’s regulatory domain by CaMKII or by PLK2 reduces the affinity of its PDZ ligand for all three of the PDZ domains of PSD-95. Both of these protein kinases are important regulators of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeburg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hell, 2014</xref>). We have also verified a strong prediction of the hypothesis which is that PSDs from mice with a deletion of one copy of the synGAP gene will contain fewer copies of synGAP and more copies of other proteins that bind to PSD-95. Indeed, we have shown that PSD fractions from young <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice have ~24% less synGAP per molecule of PSD-95 than those from <italic>wt</italic> mice; and, in contrast, they have significantly more TARP proteins (~12%), LRRTM2 (~14%), and neuroligin-2 (~9%) per molecule of PSD-95. The ratio of neuroligin-1 to PSD-95 is not altered.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16813.021</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Cartoon model of rearrangement of PSD caused by synGAP haploinsufficiency or by phosphorylation of synGAP-α1 by CaMKII.</title><p>Unphosphorylated synGAP-α1 (<italic>Top</italic>) binds to PDZ1, PDZ2 or PDZ3 of PSD-95, occupying as many as ~15% of its PDZ domains. The PDZ domains of PSD-95 are shown in blue and their numbers are indicated on the left pair of PSD-95 molecules. AMPARs that have been inserted into the extrasynaptic membrane by exocytosis associate with TARPs and with LRRTMs, both of which can bind to PDZ1 and PDZ2 of PSD-95. Neuroligin-1 (NLG-1) binds to PDZ3 of PSD-95. LRRTMs and NLG-1 also bind across the synaptic cleft to presynaptic neurexins. Induction of LTP (<italic>Lower Right</italic>) causes flux of calcium through NMDARs that activates CaMKII leading to phosphorylation of synGAP-α1 on sites in the regulatory domain. The affinity of synGAP-α1 for the PDZ domains decreases, allowing TARPs, LRRTMs, and perhaps NLG-2 to displace synGAP-α1 by binding to the PDZ domains. The shift in affinity of synGAP-α1 creates 'slots' that can be occupied by TARPs and LRRTMs bound to AMPARs, and by NLG-2, leading to strengthening of the synapse. SynGAP haploinsufficiency (<italic>Lower Left</italic>) results in a reduced amount of synGAP-α1 in the PSD. Similar to the model for LTP, this leaves more PDZ domains available to bind TARPs, LRRTMs, and NLG-2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16813.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16813.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16813-fig12-v2"/></fig></p><p>In the mouse brain, synGAP begins to be expressed at birth and its expression increases rapidly as synapses are forming during the first weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2006</xref>).

They form excitatory synapses precociously in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>) and also during postnatal cortical and hippocampal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>), leading to an elevated E/I ratio (excitatory/inhibitory synaptic ratio) and derangement of critical developmental periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clement et al., 2013</xref>). While all of these influences could contribute to alterations in the composition of PSDs in <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> animals, several arguments suggest that the increased presence of TARPs, LRRTMs, and neuroligin-2 that we report in PSDs of young animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) is likely a primary, rather than a secondary effect of the mutation. The effect of overexpression of synGAP-α1 in cultured forebrain neurons on development of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>) and on numbers of synaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>) is rapid, measurable within 12–24 hr of transfection and is not caused by mislocalization of the exogenous synGAP- α1. These effects are predicted by our model and do not depend on the in vivo context of the neurons. They are also not dependent on the GAP activity of synGAP and they require the PDZ ligand. While it is possible that a presently unknown direct effect on protein expression produces these changes, that effect would have to be specific for synGAP-α1 and require its PDZ ligand. No evidence has emerged for a direct effect of the PDZ ligand on protein expression. Thus, the hypothesis we have put forward is the most parsimonious explanation for the specific effects of synGAP-α1 on PSD composition. Similarly, the change in protein composition of PSDs in <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) cannot be explained by a two-fold reduction in RasGAP and RapGAP activity. SynGAP produces a much larger fold increase in GTPase activity of Rap than of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walkup et al., 2015</xref> and references therein). Therefore, loss of half of the GAP activity would be predicted to increase the level of active Rap even more than that of active Ras. Thus, one would expect a relative increase in endocytosis of AMPARs compared to exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>). That would result in fewer AMPAR binding proteins in the PSD; not more, as we observe. For now, application of Occam’s razor strongly favors the hypothesis we have presented. Future experiments will be necessary to determine the quantitative significance of synGAP-α1’s restriction of PDZ domain binding sites at various times during development and during acute stimulation of synapses.</p><p>Because binding between molecules is driven by their concentrations and also by the inherent affinity between the binding components, we predict that phosphorylation of synGAP-α1 by CaMKII or PLK2 can alleviate the restriction, enabling reconfiguration of the PSD scaffold. Thus, acute phosphorylation of synGAP-α1 by CaMKII following activation of NMDARs during induction of LTP could initiate rearrangement of the composition of PSDs of individual synapses by causing an increase in equilibrium binding in the PSD of AMPARs associated with TARPs and LRRTMs, and of other PSD-95 binding proteins, as they diffuse from perisynaptic locations. It will be important to test this prediction in future experiments.</p><p>Dephosphorylation of synGAP-α1 after its movement away from PDZ domains might be expected to allow synGAP-α1 to displace the newly added TARPs and LRRTMs and reverse the addition of new AMPARs. Thus, if this model is correct, additional processes occurring later in the consolidation of LTP would be needed to stabilize the newly added AMPARs in the synapse and/or to permanently decrease the number of synGAP-α1 molcules per PSD-95 in potentiated synapses. Such processes could include degradation of the phosphorylated synGAP-α1 and its replacement by newly synthesized alternatively-spliced isoforms that lack the C-terminal PDZ binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown that an increase in localization of neuroligin-2 at excitatory synapses is mediated by binding to PSD-95 and increases the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prange et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2010</xref>). It seems likely that the restriction by synGAP-α1 of binding of neuroligin-2 to PDZ3 of PSD-95 would be more significant during development, during formation of new synapses, or perhaps in later phases of consolidation of LTP in adults. It is not clear whether a pool of perisynaptic neuroligin-2 exists at adult synapses that could be recruited to new synaptic sites over a few minutes after phosphorylation of synGAP-α1. Nonetheless, the small but significant increase in neuroligin-2 that we observe in excitatory PSDs from <italic>Syngap<sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice, as well as the increased steady state amounts of TARPs and LRRTMs would increase the overall excitatory/inihibitory (E/I) balance of synapses onto neurons in the mutant mice, and perhaps also in humans with <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> haploinsufficiency.</p><p>We note that the reduction in affinity of synGAP-α1 for PDZ domains of PSD-95 after phosphorylation by CaMKII is apparently not sufficient for complete dispersal of synGAP-α1 away from the PSD, although it is likely necessary. Mutated synGAP-α1 missing the PDZ ligand (synGAP<italic>ΔSXV</italic>) cannot bind to PDZ domains, yet still localizes to synaptic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al. (2013)</xref> showed by immunoelectron microscopy that both α1 and α2 synGAP isoforms localize to the PSD core, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMahon et al. (2012)</xref> showed by mass spectrometry that α2 isoforms are present in isolated PSDs. These data mean that reduction of affinity of synGAP for PDZ domains may be sufficient to decrease its ability to compete for binding slots on PSD-95; however, complete detachment of synGAP from the PSD in vivo likely requires additional events.</p><p>The functional significance of our finding that r-synGAP-α1 contains a high affinity binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is less clear. We have shown that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM alters the conformation of the carboxyl terminal regulatory domain of r-synGAP-α1 allowing CDK5 to phosphorylate additional sites; the binding also reduces the affinity of r-synGAP-α1 for PDZ3 by ~25%. However, the consequences of these two effects for synaptic function are not known. Once again, the high copy number of synGAP in the PSD may provide a clue. The biochemical events initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through NMDARs that lead to changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sjostrom and Nelson, 2002</xref>) are initiated by formation of transient and limiting concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markram et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pepke et al., 2010</xref>). Approximately ten regulatory enzymes compete for binding of, and activation by, this Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy, 2013</xref>). Because of the abundance of synGAP in the PSD, the high affinity binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM on synGAP will compete effectively for the newly formed Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and may act as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM buffer.</p><p>Haploinsufficiency of <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> in humans is the cause of ~2–9% of cases of nonsyndromic cognitive disability with co-morbid Autism Spectrum Disorder or Epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>). The reduced amount of synGAP and resulting decrease in its ability to compete for PDZ domains are likely as significant as the reduction in synaptic Ras/Rap GAP activity in the pathology of these disorders. An increase in the E/I balance of synapses onto neurons in the forebrain of affected individuals is predicted by our results with <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, and could be responsible for the symptoms of cognitive disability, ASD, and/or epilepsy.

In this method, PDZ domains are immobilized on the chip surface and used to capture and measure the concentration of free r-synGAP-α1 in pre-equilibrated mixtures of a constant amount of r-synGAP-α1 with varying amounts of soluble recombinant PDZ domains. Experiments were performed on a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Purified PDZ domains (PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, PDZ12, PDZ123 from PSD-95) were coupled to Series S CM5 Sensor Chips (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, catalog no. BR-1005-30) by the amine coupling protocol specified in the Biacore T200 Control Software with reagents purchased from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. Sensor surfaces were activated by applying a 1:1 mixture of 50 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS): 200 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) provided in the Biacore Amine Coupling Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, catalog no.

PDZ domains were diluted to 0.1–5 µM in Biacore Sodium Acetate Buffer [10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, catalog no. BR-1003-49) for PDZ1 and PDZ3; pH 4.5 for PDZ2; pH 5 for PDZ12 and PDZ123]. PDZ domains were injected into flow cells 2 and 4 until 200 to 400 RU (resonance units) of PDZ domain were immobilized. Flow cells 1 and 3 were left blank to be used as reference surfaces. Ethanolamine (1 M, pH 8.5) was injected for 7 min at 10 μl/min to block remaining active sites on all four flow cells.</p><p>A calibration curve was prepared by applying samples of 0 to 50 nM r-synGAP-α1 prepared by two-fold serial dilution of 50 nM r-synGAP-α1 into 1x HBS-EP+ buffer (degassed 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4; 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, catalog no. BR-1006-69) to the chip and recording the maximum RU for each concentration. Samples for calibration were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature before randomized injection onto the chip surface at 25°C at 10 μl/min for 200 s over all four flow cells. Between each sample injection, the chip was regenerated by injecting 1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 100 μl/min for 60 s, waiting 180 s for the baseline to stabilize, then injecting a second pulse of MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution, waiting 300 s for the baseline to stabilize, and finally executing a 'carry over control injection' in which HBS-EP+ buffer is flowed over the chip surface at 40 µl/min for 30 s. Mixtures of r-synGAP-α1 and PDZ domains were prepared by 1:1 dilution of 50 nM r-synGAP-α1 with two-fold serial dilutions of PDZ domains (0–20 µM PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, PDZ12 or 0–160 µM PDZ123) in HBS-EP+ buffer to produce mixtures containing 25 nM r-synGAP-α1 and 0–10 µM PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, PDZ12 or 0–80 µM PDZ123. For each mixture of r-synGAP-α1 and PDZ domain, the different concentrations were injected randomly and a series of sensorgrams were recorded as described for the calibration curve.</p><p>Sensorgrams were processed with Biacore T200 Evaluation Software, (ver. 3.0, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The y-axes were zeroed at the baseline for each cycle and x-axes were aligned at the injection start. Bulk refractive index changes and systematic deviations in sensorgrams were removed by subtracting the responses in reference flow cells corresponding to the sample flow cells (e.g. 2–1, 4–3). The averaged sensorgrams for 0 nM r-synGAP-α1 were then subtracted from sensorgrams for all other concentrations. The concentrations of free r-synGAP-α1 in each mixture with PDZ domains was determined from the calibration curve, exported into Prism, and plotted against the log of PDZ domain concentration.

Equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) for binding to PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ3 were determined from the best fit curves as described in the Biacore T200 Software Handbook (p. 210). The experimental curves deviated slightly from the equation at higher concentrations of soluble PDZ domain because of a low affinity association between PDZ domains bound to the chip and soluble free PDZ domains. The deviation is most obvious for phosphorylated r-synGAP-α1 which has a relatively low affinity for PDZ123. We determined that these deviations had only a small effect (&lt;~5%) on the calculated K<sub>D</sub>’s by comparing K<sub>D</sub>’s after fitting the curves including or excluding points for high concentrations of PDZs at which the r-synGAP-α1 concentration appeared to plateau above zero. PDZ12 and PDZ123 contain more than a single PDZ domain binding site. It is not possible to derive a unique equation incorporating two or three binding sites when the affinities of the multiple sites are similar. Therefore, single 'apparent' equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>Dapp</sub>) were determined by obtaining the best fit of the data with the equation for a single binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Binding of r-synGAP-α1 to CaM-Sepharose</title><p>Rosetta2(DE3) cells containing sr-synGAP or r-synGAP-α1 were lysed in Lysis buffer as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walkup et al.

For measurement of neuroligin-1, both PSD-95 and neuroligin-1 were detected by the same goat anti-mouse secondary; the bands were physically separated on the gel and were quantified independently. Bound antibodies were visualized in the appropriate fluorescent channels with an Odyssey Classic Infared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences).</p><p>Before running samples for quantification, we determined the amount of PSD sample that would result in signals for each protein that were strong enough for measurement and not saturated. To quantify the densities of the bands, each visual image was first set to high brightness in order to capture the boundaries of the signals for each band. The images were then used as a template in Li-Cor software to draw rectangular regions of interest around protein bands, and around identically sized background regions in the same lane. Background densities were subtracted from each protein signal. The digital data read by the Li-Cor software is unchanged by the visualization settings and is linear over several orders of magnitude. For each lane, the ratio of the integrated density of each of the five proteins to the integrated density of PSD-95 was calculated. For three gels, one outlier measurement (defined as greater than 2 times the standard deviation of the mean [S.E.]) was excluded from the calculation. The mean and S.E of the ratios were determined for <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> PSD fractions. The means were compared by t-tests performed with Prism software as indicated in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. The effect size was measured by Cohen’s d (ratio of the difference in the mean to the pooled standard deviations of the measurements). Cohen’s d between 0.5 and 0.8 is generally considered a 'medium' effect size, greater than 0.8 is generally considered a large effect size. For four of the proteins, the number of measurements was sufficient to determine a significant difference between <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic>. In the case of neuroligin-1, the means were identical after 24 individual measurements of each sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by grants from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (Center for Integrative Study of Cell Regulation), the Hicks Foundation for Alzheimer’s Research, the Allen and Lenabelle Davis Foundation, and from National Institutes of Health Grant MH095095 to MBK.

The main issue is that the qualitative findings of Araki et al. provide the same bottom line as this paper, but with more physiological relevance. This is not, we would like to stress, just a matter of &quot;publication date&quot;. While there are new quantitative data on the sites studied in Araki (these sites were originally identified by the Kennedy group) the focus is on a new site, S1283, identified in vitro. The paper fails to provide a clear integrated discussion of the roles of these sites. The S1123/S1093 sites seem likely to be the relevant &quot;10 min sites&quot; that are causing PSD-95 release in vitro in the S1283 mutant and it seems equally likely that S1283 is the &quot;10 min&quot; site that causes release in the S1123 mutants, making it unclear why the S1123/S1283 double mutant was not examined. This paper needs to make a compelling case as to why quantitative information about S1283, an in vitro phosphorylation site which has not been shown to have a role in vivo, gives added value to the story. Secondly, there is no discussion of how the non-PDZ ligand form of SynGAP is released by phosphorylation, something a more general model should include. Thirdly, the SynGAP/+ PSD data, while suggestive and supportive of the model, are not totally compelling due to the potential for developmental effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper provides a beautifully logical and well-supported model for how activity can lead to the remodeling of the PSD and the insertion of AMPARs. The study demonstrates very convincingly that phosphorylation of SynGAP by CaMKII reduces its affinity for PSD-95 PDZ domains. The authors go on to posit that in vivo this decrease in PDZ binding frees up &quot;slots&quot; for other PSD-95-binding proteins to inhabit and allows the insertion of more AMPARs into the synapse. This idea has a certain appeal since it helps explain the initiation of the remodeling of the PSD that is caused by activity. The model is circumstantially supported by data from PSDs of WT and synGAP heterozygotes which show that the ratio of PSD-95 to SynGAP is decreased, but the ratio to other PDZ-binding partners is increased.</p><p>In general this is a very interesting, convincing and potentially important study. I have only two suggestions. The first is that given the ability of the authors to look at PSD-95 binding in a quantitative manner they should have filled in the gap between their biochemical data and the PSD immunoblots by showing with binding assays that SynGAP and other PDZ ligands actually compete and that phosphorylation of SynGAP alters its ability to compete. This would nicely close the loop.</p><p>The second is that the authors seem to take a very CaMKII-centric view of SynGAP phosphorylation. It clearly is the big dog with 10 mol/mol, but can other kinases cause similar losses of affinity for PSD-95? How about Cdk5 or PKA? Can they act independently or synergistically with CaMKII? Given that it appears that the affinity effect is &quot;bulk&quot; and not site-specific this may be quite biologically relevant. It at least merits discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents evidence that phosphorylation of SynGAP by CaMKII near its C-terminus decreases its binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. The authors identify S1283 as a critical phosphorylation site in this context. The data are largely solid. However, recent other work already showed that phosphorylation of SynGAP on S1108 and S1128 by CaMKII reduces its interaction with PSD-95 and is important for chemically induced LTP (Araki et al., 2015, as cited). The authors would have to discuss how their findings intersect with this recent other work in much more detail than they present right now. Most importantly, in the absence of any functional studies such as redistribution of postsynaptic proteins upon S1283 phosphorylation and its dependence on S1283 phosphorylation, the functional significance of this phosphorylation is not clear enough for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A technical major issue is that pull-down data lack controls for non-specific binding of the various SynGAP polypeptides to resin, ideally with a non-specific tag. This is in part important because there is quite a bit of difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for pull down of WT SynGAP after 0.5 vs. 10 min CaMKII pre-treatment. Could this be due differences between experiments, perhaps due to variations in non-specific binding to resin?In this context, the fact that the point mutations of SynGAP showed more binding than WT after 0.5 min CaMKII pretreatment could potentially be due to variation in non-specific binding and, if so, there might not be a difference between the 0.5 and 10 min CaMKII incubations in that respect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a well-written and clearly presented manuscript describing a novel mechanism by which synGAP regulates synaptic function. It is of high importance given the fact that mutations in synGAP in humans leads to non-syndromic intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of synGAP action will help devise therapeutic strategies for these debilitating disorders.</p><p>While overall this is an exciting manuscript, I have several criticisms that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) As it stands, the manuscript reads as if all isoforms of synGAP bind PSD-95 through the PDZ-binding domain. However, this is true only for those isoforms containing the α1 c-terminal. The relative abundance of these protein isoforms relative to α2 (or other isoforms) is not well-described but both localize to synapses. A clear statement that the mechanism described in this manuscript applies to α1 containing isoforms only is warranted. Preferably, instead of referring to synGAP, the authors could refer to synGAP α1 throughout the manuscript. While these changes do not detract from the importance of the main findings of the manuscript, they highlight that many synGAP isoform exist at the synapse that do not contain the sequences necessary to bind PSD-95.</p><p>2) It is unclear how they derived the equation to determine the best fit of their data. In several of their panels, the curves do not appear to fit the data well at all. How were the constraints placed on the maxima and minima? For example, for much of their data, the levels of free r-synGAP never reach 0, despite high levels of PDZ concentrations. However, the curves all asymptote to 0. Hence, the equation does not appear to describe the data. Consideration needs to be given to alternative equation that better describe the data to allow accurate K<sub>D</sub>s to be determined.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Binding of synGAP to PSD-95 is regulated by phosphorylation and shapes the composition of the postsynaptic density&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor and two reviewers: Peter C. Kind (Reviewer #3) and Leslie C Griffith (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper proposes a model for how activity-dependent synaptic reorganization occurs. The authors demonstrate that CaMKII phosphorylation of synGAP reduces its affinity for the PDZ domains of PSD-95, thus making these sites available for other proteins. This role for synGAP in regulating PSD composition is independent of it GTPase activity and changes the potential outcomes of both synGAP action in normally developing neurons as well as in the human pathology associated with SYNGAP haploinsufficiency. The biochemical findings are tightly integrated into a model of PSD plasticity that provides a new way of looking at how synapses reorganize. While not all the last details have been worked out, this is a substantially new way of looking at the PSD that should have a significant influence on the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should deal with the minor discussion points outlined below.</p><p>1) While the data showing an increase in binding of TARPs, LRRTM2 and NLGN2 is consistent with the model proposed, I do not think the authors should be quite so dismissive of the potential of developmental compensation as a contributing factor. Identifying direct vs. indirect effects of a given mutation is always difficult and compensation can happen at all levels, from molecular to circuit. <italic>SynGAP<sup>+/-</sup></italic> neurons show numerous physiological in intrinsic and circuit properties, plasticity, morphology etc. How each of these relate directly to the reduction in synGAP is not known. Since the excitability and activity of neurons is altered, so to will the activity-dependent gene expression. Hence, changes in protein expression and localisation may also arise as a secondary effect of changes in activity across development. Therefore, while their data certainly are consistent with their model and their conclusions may even be the most parsimonious explanation for their data since TARPs, LRRTM2 and NLGN2 are all affected, a critical discussion of other possibilities seems warranted.</p><p>2) The McMahon et al. manuscript did not make any conclusions about the relative abundance of α1 and α2 isoforms because different antibodies with different binding affinities were used. That said, it is clear that α1 containing synGAPs are abundantly expressed at synapses and that the mechanism proposed here is an important regulator of synGAP function.</p><p>3) The Barnett et al. manuscript did not show that, &quot;isoforms of synGAP that do not contain the PDZ ligand are, nevertheless, bound to the PSD.&quot; as stated in the Discussion. Instead they showed that in PSD-95 mutants, synGAP still associated with the PSD using a pansynGAP antibody. They did not distinguish whether these were non-PDZ binding isoforms or α1 containing isoforms that use and non PSD-95 strategy for associating with the PSD. However, McMahon et al. presented mass spec data showing α2 containing isoforms are present at excitatory synapses.</p><p>4) A clear comparison of the different phosphorylation sites between the Araki et al. and this manuscript would be useful. As far as I can tell, both the Araki et al. and this manuscript are referring to the rat sequence. However, the Araki paper is using the numbering of the A isoform and the Kennedy is using the α1 isoform. These can be seen in the McMahon et al., Supplemental <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>. They encode different N-terminal peptides that differ by 15 amino acids and this leads to the differences in numbering. Is this correct?</p><p>5) It does not appear my original query on statistics was addressed. So I restate it below. Apologies if I missed any clarification.</p><p>In general the statistical methods appear appropriate. One clarification, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> could the authors please confirms that n=number of animals rather than number of PSD preps or number of lanes. I believe this is the case, but it is ambiguous.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16813.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>While all the reviewers found this study interesting, there was a consensus that as it stands it is not suitable for eLife.

The conclusions of the Araki paper were completely different from ours and offered a different model. Indeed most of the experiments in our manuscript are entirely different. The summary from the Araki paper taken from the Neuron PDF of the paper states: “In Brief:</p><p>Araki et al. discovered that CaMKII- dependent phosphorylation of SynGAP induces its dispersion from synaptic spines leading to activation of small G proteins during LTP. These results define a key missing link between CaMKII and small G protein activation.”</p><p>There is no mention made in the Araki paper of the possibility that “release” of synGAP is important for reducing competition for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95. Nor are there any experiments dealing with that issue.</p><p>Our study adds the following new information not published previously (in addition to all of the quantitative data):</p><p>A) Most importantly, we provide a new model for a distinct function of synGAP by recognizing the consequences of the fact that synGAP is an unusually abundant protein in the PSD, nearly as abundant as PSD-95 itself. Our reading of the data of McMahon et al. on synGAP isoforms is that the synGAP α1 isoform makes up approximately half of the synGAP in a mouse hippocampal homogenate (at the very least 30%). This fact predicts that synGAP could occupy as many as 15% of all of the PDZ domains on PSD-95. This means that a reduction in affinity of synGAP for the PDZ domains would necessarily make a relatively large number of PDZ domains available for binding to other proteins. This has not been stated in publications previously and this simple deduction has not been made in any other paper. The model is a significant advance on its own. As the editors suggested, we have rearranged the paper to introduce this model thoroughly in the introduction, and we have emphasized it in the title.</p><p>B) We make an experimental prediction that is improbable unless the mechanism we propose is operating, and we validate that prediction with data. Proof of our model will require many experiments, but Occam’s razor indicates that our model is the most parsimonious explanation of our data.</p><p>C) We show that cumulative phosphorylation of synGAP at several sites in the C-terminus reduces the affinity of synGAP for ALL THREE of the PDZ domains on PSD-95.</p><p>Finally, we make the comment that, though it is widely stated that experiments involving expression of fluorescent proteins and live imaging are “more physiological” than biochemical studies, we do not share this view. Such experiments cannot control for over- and under expression of fluorescent proteins and resulting artifacts arising from disrupted kinetics. They are useful to provide qualitative data about behavior of individual molecules in vivo. However, they are prone to erroneous interpretation and must be understood in light of the biochemical characteristics of the proteins studied. We believe that progress in understanding molecular mechanisms within neurons has been damaged by over-reliance on studies of individual fluorescent proteins in vivo by imaging.</p><p><italic>While there are new quantitative data on the sites studied in Araki (these sites were originally identified by the Kennedy group) the focus is on a new site, S1283,</italic> identified <italic>in vitro.</italic> </p><p>The focus of our study was not and is not on identifying a new site. We agree with the reviewers that if the only addition that our work made to the qualitative Araki study is the identification of one possible new site, S1283, the paper would not be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, nothing in our paper indicated that this finding as its major focus. In our view, the identification of the additional site simply cleans up and clarifies the number of sites that can be involved in regulating binding of synGAP to PDZ domains. It is a detail.</p><p><italic>The paper fails to provide a clear integrated discussion of the roles of these sites. The S1123/S1093 sites seem likely to be the relevant &quot;10 min sites&quot; that are causing PSD-95 release in vitro in the S1283 mutant and it seems equally likely that S1283 is the &quot;10 min&quot; site that causes release in the S1123 mutants, making it unclear why the S1123/S1283 double mutant was not examined. This paper needs to make a compelling case as to why quantitative information about S1283, an in vitro phosphorylation site which has not been shown to have a role in vivo, gives added value to the story.</italic> </p><p>As we stated above, our goal was not and is not to provide an integrated discussion of the roles of sites S1123 and S1283 in synGAP. We have added studies of additional multiple mutations that included site S1283. We now conclude that both S1123 and S1283 can affect binding affinity for PDZ domains, but the effect of S1283 seems to be somewhat more potent. We show in two ways that cumulative phosphorylation of other, more slowly phosphorylated sites by both CaMKII and PLK2 can also result in a decrease in affinity. This data shows that synGAP conforms to a model of regulation stressed by Holt et al. (cited in the manuscript) which states that phosphorylation often involves disruption or enhancement of protein-protein interactions by addition of multiple negative charges, often in an otherwise disordered region. We do not believe that it is accurate to imagine that particular sites in synGAP have unique functions in regulating association with PDZ domains.</p><p><italic>Secondly, there is no discussion of how the non-PDZ ligand form of SynGAP is released by phosphorylation, something a more general model should include. Thirdly, the SynGAP/+ PSD data, while suggestive and supportive of the model, are not totally compelling due to the potential for developmental effects.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct that we did not discuss explicitly how β or α2 isoforms that don’t have PDZ binding sites might be released from the PSD. A paper by Yang et al. (2013) in PLoS One, from the Dosemeci/Reese group shows movement of α2 isoforms away from the membrane. It is an EM study showing that synGAP α2 and synGAP α1 both move from inside the PSD at ~30 nm from the membrane to what they call the “pallium” of the PSD, at a median of ~60 nm from the membrane. The movement is evident 10 min after NMDA treatment, and the movement is sensitive to inhibition by a peptide inhibitor of CaMKII. This result suggests that phosphorylation can indeed affect the micro-distribution of synGAP α2 similarly to synGAP α1. This is an issue that we are interested in examining, but it is not the focus of this paper to provide a “general” model of the functions of all synGAP isoforms. The existence of additional isoforms does not directly impinge on the hypothesis that is the central focus of our manuscript. We do not believe that we should be required to figure out every aspect of the function of synGAP in order to publish this paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We have added the suffix α1 at all places in our manuscript where it is appropriate, as suggested by reviewer 3; and we have modified the Discussion to take into account that the α1 subunit is only approx. half of the total synGAP. Even a conservative interpretation of the data in McMahon et al. would suggest that at least 30% of the total synGAP is an α1 isoform. These numbers don’t alter the predictions of the model substantially.</p><p>We disagree with the statement of the reviewers that “…the <italic>SynGAP<sup>-/+</sup></italic> PSD data, while suggestive and supportive of the model, are not totally compelling due to the potential for developmental effects.” SynGAP begins to be expressed as synapses begin forming in the brain. Newborns with complete deletion of synGAP appear normal, but die a few days after birth with movement defects and apparent seizure activity, indicating a defect as synapses are forming. Such developmental effects of mutations arise for molecular reasons. There is no evidence of morphological changes in synGAP heterozygous animals, nor in individuals with synGAP haploinsufficiency, that might lead to a wiring defect that could produce the result we report. The hypothesis we have put forward is by far the most parsimonious explanation for the change in composition of forebrain PSDs in the <italic>synGAP<sup>+/-</sup></italic> animals. Indeed, the quantitative nature of the changes is difficult to explain in any other ways. They cannot be explained by a two-fold reduction in RasGAP and RapGAP activity. SynGAP produces a much larger fold increase in GTPase activity of Rap than of Ras (Walkup et al., 2015 and references therein). Therefore, loss of half of the GAP activity would be predicted to increase the level of active Rap even more than that of active Ras. Thus, one would predict a relative increase in endocytosis of AMPARs compared to exocytosis. That would result in fewer AMPAR binding proteins in the PSD; not more, as we observe. Beyond that, the competitive role for synGAP binding explains several previously unexplained observations in the literature. Many of these were detailed in our discussion. For now, Occam’s razor strongly favors our hypothesis. We point out that many experiments will be necessary to “prove” this model beyond a doubt. However, the experiment we present is a strong favorable one given that it matches the prediction of the model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper provides a beautifully logical and well-supported model for how activity can lead to the remodeling of the PSD and the insertion of AMPARs. The study demonstrates very convincingly that phosphorylation of SynGAP by CaMKII reduces its affinity for PSD-95 PDZ domains. The authors go on to posit that in vivo this decrease in PDZ binding frees up &quot;slots&quot; for other PSD-95-binding proteins to inhabit and allows the insertion of more AMPARs into the synapse. This idea has a certain appeal since it helps explain the initiation of the remodeling of the PSD that is caused by activity. The model is circumstantially supported by data from PSDs of WT and synGAP heterozygotes which show that the ratio of PSD-95 to SynGAP is decreased, but the ratio to other PDZ-binding partners is increased.</italic> </p><p><italic>In general this is a very interesting, convincing and potentially important study. I have only two suggestions. The first is that given the ability of the authors to look at PSD-95 binding in a quantitative manner they should have filled in the gap between their biochemical data and the PSD immunoblots by showing with binding assays that SynGAP and other PDZ ligands actually compete and that phosphorylation of SynGAP alters its ability to compete. This would nicely close the loop.</italic> </p><p>We are interested in doing such a study, but it is far more complicated and tricky than the reviewer imagines. The appropriate controls and a thorough job would require an additional paper.</p><p><italic>The second is that the authors seem to take a very CaMKII-centric view of SynGAP phosphorylation. It clearly is the big dog with 10 mol/mol, but can other kinases cause similar losses of affinity for PSD-95? How about Cdk5 or PKA? Can they act independently or synergistically with CaMKII? Given that it appears that the affinity effect is &quot;bulk&quot; and not site-specific this may be quite biologically relevant. It at least merits discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have added experiments with CDK5 and PLK2, both of which phosphorylate synGAP, but more slowly than CaMKII. CDK5 phosphorylation has no effect on affinity; whereas PLK2 phosphorylation decreases affinity less than phosphorylation by CaMKII. Its effect adds to the conclusion that “bulk phosphorylation” can have a greater effect than single sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript presents evidence that phosphorylation of SynGAP by CaMKII near its C-terminus decreases its binding to the PDZ domains of PSD-95. The authors identify S1283 as a critical phosphorylation site in this context. The data are largely solid. However, recent other work already showed that phosphorylation of SynGAP on S1108 and S1128 by CaMKII reduces its interaction with PSD-95 and is important for chemically induced LTP (Araki et al., 2015, as cited). The authors would have to discuss how their findings intersect with this recent other work in much more detail than they present right now. Most importantly, in the absence of any functional studies such as redistribution of postsynaptic proteins upon S1283 phosphorylation and its dependence on S1283 phosphorylation, the functional significance of this phosphorylation is not clear enough for publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p><italic>A technical major issue is that pull-down data lack controls for non-specific binding of the various SynGAP polypeptides to resin, ideally with a non-specific tag. This is in part important because there is quite a bit of difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for pull down of WT SynGAP after 0.5 vs. 10 min CaMKII pre-treatment. Could this be due differences between experiments, perhaps due to variations in non-specific binding to resin? In this context, the fact that the point mutations of SynGAP showed more binding than WT after 0.5 min CaMKII pretreatment could potentially be due to variation in non-specific binding and, if so, there might not be a difference between the 0.5 and 10 min CaMKII incubations in that respect.</italic> </p><p>There is no detectable non-specific binding of synGAP protein to the affinity resin under the conditions of the bead binding assay. We now state this in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a well-written and clearly presented manuscript describing a novel mechanism by which synGAP regulates synaptic function. It is of high importance given the fact that mutations in synGAP in humans leads to non-syndromic intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of synGAP action will help devise therapeutic strategies for these debilitating disorders.</italic> </p><p><italic>While overall this is an exciting manuscript, I have several criticisms that need to be addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) As it stands, the manuscript reads as if all isoforms of synGAP bind PSD-95 through the PDZ-binding domain. However, this is true only for those isoforms containing the α1 c-terminal. The relative abundance of these protein isoforms relative to α 2 (or other isoforms) is not well-described but both localize to synapses. A clear statement that the mechanism described in this manuscript applies to α1 containing isoforms only is warranted. Preferably, instead of referring to synGAP, the authors could refer to synGAPα1 throughout the manuscript. While these changes do not detract from the importance of the main findings of the manuscript, they highlight that many synGAP isoform exist at the synapse that do not contain the sequences necessary to bind PSD-95.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we now refer to synGAP-α1 throughout the manuscript and state that the model applies to that isoform.</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear how they derived the equation to determine the best fit of their data. In several of their panels, the curves do not appear to fit the data well at all. How were the constraints placed on the maxima and minima? For example, for much of their data, the levels of free r-synGAP never reach 0, despite high levels of PDZ concentrations. However, the curves all asymptote to 0. Hence, the equation does not appear to describe the data. Consideration needs to be given to alternative equation that better describe the data to allow accurate</italic> K<sub>D</sub><italic>s to be determined.</italic> </p><p>The equation was derived in earlier papers that we cited and is described in the Biacore handbook. We now state in the Methods and Results that the equation describes an ideal situation in which there is one binding site between ligand and receptor, and in which there is no non-specific binding. We now indicate why the levels of free r-synGAP-α1 do not appear to reach zero (binding between free soluble PDZ domain and PDZ domains on the chip at high concentration). Despite this deviation, the data allow a sufficient fit to calculate a reliable K<sub>D</sub> for a single site. We also explain why we use the term apparent K<sub>D</sub> for the numbers derived for constructs with more than one PDZ domain. Because the two or three PDZ domains have similar, but not identical, affinities the curve will not be fit exactly. There will be multiple solutions to equations derived assuming more than one binding site. Simply put, there are not good ways to use bulk methods to find the affinities of individual sites in a molecule with more than one binding site. The “apparent” K<sub>D</sub> is, nonetheless, a useful description of the summed binding properties of the constructs with multiple sites.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p> <italic>The authors should deal with the minor discussion points outlined below.</italic></p><p> <italic>1) While the data showing an increase in binding of TARPs, LRRTM2 and NLGN2 is consistent with the model proposed, I do not think the authors should be quite so dismissive of the potential of developmental compensation as a contributing factor. Identifying direct vs. indirect effects of a given mutation is always difficult and compensation can happen at all levels, from molecular to circuit. SynGAP<sup>+/-</sup> neurons show numerous physiological in intrinsic and circuit properties, plasticity, morphology etc. How each of these relate directly to the reduction in synGAP is not known. Since the excitability and activity of neurons is altered, so to will the activity-dependent gene expression. Hence, changes in protein expression and localisation may also arise as a secondary effect of changes in activity across development. Therefore, while their data certainly are consistent with their model and their conclusions may even be the most parsimonious explanation for their data since TARPs, LRRTM2 and NLGN2 are all affected, a critical discussion of other possibilities seems warranted.</italic> </p><p>We have added an additional paragraph to the Introduction describing yet another experiment from the literature that is explained by the proposed model. We did this in order to refer to it in a paragraph that we added to the Discussion. In this latter paragraph we discuss the possibility of other effects during development, and we explain why we believe that Occam’s razor favors our model at this time.</p><p> <italic>2) The McMahon et al. manuscript did not make any conclusions about the relative abundance of α1 and α2 isoforms because different antibodies with different binding affinities were used. That said, it is clear that α1 containing synGAPs are abundantly expressed at synapses and that the mechanism proposed here is an important regulator of synGAP function.</italic> </p><p>We made our estimate based on a comparison of the relative ratios of the major α1 and α2 isoforms revealed by the two isoform-specific antibodies compared to the pan-synGAP antibody. This estimate would not depend strongly on the affinities of the different antibodies. Nonetheless, it is a soft estimate and we have removed the citation of McMahon et al. and simply stated the assumption that α1 makes up 30-50% of the synaptic synGAP.</p><p> <italic>3) The Barnett et al. manuscript did not show that, &quot;isoforms of synGAP that do not contain the PDZ ligand are, nevertheless, bound to the PSD.&quot; as stated in the Discussion. Instead they showed that in PSD-95 mutants, synGAP still associated with the PSD using a pansynGAP antibody. They did not distinguish whether these were non-PDZ binding isoforms or α1 containing isoforms that use and non PSD-95 strategy for associating with the PSD. However, McMahon et al. presented mass spec data showing α2 containing isoforms are present at excitatory synapses.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the references for this point and removed the reference to the Barnett paper.</p><p> <italic>4) A clear comparison of the different phosphorylation sites between the Araki et al. and this manuscript would be useful. As far as I can tell, both the Araki et al. and this manuscript are referring to the rat sequence. However, the Araki paper is using the numbering of the A isoform and the Kennedy is using the α1 isoform. These can be seen in the McMahon et al., Supplemental <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>. They encode different N-terminal peptides that differ by 15 amino acids and this leads to the differences in numbering. Is this correct?</italic> </p><p>We have added a key to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> comparing the numbering of sites in our papers, the Araki paper, and also the paper by Lee et al. on Plk2 sites. Lee et al. use numbers from the β isoform.</p><p> <italic>5) It does not appear my original query on statistics was addressed. So I restate it below. Apologies if I missed any clarification.</italic> </p><p> <italic>In general the statistical methods appear appropriate. One clarification, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> could the authors please confirms that n=number of animals rather than number of PSD preps or number of lanes. I believe this is the case, but it is ambiguous.</italic> </p><p>We did add what we thought was a clarification to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. However, we have now made the reference to the units of n more explicit. We note that n does <italic>not</italic> refer to the number of animals here. It refers to the individual measurements of protein ratios from each lane of gels. The number of animals is 6 wild type and 6 het in all cases. It is not customary or usually necessary to make biochemical measurements on individual animals. In behavioral experiments the variation from animal to animal can be large because of the many brain areas involved in expressing behaviors, and the difficulty of controlling context perfectly. Biochemical variation from animal to animal is generally much smaller, and measurements are made as averages of preparations from brain tissue pooled from several animals. In this case, the technical replicates are important because the variation in measurements from individual lanes is high. This variation results from minor differences in loading, immunoblot background, shapes of lanes, small variations in amounts of protein transferred during blotting, etc.</p></body></sub-article></article>
