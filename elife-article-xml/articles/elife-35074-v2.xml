Early in development, B cells randomly rearrange their immunoglobulin genes through VDJ recombination and encounter a series of tolerance checkpoints that serve to remove autoreactive B cell receptors (BCRs) from the repertoire. Strongly autoreactive immature B cells rearrange additional light chains to ‘edit’ their autoreactivity, and they ultimately undergo deletion if this is unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shlomchik, 2008</xref>). Yet, despite stringent counter-selection of autoreactivity, the mature follicular (Fo) B cell compartment retains cells reactive towards endogenous antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wardemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). How these cells are restrained from mounting autoimmune responses is not fully understood.</p><p>We previously described a BAC Tg reporter mouse (Nur77-eGFP) in which GFP expression is under the control of the regulatory region of <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, an immediate early gene rapidly induced by antigen receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mittelstadt and DeFranco, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Winoto and Littman, 2002</xref>). We showed that Nur77-eGFP expression in naïve B cells is proportional to strength of antigenic stimulation and consequently to autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). The most prominent characteristic of GFP<sup>hi</sup> reporter B cells is decreased surface IgM BCR relative to GFP<sup>lo</sup> cells. Goodnow and colleagues first suggested that IgM downregulation may mark autoreactive B cells in the normal mature repertoire shortly after they reported selective downregulation of IgM in the IgHEL (hen egg lysozyme) BCR Tg/soluble HEL Tg model system of B cell autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodnow et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodnow et al., 1989</xref>). Indeed, multiple studies in mice and humans have identified naturally occurring IgD<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>lo</sup> cells as autoreactive and ‘anergic’ or functionally unresponsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirchenbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quách et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). These results corroborate observations with several BCR transgenic model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cambier et al., 2007</xref>). However, whether or how IgM downregulation might constrain autoreactivity remains unclear because naturally-occurring autoreactive B cells maintain high expression of the IgD BCR isotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>IgM and IgD are splice isoforms of a common precursor heavy chain mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore et al., 1981</xref>). While they differ in their Fc domains, both BCR isotypes contain the same antigen-binding domain, as well as identical 3-amino acid cytoplasmic tails, and they pair with Igα/β in order to initiate the canonical BCR signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radaev et al., 2010</xref>). However, the expression pattern of the isotypes differs; IgM expression begins as soon as heavy and light chains recombine early in B cell development, and persists until class switch recombination occurs following B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Cerutti, 2010</xref>). IgD is uniquely co-expressed with IgM during a narrow developmental window on late transitional and mature naïve Fo B cells as a result of alternate splicing regulated by the zinc-finger protein ZFP318 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pioli et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that IgD may play a critical role specifically in mature naïve B cells. Initial characterization of IgM- and IgD-deficient mice revealed only mild phenotypes and substantial redundancy; each isotype could mediate B cell development, initiate antibody responses to T-dependent and -independent immunization, and induce normal levels of steady-state serum IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lutz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nitschke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roes and Rajewsky, 1993</xref>). This is consistent with prior studies in BCR transgenic model systems demonstrating that each isotype alone can mediate B cell development, deletion, and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brink et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>IgM and IgD differ structurally; IgD has a much longer, flexible hinge region linking its Fab and Fc regions than IgM does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Cerutti, 2010</xref>). Recently, Ubelhart, Jumaa, and colleagues demonstrated that a short and inflexible hinge confers upon IgM the unique capacity to signal in response to monovalent antigens, while both isotypes can respond to multivalent antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Übelhart et al., 2015</xref>). However, the Goodnow lab subsequently showed that IgHEL Tg splenic B cells expressing either the IgD or IgM BCR exclusively could mobilize calcium in response to soluble HEL antigen in vitro, and each isotype can mediate a common gene expression program characteristic of anergy in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it remains unclear whether IgM and IgD BCRs expressed in an unrestricted B cell repertoire differentially sense bona fide endogenous antigens in vivo, particularly as the identity and nature of such antigens is largely unknown and not restricted to soluble monovalent antigens. For example, 5–10% of circulating naïve B cells in healthy humans express the well-characterized unmutated and autoreactive human heavy chain V-segment IGHV4-34, and these cells exhibit anergy, selective IgM downregulation, and recognize cell-surface antigens on erythrocytes and B cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quách et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reed et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We and others previously hypothesized that downregulation of IgM on Fo B cells might serve to restrain their response to endogenous antigen. Conversely, high expression of IgD on these cells might play a ‘tolerogenic’ role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). To determine how IgM and IgD differentially regulate B cell responses to endogenous antigens, we generated Nur77-eGFP reporter mice deficient for either IgM or IgD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lutz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nitschke et al., 1993</xref>). Using this reporter of antigen-dependent signaling, we show that IgD is less sensitive than IgM to bona fide endogenous antigens in vivo despite higher surface expression and robust responsiveness to receptor ligation in vitro. Indeed, marginal zone (MZ) and B1a cells that express IgD but lack IgM induce less Nur77-eGFP than WT, and this is not attributable to repertoire differences. To further support these observations, we examine a series of cell fate decisions for which in vivo BCR signaling requirements have been previously defined. We show that IgD drives a pattern of development consistent with reduced endogenous antigen recognition, favoring MZ B cell fate and disfavoring B1a cell fate. Similarly, IgD alone is less efficient than IgM at driving SLPC expansion in response to endogenous antigens, a process that requires robust BCR signaling. However, IgD is sufficient for germinal center (GC) B cell differentiation. Our data suggest that reduced endogenous antigen sensing (i.e. signal transduction in response to antigen binding) by the IgD BCR isotype shunts autoreactive IgD<sup>hi</sup> IgM<sup>lo</sup> Fo B cells away from differentiation into SLPCs. We propose that predominant IgD expression maintains the quiescence of autoreactive B cells in response to chronic endogenous antigen stimulation, and limits autoantibody secretion in the context of rapid immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous antigen is both necessary and sufficient for expression of Nur77-eGFP reporter in B cells in vivo</title><p>We previously showed that antigen recognition was both necessary and sufficient for Nur77-eGFP reporter expression by B cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, reporter expression reflects endogenous antigen recognition in vivo. Conversely, under steady-state conditions in vivo, the Nur77-eGFP reporter does not reflect signaling through other receptors expressed in B cells; indeed, loss of either CD40, or TLR3, 7, and 9 signaling has no effect on reporter expression in B cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, neither BAFF, nor IL-4, nor CXCR4-dependent signaling can regulate reporter expression in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). To further confirm that Nur77 expression in naïve B cells under steady state conditions is not regulated by microbial stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (e.g. TLRs 1, 2, 4, 6, and the TLR-4-like molecule RP105), we studied mice raised under either germ-free conditions or conventional specific-pathogen-free conditions. We observed no induction of endogenous Nur77 protein in splenic B cells or endogenous <italic>Nr4a1</italic> transcript in splenocytes in the presence of commensal flora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

We therefore sought to take advantage of the Nur77-eGFP reporter in order to probe the responsiveness of a diverse BCR repertoire of mature B cells expressing either IgM or IgD alone to the vast range of endogenous antigens they may encounter in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35074.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IgD expression enables a dynamic range of IgM responsiveness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFP expression in mature Fo splenic B cells (CD19+CD23+CD93-) from Nur77-eGFP BAC Tg reporter mice with either a wild-type BCR repertoire (left), or harboring IgHEL Tg specific for the cognate antigen HEL (hen egg lysozyme) in the absence (middle), or presence (right) of endogenous cognate antigen driven by soluble HEL Tg.

The variation in surface IgM expression across the B cell repertoire is profound, spanning a 100-fold range. However, because IgD is expressed at high and invariant levels in all WT naïve Fo B cells, total surface BCR, unlike IgM, has little dynamic range across the WT repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>To explore how IgM and IgD differentially regulate B cells reactive to endogenous antigens, we generated Nur77-eGFP mice deficient for either IgM or IgD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lutz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nitschke et al., 1993</xref>). In <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, all B cells express IgD alone prior to class switch recombination (CSR), and in <italic>IgD<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, all B cells express IgM alone prior to CSR. We observed that IgM is still downregulated on <italic>IgD<sup>−/−</sup></italic> GFP<sup>hi</sup> Fo B cells, but the dynamic range of IgM expression is highly restricted relative to the broad range observed on WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that IgM down-modulation on GFP<sup>hi</sup> reporter B cells largely accounts for impaired signaling through IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). However, the narrow dynamic range of IgM on IgD-deficient cells renders reporter B cells unable to fine-tune signaling through the IgM BCR across the GFP repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, IgD-mediated signaling is not altered across the GFP repertoire in the presence or absence of IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As a result, reduced responsiveness of GFP<sup>hi</sup> B cells is most profound in B cells that express the IgM isotype in the presence of IgD. This suggests that IgD expression may be necessary to establish and/or maintain a broad and functionally dynamic range of surface IgM expression across the B cell repertoire. This is consistent with a previously proposed survival function for the IgD BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roes and Rajewsky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic> follicular B cells express more surface BCR than <italic>IgD<sup>−/−</sup></italic> follicular B cells, but similar Nur77-eGFP</title><p>Deletion of either the IgM or the IgD BCR isotype results in compensatory upregulation of the remaining isotype. This may be due in part to a change in competition for pairing with Igα/β heterodimers, which is essential for trafficking of IgM to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hombach et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic> B cells express about twice as much surface BCR as <italic>IgD<sup>−/−</sup></italic> B cells, as measured by surface anti-light chain staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). Nevertheless, distribution of Nur77-eGFP expression across the naïve B cell repertoire is nearly identical in <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>IgD<sup>−/−</sup></italic> Fo B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Further, at every level of Nur77-eGFP, cells that express IgD alone require more surface BCR to drive an equivalent amount of GFP compared to cells that express IgM alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that on a per-receptor basis, IgD BCR may be less efficient at inducing Nur77-eGFP in response to endogenous antigens. Importantly, this is not attributable to differential dependence upon IgM or IgD expression for signaling via CXCR4 or downstream of canonical TLR ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>IgD BCR crosslinking induces robust signaling in vitro</title><p>Because IgD drives less Nur77-eGFP per receptor than IgM in vivo, we wanted to determine whether there were defects in signal transduction downstream of IgD.

BAFF overexpression ‘unrestricts’ the BCR repertoire by removing competition for survival, thereby reducing both positive and negative selection pressures and permitting cells with either insufficient or excessive BCR signaling to persist in the repertoire, resulting in a massively expanded MZ compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stadanlick and Cancro, 2008</xref>). Importantly, BAFF does not directly regulate reporter GFP expression, and therefore GFP reflects endogenous antigen stimulation on this genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zikherman et al., 2012</xref>). In BAFF Tg mice, IgD-only MZ cells expressed much less GFP than those expressing IgM alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This was not explained by differences in surface receptor levels between these populations as they are comparable on this genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, IgD-only cells with low GFP and IgM-only cells with high GFP appear to be preferentially rescued in mice with excess BAFF, suggesting that distinct BCR repertoires, far from accounting for GFP differences between IgM-only and IgD-only MZ B cells, actually obscure these differences. Conversely, either ‘fixing’ or unrestricting the BCR repertoire unmasks impaired GFP upregulation by IgD relative to IgM.</p><p>As a result of allelic exclusion of the heavy chain locus during B cell development, <italic>IgM<sup>+/−</sup></italic> heterozygous mice develop two genetically distinct sets of B cells in which half express only IgD and the other half express both IgM and IgD.

Indeed, B1a cells are modestly reduced in IgM-deficient mice, while MZ B cells are modestly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Because serum IgM deficiency leads to increased B1a numbers, we assessed B1a and MZ B cell development in a competitive setting to isolate the cell-intrinsic effects of IgM and IgD BCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boes et al., 1998</xref>).

In contrast, IgD-only B cells preferentially populate the MZ B cell compartment in competition with IgM-only B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data are consistent with a signal strength model of B1a/MZ B cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and this suggests that in vivo signaling, antigen recognition, or both are reduced in IgD-only B cells.

While B cells expressing IgM (of either IgH locus) generated IgG2a/c anti-dsDNA, IgD-only B cells were relatively protected from generating anti-dsDNA antibodies, even at late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>).

High and invariant IgD expression provides survival signals to allow these autoreactive cells to be maintained in the repertoire. Upon activation by foreign antigen, the least autoreactive cells receive strong signals through IgM and can quickly differentiate into plasma cells with little danger of autoimmunity.

This weak signaling shunts IgD<sup>hi</sup> IgM<sup>lo</sup> cells into the germinal center where they can be ‘redeemed’ via somatic hypermutation, as proposed by Goodnow and colleagues.

Next we tracked the generation of IgG1<sup>+</sup> PCs by detecting allotype [a] or allotype [b] IgG1. In contrast to the GC response, IgD-only B cells were significantly disfavored in this compartment, although the defect was less severe than that observed in <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, which lack serum IgM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). To control for differences in the VDJ locus, we performed this experiment using <italic>IgH<sup>a/b</sup></italic> control mice and observed no significant differences between allotypes, implying that BCR isotypes rather than VDJ locus accounted for our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to impaired IgG1 SLPC responses by IgD-only B cells, we observed that IgD-only B cells were able to generate unswitched plasma cells in response to SRBC immunization in both non-competitive and competitive settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Unswitched PC numbers correlate well with MZ B cell numbers in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, MZ B cells efficiently generate short-lived unswitched plasma cells even in response to TD-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song and Cerny, 2003</xref>). We therefore suspect that IgG1 PCs emanate from the Fo B cell compartment, while the unswitched PC response may originate in the MZ B cell compartment. Normal SLPC generation by IgM-deficient MZ B cells in response to immunization would be consistent with previously reported normal T-independent II responses in IgM-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lutz et al., 1998</xref>). However, we cannot exclude a contribution of follicular-derived PCs that have failed to class switch to IgG1.</p><p>We sought to confirm that the IgG1<sup>+</sup> PC defect was generalizable to other T-dependent immunogens. The B cell response to NP hapten is stereotyped and makes predominant use of the VH186.2 heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loh et al., 1983</xref>). We therefore immunized both <italic>IgM<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>IgH<sup>a/b</sup></italic> mice with NP hapten conjugated to rabbit serum albumin (NP-RSA) in order to control for differences in VDJ locus. Although allotype [a] makes a less robust response to NP than allotype [b], we normalized responses of IgD-only cells to wild type allotype [a] cells and found that GC responses at early time points were intact, but IgG1<sup>+</sup> PCs and NP-specific IgG1 titers were significantly reduced 7–8 days after immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–I</xref>). These data suggest that IgD-only follicular B cells are competent to enter the GC, but they have defects in adopting the SLPC fate (or class-switching) in response to T-dependent immunization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We and others previously hypothesized that a major tolerance strategy employed by autoreactive Fo B cells is selective downregulation of IgM. However, since all Fo B cells express a high and invariant amount of surface IgD, it was unclear whether and how loss of IgM expression could affect B cell responses to antigenic stimulation. It was recently reported that IgM, but not IgD, is uniquely responsive to monomeric antigens due to a short and inflexible linker region coupling the Fab and Fc portions of IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Übelhart et al., 2015</xref>). This could account for selective quiescence of mildly autoreactive B cells to monovalent endogenous antigens. However, the identity and structural characteristics of endogenous antigens are not well understood, and include cell-surface antigens on the surface of red cells and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quách et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reed et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, recent work from Goodnow and colleagues showed that HEL-specific IgD BCR, when expressed on primary mouse splenocytes, can indeed mobilize calcium in vitro and can mediate gene expression changes in vivo in response to monovalent cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How do our observations help move beyond and reconcile the seemingly contradictory published work on antigen sensing by IgM and IgD? In vitro signaling studies of HEL-specific BCRs by the Jumaa and Goodnow labs differ in several important ways; the former work assesses calcium signaling in pre-B cells that lack Slp-65 expression, while the latter studies splenic B cells with a considerably more mature phenotype. In addition, differences in reagents or strength of stimulus may also contribute to opposing conclusions. Our data suggests that the reduced sensitivity of IgD to bona fide endogenous antigen may lie somewhere between these two extremes; we find that IgD can sense endogenous antigens, just less efficiently than IgM. Consistent with this conclusion, both HEL-specific IgM and IgD BCRs can mediate B cell anergy and drive a common gene expression program in response to chronic high affinity soluble antigen exposure in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brink et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that B cells expressing IgD BCR alone inefficiently sense endogenous antigens, and exhibit impaired in vivo cell fate decisions that are dependent upon BCR signal strength. This is epitomized by dramatic skewing of IgD-only B cells away from the B1a and towards the MZ fate in a competitive setting. Importantly, signal transduction mediated by the IgD BCR in response to anti-Igκ stimulation in vitro is intact for all assayed parameters, suggesting that antigen sensing and signal initiation rather than signal transduction downstream of IgD is impaired. We propose that this impaired sensing is conferred by structural properties of IgD, either through direct binding of antigen and signal transduction through the BCR or through differential pairing with co-receptors that directly modulate the BCR signaling pathway.</p><p>Characterization of bona fide endogenous antigens that drive Nur77-eGFP expression in the polyclonal repertoire is necessary in order to further dissect the biophysical basis for reduced antigen sensing by IgD in vivo. These antigens may not be exclusively restricted to those that are germline-encoded or generated by host enzymes; rather they may include non-inflammatory antigens taken up through the gastrointestinal tract and recognized by specific BCRs. At least some relevant endogenous antigens may be membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quách et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reed et al., 2016</xref>), and recent studies have illustrated the importance of membrane spreading, contraction, and stiffness discrimination in BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shaheen et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that relevant endogenous antigens are presented in contexts that do not efficiently trigger signaling through the flexible structure of IgD. This might explain the discrepancy between weak responsiveness of IgD to endogenous antigens in vivo and strong signaling in response to crosslinking antibodies in vitro.</p><p>An alternative mechanism is that differential clustering of co-receptors with IgD and IgM might influence how BCR signals are integrated in vivo. It has long been proposed that there are not only quantitative, but also qualitative differences between IgM and IgD signaling. Early studies of IgM and IgD signaling in cell lines suggested that kinetics but not quality of signaling triggered by each isotype differed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Reth, 1995</xref>). However, we have been unable to identify a difference in kinetics of BCR signaling in primary IgM- or IgD-deficient B cells in vitro. More recently, studies using TIRF, dSTORM, and PLA (proximity ligation assay) showed that IgD is more densely clustered on the cell surface than IgM, and these distinct IgM- and IgD-containing ‘islands’ are differentially associated with co-receptors such as CD19 in resting and activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kläsener et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maity et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mattila et al., 2013</xref>). Since function of the ITIM-containing inhibitory co-receptor CD22 depends on its ability to efficiently access the BCR, differences in cluster density of IgM and IgD might render them differentially sensitive to such inhibitory tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gasparrini et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that differential association with such co-receptors contributes to differences in the function of the IgM and IgD BCRs in vivo by modulating BCR signal strength, or by selectively perturbing specific downstream signaling events.</p><p>In addition to B cell co-receptors that have long been known to directly modulate canonical BCR signaling, a growing list of immunoreceptors expressed on B cells have more recently been shown to require expression of the BCR for optimal function; Becker et al. have shown that expression of the IgD BCR is critical for CXCR4-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2017</xref>). This may influence the biology of B cells expressing only IgM; indeed, CXCR4-deficient B cells exhibit reduced plasma cell migration from spleen to bone marrow (but intact splenic SLPC responses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nie et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, defective CXCR4 signaling in IgM-only B cells could not account for reduced Nur77-eGFP expression in IgD-only B cells because reporter expression is insensitive to CXCR4 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Nor would it account for skewed cell fate decisions by IgD-only B cells in competition with wild type B cells, both of which retain intact CXCR4 signaling. B cell responses to TLR4 ligands also require expression of the BCR, but importantly, canonical TLR ligands do not exhibit selective dependence on either the IgM or the IgD isotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Finally, recent work establishes a role for the Fc-receptor for IgM in modulating B cell responses, and could therefore play a role downstream of serum IgM that is absent in <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2017b</xref>). We control for this effect by confirming that all phenotypes in this study are cell-intrinsic and independent of secreted IgM.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that strong BCR signals favor SLPC over GC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paus et al., 2006</xref>). This is thought to be transcriptionally mediated at least in part by loss of Ets1 expression and induction of Irf4 in a BCR signal-strength dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that IgM and IgD are each sufficient to drive GC responses, but IgD is less efficient at promoting SLPC fate in response to endogenous antigens, implying that IgD<sup>hi</sup> IgM<sup>lo</sup> B cells may similarly be shunted away from SLPC responses. This discrepancy is unlikely to be attributable to differences in antigen capture and presentation by the IgM and IgD BCRs, as GC entry is highly T cell-help dependent. Instead, we provide evidence to suggest that reduced antigen-dependent BCR signals are transduced in vivo by IgD. We show that, in the absence of Lyn, Ets1 downregulation and unswitched PC expansion require the IgM BCR. <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice phenocopy <italic>Btk<sup>lo</sup>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice; both strains are protected from Ets1-downregulation, PC expansion, and anti-dsDNA autoantibody production in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayeux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whyburn et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests that robust Btk-dependent Ets-1 downregulation in response to endogenous antigens relies upon efficient antigen sensing by the IgM BCR and is important to drive unswitched PC expansion in the absence of Lyn. It will be important to explore whether a similar mechanism accounts for impaired IgG1<sup>+</sup> SLPC responses by Lyn-sufficient B cells with low or absent IgM expression.</p><p>We propose that the purpose (and consequence) of IgM downregulation on autoreactive B cells is to limit their direct differentiation into SLPCs in response to chronic endogenous antigen stimulation, and prevent secretion of auto-antibodies in the context of an acute humoral immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, IgD is sufficient to drive germinal center differentiation without the contribution of IgM. This has been well-demonstrated both in the present study as well as prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lutz et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, not only are autoreactive IgD<sup>hi</sup> IgM<sup>lo</sup> B cells competent to enter the germinal center, they appear to do so with greater efficiency, perhaps due in part to improved survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sabouri et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth emphasizing that selection pressures and tolerance mechanisms operating within the germinal center must independently ensure that somatic hypermutation both abolishes germ-line-encoded autoreactivity and prevents de novo acquisition of autoreactivity. Goodnow and colleagues recently showed that autoreactive BCRs can indeed be ‘redeemed’ by somatic hypermutation, providing proof-of-principle that entry of autoreactive B cells into the GC does not necessarily pose a risk to the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sabouri et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Why, though, are autoreactive B cells preserved in the periphery and not deleted? Why is IgD necessary at all? One suggestion is that such BCRs are retained in the pre-immune B cell compartment to fill holes in the repertoire, and that IgD is essential for their survival; indeed, it has been shown that loss of IgD expression, with or without compensatory upregulation of IgM, leads to loss of mature naïve B cells in competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roes and Rajewsky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabouri et al., 2016</xref>). We similarly find that IgD-only B cells have a profound competitive advantage in the follicular B cell compartment relative to IgM-only (but not WT) B cells, implying an obligate survival function for the IgD isotype BCR. This is consistent with a well-appreciated pro-survival function of the BCR as demonstrated by Rajewsky and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 1997</xref>). Since IgD expression is needed to keep IgM<sup>lo</sup> B cells alive, this may explain why IgD expression facilitates a broad dynamic range of IgM expression across the B cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), allowing B cells to fine-tune the intensity of their SLPC responses according to their autoreactivity. IgD expression on IgM<sup>lo</sup> cells could serve to mediate antigen capture and participation in T-dependent immune responses, while simultaneously limiting SLPC responses as we show here.</p><p>We demonstrate here for the first time that IgD BCRs sense endogenous antigen more weakly than IgM BCRs in vivo, are inefficient at driving SLPC responses to endogenous antigens, and thereby may function to divert autoreactive follicular B cells from direct PC differentiation. We propose that this property of the IgD BCR limits generation of auto-reactive antibodies in the context of immediate humoral immune responses. Taken together with recent work from the Jumaa and Goodnow groups, we propose a unified model of how IgM downregulation in the face of high IgD expression regulates the fate of naïve autoreactive B cells in vivo while retaining their contribution to the mature BCR repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (v9.7.6) software (Treestar Incorporated, Ashland, OR). Statistical analysis and graphs were generated using Prism v6 (GraphPad Software, Inc). Figures were prepared using Illustrator CS6 v16.0.0. Median Igk levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) were calculated for 200 equally sized ‘bins’ spanning the Nur77-eGFP spectrum using Canopy v1.4.1 (Enthought); source code is provided, and parameters can be modified to condense any 2D FACS plot for comparisons of multiple samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistics and replicates</title><p>We define biological replicates as independent analyses of cells isolated from different mice of the same genotype, and we define technical replicates as analyses of cells isolated from the same mouse and used in the same experiment. When technical replicates were used, we averaged them to calculate a value for the biological replicate. All reported values and statistics correspond to biological replicates only, and all ‘n’ values reported reflect the number of biological replicates. Wherever MFIs are directly compared, we collected all samples in a single experiment to avoid potential error that could arise from fluctuations in our flow cytometers. In some instances, MFI ratios were compiled from different experiments for statistical purposes, but qualitative findings were consistent experiment to experiment. As our panels reproducibly generated flow plots with well-defined populations, population sizes were calculated from data compiled from different experiments. When comparing two groups, we employed Welch’s t test, which is more stringent than Student’s t test and does not assume that the groups have the same standard deviation. We used paired difference t tests when studying parameters in allotype-heterozygous mice that are sensitive to cell-extrinsic factors (e.g. dose of immunogen or severity of autoimmune disease). When comparing three genotypes (e.g. receptor levels on WT vs. <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup></italic>vs. <italic>IgD<sup>−/− </sup></italic>B cells), we used one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test to calculate p values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Intracellular Nur77, pErk and pS6 staining</title><p>Ex vivo or following stimulation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 100% methanol, and stained with anti-Nur77, anti-pErk, or anti-pS6 followed by lineage markers and secondary antibodies if needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intracellular plasma cell staining</title><p>Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in BD Perm/Wash.

Sera were diluted serially, and total IgM and total IgD were detected with anti-IgM-biotin (eBioscience) and SA-HRP (Southern Biotech) or anti-IgD-HRP (American Research Products). dsDNA plates were generated by serially coating plates with 100 μg/mL poly-L-lysine (SigmaAldrich) and 0.2 U/mL poly dA-dT (SigmaAldrich) in 0.1 M Tris-HCL pH 7.6. Sera were diluted serially on dsDNA plates, and autoantibodies were detected with IgG2[a]-biotin, IgG2a[b]-biotin, and SA-HRP. NP plates were generated by coating 96-well plates with 1 μg/mL NP-BSA (Biosearch, conjugation ratio 23) in PBS. Sera from NP-RSA immunized and unimmunized mice were diluted serially, and NP-specific IgG1 was detected with IgG1[a]-biotin, IgG1[b]-biotin, and SA-HRP. All ELISA plates were developed with TMB (Sigma) and stopped with 2N sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. For total IgM, total IgD, and dsDNA IgG2a, OD values or OD ratios were calculated and displayed. For NP-specific IgG1, titers were calculated at OD = 0.2 and normalized such that the average IgG1[a]/IgG1[b] ratio in immunized Balb/c-C57BL/6 F1 mice equals 1.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>B cell purification and western blots</title><p>Splenic B cells were purified by negative selection with a MACS kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotech, cat# 130-090-862).

Nur77-GFP mice have thus emerged as a useful tool to study B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling in vivo.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors aimed to answer the long-standing question why mature B cells express two BCR isotypes, IgM and IgD, with identical antigen-specificity, and how these two isotypes impose B cell tolerance in vivo.</p><p>A major issue for me is the clarity of the present manuscript. Although the initial question is clear and well defined, a good rational flow along the experiments, figures and the text is missing. Also the way the data are presented is highly confusing and prevents comparison between figures. The manuscript clearly needs an effort to synthesize and clarify the message.</p><p>The main message of the manuscript is that IgD-BCR signal strength is reduced when compared to IgM-BCR signal strength only in vivo upon recognition of autoantigens driving differentiation (Figure 1 and MZ versus B1a cells under competitive conditions, Figure 4) or for the generation of SLPC (Figure 7). In contrast, in vitro (Figure 2), upon immunization (Figure 7) and upon recognition of auto-antigens in the <italic>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> background (Figure 5A-B) the signals of IgD-BCR are as competitive as the signals from IgM-BCR. Taken together, these results are confusing and point out to microenvironment, cell-differentiation stage, co-receptor expression and crosstalk between receptors in a given situation as reasons modulating the signals through the BCR. To conclude that &quot;IgD-BCR sensing antigen is impaired&quot; is an over-interpretation of the results, a not-justified generalization and neglects a major part of the results exposed in this manuscript.</p><p>1) The whole study is based on the observation that Follicular B cells in the spleen are GFP+, indicating that they have been activated at some point during development (T2/T3 stage) by any of the receptors that induce the activation of the Nur77 locus (BCR, CD40, TLR9, TLR4…). The authors claimed already back in the first publication (Zikherman et al., 2012) that GFP positivity results from BCR signals upon encounter with autoantigens because GFP positivity is significantly reduced in BCR transgenic settings (IgHEL Tg), and again increased in the presence of antigen (IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg). However, if the encounter with autoantigens drives GFP positivity, why are there not GFP+ cells within the immature cells in the BM? At any given moment, some immature B cells are signaling through the BCR during B cell selection, one should expect a proportion of GFP+ cells in the BM. Moreover, it has been broadly demonstrated that BCR driven signals are crucial for B cell development, why are there not GFP+ B cells during B cell development? Is it possible that GFP positivity is the result of a combination of different signals happening from the T2/T3 stage on, including also BCR signals in the IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg settings? The authors discard CD40; TLR3,7,9 (<italic>Unc93b1</italic> mice, this information should be found at least in the figure legend); TLR7; IL4; BAFF and CXCR4 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Zikherman et al., 2012). However, an obvious candidate is TLR4, no data are shown using either LPS stimulation in vitro, <italic>TLR4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice or even better by housing the mice in pathogen free/sterile conditions. Indeed amount of mRNA of TLR4 increases from the T1 stage on to get a maximum at the Fo stage. Other receptors which levels of mRNA are upregulated from the transitional stage on are TLR6, TLR1, CD22….</p><p>2) In line with the comment before, why most of Fo cells (around 90%) are GFP+ also in the WT settings? This high percentage is expected in the IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg setting. However, in the WT situation, if GFP positivity is the consequence of autoantigen encounter, this would mean that most of B cell emigrants from the BM carry autoreactive receptors. Do the authors suggest that tolerance in mice is established mainly in the peripheral checkpoint (T2/T3)? This will be in contrast with the data in humans in which both checkpoints reduced the percentage of self-reactive BCR to half, and only 40% of new emigrants carry self-reactive BCRs, percentage that is reduced to 20% after the peripheral checkpoint.</p><p>Taken together the last two points, it seems true that autoantigens are sufficient to drive Nur77-GFP expression as claimed by the authors (IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg setting already reported in 2012), but I am not convinced at this stage that all GFP+ cells in the Fo stage are GPF+ because BCR signaling as consequence of autoantigen encounters. I rather think that GFP accumulation is the result of several activation signals from diverse receptors, including the BCR but not exclusively.</p><p>3). Because an inverse correlation between GFP levels and IgM expression is observed, the authors propose that IgM is downregulated as consequence of autoantigen encounter and therefore, activation of autoreactive B cells is prevented. The slope that correlates IgM and GFP expression in the IgM-only mice is reduced compared to the slope in WT, why is this? In other words, why in the absence of IgD, IgM cannot be optimally downregulated? In this the case also upon anti-IgM stimulation ex vivo?</p><p>In contrast to IgM, IgD levels are invariant with GFP expression, this would mean that in IgD mice GFP high cells could be easily re-activated driving autoimmunity, is this the case? The authors claim that these cells cannot be optimally activated, but the total GFP levels are the same, proving that activation was equally strong. Can IgD be downregulated upon stimulation ex vivo in the IgD-only B cells?</p><p>4) In Figure 1F, the authors showed that for a given GFP signal more IgD-BCRs are needed than IgM-BCRs, proposing that IgD-BCRs do not signal properly in vivo (supposedly, in response to antigens). Taking in consideration recent data regarding the nanoscale distribution of IgM and IgD-BCRs in protein islands, how are the levels of co-receptors such as CD19, CD22, CD20 in WT, IgM-only and IgD-only? Are these co-receptors excluded or included in the IgM protein island in the absence of IgD? Are these coreceptors modulating differently IgM-BCR and IgD-BCR signals? Differences in co-receptor levels and/or composition of these protein islands might explain why IgD stimulation in vitro, which happens solely by the BCR, is strong (Figure 2).</p><p>5) What exactly does this mean for the authors, &quot;sensing of endogenous antigen&quot;? or just &quot;sensing of antigen&quot;?</p><p>6) It is unclear to me the significance of the experiments shown in Figure 3. Both B1a and MZ B cells express preferentially IgM-BCRs. Are they generated to the same extent in IgD-only mice? If yes, is this not probing that IgD-BCR in vivo signals as efficient as IgM-BCR at least to drive differentiation of these cells? However, IgD-only B1a and M Z cells showed reduced levels of Nur77-GFP ex vivo. Again, how is the expression of co-receptors and especially of innate-like receptors in IgD-only versus WT or IgM-only B1a and MZ B cells? In these two populations all cells are GFP+ cells, it seems counterintuitive that all cells that populate the periphery are autoreactive… In the IgD-only B1a cells there is indeed a GFP- population, the authors should compare the repertoire of these GFP- cells to GFP+ cells to support they claims.</p><p>7) As cited by the authors, a link between BCR signal strength and cell fate has been established some years ago, in which weak BCR signals will allow MZ B cell generation but prevent B1 cell generation. In contrast, strong signals might favor B1 generation/maintained. No major differences were observed in B1 or MZ cell generation between IgM-only, IgD-only and WT. However, under competitive conditions, IgD-only B cells fill up preferentially the MZ B cell compartment and are unable to differentiate to B1a cells. How are these cells phenotypically? MZ are BM-derived while B1a cells are mainly fetal liver derived and long lived. It has been proposed that in B2 cells IgD provide survival signals. Is it possible that B1 cells required survival signals via IgM and that IgD cannot provide survival signals or self-renewal signals? Is it really a matter of signal strength or of signal quality? How is this piece of data related to autoantigen recognition?</p><p>8) Which bibliography supports the following sentence &quot;endogenous auto-antigens may differ significantly from model antigens&quot;? The authors used HEL as model antigen and as endogenous auto-antigen, is the model antigen HEL not differing from endogenous auto-antigens?</p><p>9) Similar to the results obtained in vitro, the results in the <italic>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice support that both IgM and IgD-BCR provide sufficient signals for B cell activation (CD86, CD69) and for GC differentiation against the theory of the authors that &quot;IgD-BCR sensing&quot; of antigen is impaired.</p><p>10) Regarding the production of autoantibodies in Figure 5, why the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also increased in the WT cells that co-exist with the IgM-only B cells? Indeed, at 25 weeks the basal levels are elevated in all the mice compared to all the other situations. It is possible that other receptors, such as germline-encoded receptors, cooperate only with IgM-BCR to break tolerance and not with IgD? This will be independent of BCR strength but dependent of crosstalk between receptors. This crosstalk has been described at least for TLR4/IgM-BCR and RP105/IgM-BCR.</p><p>11) In Figure 6A, how are the levels of Ets1 in IgM-only? And in Figure 6B, how is intracellular IgD in WT or IgM-only mice? I do not agree with the interpretation of Figure 6E, <italic>IgM<sup>−/−</sup>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> have elevated IgD serum levels when compared to <italic>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic>.</p><p>12) Why are IgD-only less competitive to enter the GC but disfavored to produced SLPC responses? Is this because BCR-strength as proposed by the authors or by the effect of isotype-specific interactions with co-receptors?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors present an extensive body of work comparing the development and responsiveness of polyclonal B cells capable of expressing either IgM or IgD BCRs prior to undergoing class switching. Whilst there is an extensive literature comparing the functional capabilities of these two (normally) co-expressed classes of BCR, this particular study examines a variety of readouts not previously examined, in particular the apparent sensing of endogenous self-antigens. Despite some concern about the different strain origins of the original IgM and IgD KO lines, the authors appear to control for this adequately throughout the study.</p><p>Overall I found the experiments to be well-performed and thoughtfully interpreted. The data presented here go some way to resolve recent controversies in the field and as such provide a valuable source of new information to help resolve the longstanding question of why naive, resting B cells co-express IgM and IgD BCRs.</p><p>I have just a couple of specific points:</p><p>1) In the SRBC-induced responses, did the IgM KO mice possess a general deficiency in PC production apart from IgG1-switched PCs e.g. in producing unswitched PCs?</p><p>2) Similarly, was the production of switched (e.g. IgG1+) GC B cells different between the IgM-only and IgD-only B cells?</p><p>It would be important to add this information to clarify the nature of the defect involved.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;IgM and IgD B cell receptors differentially respond to endogenous antigens and control B cell fate&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

I appreciate the determination of the investigators to address the issues that arose during the revision process and thank the authors for their efforts.</p><p>One of my major points in the previous revision round was whether the Nur77-GFP positive B cells were indeed positive because activation of the BCR by self-antigens (as claimed by the authors) or by a combination of signals by the BCR and/or additional receptors expressed on the surface of B cells.</p><p>The authors have appropriately answered part of this question by showing that some of these receptors do not activate expression of Nur77 (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, CXCR4). Other receptors, such as TLR4, TLR9 and TLR1/2 do activate expression of Nur77-GFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>). However, the authors demonstrate here (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) that upregulation of Nur77-GFP by these receptors is equal between IgM-only and IgD-only B cells (although the concentration of ligands chosen are too high). The authors also show in the new version, that endogenous levels of Nur77 transcripts in B cells are equally elevated between Germ-free mice and SPF, arguing that Nur77 signals in B cells do not from microbial stimulation (although these signals might come from the endotoxin present in the chow, or did the authors used endotoxin-free chow?). Moreover, the levels of endogenous Nur77 transcripts were equally elevated between MyD88KO and MyD88WT peritoneal B1a cells. Here, I would like to ask why peritoneal B1a cells were chosen and not splenic B cells as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-E?</p><p>However, I do not agree that the Nur77-GFP signals in B cells are the consequence of self-antigen (self-antigen defined by an antigen encoded by the DNA of the self-organism) stimulation by the BCR. I disagree with the authors using self-antigen (subsection “Cell-intrinsic skewing of B cell development by the IgM and IgD BCRs”, first paragraph), endogenous auto-antigen (subsection “Either IgD or IgM BCR is sufficient to mediate polyclonal B cell activation and germinal center differentiation in <italic>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice”, first paragraph) and antigen encounters in vivo (subsection “IgD BCRs sense endogenous antigens less efficiently than IgM BCRs”) as synonymous. I fully agree that Nur77-GFP signals are upregulated upon BCR stimulation by antigen and that antigen is necessary to drive Nur77-GFP expression in vivo. But I do not agree that self-antigen is necessary to drive Nur77-GFP expression in vivo. My arguments are:</p><p>• Nur77-GFP signals are highly upregulated when B cells leave the sterile/defined microenvironment of the BM. Nur77-GFP expression timely occurs when cells encounter &quot;antigens&quot; in the periphery, and those antigens activate the BCR. But these antigens are not necessarily self-antigens, they can be food-antigens, LPS (from the chow, antibodies against LPS are broadly recognized), and other non-pathological or non-inflammatory antigens recognized by the BCR. These antigens might activate B cells to upregulate Nur77, but in the absence of T cell help or an inflammatory milieu will not drive an immune response.</p><p>• The results with the IgHEL BCR Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) are fully compatible with the above-described scenario. These mice express a clonal BCR not able to recognize any self-antigen, but also, not able to recognize any of the possible non-inflammatory antigens that will be encountered in the periphery, for this reason the signal of Nur77 is lower. This interpretation is also compatible with higher level of Nur77-GFP in HEL Tg cells exposed to cognate HEL antigen that in WT. Related to this, the results show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref> are also compatible with this scenario since Nur77-GFP upregulation is reduced in IgHEL BCR Tg mice in respond to LPS (small reduction), CpG (clear at lower concentration), and to Pam3CSK4 (visible at both concentrations). A possible interpretation of these results is that the HEL Tg BCR is not able to recognize epitopes in those substances that, together with the corresponding TLR, aid to activate Nur77-GFP in B cells.</p><p>• The results with the VH3H9 Tg mice (Author response image Figure 3) are also fully compatible with the above-described scenario, since the κ+ cells (not recognizing endogenous DNA) also up-regulate (even to the same levels than λ+ cells) Nur-77 upon leaving the BM. Most probably because they encounter non-inflammatory antigens in the periphery.</p><p>Taken together, I fully agree that the present manuscript is improved upon revision and most of my requests have been clarify. However, I still request that the authors recognize that the Nur77-GFP signals in B cells might be the result of BCR stimulation by a broader collection of non-inflammatory antigens in vivo, not only self-antigens. They might be globally named as endogenous antigens but not exclusively self-antigens, or endogenous self-antigens. The main conclusion of the manuscript is unaltered, namely that IgD-BCR signals differently upon encounter of non-inflammatory antigens in vivo, but to narrow this conclusion only to self-antigens is not proven and not justified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35074.052</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Differential sensing of endogenous antigens and control of B cell fate by IgM and IgD B cell receptors&quot; by Noviski et al. follows a series of manuscripts started back in 2012 with the publication of the Nur77-GFP mice (Zikherman et al., 2012).

Rigorously studying in vivo antigen sensing in the context of a polyclonal repertoire requires examining a broad array of BCR-dependent physiological readouts. The paper begins by establishing the specificity of the Nur77-eGFP reporter as a read-out of endogenous antigen-dependent signaling in B cells (below in the rebuttal we review new data establishing specificity and validity of this reporter). We next introduce this reporter into mice lacking either IgM or IgD to determine how endogenous antigens-dependent signals are transduced by these BCR isotypes. We observe that IgD drives less reporter expression per receptor than IgM, and we proceed to rule out differences in downstream signal transduction as an explanation. Next, we observe that signaling in response to residual endogenous antigens is impaired in IgD-only cells (as read out by basal calcium and ex vivo GFP induction). Indeed, we show that marginal zone (MZ) and B1a cells that express IgD but lack IgM induce less Nur77-eGFP than WT and this is not attributable to repertoire differences. Subsequent figures examine sensing of endogenous antigens in relevant in vivo contexts: B cell development and autoimmune disease. In the context of autoimmune disease, we identified a defect in rapid plasma cell responses by IgD-only cells. The final figure builds upon this finding, and identifies a major defect in rapid IgG1<sup>+</sup> plasma cell induction by IgD-only cells in the context of immunization with T-dependent antigens, but intact generation of germinal center responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the way the data are presented is highly confusing and prevents comparison between figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We anticipated that the use of IgM<sup>−/−</sup>, IgD<sup>−/−</sup>, and IgM<sup>−/−</sup>IgD<sup>−/−</sup> mice (containing mixed populations of IgM-only, WT, and IgD-only B cells) along with IgM<sup>−/−</sup>, WT, and IgD<sup>−/−</sup> mice might be challenging to keep track of. For this reason, we intentionally generated a consistent color scheme to aid in interpretation of data, and we provided schematic diagrams to clarify our logic (Figure 6—figure supplement 2, Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We labeled all graphs with both the genotype of the mouse, and the “genotype” of the B cells specifically to aid in clarity. In general, cells that express IgM alone are blue and cells that express IgD alone are red (WT cells are grey or orange depending on allotype). We have revised our figures to remove as many deviations from this color scheme as possible, specifically in Figure 5E, F, Figure 7B, D, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, C, D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript clearly needs an effort to synthesize and clarify the message.</p><p>The main message of the manuscript is that IgD-BCR signal strength is reduced when compared to IgM-BCR signal strength only in vivo upon recognition of autoantigens driving differentiation (Figure 1 and MZ versus B1a cells under competitive conditions, Figure 4) or for the generation of SLPC (Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this message is the one we hoped to communicate. Our evidence for this is also grounded in Manuscript Figure 3 demonstrating reduced Nur77-eGFP expression in IgD-only relative to IgM-only MZ and B1a B cells. We also show defect in SLPC generation and autoantibody production by IgD-only cells in response to endogenous antigens in the <italic>Lyn<sup>−/−</sup></italic> model (Figures 5, 6). So, in sum, Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 provide evidence to support this message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast, in vitro (Figure 2), upon immunization (Figure 7) and upon recognition of auto-antigens in the Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> background (Figure 5A-B) the signals of IgD-BCR are as competitive as the signals from IgM-BCR.</p></disp-quote><p>This is in part an error of interpretation. We showed (Figure 2.) that in vitro IgD was equally if not more efficient at signal transduction than IgM in response to antibody cross-linking, in contrast to our in vivo observations. We suggest that coupling of the IgD BCR to downstream signaling machinery is intact but sensitivity to endogenous antigens is specifically impaired. We reconcile these results by suggesting that responses to endogenous antigens differ from those triggered by antibody-mediated crosslinking of the receptors in vitro. In response to endogenous antigens, we show that polyclonal B cell activation and GC B cell fate are intact, while autoantibody and SLPC generation are defective (Figures 5, 6). In response to T-dependent immunizations, we show impaired IgG1 SLPC generation, but intact GC B cell fate (Figure 7). We reconcile these observations by suggesting that the stringent requirement for strong BCR signaling for SLPC (but not GC) generation accounts for these observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Taken together, these results are confusing and point out to microenvironment, cell-differentiation stage, co-receptor expression and crosstalk between receptors in a given situation as reasons modulating the signals through the BCR. To conclude that &quot;IgD-BCR sensing antigen is impaired&quot; is an over-interpretation of the results, a not-justified generalization and neglects a major part of the results exposed in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We examine a wide variety of readouts known to be affected by BCR signal strength (ex vivo calcium, ex vivo GFP, in vivo GFP, MZ/B1 fate, SLPC and GC fate in Lyn<sup>−/−</sup>, SLPC and GC fate in response to immunization), and we cite literature describing how BCR signal strength affects the propensity of a B cell to adopt each fate. The common thread is that IgD-only cells are inefficient at adopting the fates that require the strongest in vivo BCR signaling in response to endogenous antigens. It is worth emphasizing that IgM and IgD are BCR isotypes that signal in response to antigen. Therefore, it should not be extremely controversial to propose in vivo antigen-dependent signaling differences as an explanation for phenotypes in mice expressing each isotype in isolation.</p><p>We acknowledge that complex in vivo phenotypes may reflect cooperation between IgM or IgD BCRs and some to-be-defined signal, but it is not possible or reasonable to exclude every known receptor expressed on B cells in this manuscript. That said, we provide important new data excluding a role for microbial stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors as well as TLR-MyD88-dependent signaling in regulating Nur77 expression in vivo by using two independent approaches (germ free mice and conditional deletion of MyD88 in B cells, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E, F). Table 1 lists data to exclude a role for: commensal flora and signaling downstream of MyD88, endocytic TLRs, Jak-Stat, CXCR4, CD40, and BAFF in the regulation of Nur77 expression in B cells in vivo under steady-state conditions. We further show in new data that a range of TLR ligands do not specifically require either IgM or IgD to signal and therefore would not account for our phenotypes (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In the fifth paragraph of our revised Discussion, we explicitly state that the most likely mechanistic explanation for our findings are structural differences between the IgM and IgD isotypes, which could either directly influence transduction of endogenous antigen-driven signals or influence pairing with and access to relevant co-receptors such as CD19 and CD22 that in turn modulate BCR signaling.</p><p>We have no wish to over-interpret our data, but one cannot expect a model that synthesizes the data (clarity of message as requested above) without any interpretation or conclusions. Some degree of interpretation is necessary to help the reader make sense of a complex set of in vivo phenotypes. We have made every effort in our revised manuscript to make the clear distinction between description and interpretation of data.</p><p>Our manuscript should also be read against a background literature which has failed to identify significant non-redundant functions of these co-expressed BCR isotypes in vivo. We have done so for the first time and present a compelling model to explain why IgM and IgD are co-expressed on naïve B cells, and how down-regulation of the former but not the latter on self-reactive cells could function as a vital tolerance mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The whole study is based on the observation that Follicular B cells in the spleen are GFP+, indicating that they have been activated at some point during development (T2/T3 stage) by any of the receptors that induce the activation of the Nur77 locus (BCR, CD40, TLR9, TLR4…). The authors claimed already back in the first publication (Zikherman et al., 2012) that GFP positivity results from BCR signals upon encounter with autoantigens because GFP positivity is significantly reduced in BCR transgenic settings (IgHEL Tg), and again increased in the presence of antigen (IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg).</p></disp-quote><p>We make use of the Nur77-eGFP reporter in our manuscript precisely because our goal is to understand response of a polyclonal repertoire of IgM and IgD isotypes to endogenous antigens in vivo (rather than to model antigens). Major points 1 and 2 raised by this reviewer question whether Nur77-eGFP is a valid reporter of antigen-dependent signaling by B cells in vivo. We argue that this degree of skepticism is not justified. We provide data in this rebuttal and in our revised manuscript to further validate this reporter precisely because it aids in interpretation of our cellular phenotypes. As the reviewer notes and we have shown genetically in previous work (Zikherman et al., 2012), endogenous antigen is necessary and sufficient for Nur77-eGFP expression in vivo in mature B cells under steady state conditions (Manuscript Figure 1A, Author response image Figure 1).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35074.041</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Antigen is necessary and sufficient for Nur77-eGFP expression in B cells; IgHEL-sHEL interaction drives higher Nur77-eGFP expression than the wild type BCR repertoire.</title><p>Panel (<bold>A</bold>) take from Manuscript Figure 1A.

These data collectively demonstrate that in vivo expression of Nur77-eGFP in B cells under steady state conditions is specifically regulated by antigen and regulators of BCR signaling (e.g. CD45, Lyn), but not by other immunoreceptors (including each receptor listed by the reviewer above: CD40, TLR9, TLR4) and therefore represents a VALID readout of antigen-dependent BCR signaling in vivo. We now proceed to address specific reviewer questions about the function of this reporter in our point-by-point response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, if the encounter with autoantigens drives GFP positivity, why are there not GFP+ cells within the immature cells in the BM?

This may be due in part to differences in receptor expression (lower levels of surface IgM, absence of IgD), but may also reflect differences in signaling machinery or chromatin landscape.

Indeed, when we force expression of a highly self-reactive BCR Tg, we observe that immature BM B cells in fact do upregulate Nur77-eGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). V<sub>H</sub>3H9 is a heavy chain (HC) originally cloned from the MRL/lpr lupus mouse model and biases the entire BCR repertoire towards DNA-reactivity, particularly when paired with endogenous V<sub>λ</sub>1 light chain (LC) (Erikson et al., 1991). This HC has been knocked-in to the endogenous BCR locus to generate site directed (sd) V<sub>H</sub>3H9 Tg mice in which the majority of B cells express this HC paired with endogenous LCs. This model system is extremely powerful because bona-fide DNA-reactive B cells can be tracked through development in a polyclonal repertoire on the basis of surface V<sub>λ</sub>1 expression. B cells expressing dsDNA-specific V<sub>λ</sub>1 BCRs persist in the periphery in sd-V<sub>H</sub>3H9 mice despite extensive receptor editing and counter-selection, in part because V<sub>λ</sub>1 light chain expression is itself the result of extensive receptor editing and “traps” self-reactivity in the repertoire (Erikson et al., 1991; Fields et al., 2005). We have generated reporter mice harboring the site-directed (sd) V<sub>H</sub>3H9 Tg in the endogenous BCR locus. dsDNA-reactive V<sub>λ</sub>1 B cells turn on GFP early in development and express higher levels in maturity, consistent with their chronic self-antigen stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, manuscript in preparation from our laboratory). These data support the Nur77-eGFP reporter as a sensitive marker of B cell self-reactivity, and argue that highly self-reactive B cells do upregulate reporter expression during BM development, but these cells normally represent a small proportion of the repertoire and are efficiently eliminated in WT mice.</p><p>Because these points are an important response to the reviewer query about the sensitivity of the Nur77-eGFP reporter to antigen-dependent signaling during B cell development, but are not directly relevant to the manuscript under review, we present these data in the rebuttal, but have not incorporated them into the revised manuscript.

This high percentage is expected in the IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg setting. However, in the WT situation, if GFP positivity is the consequence of autoantigen encounter, this would mean that most of B cell emigrants from the BM carry autoreactive receptors. Do the authors suggest that tolerance in mice is established mainly in the peripheral checkpoint (T2/T3)? This will be in contrast with the data in humans in which both checkpoints reduced the percentage of self-reactive BCR to half, and only 40% of new emigrants carry self-reactive BCRs, percentage that is reduced to 20% after the peripheral checkpoint.</p><p>Taken together the last two points, it seems true that autoantigens are sufficient to drive Nur77-GFP expression as claimed by the authors (IgHEL Tg/sHEL Ag Tg setting already reported in 2012), but I am not convinced at this stage that all GFP+ cells in the Fo stage are GPF+ because BCR signaling as consequence of autoantigen encounters. I rather think that GFP accumulation is the result of several activation signals from diverse receptors, including the BCR but not exclusively.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed proposed that most mature B cells harbor self-reactivity to endogenous antigens (albeit mild) that is proportional to Nur77-eGFP reporter expression, and that Nur77-eGFP expression in those cells is a result of endogenous antigen recognition. This was a central part of the message of our Nature 2012 paper. Our evidence in support of this contention is three-fold:</p><p>a) Restricting the normal diverse BCR repertoire to force recognition of a non-murine antigen (via IgHEL BCR Tg) and thereby eliminate endogenous antigen recognition results in near-complete loss of Nur77-eGFP expression in B cells in vivo (Figure 1A; Zikherman et al., 2012: Figure 3B, C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Notably, this occurs despite the fact that surface BCR expression in IgHEL BCR Tg cells is higher than that found on WT B cells, and despite the fact that these cells are competent to respond to TLR ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>). Reintroducing model antigen (sHEL Tg) genetically into this system is sufficient to upregulate Nur77-eGFP in B cells and recapitulate GFP expression seen in a normal diverse mature BCR repertoire. Importantly, the GFP MFI seen in IgHEL BCR Tg B cells exposed to high affinity cognate antigen sHEL in vivo is <italic>considerably higher</italic> than that seen in WT B cells with a diverse repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). This suggests that WT B cells <italic>do</italic> see endogenous antigens, but at considerably lower intensity / affinity than that encoded by the IgHEL / sHEL model.</p><p>b) We have shown in previously published work that Nur77-eGFP B cells harbor BCRs with higher ANA-reactivity as measured by ELISA (Zikherman et al., 2012: Figure 4E). Similar findings of autoreactivity among IgM<sup>lo</sup> mature B cells from mice and humans (corresponding to B cells with higher GFP and endogenous Nur77 expression) have been reported by independent groups in mice and humans (Kirchenbaum et al., 2014; Quach et al., 2011).</p><p>c) Moreover, in published data and the present revised manuscript and rebuttal, we systematically exclude a contribution by: commensal microbes, MyD88-dependent signaling, CD40-dependent signaling, CXCR4-dependent signaling, Jak-Statdependent signaling, and BAFF-dependent signals (see Table 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The reviewer wishes to reconcile our argument that Nur77-eGFP expression in naïve mature B cells reflects reactivity to endogenous antigens with data reported by Wardemann, Nussenzweig and colleagues (Wardemann et al., 2003). Wardemann at al. show that anti-nuclear-reactivity of mature human B cells measured by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) are seen in only about 20% of cells. This study of necessity uses an arbitrary cutoff and an artificial readout (ANA IFA) to identify “autoreactive B cells”. Our readout (GFP fluorescence) is a continuous, linear, and sensitive reporter of bona fide reactivity to endogenous antigens without any arbitrary cutoff other than detection of fluorescence by flow cytometer. We propose that the degree of endogenous antigen recognition by the naïve mature repertoire is “weak / mild” in comparison to genetic models of B cell autoreactivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">3</xref>), but is detectable by the Nur77-eGFP reporter and is above the baseline seen with a bona fide non-self-reactive BCR (IgHEL Tg). The self-reactivity detected by ANA IFA used by the Nussenzweig laboratory may be distinct from true endogenous antigen recognition and/or this assay may have a lower sensitivity for detection of self-reactivity. Indeed, Ignacio Sanz and others have characterized a naturally-occurring human BCR heavy chain (VH34-4) that recognizes an epitope on the surface of RBCs that would presumably not be detected by an ANA assay (Quach et al., 2011; Reed et al., 2016).</p><p>Indeed, there is an extensive B cell literature that is consistent with our contention that self-reactivity (mild) is a feature of the normal mature B cell repertoire, and may actually be selected for. Prior work has supplied indirect evidence for antigen-dependent positive selection of B cells (Cancro and Kearney, 2004; Cariappa and Pillai, 2002; Rosado and Freitas, 1998; Su et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2006; Wang and Clarke, 2003). Studies have shown that self-ligands can drive selection of B cells into the mature primary immune repertoire in the context of BCR Tg models (Hayakawa et al., 2003; Wang and Clarke, 2003). Analysis of AgR repertoire diversity has revealed a restricted repertoire in mature relative to immature B cells, suggesting active selection by antigen (Freitas et al., 1989; Gu et al., 1991; Levine et al., 2000).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3). Because an inverse correlation between GFP levels and IgM expression is observed, the authors propose that IgM is downregulated as consequence of autoantigen encounter and therefore, activation of autoreactive B cells is prevented. The slope that correlates IgM and GFP expression in the IgM-only mice is reduced compared to the slope in WT, why is this? In other words, why in the absence of IgD, IgM cannot be optimally downregulated? In this the case also upon anti-IgM stimulation ex vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We have explicitly addressed this point in our revised manuscript (subsection “Dual expression of IgM and IgD BCRs is required to establish a broad dynamic range of BCR responsiveness across the repertoire”, last paragraph; Discussion, eighth paragraph). Here we clarify further: previous work from the Rajewsky lab identified a critical survival function for the BCR, as B cells die upon acute deletion of the BCR (Kraus et al., 2004; Lam et al., 1997). Moreover, recent work from Goodnow lab describes a novel ENU-generated mutant that lacks IgD expression but does not compensatorily upregulate surface IgM (dmit mutant), in contrast to the IgD<sup>−/−</sup> mice studied in our manuscript (Sabouri et al., 2016). The dmit mutant B cells have a major defect in survival, suggesting that not only is BCR expression required for B cell survival, but the amount matters. In Figure 1D, we show that IgM-only (IgD<sup>−/−</sup>) B cells have 60% as much total receptor as WT cells. Since these IgM-only cells express just one receptor, any downregulation in IgM leads to an equivalent downregulation in total surface receptor. WT cells express two isotypes, and we propose that the high level of IgD on all WT cells gives them “room” to downregulate IgM more extensively without losing BCR-mediated survival. We propose here and in our manuscript that IgM downregulation in IgD<sup>−/−</sup> mice is limited by survival of such cells. It is not possible to accurately recapitulate tonic survival function of the BCR in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast to IgM, IgD levels are invariant with GFP expression, this would mean that in IgD mice GFP high cells could be easily re-activated driving autoimmunity, is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>This would be the case <italic>if</italic> IgD BCR were sensitive to endogenous antigen stimulation. Our manuscript argues that IgD is less sensitive than IgM to endogenous antigens. We propose that IgD’s reduced sensitivity towards self-antigens permits high surface expression on autoreactive cells (thereby facilitating their survival) without promoting aberrant activation in response to endogenous antigens. As IgD can respond robustly to anti-kappa stimulation in vitro, we propose that IgD is maintained on autoreactive cells to permit both survival of these cells and to allow for activation upon encounter with exogenous antigens. Our data in Figure 7 show that this subsequent activation through IgD has limits, particularly with regard to IgG1<sup>+</sup> PC generation. The Goodnow lab has proposed (Model in Figure 7—figure supplement 2) that promotion of GC fate in this context allows autoreactive IgD<sup>hi</sup>IgM<sup>lo</sup>GFP<sup>hi</sup> cells to mutate away from self-reactivity(Reed et al., 2016; Sabouri et al., 2016; Sabouri et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that these cells cannot be optimally activated, but the total GFP levels are the same, proving that activation was equally strong.</p></disp-quote><p>GFP levels are the same, but it takes twice as much IgD BCR than IgM BCR to achieve comparable Nur77-eGFP expression (Figures 1B, D, E, F). Moreover, IgD-only B1a and MZ B cells have higher BCR expression but lower GFP expression than IgM-only comparators (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, when we reduce selection pressures on the MZ repertoire (BAFF Tg), resulting in comparable surface expression of IgM and IgD, we unmask a markedly reduced expression of Nur77-eGFP in IgD-only MZ B cells (Figure 3D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). In most of our manuscript, we focus on BCR-dependent phenotypes that are present <italic>in spite</italic> of high surface IgD receptor expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can IgD be downregulated upon stimulation ex vivo in the IgD-only B cells?</p></disp-quote><p>IgD can be downregulated on the surface of both WT and IgD-only cells in response to anti-IgD or anti-kappa stimulation.

Taking in consideration recent data regarding the nanoscale distribution of IgM and IgD-BCRs in protein islands, how are the levels of co-receptors such as CD19, CD22, CD20 in WT, IgM-only and IgD-only? Are these co-receptors excluded or included in the IgM protein island in the absence of IgD? Are these coreceptors modulating differently IgM-BCR and IgD-BCR signals? Differences in co-receptor levels and/or composition of these protein islands might explain why IgD stimulation in vitro, which happens solely by the BCR, is strong (Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that differential association with B cell coreceptors that directly modulate BCR signal transduction (e.g. CD19, CD22) may contribute to differential signaling by IgM and IgD. Our revised Discussion incorporates this possibility (fifth paragraph). We studied surface expression of CD22, CD19, and CD45 on IgM-only, IgD-only, and WT B cells via FACS staining and found no differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref>), but we did not assess receptor co-localization by microscopy. We believe that further exploring this possibility is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, but it is a fruitful avenue to pursue in the future.</p><fig id="respfig7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35074.047</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>BCR, co-receptor and CD45 expression on IgM or IgD-deficient B cells.</title><p>Splenocytes from IgM-/-, IgD-/-, or WT ice were stained to detect surface expression of CD19, CD22, CD45, CD79b, and kappa light chain.

As we describe above, the relevant signals in the populations we study are not microbial in origin. We have clarified our use of this term in the Introduction of our revised manuscript (last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear to me the significance of the experiments shown in Figure 3. Both B1a and MZ B cells express preferentially IgM-BCRs. Are they generated to the same extent in IgD-only mice?

Thus, we demonstrate that IgD-only B cells exhibit impaired BCR signaling in response to endogenous antigens in vivo (Figure 3), and exhibit B cell fates consistent with this (Figure 4). Since signal strength has been shown to be important in the development of these subsets, we use this result as support for our claim that IgD senses endogenous antigens more weakly than IgM does.</p><p>Again, how is the expression of co-receptors and especially of innate-like receptors in IgD-only versus WT or IgM-only B1a and MZ B cells?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, how is the expression of co-receptors and especially of innate-like receptors in IgD-only versus WT or IgM-only B1a and MZ B cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The phenotype of B1a and MZ B cells from IgD-only, IgM-only and WT mice is grossly normal, as is coreceptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8</xref>).

We have clarified our manuscript text to make this explicit (subsection “Cell-intrinsic skewing of B cell development by the IgM and IgD BCRs”, end of first paragraph). However, antigen-dependent BCR signal strength is essential for normal steady-state numbers of B1a cells in mature mice (despite their fetal origin) as described in literature cited in our manuscript. It is highly likely that such strong BCR signaling is antigen-dependent at least in part because the B1a repertoire is highly self-reactive. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that impaired antigen-dependent signaling correlates with and likely accounts for loss of IgD-only B1a cells in IgM-deficient mice and in IgM<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our in vivo data does not distinguish between signal strength and “signal quality”. Our revised manuscript addresses this point explicitly (see response to point 4 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Which bibliography supports the following sentence &quot;endogenous auto-antigens may differ significantly from model antigens&quot;?

These bona fide endogenous antigens differ from model antigens such as HEL by their chemical structure (carbohydrate vs. protein) and form (cell surface vs. soluble), and likely by their affinity for the BCR. We have presented this example explicitly in both the Introduction (fourth paragraph) and Discussion (fourth paragraph) of our revised manuscript along with relevant citations (Quach et al., 2011; Reed et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Similar to the results obtained in vitro, the results in the Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice support that both IgM and IgD-BCR provide sufficient signals for B cell activation (CD86, CD69) and for GC differentiation against the theory of the authors that &quot;IgD-BCR sensing&quot; of antigen is impaired.</p></disp-quote><p>IgD is not incapable of transmitting allantigen-dependent signals. Rather, we argue that it does so less efficiently than IgM especially in response to endogenous antigens. Indeed, if this were not the case, IgD would not be able to mediate B cell development and immune responses as reported in the original description of IgM<sup>−/−</sup> mice by Frank Brombacher and colleagues (Lutz et al., 1998). Rather, we argue that IgD-only B cells are particularly defective at adopting cell fates requiring strong BCR signaling. Our manuscript has identified a range of in vivo phenotypes which IgD alone is insufficient to drive (e.g. high Nur77-eGFP expression, B1a cell fate, unswitched PC expansion in Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice, autoantibodies in Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice). By contrast, GC fate is not compromised. This is consistent with intact affinity maturation in response to TD-immunogens as reported by Brombacher and colleagues. We propose this is because weak BCR signals are sufficient to drive GC fate, in contrast to SLPC fate. Indeed, there is an extensive literature supporting this model (cited in our manuscript). Similarly, we argue that BCR signaling transmitted through IgD in the absence of Lyn is sufficient to upregulate activation markers and GC fate, but apparently not sufficient to drive unswitched PC or autoantibody production. The model we propose is that IgD-dependent signaling in vivo in response to endogenous antigens is not completely defective, but is rather less sensitive than that mediated by IgM. In other words, our paper describes which BCR signaling thresholds IgD can overcome and which ones it cannot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Regarding the production of autoantibodies in Figure 5, why the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also increased in the WT cells that co-exist with the IgM-only B cells? Indeed, at 25 weeks the basal levels are elevated in all the mice compared to all the other situations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have noted a reduced penetrance of autoantibody production in IgM<sup>−/−</sup> Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice relative to IgD<sup>−/−</sup> Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice.

This allowed us to obtain more samples with detectable anti-dsDNA IgG2a and validate our finding that IgDonly cells are indeed protected from giving rise to anti-dsDNA IgG2a-secreting plasma cells relative to WT B cells in the same animal (Figure 5E). We believe these additional data further strengthen our conclusions. Our favored explanation for the reduced penetrance of autoantibodies in IgM<sup>−/−</sup> Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice relative to IgD<sup>−/−</sup> Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice is that the frequency of cells competent to initiate anti-dsDNA IgG2a PC production regulates disease progression. This was recently shown to be important for GC initiation in an autoimmune mouse model (Degn et al., 2017). We speculate that it might also play a role in PC differentiation, either through generation of an inflammatory environment or through a feed-forward mechanism where circulating autoantibodies drive further autoantibody generation. In addition, non-cell-autonomous differences in serum IgM levels between may contribute.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is possible that other receptors, such as germline-encoded receptors, cooperate only with IgM-BCR to break tolerance and not with IgD?

We find that both IgM-only and IgD-only mice can generate unswitched PCs. IgD-only B cells and WT B cells produce similar numbers in absence of competition, while IgD-only B cells produce more in competitive setting. This trend correlates very well with the relative numbers of MZ B cells of each genotype (i.e. expanded number of IgD-only B cells especially in IgM+/- mice –Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and Figure 4D). MZ B cells efficiently generate short-lived unswitched plasma cells even in response to TD-antigens (Phan et al., 2005; Song and Cerny, 2003). We therefore suspect that IgG1 PCs emanate from the Fo B cell compartment, while the unswitched PC response may originate in the MZ B cell compartment. Normal SLPC generation by IgM-deficient MZ B cells in response to immunization would be consistent with previously reported normal T-independent II responses in IgM-deficient mice (Lutz et al., 1998).

I disagree with the authors using self-antigen (subsection “Cell-intrinsic skewing of B cell development by the IgM and IgD BCRs”, first paragraph), endogenous auto-antigen (subsection “Either IgD or IgM BCR is sufficient to mediate polyclonal B cell activation and germinal center differentiation in Lyn<sup>−/−</sup> mice”, first paragraph) and antigen encounters in vivo (subsection “IgD BCRs sense endogenous antigens less efficiently than IgM BCRs”) as synonymous. I fully agree that Nur77-GFP signals are upregulated upon BCR stimulation by antigen and that antigen is necessary to drive Nur77-GFP expression in vivo. But I do not agree that self-antigen is necessary to drive Nur77-GFP expression in vivo. My arguments are:</p><p>• Nur77-GFP signals are highly upregulated when B cells leave the sterile/defined microenvironment of the BM. Nur77-GFP expression timely occurs when cells encounter &quot;antigens&quot; in the periphery, and those antigens activate the BCR. But these antigens are not necessarily self-antigens, they can be food-antigens, LPS (from the chow, antibodies against LPS are broadly recognized), and other non-pathological or non-inflammatory antigens recognized by the BCR. These antigens might activate B cells to upregulate Nur77, but in the absence of T cell help or an inflammatory milieu will not drive an immune response.</p><p>• The results with the IgHEL BCR Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) are fully compatible with the above-described scenario. These mice express a clonal BCR not able to recognize any self-antigen, but also, not able to recognize any of the possible non-inflammatory antigens that will be encountered in the periphery, for this reason the signal of Nur77 is lower. This interpretation is also compatible with higher level of Nur77-GFP in HEL Tg cells exposed to cognate HEL antigen that in WT. Related to this, the results show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref> are also compatible with this scenario since Nur77-GFP upregulation is reduced in IgHEL BCR Tg mice in respond to LPS (small reduction), CpG (clear at lower concentration), and to Pam3CSK4 (visible at both concentrations). A possible interpretation of these results is that the HEL Tg BCR is not able to recognize epitopes in those substances that, together with the corresponding TLR, aid to activate Nur77-GFP in B cells.</p><p>• The results with the VH3H9 Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>) are also fully compatible with the above-described scenario, since the κ+ cells (not recognizing endogenous DNA) also up-regulate (even to the same levels than λ+ cells) Nur-77 upon leaving the BM. Most probably because they encounter non-inflammatory antigens in the periphery.</p><p>Taken together, I fully agree that the present manuscript is improved upon revision and most of my requests have been clarify. However, I still request that the authors recognize that the Nur77-GFP signals in B cells might be the result of BCR stimulation by a broader collection of non-inflammatory antigens in vivo, not only self-antigens. They might be globally named as endogenous antigens but not exclusively self-antigens, or endogenous self-antigens. The main conclusion of the manuscript is unaltered, namely that IgD-BCR signals differently upon encounter of non-inflammatory antigens in vivo, but to narrow this conclusion only to self-antigens is not proven and not justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We gratefully acknowledge the possibility that endogenous antigens that signal through the BCR of naïve B cells in vivo may not exclusively represent “self” antigens encoded by the host genome or generated by enzymes encoded by the host genome. We have therefore modified the text of our revised manuscript to carefully eliminate such an implication. We have now consistently used the term “endogenous” rather than “self” antigens in order to encompass non-inflammatory exogenous antigens (such as food antigens) that may signal through the BCR. Specifically, we have modified citations in the first paragraph of the subsection “Cell-intrinsic skewing of B cell development by the IgM and IgD BCRs” and “Either IgD or IgM BCR is sufficient to mediate polyclonal B cell activation and germinal center differentiation in <italic>Lyn-/-</italic> mice”. We have gone on to also edit references throughout the manuscript in order to clarify the same point. Finally, we have made this point explicitly in our revised Discussion:</p><p>“These antigens may not be exclusively restricted to those that are germline-encoded or generated by host enzymes; rather they may include non-inflammatory antigens taken up through the gastrointestinal tract and recognized by specific BCRs.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Baumgarth, N. 2016.
