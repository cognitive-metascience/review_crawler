Organogenesis often starts with the formation of characteristically shaped organ precursors. However, the cellular mechanisms driving organ precursor formation are often not clear. Here, using zebrafish, we investigate the epithelial rearrangements responsible for the development of the hemispherical retinal neuroepithelium (RNE), a part of the optic cup. We show that in addition to basal shrinkage of RNE cells, active migration of connected epithelial cells into the RNE is a crucial player in its formation. This cellular movement is driven by progressive cell-matrix contacts and actively translocates prospective RNE cells to their correct location before they adopt neuroepithelial fate. Failure of this migration during neuroepithelium formation leads to ectopic determination of RNE cells and consequently impairs optic cup formation. Overall, this study illustrates how spatiotemporal coordination between morphogenic movements and fate determination critically influences organogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22689.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22689.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>retinal neuroepithelium</kwd><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>epithelial invagination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA-00007/2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sidhaye</surname><given-names>Jaydeep</given-names></name><name><surname>Norden</surname><given-names>Caren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB655 A25</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sidhaye</surname><given-names>Jaydeep</given-names></name><name><surname>Norden</surname><given-names>Caren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DIGS-BB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sidhaye</surname><given-names>Jaydeep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular and tissue level analysis reveals how different cell behaviors involving dynamics of the basal domain cooperate in space and time to shape an epithelial organ.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many developmental contexts, organ formation includes rearrangements of epithelial sheets. Such rearrangements give rise to organ precursors that later develop into mature organs. For example, epithelial rearrangements that form the imaginal discs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae generate organs in the adult fly including wings and legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morata, 2001</xref>). Similarly, the vertebrate neural tube is shaped by epithelial reorganization and later develops into the brain and the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greene and Copp, 2014</xref>). Epithelial reorganization occurs via changes in the morphology, number and location of cells, and ultimately defines the architecture of the developing organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lecuit and Le Goff, 2007</xref>). When epithelial reorganization and thereby organ precursor architecture is impaired, the structure and function of the mature organ can be compromised. For instance, defects in cell-matrix adhesion resulting in impaired wing imaginal disc formation ultimately cause a blistered wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domínguez-Giménez et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, defects in epithelial fusion of neural folds can lead to problems in neural tube closure and generate severe birth defects in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greene and Copp, 2014</xref>). Hence, deciphering how epithelial morphogenesis shapes organ precursors is crucial to understand overall organ development.</p><p>One outstanding model to investigate how epithelial biology shapes organ architecture is the developing vertebrate retina. Here, the retinal neuroepithelium (RNE) is the organ precursor that later gives rise to all neurons of the mature retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuhrmann, 2010</xref>). The hemispheric RNE that is located in the optic cup develops from the epithelial optic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazin-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>). Its formation involves complex epithelial rearrangements including tissue elongation, sheet invagination and epithelial sheet movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). It has been shown in mouse and human retinal organoid in vitro cultures that the optic vesicle epithelium self-organizes into a hemispherical shape due to high proliferation in a confined space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>). However, work in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> shows that RNE development continues even when cell proliferation is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris and Hartenstein, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). Such differences highlight the importance of in vivo studies of optic cup formation to address how the RNE is formed during embryonic development.</p><p>Due to its unmatched imaging potential, the zebrafish is an excellent model to understand in vivo optic cup formation at both the cellular and the tissue level. In teleosts, RNE morphogenesis occurs by rearrangements of a continuous epithelium, the bilayered optic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmitt and Dowling, 1994</xref>). The distal layer of the optic vesicle develops into the RNE and part of the proximal layer develops into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Work in zebrafish and medaka showed that basal constriction of RNE cells is important for RNE invagination (brown cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogdanović et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicolás-Pérez et al., 2016</xref>). However, given that a subpopulation of prospective RNE cells is located in the proximal epithelial layer, at the onset of optic cup morphogenesis (OCM), it is not clear whether basal constrictions alone can drive RNE formation or whether these cells play an additional role. The proximal prospective RNE cells move into the distal, invaginating neuroepithelium by a process called rim involution (blue cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>). However, to date, it remains unclear which molecular mechanisms drive rim involution and whether it is actively involved in RNE morphogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNE invagination is accompanied by basal cell surface area shrinkage and basal actomyosin accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of RNE morphogenesis from 16 hours post fertilization (hpf) or 15 somite stage (ss) to 24 hpf or 30 ss showing RNE cells that undergo invagination (brown) and rim cells that undergo rim involution (blue).

We find that in addition to basal invagination of the RNE, rim involution critically supports RNE morphogenesis. Rim cells migrate actively and collectively to integrate in the invaginating RNE. When rim migration is perturbed, not all prospective neuroepithelial cells reach the RNE but nevertheless these cells adopt neuroepithelial fate. This results in severely disturbed retinal architecture. Thus, active migration of rim cells coordinates the timely integration of future neuroepithelial cells into the hemispherical RNE and is essential to prevent ectopic fate specification of neuroepithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Invagination of the retinal neuroepithelium involves basal accumulation of contractile actomyosin and basal cell surface reduction</title><p>To begin to elucidate the mechanisms of RNE formation, we initially focused on RNE invagination. It has been recently shown that RNE invagination is accompanied by basal constriction of neuroepithelial cells in the distal layer of the optic vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, brown cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicolás-Pérez et al., 2016</xref>). To validate this finding, we labeled the cell cortex at different stages of optic cup morphogenesis from 15 somite stage (ss) to 28 ss (16 hours post fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf) using the F-actin marker phalloidin. We measured the average cell density at the base of the RNE and noted that basal cell density increased significantly during optic cup invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Concomitantly, the average basal area of RNE cells was reduced by about 45%. This reduction mainly occurred during the first half of the invagination process between 15 ss and 21 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the average apical area of cells increased. As a result, the average apical area was larger than the average basal area at the end of the process. This shows that cells undergo overall shape changes during invagination and form cones with a narrowing basal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the observed reduction in basal cell area was linked to changes in actomyosin distribution, we imaged actin and myosin distribution during RNE morphogenesis. At the onset of neuroepithelial invagination, the actin marker GFP-UtrophinCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>) accumulated at the basal side of the RNE (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) similarly to the myosin marker, myl12.1-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iwasaki et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Basal actin and myosin enrichment was specific to the invaginating zone of the neuroepithelium and was not observed in other regions of the optic cup (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These findings were corroborated by phalloidin (actin) and anti-phosphomyosin (active myosin) staining of samples fixed between 15 ss and 30 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Quantitative analysis of phalloidin and phosphomyosin intensity distribution along the apicobasal axis of the neuroepithelium showed that the basal actomyosin bias spanned about 15% of the RNE height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, we confirmed that invagination of the neuroepithelium is accompanied by basal surface area reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicolás-Pérez et al., 2016</xref>). We further show that invaginating RNE cells change their overall shape and feature basal accumulation of contractile actomyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22689-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.007</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Actin dynamics during RNE morphogenesis.</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of actin dynamics during RNE morphogenesis using Tg(<italic>actb1</italic>:GFP-utrCH).

Upon 7 h of Rockout treatment, lens structures in treated embryos developed similarly to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Also, the overall staining for phosphomyosin was weaker in the treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Despite this reduction of actin and myosin however, the effect on the morphology of the cup was surprisingly weak. 40% of embryos showed an accumulation of cells at the rim of the cup, whereas 30% of embryos showed a milder optic cup phenotype (n = 30 embryos per experiment, N = 5 experiments; 30% of embryos showed stalled development and were thus excluded from the analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

Thus, RNE invagination was initiated but was not as efficient in the treated embryos as in controls and appeared delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,F</xref>). To better understand the progression of RNE formation in the Rockout condition, we performed time-lapse imaging of GFP-UtrophinCH in Rockout-treated embryos. This confirmed that RNE invagination still took place, albeit with slower kinetics, even when basal actin levels were greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>). Interestingly, at 30ss, the end point of optic cup invagination, the basal surface area of the invaginating cells was similar in controls and Rockout-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This observation suggests that RNE invagination does not solely depend on basal actomyosin contractility and that it can be compensated by other mechanisms.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Impairment of actomyosin-driven basal constriction or proliferation does not prevent RNE formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal scan of optic cup at 30 ss stained for phalloidin.

One way to increase cell numbers is proliferation, and it has been shown that RNE formation is accompanied by high proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, proliferation has been suggested as a driving force for optic cup formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>). In zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, however, optic cup invagination persists even when proliferation is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris and Hartenstein, 1991</xref>). To test whether tissue compaction caused by ongoing proliferation can at all influence RNE invagination, we inhibited proliferation with hydroxyurea and aphidicolin from 10 ss onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>), leading to markedly reduced pH3 staining compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consequently, the neuroepithelium hosted fewer cells and these cells adopted a more columnar morphology than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>]). Furthermore, following inhibition of proliferation, cells in the RNE displayed a larger average basal area than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Despite this, optic cup formation still occurred and invagination angles were not severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This observation indicated two things a) That the total number of cells in the invaginating RNE influences the basal area of single cells and b) that RNE invagination can take place even when cells show a broader basal area due to reduced cell proliferation. Thus, it suggests that other additional processes participate in RNE morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RNE morphogenesis involves active cell migration at the rim of the optic cup</title><p>In addition to proliferation, another process that occurs concomitantly with RNE invagination that increases the cell number in the RNE is rim cell involution. This phenomenon is most prominent at the ventral and temporal side of the cup and relocates a substantial number of cells from the proximal layer of the optic vesicle into the invaginating RNE (blue cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>). Such an influx of cells may result in increased tissue compaction and contribute to the inward bending of the tissue. As we noted that rim cells in the Rockout-treated embryos continued to move into the cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), we wondered whether these cell movements could explain the recovery of RNE morphogenesis defects upon Rockout treatment. We thus asked if rim involution was actively involved in shaping the RNE. To answer this question, we first needed to understand how cells move at the rim. Hence, we characterized their single-cell dynamics. Mosaic labeling of rim cells with the membrane marker mKate2-ras and the apical marker Par3-GFP revealed that moving rim cells kept a stable apical domain but were very dynamic at the basal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). As microtubules marked with EMTB-tdTomato did not show significant reorganization during rim involution, we concluded that microtubules were not majorly involved in the cellular dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead, we observed that cells extended dynamic lamellipodia-like protrusions in the direction of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). These protrusions were actin rich, as shown by GFP-UtrophinCH localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), underlining their lamellipodial character. Such lamellipodia were only observed in the rim cells and were not seen in the invaginating RNE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). When we quantified basal protrusive activity during rim migration, we found that the vast majority of the actin rich protrusions occurred in the direction of movement, the leading side of the cells facing the invaginating zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This showed that the protrusive activity of rim cells is directional. Interestingly, the directional actin-rich lamellipodia formation and rim migration were still observed in the Rockout condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>), further indicating that the migratory behavior of rim cells occurs independently of the basal actomyosin bias in the invaginating RNE cells. Interestingly, while rim cells exhibited protrusive membrane activity at the basal side, they nevertheless maintained their apicobasal polarity and an apical actin pool associated with the adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>). This shows that a) rim cells are integrated in an intact epithelial sheet and display the migratory behavior as a collective epithelium and b) that rim cells show characteristics that are intermediate between the epithelial and mesenchymal state.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Rim involution involves active cell migration of connected epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse imaging of rim zone with mosaic expression of Par3-GFP and mKate2-ras.

We next asked how exactly lamellipodia formation can drive rim cell movement. Lamellipodia-driven migration often depends on dynamic attachments of cells to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedl and Wolf, 2010</xref>). Thus, we assessed the distribution of ECM during rim movement by immunostainings for the ECM components Laminin, Chondroitin sulfate and Fibronectin. Laminin and Chondroitin sulfate were only weakly expressed beneath the developing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), but showed stronger accumulation in the rim zone, the developing lens placode and the invaginating RNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Fibronectin instead showed preferential staining in the rim zone and the developing lens placode and weaker staining beneath the invaginating RNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, we speculated that the migrating rim cells use their lamellipodia to dynamically attach to the underlying ECM and thereby generate force for movement. Imaging the focal adhesion markers Integrin-β1-mKate2 and Paxillin-mKate2 indeed revealed dynamic short-lived foci at the basal side of rim cells during time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Videos 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). However, once cells reach the RNE and stopped the active migratory behavior they formed stable focal adhesions marked by integrin and paxillin as well as actin (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Videos 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Co-imaging of the localization and dynamics of Paxillin-mKate2 and GFP-UtrophinCH corroborated this finding. While the cells in the rim zone lacked basal enrichment of actin and paxillin, cells in the invaginating region showed stable basal enrichment of Paxillin coinciding with the basal accumulation of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). This suggested that the active migratory behavior observed for rim cells is confined to the zone that connects the developing RPE and the RNE, where cells move from one epithelial layer into the other by turning 180°. Once the cells reach the inner layer of the cup they change to stable cell-ECM attachment and attain typical neuroepithelial morphology.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media10" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22689-media10.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.026</object-id><label>Video 10.</label><caption><title>Integrin dynamics during rim involution.</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of integrin dynamics during rim involution.

To this end, we knocked down laminin α-1 and ojoplano/opo using previously published morpholinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pollard et al., 2006</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref> for controls for efficiency of morpholino knockdown). Laminin depletion interferes directly with ECM integrity and it has been shown to be involved at different stages of optic cup development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryan et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that depletion of laminin from the ECM resulted in an overall increase in Fibronectin staining, indicating a change in the ECM composition and arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Knockdown of laminin resulted in impaired optic cup formation at 30 ss. Epithelial tissue accumulated at the temporal side of the optic cup was observed, giving the cup an S-shaped appearance instead of the C-shaped appearance seen in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).</p><p>To test if intracellular perturbation of cell-ECM attachment would also affect rim migration, we knocked down Opo. Opo is a protein that is known to regulate endocytosis of integrins and was previously shown to play an important role in eye morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogdanović et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, opo morphants recapitulated the S-shaped optic cup phenotype, although the severity of the phenotype was milder than in the laminin condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).</p><p>Time-lapse imaging of both conditions confirmed that the S-shaped phenotype was caused by impaired rim cell migration, as the speed of rim cells was reduced (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Videos 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F,G</xref>). This reduced speed most likely results from the inability of migrating cells to efficiently use their lamellipodia to migrate along the underlying matrix. A recent study reported that Laminin α-1 mutant shows polarity defects in cells of the optic cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryan et al., 2016</xref>). However, in the morphant condition used here we did not observe a strong effect on polarity. We only observed few ectopic apical domains within the neuroepithelium while overall tissue-wide apical marker distribution was not affected in the laminin morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, this condition allowed us to dissect the effects of perturbed cell-ECM adhesion during OCM. Similarly, no defects on apical marker distribution were observed in Opo morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez-Morales et al., 2009</xref>). Basally however, we noticed that actomyosin accumulation was reduced in the invagination zone in both laminin and opo knockdown conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). In addition, invagination angles were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This argued that both, rim migration and actomyosin-assisted invagination were disturbed in these conditions leading to the strong phenotypes observed.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media13" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22689-media13.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.037</object-id><label>Video 13.</label><caption><title>RNE morphogenesis in laminin morphant.</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of mosaic expression of mKate2-ras in laminin morphant.

When we imaged the focal adhesion component Paxillin using mosaic Paxillin-mKate2 RNA injection, we observed that in laminin morphants the rim cells localized Paxillin stably along the modified basement membrane instead of the dynamic foci seen in the control condition (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">Video 15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In opo morphants however, Paxillin distribution was more transient than seen in the controls (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">Video 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In both cases the rim cells exhibited basal bleb-like protrusions instead of the lamellipodia observed in control embryos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">Videos 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These bleb-like protrusions were extension of the plasma membrane, with short lived actin localization and devoid of myosin, showing the characteristic features of blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Such basal blebs were also observed when opo morphants cells were transplanted into control embryos, in line with a cell autonomous phenotype (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media17">Video 17</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>, N = 4 out of 5 transplanted embryos). The observation that morphant cells nevertheless reached the RNE underlines the collective characteristic of the migration as surrounding control cells most likely pull them along to their final positions (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media17">Video 17</xref>). The finding that the cells that failed to undergo active rim migration exhibited blebs instead of lamellipodia made us ask whether perturbation of the normal protrusive activity itself could interfere with rim cell migration. To test this idea, we knocked down the ERM protein family member Ezrin using a published morpholino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Link et al., 2006</xref>). Ezrin is a protein that links actin and the plasma membrane and its knockdown has been shown to lead to increased blebbing and reduced migration rates of zebrafish prechordal plate precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schepis et al., 2012</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref> for controls for efficiency of morpholino knockdown by Western blot and overall morphant morphology). During RNE formation, we observed that ezrin knockdown did not affect the overall apicobasal polarity in the developing optic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>) but specifically induced basal blebbing in the area where rim cells resided, whereas lateral sides of the rim cells and the pool of invaginating RNE cells were not affected (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media18">Video 18</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also observed rim cell blebbing when ezrin morphant cells were transplanted into control background, again arguing that blebbing is a cell autonomous phenotype ([<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>] N = 2 out of 4 transplanted embryos. This variability is most likely due to varying morpholino concentration within transplanted cells as they come from different donors). Interestingly, ezrin depletion in all rim cells resulted in a phenotype similar to Laminin or Integrin interference. The average cell speed was reduced by 27% and rim cells did not reach the RNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B,C and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media19">Video 19</xref>). While the formation of the lens and the RPE occurred similar to the control situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), specifically RNE morphogenesis in ezrin morphants was defective and at 30 ss an S-shaped optic cup was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Importantly, however, we only observed a minor effect on basal actomyosin accumulation in the RNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). A comparison of the instantaneous slopes of the normalized phalloidin intensity distribution curves confirmed that unlike Rockout, laminin Mo and Opo Mo, ezrin morphants showed very little disturbance of the basal actomyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This indicated that the S-shaped phenotype was mainly caused by the defects in rim involution and less by the perturbation of basal actomyosin. This S-shaped phenotype did not recover upon continued development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, the cells that stayed outside the presumptive RNE layer eventually showed a stable Paxillin distribution outside the RNE as seen in the laminin knock down condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Cells thereby attained neuroepithelial-like morphology. We conclude that correct ECM formation and distribution is important for lamellipodia formation and successful rim cell migration. When cell-ECM attachment is impaired, lamellipodia formation is perturbed and rim cells form blebs but these blebs cannot support cellular movement. Consequently, cells do not enter the neuroepithelium but can nevertheless take on neuroepithelial morphology at ectopic location.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media15" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22689-media15.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.039</object-id><label>Video 15.</label><caption><title>Paxillin dynamics during rim involution in laminin morphant.</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of paxillin dynamics during rim involution in laminin morphant with mosaic expression of GFP-ras (left) and paxillin-mKate2 (middle).

To test this, we used Vsx2, an early retinal transcription factor specific for RNE fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>). Time-lapse imaging of the transgenic line Tg(<italic>vsx2</italic>::GFP) expressing GFP under the <italic>vsx2</italic> promoter allowed us to follow RNE specification. In control embryos, GFP was primarily expressed in the invaginating RNE layer and the signal was weak in cells within the rim zone. Only when rim cells reached the inner RNE did they express GFP more prominently (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media20">Video 20</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in the ezrin knockdown condition, rim cells that accumulated outside the RNE expressed GFP ectopically at this location (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media21">Video 21</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Such ectopic expression of <italic>vsx2</italic> outside the optic cup was also observed in laminin and opo morphants. Here, cells failed to migrate and an S-shaped cup was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, <italic>vsx2</italic> expression and RNE fate while seemingly temporally controlled were independent of correct cell position. In some ezrin morphants, these displaced RNE cells initiated a second invagination zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These phenotypes persisted until 36hpf, when neurogenesis in the RNE is known to start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weber et al., 2014</xref>), resulting in abnormal architecture of the optic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

It occurs by collective and directed migratory behavior of the epithelium that later integrates into the invaginating RNE layer. Rim involution together with the basal constriction of invaginating RNE cells shape the epithelial fold of the optic vesicle into a hemispherical RNE that gives rise to the future retina. While defects in RNE invagination can be rescued by continued rim involution, defects of rim migration result in impaired RNE architecture. Thus, rim involution ensures translocation and timely integration of prospective neuroepithelial cells into the optic cup, where they adopt retinal fate (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22689.053</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Concerted action of basal cell area shrinkage and rim involution shapes the hemispheric RNE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of RNE morphogenesis.

RNE cells in the distal layer (brown) contribute to invagination and prospective neuroepithelial cells (blue) undergo rim involution to reach the inner layer of the cup. (<bold>B</bold>) In control conditions, invagination is driven by basal area reduction that is guided by basally enriched actomyosin-driven constriction and overall compaction by increasing number of cells. Rim involution is driven by collective and directed migration of the epithelium at the rim of the developing optic cup. Protrusive migratory dynamics of rim cells change to adherent behavior when cells reach the inner layer. (<bold>C</bold>) Effect of cellular perturbations on the RNE architecture. (i) Loss of basal actomyosin enrichment slows the invagination process, which can result in a wider optic cup. (ii) Perturbation of lamellipodial membrane protrusions affects the migratory behavior and the optic cup architecture, resulting in an S-shaped optic cup. (iii) Perturbation of cell-ECM adhesion results in both loss of basal actomyosin accumulation in the invaginating zone and perturbed lamellipodial membrane protrusions in the rim zone. Such combined effect leads to a severe optic cup phenotype.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22689.053">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22689.053</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-22689-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Basal RNE cell shrinkage and active rim migration together ensure efficient hemispheric RNE formation</title><p>The teleost optic vesicle is an epithelial bilayer that needs to rearrange to form the hemispheric optic cup hosting the RNE that give rise to all retinal neurons later in development. To make this rearrangement efficient over a short developmental time span, the tissue has adopted an interplay of cell shape changes supported by basal constriction of RNE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicolás-Pérez et al., 2016</xref>) and migration of rim cells. However, it seems that rim involution plays a dominant role in this process as it translocates a substantial number of cells into the RNE that later contribute to invagination through basal actomyosin contractility and tissue compaction. As a result, the phenotypes observed upon perturbed rim involution are more severe than when basal constriction is impaired. Similar combinations of epithelial rearrangements are at play during other morphogenesis phenomena that occur in a rather short developmental time frame. For instance, during zebrafish posterior lateral line development, timely coordination between the epithelial rearrangements of microlumen formation and primordium migration determines the spacing of rosettes and in turn the lateral line architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durdu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, to fully understand the dynamics of morphogenetic processes it is important to decipher how diverse cell behaviors and their relationship orchestrate tissue formation in different contexts. This is important for determining the common and differential mechanisms underlying organ formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Distinct dynamics at the basal side of the epithelium drive RNE morphogenesis</title><p>Interestingly, all of the dynamic morphogenetic changes elucidated here occur at the basal side of the epithelium. In the rim region, basal cell dynamics are crucial for cell migration, whereas in the invaginating region they assist the formation of stable basal adhesion and basal constriction. Basal domain dynamics are also involved in the formation of the zebrafish midbrain-hindbrain boundary, where the ECM is important for basal shrinkage of the boundary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutzman et al., 2008</xref>), and for the generation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium, where cell-ECM adhesion plays a crucial role in follicle rotation and egg elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, also studies on in vitro <italic>optic</italic> cup organoids show that laminin is a crucial ECM component for successful cup formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>). However, most studies of established systems of epithelial morphogenesis such as gastrulation movements in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or vertebrate neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>) have focused on the dynamics of the apical domain. It will therefore be important to further explore the role of dynamics of the basal domain and its interaction with the ECM during morphogenesis in different developmental contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RNE morphogenesis occurs by spatio-temporal transition of cell behaviors from a migratory to an adherent epithelial state</title><p>During development, cells rarely exhibit archetypal epithelial or mesenchymal characteristics but usually a mixture of both. This has led to the emerging concept of a continuum between the mesenchymal and epithelial state, a topic that recently gathered increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Casanova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernadskaya and Christiaen, 2016</xref>). Depending on the context and the morphogenetic processes, cells utilize different states along this continuum. Rim cells represent such an example where initially cells exhibit both epithelial (apicobasal polarity and cell-cell adhesion) and mesenchymal characteristics (directed protrusive activity and dynamic cell-matrix contacts). However, once the cells involute and integrate into the invaginating RNE they stop their protrusive activity, adhere stably to the ECM and attain the full epithelial state. Thus, rim cells traverse along the continuum and modulate their cell behavior in space and time to shape the organ precursor, the RNE. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal regulation of this transition seems important as a premature transition to stably attached morphology hinders further steps of organogenesis. Similar cellular transitions are also observed at earlier stages of eye development, during optic vesicle evagination. During this event, the eye field cells that seem of more mesenchymal nature change their morphology and acquire apicobasal polarity to form the optic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivanovitch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bazin-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in teleosts, the process of RNE formation from eye field to hemispherical retina utilizes gradual transitions from the mesenchymal to epithelial state at different developmental stages to efficiently shape the RNE into a hemisphere. Further research is required to understand how cell behavior is modulated spatiotemporally. Such investigations will provide insights into the transition along the continuum of states from mesenchyme to epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Rim cells migrate collectively</title><p>We show that rim cells undergo active cell migration using dynamic lamellipodia and cell-ECM attachments while staying integrated within the epithelial sheet. Thus, rim cell migration is a previously uncharacterized form of collective epithelial cell migration. Lately various morphogenetic phenomena have been discovered to include collective epithelial migration, including the well-studied systems of border cell migration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, branching morphogenesis of trachea in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammary gland development, wound healing in mammals or lateral epidermal movement during dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>). Studies of these different systems have led to the emerging view that in each context, the cells exhibit different extent of epithelial and migratory characters, thus broadening the definition of collective epithelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Casanova, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to other collective migration phenomena, such as border-cell migration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, migration of posterior lateral line primordium in zebrafish or wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>), rim cell migration occurs in a part of a continuous epithelial sheet and lacks specific leader cells. Nevertheless, even without leader cells, rim migration occurs in a directed manner and lamellipodia formation is highly biased towards the direction of movement. This molecular and cellular directionality could possibly emerge from the distribution of forces present in the developing optic cup and/or the spatial distribution of surrounding ECM. Future studies will need to investigate these factors to understand how they influence directionality of rim migration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Defects in rim migration lead to ectopic fate specification and interfere with future retinal development</title><p>Our data show that collective rim migration is indispensable for shaping the RNE, the organ precursor that gives rise to the retina. Rim migration translocates prospective neuroepithelial cells that initially reside in the epithelial sheet outside the presumptive RNE to their correct location in the hemispheric RNE. However, when these cells do not reach the RNE in time, they change their morphology and adhere to the underlying ECM at ectopic positions generating a negative feedback, as these cells can never be translocated further. Thus, timely controlled rim cell migration is critical to coordinate spatial positioning of cells with the timing of neuroepithelial fate determination. Failure of rim movement leads to enduring defects in optic cup architecture. This is highlighted by the observation that, in severe cases, a secondary invagination zone can be formed. Our study thereby reveals that RNE fate is independent of the position of cells, suggesting that while signaling pathways and patterning molecules are very important for RNE fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuhrmann, 2010</xref>), they cannot ensure proper positioning of cells if epithelial rearrangements and morphogenic movements are impaired.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Developmental patterning of cell behaviors is a conserved feature of vertebrate eye development</title><p>The crosstalk between morphogenesis and developmental patterning is crucial for successful organ development. Such developmental pattern is not only reflected in gene expression differences but also affects the distinct cell behaviors during early eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>). The dorsal or distal layer of the optic vesicle starts invagination whereas the ventral region contributes to rim involution, predominantly in the ventral-temporal part of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmitt and Dowling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, the phenotypes we observed in rim perturbation conditions result in accumulation of rim cells specifically at the ventral-temporal side of the optic cup. In contrast, cells are much less affected at the dorsal and nasal side. Interestingly, the architecture of the teleost optic vesicle is different compared to that of higher vertebrates. Nevertheless, ventral-temporal cell movements have not only been observed in teleosts but also during <italic>Xenopus and</italic> chick RNE morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, studies in mouse have indicated that the invagination of the dorsal and ventral RNE can be uncoupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molotkov et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the specific cell behavior at play might depend on the species and the shape of the optic vesicle. However, the use of differential morphogenetic strategies for dorsal and ventral retinal development is conserved in all in vivo systems studied so far. It is possible that such ‘pattern’ of morphogenic strategies allows the segregation of cells that experience different environments. Consequently, this could help the cells to attain the RNE fate in a stepwise manner to prepare for the later retinal developmental programs. As it has been recently suggested that such patterning could be conserved during in vitro optic cup formation in organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasegawa et al., 2016</xref>) it will in the future be very exciting to assess how far developmental and cell-behavioral patterning in retinal organoids recapitulates the in vivo scenario at different developmental stages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains and transgenic lines</title><p>Wild type strains (WT-AB RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZIRC_ZL1">ZIRC_ZL1</ext-link>, WT-TL RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZIRC_ZL86">ZIRC_ZL86</ext-link>) and transgenic lines Tg(actb1:GFP-utrCH), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behrndt et al., 2012</xref>), Tg(actb2:mCherry-Hsa.UTRN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Compagnon et al., 2014</xref>), Tg(actb1:myl12.1-EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maître et al., 2012</xref>), Tg(actb1:HRAS-EGFP) vu119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2005</xref>), Tg(<italic>vsx2</italic>::GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>), Tg(βactin:mKate2-ras) were used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Sidhaye and colleagues aims to understand the forces driving invagination of the vertebrate optic cup, using a combination of sophisticated live imaging, pharmacological reagents, and morpholino knockdown in the zebrafish system. Recent work has described and quantified basal constriction as a driver of invagination: experiments presented here suggest that other processes may also be involved. Rim cell involution, the movement of cells from the medial to lateral layer of the optic vesicle, has been observed previously: in this manuscript, the authors carry out the first detailed characterization of the cell biological and molecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, and examine its role in driving the formation of the hemispheric retinal neuroepithelium.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) About the tissue specificity of the process. Laminin associates with fibronectin, collagen and entactin, and could be involved in multiple other processes other than providing a scaffold for migration (for example one could think that laminin is involved in maintaining apico-basal polarity and elongation of the neuroepithelial progenitor cells, before the invagination stage). Laminin may also well be involved in cell-cell signaling, and since it is expressed all around the optic vesicle, it is possible that it affects invagination indirectly. So the fact that the optic cup in the laminin morphant doesn't invaginate properly doesn't necessarily mean it is because the lamellipodia forming cells at the rim aren't binding to ECM. The Opo-MO is also an indirect way of looking at ECM-cell interactions. It is difficult to think of an easy experiment to fix this point. Without a specific candidate ECM protein (none has been suggested by the authors) – it is unclear whether the cells bind laminin directly or another ECM protein, and experiments are difficult due to the multitude of possible receptors, some of which are likely to be redundant. Given that the group is using integrin-beta1-mKate2 for imaging, performing experiments involving DN-integrin-beta1 (placed under a heat shock promoter or a rim cell specific promoter) might help to clarify this issue. Another possibility would be to do some transplantation experiments to obtain opo and laminin morphant clones in a wt retina and observe the phenotype of the morphant rim cells (eg. lamellipodia, integrin b1 and paxillin dynamics).</p><p>2) About the link between Opo and Laminin morphant phenotype to ECM-cell interactions in the rim. Time-lapse imaging experiments in a background that labels focal adhesion markers (ie. repeat the morpholino experiments in the Integrin-β1-mKate2 and Paxillin-mKate2 background and see if the short-lived foci observed in WT rim cells disappears) would really help to make the case stronger.</p><p>3) Delineating the contribution of basal constriction vs active migration. The analysis of both the Opo morphant and the Ezrin morphant would benefit from transplantation experiments followed by time-lapse imaging to overcome limitations of spatial specificity eg. Transplant Opo/Ezrin morphant cells into labelled, but otherwise WT, embryos. If only cells at the rim are actively migrating and are pulling the epithelial sheet behind them, the migration speed of the WT cells should not be affected until the first transplanted cells reach the rim.</p><p>4) The authors state that this is a &quot;novel mode of active collective epithelial migration&quot;. Based on the data presented, it is not quite clear to me that this is really collective migration. The videos of EGFP-DN-Rac-expressing embryos would help significantly, as would determining whether the remaining protrusions in EGFP-DN-Rac-expressing cells are positive for actin and paxillin, and therefore might mediate a different mode of motility, rather than being pulled along (see below in specific points).</p><p>5) Morpholino. The authors should use mutants when available, otherwise they should accordingly moderate their conclusions.</p><p>For example, it looks like the quantity of opo morpholino is high (3.8ng). Other tissues involved in invagination of the RNE or potentially important for optic cup formation are also altered (eg. pre-lens ectoderm). Therefore, the strong phenotype observed might not be specific. When compared with the phenotype of the opo-like mutant phenotype in Martinez-Morales et al., 2009, the retina does not look like as altered as showed here. Are the controls made for the laminin and opo MO injections complete? It seems that there is either a WB or an immunostaining, not both (as mentioned in the Results section in the reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). There are laminin alpha 1 mutant available (Pathania et al., 2014) and ezrin2 mutant (ZIRC). Overall these mutants would complement well the morphants and set good standards in the field.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>6) The authors state in the first sentence of the Discussion: &quot;active rim involution is the major driver of optic cup formation.&quot; The data presented still leave some question as to whether this is the main driver: it appears that there is still a significant amount of invagination when rim involution is disrupted. This language can be softened. Yet, if both basal constriction and rim involution are inhibited simultaneously, is invagination completely blocked?</p><p>7) Throughout the manuscript, the figures could use axes for orientation of the embryos.</p><p>8) Can the authors explain why they chose the Mann-Whitney test as the statistical test of choice throughout the manuscript?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>: Where within the optic cup were the cells that were quantified for phalloidin and phospho-myosin? A schematic of what is defined as &quot;central&quot; RNE would be helpful (here, and for many other points in the manuscript). Also, some labels on the schematic inset of 1F would be helpful (the yellow arrow is a bit hard to see).</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The authors use a pharmacological reagent, Rockout, to test the role of actomyosin contractility downstream of the Rock pathway. Did the authors carry out a dose-response test to determine the optimal dose? This question goes with the next point: were 30% of embryos unaffected by Rockout treatment?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: The categorization of phenotypes is a bit confusing. The authors have accounted for phenotypes in 70% of treated embryos; were a full 30% of embryos unaffected after 7 h treatment?

Laminin associates with fibronectin, collagen and entactin, and could be involved in multiple other processes other than providing a scaffold for migration (for example one could think that laminin is involved in maintaining apico-basal polarity and elongation of the neuroepithelial progenitor cells, before the invagination stage). Laminin may also well be involved in cell-cell signaling, and since it is expressed all around the optic vesicle, it is possible that it affects invagination indirectly. So the fact that the optic cup in the laminin morphant doesn't invaginate properly doesn't necessarily mean it is because the lamellipodia forming cells at the rim aren't binding to ECM.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers rightly point out the diverse roles of laminin. To clarify our interpretations, we implemented text changes and generated additional data:</p><p>A) We now further clarified in the rewritten manuscript that we believe that the laminin knock down phenotype is a result of interference with both, the invagination of RNE cells (most likely due to the observed perturbed basal actomyosin enrichment) and rim cell defects. We believe that the combination of these phenotypes leads to the more pronounced impairment of optic cup morphogenesis observed in this condition.</p><p>B) With respect to the apicobasal polarity. We now analyzed polarity markers. However, we did not observe gross level perturbations of the apicobasal polarity of the tissue that would hamper the RNE morphogenesis. As seen previously in Bryan et al., 2016, we observed ectopic aPKC staining in a small minority of delaminated cells at 24 hpf. This data has been added to the new version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>)</p><p>C) We performed additional experiments to clarify the role on laminin for the distribution of other ECM components. Our new data shows that indeed laminin is involved in maintaining the overall basal lamina composition and arrangement. We observed that laminin knockdown resulted in an overall enrichment of Fibronectin in the basal lamina. In control optic cups, Fibronectin was mainly localized at the rim region and under the lens placode and stained very faintly in the invaginating RNE region. However, in laminin morphants, we observe an overall enrichment of Fibronectin in the invaginating as well as rim zone. Furthermore, upon investigating Paxillin distribution in laminin morphants we observed that the rim cells respond to this altered ECM composition by less dynamic Paxillin distribution earlier outside the RNE, which most likely adds to the rim migration phenotype. Together this data shows that laminin knock down alters ECM composition and distribution which can negatively influence the migration behaviour of rim cells. This data has been implemented in the new version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">Video 15</xref>).</p><p><italic>The Opo-MO is also an indirect way of looking at ECM-cell interactions. It is difficult to think of an easy experiment to fix this point. Without a specific candidate ECM protein (none has been suggested by the authors) – it is unclear whether the cells bind laminin directly or another ECM protein, and experiments are difficult due to the multitude of possible receptors, some of which are likely to be redundant. Given that the group is using integrin-beta1-mKate2 for imaging, performing experiments involving DN-integrin-beta1 (placed under a heat shock promoter or a rim cell specific promoter) might help to clarify this issue.</italic> </p><p>In line with the reviewers’ suggestions, we obtained the Torso-betaPS DN-Integrin construct used before in (Martinez-Morales et al., 2009). This construct was implied to impair RNE invagination when overexpressed, however in less than 30% of embryos (Martinez-Morales et al., 2009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and text). We subcloned the Torso-betaPS construct and put it under a heatshock promoter with a fluorescent tag. However, using this approach, we couldn’t reproduce the previously reported invagination phenotype. Instead, we observed that paxillin in cells expressing the HS-Torso-betaPS construct localizes at apical additionally to basal positions. These findings made it in our opinion difficult to interpret the phenotypes observed and we did not add this data to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Another possibility would be to do some transplantation experiments to obtain opo and laminin morphant clones in a wt retina and observe the phenotype of the morphant rim cells (eg. lamellipodia, integrin b1 and paxillin dynamics).</italic> </p><p>We performed the transplantation experiments for the Opo morphants and indeed observed basal blebbing in the morphants clones, highlighting the autonomous nature of the phenotype. This data has been added to the new version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similar experiments are however not possible for the laminin morphants as laminin is a secreted protein and thus cell autonomy would not be expected as all control surrounding cells would generate a normal underlying laminin matrix along which the morphant cells could migrate.</p><p><italic>2) About the link between Opo and Laminin morphant phenotype to ECM-cell interactions in the rim. Time-lapse imaging experiments in a background that labels focal adhesion markers (ie. repeat the morpholino experiments in the Integrin-β1-mKate2 and Paxillin-mKate2 background and see if the short-lived foci observed in WT rim cells disappears) would really help to make the case stronger.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We carried out these experiments and they indeed helped to interpret the observed phenotypes. As mentioned already for point 1, when paxillin was followed in cells in laminin morphants, these cells show less dynamic Paxillin distribution already outside the RNE, which most likely additionally hampered their migration behaviour in addition to reduced lamellipodia and increased bleb formation.</p><p>In case of Opo morphants, with reduced integrin levels (Martinez-Morales et al., 2009), we observed more transient basal paxillin localization than in control cells. However, this paxillin distribution was not accompanied by lamellipodial formation, but by basal membrane blebbing. This inability to form normal lamellipodial protrusions hampers cellular migration as shown in the ezrin condition. Together this data highlights the importance of dynamic cell ECM attachments for rim involution. This data has been added to the latest version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">Video 16</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Delineating the contribution of basal constriction vs active migration. The analysis of both the Opo morphant and the Ezrin morphant would benefit from transplantation experiments followed by time-lapse imaging to overcome limitations of spatial specificity eg. Transplant Opo/Ezrin morphant cells into labelled, but otherwise WT, embryos. If only cells at the rim are actively migrating and are pulling the epithelial sheet behind them, the migration speed of the WT cells should not be affected until the first transplanted cells reach the rim.</italic> </p><p>We now clarified this further in the current version of the manuscript. As mentioned already in response to point 1, we show that both basal constriction and rim involution are important for the process of RNE invagination and both processes feedback onto each other. Thus, also the overall speed of cells is a combined effect of the cell behavior distribution in the tissue and not determined by the identity of individual clones. As the transplanted minority of morphant cells are surrounded by cells that move with the same kinetics as cells in controls and also the invaginating cells, that most likely additionally help rim involution are not affected, we did not expect major differences in speed. Indeed, due to these collective effects, the mosaic morphant cells migrate almost by similar speed as control cells (data not shown) underlining once more the collective nature of the migration. We have clarified this point in the new version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The authors state that this is a &quot;novel mode of active collective epithelial migration&quot;. Based on the data presented, it is not quite clear to me that this is really collective migration. The videos of EGFP-DN-Rac-expressing embryos would help significantly, as would determining whether the remaining protrusions in EGFP-DN-Rac-expressing cells are positive for actin and paxillin, and therefore might mediate a different mode of motility, rather than being pulled along (see below in specific points).</italic> </p><p>This is a good point brought up by the reviewer. We performed further experiments with the DN-Rac condition but due to experimental and technical difficulties it was not possible to exclude that the EGFP-DN-Rac expressing cells might mediate a different mode of motility. We have thus now removed this data from the manuscript. The collective nature of cell movement is still shown however for example in the transplanted morphant cells of the opo condition that reproduce the previous DN-Rac phenotype (see answer to Point 1 and Point 3, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media17">Video 17</xref>). We also added two additional videos that make clear that while rim cells are very dynamic at the basal side, they stay connected in the epithelial sheet apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Morpholino. The authors should use mutants when available, otherwise they should accordingly moderate their conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We do agree that a combination of morphant and mutant data can strengthen conclusions especially when previously unknown proteins are explored. While it is correct, that some mutants exist, we did not have them established in our fish facility and getting and growing them would have been beyond the timescale of the revision process.</p><p>However, we here used well characterize and published morpholinos, for which knock down potential has been shown in previous studies and been compared to the mutants in the case of opo and laminin-alpha1, for which mutants show very similar phenotypes as the morphants (Martinez-Morales, et al., 2009, Pollard et al., 2006). Recently, Bryan et al., 2016 also reported the optic cup morphogenesis phenotypes in the laminin-alpha1 mutant. The ezrin morpholino was used by Link et al., 2006. Here it was shown that strong ezrin depletion can result in gastrulation defects, however, we use a morpholino concentration that allows us to interfere with later developmental stages and we show that overall development and morphology of the embryos is comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Nevertheless, in addition we carried out our own knockdown controls and show that in all conditions expression levels of the genes in question are affected at the protein level (see below).</p><p><italic>For example, it looks like the quantity of opo morpholino is high (3.8ng). Other tissues involved in invagination of the RNE or potentially important for optic cup formation are also altered (eg. pre-lens ectoderm). Therefore, the strong phenotype observed might not be specific.</italic> </p><p>3,8ng is not a particularly high concentration in the field. Morpholino concentrations can vary quite significantly depending on target gene, (e.g. 4ng/embryo <italic>aPKC</italic>-lamba morpholino recapitulates heart and soul mutant phenotype (Horne-Badovinacet al., Current biology 2001), or <italic>vsx2</italic>MO was used at 6–10 ng/embryo to study its role in optic cup development (Gago-Rodrigues et al., Nat comm 2015). In terms of molarity, we inject 1.5 nL of 300µM morpholino dilution which is not particularly high in the field. Furthermore, we used similarly high or higher concentration of standard control morpholinos and did not observe any phenotypes.</p><p>We also ruled out that morpholinos lead to general morphological effects, as we did not observe differences in the development of the lens placode or RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To make the variation of phenotypes observed more transparent, we now added a detailed table on the frequency of the phenotypes to the current manuscript. (Material methods—source data1).</p><p><italic>When compared with the phenotype of the opo-like mutant phenotype in Martinez-Morales et al. 2009, the retina does not look like as altered as showed here.</italic> </p><p>The phenotype seen in our study does phenocopy the phenotype shown for zebrafish morphants as shown in the Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in the Martinez-Morales et al. 2009 Development paper.</p><p>Subtle differences, that we are nevertheless not aware of, might result from the differences in the medaka versus the zebrafish system. In personal communication with Juan Martinez Morales he confirmed that also his lab observed the rim phenotype, despite the fact that they did not further study it. Thus, we do believe that what we observe here is a genuine opo phenotype in zebrafish.</p><p><italic>Are the controls made for the laminin and opo MO injections complete?

Overall these mutants would complement well the morphants and set good standards in the field.</italic> </p><p>See our response to the first point in response 5.</p><p><italic>Suggested revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>6) The authors state in the first sentence of the Discussion: &quot;active rim involution is the major driver of optic cup formation.&quot; The data presented still leave some question as to whether this is the main driver: it appears that there is still a significant amount of invagination when rim involution is disrupted. This language can be softened. Yet, if both basal constriction and rim involution are inhibited simultaneously, is invagination completely blocked?</italic> </p><p>This is an important point brought up by the reviewers and we have now rephrased the whole manuscript according to this suggestion. Along these lines we also now cite the recently published study from the Martinez-Moralez lab, Nicolas-Perez et al., 2016. We further emphasize that both, invagination and rim involution play important roles in RNE formation. However, our data clearly shows that rim involution is a crucial player, as it contributes cells to the inner RNE that in turn directly contribute to invagination via the established actin and myosin basal bias.</p><p>We further show that the laminin knock down leads to exactly the scenario the reviewers speculate on. Upon laminin knock down both, invagination and rim migration are blocked, which is also the reason why this condition leads to the most severe phenotypes. See also our answers to Point 1, 2 and 3.</p><p><italic>7) Throughout the manuscript, the figures could use axes for orientation of the embryos.</italic> </p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have incorporated these axes in all our figures.</p><p><italic>8) Can the authors explain why they chose the Mann-Whitney test as the statistical test of choice throughout the manuscript?</italic> </p><p>We chose Mann-Whitney as the statistical test as it is a non-parametric test.

It is not clear from the MO experiments whether blebbing itself causes faulty migration, given the broad range of actions of laminin, opo and ezrin.</italic> </p><p>We apologize in case this was not clear enough in the previous version of the manuscript. We have clarified this in the current version of the manuscript. We propose that it is the perturbation of the usual protrusive activity and cell-ECM attachment that results in failed rim migration, blebbing is a cellular response observed under this condition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
