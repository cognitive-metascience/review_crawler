development has not been investigated. We show that immobilization decreases NOTCH activity and mimics a NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype, a reduction in the number of muscle progenitors and increased differentiation. Ligand-induced NOTCH activation prevents the reduction of muscle progenitors and the increase of differentiation upon immobilization. Inhibition of NOTCH ligand activity in muscle fibers suffices to reduce the progenitor pool. Furthermore, immobilization reduces the activity of the transcriptional co-activator YAP and the expression of the NOTCH ligand <italic>JAG2</italic> in muscle fibers. YAP forced-activity in muscle fibers prevents the decrease of <italic>JAG2</italic> expression and the number of PAX7+ cells in immobilization conditions. Our results identify a novel mechanism acting downstream of muscle contraction, where YAP activates <italic>JAG2</italic> expression in muscle fibers, which in turn regulates the pool of fetal muscle progenitors via NOTCH in a non-cell-autonomous manner.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15593.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15593.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15593.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Skeletal muscle is attached to the skeleton and allows the body to move. Making a new muscle, or repairing an existing one, relies on stem cells that are present inside muscles. A major goal of skeletal muscle research is to understand the signals that regulate the abilities of muscle stem cells to divide and give rise to more stem cells or to become muscle cells. Molecular signals are known to regulate the numbers of stem cells in the muscle. Skeletal muscles become larger if they are exercised, but it is not clear if mechanical forces generated by muscle contractions directly affect the number of muscle stem cells.</p><p>The NOTCH signaling pathway contributes to maintaining the population of stem cells in muscles by forcing the stem cells to divide and preventing them from becoming muscle cells. Here, Esteves de Lima et al. investigated whether muscle contraction regulates NOTCH signaling during muscle formation in chick fetuses.</p><p>The experiments show that muscle contraction stimulates the activity of a protein called YAP in muscle cells, which in turn, activates a gene in the NOTCH signaling pathway known as <italic>JAG2.</italic> This increases NOTCH signaling activity in the neighboring stem cells and maintains the number of stem cells in the muscle. The next step following this work will be to establish if this mechanism also operates during muscle formation and regeneration in other animals such as mice and zebrafish.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15593.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15593.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>myogenesis</kwd><kwd>mechanics</kwd><kwd>limb</kwd><kwd>chick</kwd><kwd>NOTCH</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-12-BSV1-0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duprez</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004923</institution-id><institution>AFM-Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AFM 16752/16826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duprez</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20140329500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duprez</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duprez</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duprez</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005737</institution-id><institution>Université Pierre et Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duprez</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mechanism links mechanical signals with the molecular YAP and NOTCH signals operating during developmental myogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle development, growth and regeneration rely on muscle stem cells. A major goal of muscle research is to understand the signals that regulate the ability of stem cells to self-renew or differentiate.</p><p>Skeletal muscle formation involves successive and overlapping phases of embryonic, fetal, perinatal and adult myogenesis. The paired homeobox transcription factors, PAX3 and PAX7, define the pool of muscle stem cells during developmental, postnatal and regenerative myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kassar-Duchossoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). Fetal myogenesis depends on PAX7-expressing muscle progenitors and is associated with muscle growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcheson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kassar-Duchossoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). Muscle progenitors undergo myogenic differentiation program with the activation of the bHLH Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs), <italic>MYF5, MRF4, MYOD, MYOG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tajbakhsh, 2009</xref>). By the end of fetal myogenesis, PAX7+ cells adopt a satellite cell position under the basal lamina of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biressi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>). During development, mechanical forces generated by muscle contraction are essential for the correct establishment of the musculoskeletal system. Although the influence of the mechanical forces for cartilage, joint, and bone development has been previously addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rolfe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shwartz et al., 2013</xref>), the consequence of muscle-induced mechanical load for the development of muscle itself is largely unknown.</p><p>The NOTCH signaling pathway is a central regulator of skeletal muscle stem cells during embryonic, fetal and adult myogenesis [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh (2014)</xref>]. Activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway requires direct cell-cell contact between a signal-sending cell that expresses the NOTCH ligand and a signal-receiving cell that expresses the NOTCH receptor. Upon ligand activation, the intracellular domain of the NOTCH receptor is cleaved, translocates into the nucleus, associates with the transcription factor RBPJ and activates the transcription of the bHLH transcriptional repressor genes, <italic>HES</italic> and <italic>HEY</italic> [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al. (2011)</xref>]. In adult myogenesis, NOTCH is involved in satellite cell activation, proliferation and quiescence [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh (2014)</xref>] and the absence of NOTCH signaling in muscle stem cells results in satellite cell depletion due to premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, during development, NOTCH has been described to activate embryonic myogenesis in somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rios et al., 2011</xref>). During developmental myogenesis, active NOTCH signaling is associated with proliferating muscle progenitors, while NOTCH ligands are expressed in differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delfini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>). NOTCH loss-of-function experiments in mice induce a loss of the muscle progenitor pool due to premature muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czajkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>), whereas NOTCH activation represses muscle differentiation in chick and mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delfini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirsinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>). While studies have identified NOTCH target genes in fetal muscle progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>), upstream regulators of NOTCH signaling during developmental myogenesis have not attracted attention.</p><p>Similarly to NOTCH, the co-transcriptional activator YAP (Yes-Associated Protein) promotes satellite cell proliferation and inhibits muscle differentiation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Judson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watt et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to being a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway, YAP has been identified as a sensor of mechanical activity and mediates cellular and transcriptional responses downstream of mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Porazinski et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to other transcription factors, YAP binds to TEAD DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varelas, 2014</xref>). YAP and TEAD1 have been shown to occupy 80% of the same promoters in human mammary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that YAP/TEAD interaction could constitute the major molecular mechanism of YAP-mediated regulation of gene transcription. The TEAD transcription factors recognize and bind to MCAT elements (CATTCC), which are enriched in regulatory regions of muscle-related genes [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wackerhage et al. (2014)</xref>]. In addition to being involved in muscle stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Judson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watt et al., 2010</xref>), YAP has been recently shown to be a critical regulator of skeletal muscle fiber size in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A link between mechanical forces (provided by muscle contraction) and signaling pathways that regulate fetal myogenesis has not been established. In this study, we show the importance of mechanical forces in the regulation of the number of fetal muscle progenitors. We show that immobilization induces a NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype in muscles. We further provide evidence that, downstream of mechanical forces, YAP positively regulates the expression of the NOTCH ligand <italic>JAG2</italic> in fibers, which maintains the pool of muscle progenitors by activating NOTCH signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of muscle contraction reduces the number of progenitors and increases their differentiation in fetal muscles</title><p>To study the effect of mechanical signals on muscle progenitors, we set up an unloading model during chick fetal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used decamethonium bromide (DMB), which blocks muscle contraction and induces rigid paralysis that leads to immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowlan et al., 2010</xref>). Two days after the inhibition of muscle contraction, we observed a reduction in the overall muscle size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,H</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crow and Stockdale, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall and Herring, 1990</xref>). In addition, we observed a decrease of 58.07% (±17.66) in the number of PAX7+ muscle progenitors in paralyzed compared to control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D-F,H-J</xref>). Consistently, the relative expression levels of <italic>PAX7</italic> and <italic>MYF5</italic> genes were significantly decreased in DMB-treated limbs compared to control limbs, as early as 12 hr after DMB application and with a more prominent effect at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to the reduction of the muscle progenitor pool, we also observed an increase of myogenic differentiation assessed by an increase of <italic>MYOD</italic> and <italic>MYOG</italic> expression using RT-q-PCR or in situ hybridization in immobilized limbs compared to control limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,G,K</xref>). The number of <italic>MYOD</italic>-expressing cells was also increased in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). In addition, muscle fibers were larger in limb muscles of DMB-treated fetuses compared to control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,I</xref>). The large muscle fibers were associated with several nuclei in paralyzed muscles, while control muscle fibers displayed only one nucleus on transverse sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Injection of pancuronium bromide (PB), a drug that exerts a flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nowlan et al., 2010</xref>) led to a similar but less pronounced effect, i.e. a 28.92% (±7.27) reduction in the number of PAX7+ cells and a concomitant increase of muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). DMB or PB treatments of chick fetal myoblast cultures did neither affect muscle progenitors nor their differentiation and did not change the expression levels of <italic>PAX7, MYF5, MYOD</italic> and <italic>MYOG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that DMB and PB did not have any off-target effect on myogenic cells. We conclude that the inhibition of muscle contraction leading to rigid or flaccid paralysis reduces the pool of fetal muscle progenitors and increases their propensity to differentiate.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15593.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of muscle contraction decreases the number of limb fetal muscle progenitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chick fetuses were treated with DMB at E7.5 and E8.5, in order to block muscle contraction.

To determine whether NOTCH signaling acts downstream of mechanical signals to regulate the muscle progenitor pool, we performed NOTCH rescue experiments in immobilization conditions. DLL1-induced NOTCH activation in chick embryos inhibits muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delfini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirsinger et al., 2001</xref>). We first performed ligand-dependent NOTCH activation and analyzed the consequences for PAX7+ cells in normal conditions of muscle activity. In <italic>DLL1</italic>-activated NOTCH limbs, the pool of PAX7+ cells was maintained at E9.5, despite inhibition of muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with the maintenance of PAX7+ progenitors in NICD-expressing cells in mouse fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, ligand-activated NOTCH maintained the number of chick fetal muscle progenitors over time and impaired their differentiation. We then forced NOTCH activity in limbs of immobilized fetuses and analyzed the consequences for muscle using the contralateral non-grafted limbs as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Under immobilization conditions, the left limbs displayed a reduction in progenitor numbers and increased differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C,E,G</xref>). In contrast, in DLL1-expressing regions of (right) limbs, the number of PAX7+ cells was increased by 215.81% (± 29.36) and myosin expression was decreased compared to control (left) limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–I</xref>). Since immobilization leads to a 2.3-fold (58.07%) reduction in the number of PAX7+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we estimated that retroviral DELTA1-induced NOTCH rescued around 93% the number of PAX7+ cells in paralyzed muscles.

To test whether the loss of NOTCH ligand in muscle fibers would suffice to reduce the size of the muscle progenitor pool, we blocked NOTCH ligand function specifically in muscle fibers. For this, we overexpressed a dominant-negative form of DELTA1 (DELTA1/DN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which prevents NOTCH ligand processing in signal-sending cells and therefore blocked NOTCH activation in signal-receiving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chitnis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henrique et al., 1997</xref>).

(2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shea et al. (2015)</xref>) but not for skeletal muscle development. We show here that mechanical signals are required to maintain the PAX7+ muscle progenitor pool during fetal myogenesis. However, muscle contraction does not change cell proliferation but rather affects the maintenance of PAX7+ cells by preventing their differentiation. Although chondrocyte proliferation is reduced in growth plates of long bone in the absence of muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roddy et al., 2011</xref>), skeletogenesis is also affected by proliferation-independent mechanisms after immobilization. Muscle contraction is necessary to maintain progenitors of the joint in an undifferentiated state and prevents their differentiation into chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahn et al., 2009</xref>). Muscle contraction also controls chondrocyte convergence extension during cartilage development in zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>). This indicates that progenitor cells of the musculoskeletal system are sensitive to mechanical signals generated by muscle contraction during development and respond to mechanical activity by several mechanisms. Interestingly in plants, physical forces contribute to stem cell maintenance acting on a master regulator (STM homeobox) of Arabidopsis shoot meristems, and this is achieved by a mechanism that is independent of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landrein et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the adult, changes in mechanical loading are known to cause variation of muscle size, but the contribution of satellite cells (adult muscle stem cells) to muscle atrophy or hypertrophy is a debated issue [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Myburgh (2014)</xref>]. However, a reduction in the number of satellite cells has been described in adult muscle disuse/unloading animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell and Pavlath, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verdijk et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, training exercises result in an increase of satellite cell number in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crameri et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suetta et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, physiological exercise has been shown to increases satellite cell numbers and to be beneficial for sarcopenic muscles [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arthur and Cooley (2012)</xref>]. Thus, our data and the available information in literature indicate that muscle stem cells are sensitive to mechanical forces during muscle development, homeostasis and ageing. It remains to be determined whether similar molecular or cellular mechanisms are active in these diverse settings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NOTCH signaling pathway acts downstream of mechanical signals during fetal myogenesis</title><p>Muscle paralysis causes a reduction of NOTCH activity and consequently muscle changes that are similar to those observed in NOTCH loss-of-function experiments. This shows that NOTCH activity is sensitive to mechanical signals during developmental myogenesis. Furthermore, ligand-induced NOTCH activation prevents the concomitant reduction of the fetal progenitor pool and increase muscle differentiation that is observed in the absence of muscle contraction. NOTCH components are also downregulated in bones of muscleless limbs of <italic>Spd</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rolfe et al., 2014</xref>), although there is no described NOTCH loss-of-function phenotype in bones of muscleless limbs or immobilized embryos. NOTCH signaling is known to control the development of the cardiovascular system, which experiences mechanical forces. The NOTCH pathway has been proposed as an intermediary between mechanical forces and heart development [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Granados-Riveron and Brook (2012)</xref>], although the precise mechanotransduction pathway has not been identified. In adult muscle, NOTCH signaling has been extensively studied during muscle homeostasis, ageing and regeneration [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mourikis and Tajbakhsh (2014)</xref>], and correlations between mechanical forces and NOTCH have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>). In summary, there is evidence for a change of NOTCH activity in different tissues during development and adult life upon muscle loading, but a functional link between mechanical signals and NOTCH has not been reported. We provide evidence that NOTCH signaling emerges as a molecular pathway that acts downstream of mechanical forces to regulate the pool of muscle progenitors during development. We believe that muscle activity acts on NOTCH ligand expression in fetal muscle fibers, since <italic>JAG2</italic> expression is lost in fibers upon unloading and the blockade of NOTCH ligand function in muscle fibers suffices to decrease the number of adjacent muscle progenitors. In zebrafish, swimming-induced exercises lead to extensive transcriptional changes in fast muscles, including modification of the expression of NOTCH ligands, <italic>Dll1, Jag1</italic> and <italic>Jag2</italic> in addition to other NOTCH components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palstra et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, on a molecular level, mechanical forces exerted by the signal-sending cell are required for ligand-induced NOTCH activation in a receiving cell that does not appear to sense forces directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang and Ha, 2013</xref>). Lastly, the NOTCH ligand Jagged1 rescues the Duchenne muscular dystrophy phenotype in zebrafish embryos and is upregulated in mildly affected dystrophin-deficient dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vieira et al., 2015</xref>). All these data converge to the idea that mechanical forces provided by muscle contraction are sensed by NOTCH ligands in muscle fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The molecular sensor of mechanical forces YAP regulates <italic>JAG2</italic> transcription in post-mitotic muscle fibers</title><p>We show here that YAP activity is sensitive to mechanical stimuli in fetal muscles in vivo. The preferential loss of YAP protein in myonuclei and YAP target gene expression in differentiated muscle cells in immobilized fetuses indicate that muscle fibers directly sense mechanical signals. Our results do not provide evidence that muscle progenitors directly sense mechanical signals, since nuclear YAP protein, proliferation rate and apoptosis were not modified in PAX7+ cells in immobilization conditions. Moreover, within fetal muscles, we did not detect any expression of the YAP target genes, <italic>ANKRD1</italic> and <italic>CTGF</italic> elsewhere than in MF20+ muscle fibers. YAP is, however, known to be expressed in activated satellite cells and has been shown to enhance satellite cell proliferation and to inhibit their differentiation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Judson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watt et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, YAP is upregulated in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and is a potent modulator of rhabdomyosarcoma formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tremblay et al., 2014</xref>). However, in addition to YAP function in muscle cell proliferation, YAP was recently shown to be upregulated in muscle fibers by mechanical overload and to be critical for the size of skeletal muscle fibers in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watt et al., 2015</xref>), highlighting an additional YAP function in post-mitotic muscle fibers upon loading. YAP and NOTCH pathways have been shown to converge in many biological systems in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yimlamai et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manderfield et al., 2015</xref>). Oncogenic YAP variants activate the NOTCH ligand <italic>JAG1</italic> and consequently NOTCH signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tschaharganeh et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, TEAD binds to regulatory sequences of the <italic>JAG1</italic> gene in human breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The current view is that YAP and NOTCH pathways converge to promote proliferation, cell fate and differentiation in a cell-autonomous manner in vertebrates. Using muscle unloading during fetal myogenesis, we provide evidence that YAP acts on muscle progenitors in a NOTCH–dependent and non-cell autonomous manner. This mechanism is reminiscent of that of the Drosophila YAP equivalent, Yorkie, during crystal cell differentiation in hematopoiesis, where Yorkie activates Serrate to induce responses in neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferguson and Martinez-Agosto, 2014</xref>). We demonstrate a mechanistic link between YAP activity in muscle fibers and the regulation of the muscle progenitor pool and show that this is mediated by a transcriptional regulation of the NOTCH ligand <italic>JAG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It remains to be determined if a similar link exists between YAP and NOTCH ligands in adult muscle fibers that could explain changes in satellite cell number during unloading or uploading of muscles. We believe that the molecular mechanism that we identify during fetal development might be central to control muscle maintenance upon mechanical loading.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15593.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of YAP and NOTCH signaling pathways in normal contracting muscles and paralyzed muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In contracting muscles, nuclear YAP (green myonuclei) and YAP target gene transcripts (green) are present in post-mitotic muscle fibers.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Gabrielle Kardon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The regulation of the pool of muscle progenitors during development is a critical determinant of muscle size. In this paper, the authors test the novel hypothesis that muscle contraction is important for regulating the number of muscle progenitors during development. By using drugs that block the contraction of muscles in the chick embryo and by molecular manipulations, they describe the possible role that YAP and NOTCH signaling may play in this process. Altogether this is a nice study with interesting hypotheses put forward which have potentially important implications, however a number of important points need to be addressed before publication can be envisaged.</p><p>1) In the Introduction, presentation of the role of the Notch pathway in myogenesis is inadequate. This is a complex situation (see for instance Mourikis and Tajbakhsh in 2014 for a partial outlook on this complexity) and presenting it as linear and simple is bound to attract criticism. The authors only refer to the role of Notch in the inhibition of myogenic differentiation of resident progenitors and satellite cells. However, opposite results have been described, e.g. in the Notch3 null mutation or the early differentiation of progenitors from the dermomyotome in the chick embryo (Kitamoto and Hanaoka, 2010; Rios et al., 2011). What this variety of responses means is that during myogenesis, Notch has different roles depending on the cellular and molecular context where it acts. This is something that should be clearly presented so that the text is less dogmatic from the start. As it is, it seems that studies that don't fit to the general hypothesis developed here are just not mentioned. In general, there is a bias towards citing much of the authors and co-authors work (and views) on what Notch is doing during myogenesis and missing other important references not only when they do not fit to the picture (see above) but even when they support the general idea (e.g. Bjornson et al. 2012).</p><p>2) The authors show that there is an increase of MyoD or Myog expression after drug treatment, which is paralleled by a decrease of PAX7 expression. They draw the conclusion that PAX7-positive cells have undergone myogenic differentiation. However, there is no definite proof that this is the case. The number of MyoD+ (or Myog+) cells could be the same after treatment, but with the number of PAX7+ cells decreasing, the proportion of MyoD+ or Myog+ cells would automatically increase (in particularly since the PAX7+ population is large). A more direct proof that this a differentiation process would be to demonstrate that the number of PAX7+ cells (per area unit) at t=0 is similar to that of MyoD+ cells per unit area at t=12 or 48 hrs. Since the authors claim there is no apoptosis (see below) the numbers should match. Furthermore a time course on MyoD and PAX7-positive cells would help.</p><p>3) The authors show that there is no change in EdU labelling in the PAX7+ population, and they conclude that there is no change in the proliferation of resident progenitors, thus supporting the hypothesis of an increase in differentiation (see above). However, the authors show that there is an increase of apoptosis in PAX7-negative cells in the muscle masses. How can they exclude that after drug treatment, the resident progenitors lose PAX7 expression, then undergo apoptosis? It is a concern that the cell population undergoing apoptosis is not identified.</p><p>4) The Notch ligand Jag2 and the Notch response (Hes5 and HeyL) are more strongly reduced after 12 than 48h, while the phenotype is stronger after 48h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The authors should discuss an explanation for this time difference.</p><p>5) The over-expression of Dll1 with RCAS viruses will target both the resident progenitors and the differentiated fibers. Since it is known that Notch is activated in trans and inhibited in cis (see del Alamo et al. Curr. Biol. 2011 for review), what conclusion can be drawn from this experiment? It would be important in these overexpression experiments to check cell type specificity, using the available tools.</p><p>In addition, since the authors claim it is Jag2 that is the ligand, why not use its cDNA? They could have used electroporation of Jag2 in combination with the muscle-specific promoter they used with the next experiment (DN Dll1) that would drive its expression in differentiated fibers. It would also have been appropriate to use siRNA directed against Jag2. The reviewers do not insist on redoing the experiments with Jag2, although if the authors have these data they should be included. in any case, since Jag2 is membrane bound, they should show that they have an effect only in cells in direct contact with the Jag2/ Dll1 over-expressing fibers.</p><p>6) It is not clear that Yap activation is downstream of muscle contraction and also that Yap activates Jag2 expression in myofibers. Of course, the most convincing data would be for the authors to show that ectopic activation of YAP in myofibers (via Tol2 MLC electroporation) rescues the loss of PAX7+ progenitors when myofibers have been immobilized. This experiment would considerably strengthen the paper and should be do-able by the authors since they have the Tol2 MLC construct.</p><p>7) Since YAP is such an ubiquitously expressed molecule, the authors should be careful in the phrasing of the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15593.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>1) In the Introduction, presentation of the role of the Notch pathway in myogenesis is inadequate.

We are aware that additional roles of NOTCH have been described during embryonic and adult myogenesis. We now mention the role of NOTCH during the activation of embryonic myogenesis in axial somites (Rios et al., 2011) and during activation, proliferation and quiescence of satellite cells. We also cite the Bjornson et al. (2012) paper, which shows a role for NOTCH in maintaining the number of satellite cells by inhibiting differentiation.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors show that there is an increase of MyoD or Myog expression after drug treatment, which is paralleled by a decrease of PAX7 expression. They draw the conclusion that PAX7-positive cells have undergone myogenic differentiation. However, there is no definite proof that this is the case.

Since the authors claim there is no apoptosis (see below) the numbers should match. Furthermore a time course on MyoD and PAX7-positive cells would help.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, there is no good commercial antibody against chick MYOD or MYOG (in contrast to the situation in mice), so we cannot calculate the number of PAX7+ and MYOD+ cells. In order to estimate the number of MYOD-expressing cells, we therefore counted the number of Hoechst+ nuclei of MYOD-expressing cells (based on MYOD in situ hybridization) versus the total number of Hoechst+ nuclei in muscles. We observed an increase in the percentage of MYOD-expressing cells in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, we observed larger Myosin+ fibres, with multiple grouped nuclei in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The increase in the number of MYOD-expressing cells, of MYOD and MYOG expression (in situ hybridization and RT-q-PCR) combined with the larger muscle fibres with multiple nuclei in paralyzed muscles compared to control muscles leads us to conclude that the decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells is due to increased differentiation. Lastly, the reversion of the muscle phenotype i.e. diminution of differentiation (and increase in the number of PAX7+ cells) upon DLL1- activated NOTCH in immobilisation conditions, is also an indirect argument that there is an increase of differentiation (in addition to the decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells) in immobilisation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We have added the 24 hour time point for PAX7, MYF5, MYOD and MYOG expression levels in immobilised limbs versus control limbs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This provides us with an intermediary time point between 12 hours and 48 hours.</p><p> <italic>3) The authors show that there is no change in EdU labelling in the PAX7+ population, and they conclude that there is no change in the proliferation of resident progenitors, thus supporting the hypothesis of an increase in differentiation (see above). However, the authors show that there is an increase of apoptosis in PAX7-negative cells in the muscle masses. How can they exclude that after drug treatment, the resident progenitors lose PAX7 expression, then undergo apoptosis? It is a concern that the cell population undergoing apoptosis is not identified.</italic></p><p>We have looked at apoptosis 24 hours after DMB treatment and there is no increased apoptosis in paralysed muscles compared to control muscles. Since there are no double labeled PAX7+/Tunel+ cells 48 hours after immobilisation, we conclude that muscle progenitors do not undergo apoptosis in paralyzed muscles (48 hours after immobilisation).</p><p>The apoptosis observed in muscles paralyzed for 48 hours is rarely observed in MF20 + cells or Desmin+ cells (now added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Desmin expression allows us to cover myogenic cells between progenitors (PAX7) and fibres (MF20). This result shows that myogenic cells do not undergo apoptosis upon immobilisation. One likely hypothesis is that apoptosis is observed in non-myogenic cells, such as muscle connective tissue cells.</p><p> <italic>4) The Notch ligand Jag2 and the Notch response (Hes5 and HeyL) are more strongly reduced after 12 than 48h, while the phenotype is stronger after 48h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The authors should discuss an explanation for this time difference.</italic> </p><p>Since JAG2 is also expressed in vessels, it is difficult to speculate on a stronger effect at 12 h 4 than 48h. We believe that the q-PCR experiments confirm the decrease of JAG2 expression in limbs, which is clearly observed in limb muscles by in situ hybridisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p> <italic>5) The over-expression of Dll1 with RCAS viruses will target both the resident progenitors and the differentiated fibers. Since it is known that Notch is activated in trans and inhibited in cis (see del Alamo et al. Curr. Biol. 2011 for review), what conclusion can be drawn from this experiment? It would be important in these overexpression experiments to check cell type specificity, using the available tools.</italic> </p><p>DLL1 overexpression experiments with the RCAS virus lead to a NOTCH gain-of-function phenotype in chick limbs (Delfini et al., 2000, Bonnet et al., 2010, Havis et al., 2012) or in chick somites (Hirsinger et al., 2001). DLL1-activated NOTCH maintains the expression of muscle progenitor markers including PAX3, MYF5 and FGFR4, while inhibiting the expression of muscle differentiation genes, MYOD, MYOG, DES and MEF2C and Myosins (Bonnet et al., 2010, Havis et al., 2012). Based on the RCAS system, DLL1 will be overexpressed only in a subset of proliferating cells (any cell types). Consequently, DLL1 will act in trans to adjacent cells. Therefore, even if a subset of proliferating cells overexpressing DLL1 inhibited NOTCH in cis, the DLL1 signal is sufficient to activate</p><p>NOTCH in trans according to the phenotypes observed after DLL1 overexpression in muscles, as reported in the papers cited above.</p><p> <italic>In addition, since the authors claim it is Jag2 that is the ligand, why not use its cDNA? They could have used electroporation of Jag2 in combination with the muscle-specific promoter they used with the next experiment (DN Dll1) that would drive its expression in differentiated fibers. It would also have been appropriate to use siRNA directed against Jag2. The reviewers do not insist on redoing the experiments with Jag2, although if the authors have these data they should be included.</italic></p><p>We used the DLL1/RCAS virus since it has been proven to induce consistently a NOTCH gain-of-function phenotype in limb muscles, i.e. an inhibition of muscle differentiation (based on the inhibition of differentiation muscle markers) and maintenance of progenitors (based on the expression of muscle progenitor markers) (Delfini et al., 2000; Bonnet et al., 2010; Havis et al., 2012). Moreover, we now show that the long-term activation of (DLL1-mediated) NOTCH maintains the number of PAX7+ cells despite the absence of differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is fully consistent with mouse data that show that activated Notch (NICD in Myf5+ cells) sustains muscle progenitors despite a block of differentiation (Mourikis et al., 2012).</p><p>To block NOTCH ligand activity, we have used an already described dominant negative form of DLL1, which has been shown to block the activity of all NOTCH ligands by preventing NOTCH ligand processing in signal-sending cells and therefore blocked NOTCH activation in signal-receiving cells (Chitnis, 2006; Henrique et al., 1997).</p><p>The DLL1/RCAS and DLL1/DN tools were already available and have been proven to be efficient to increase NOTCH activity and block NOTCH ligand function, respectively, so we did not repeat the experiments with JAG2.</p><p><italic>In any case, since Jag2 is membrane bound, they should show that they have an effect only in cells in direct contact with the Jag2/ Dll1 over-expressing fibers.</italic></p><p>The phenotype observed is a decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells upon loss of NOTCH ligand function in differentiated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). So it will be difficult to visualize a direct contact with the DLL1/DN overexpressing fibres (Tomato) and the absent PAX7+ cells.</p><p> <italic>6) It is not clear that Yap activation is downstream of muscle contraction and also that Yap activates Jag2 expression in myofibers. Of course, the most convincing data would be for the authors to show that ectopic activation of YAP in myofibers (via Tol2 MLC electroporation) rescues the loss of PAX7+ progenitors when myofibers have been immobilized. This experiment would considerably strengthen the paper and should be do-able by the authors since they have the Tol2 MLC construct.</italic></p><p>We have now performed the YAP rescue experiments in differentiated muscle cells (using the MLC promoter and the Tol2 stable vectors). We indeed found that forced YAP activity (YapS112A) in differentiated muscle cells (using the MLC promoter) prevented the decrease in the number of PAX7+ cells in immobilization conditions. It also prevented the downregulation of JAG2 transcription in muscles. Moreover, YapS112A activated the expression of ANKRD1 in paralyzed muscles. All these data are now included in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In agreement with the referees, we believe that this YAP rescue experiment greatly strengthens the conclusion of the paper.</p><p> <italic>7) Since YAP is such an ubiquitously expressed molecule, the authors should be careful in the phrasing of the conclusions.</italic></p><p>We have tried to be careful in our conclusions. Although YAP transcripts and protein are observed in many (if not all) cell types, our data nevertheless show that YAP acts downstream of muscle contraction to regulate JAG2 transcription in muscle fibres, which then regulates the pool of muscle progenitors via NOTCH.</p></body></sub-article></article>
