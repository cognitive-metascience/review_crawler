Despite the existence of several high-resolution structures of pLGICs, their dynamical properties remain elusive. Using the proton-gated channel GLIC, we engineered multiple fluorescent reporters, each incorporating a bimane and a tryptophan/tyrosine, whose close distance causes fluorescence quenching. We show that proton application causes a global compaction of the extracellular subunit interface, coupled to an outward motion of the M2-M3 loop near the channel gate. These movements are highly similar in lipid vesicles and detergent micelles. These reorganizations are essentially completed within 2 ms and occur without channel opening at low proton concentration, indicating that they report a pre-active intermediate state in the transition pathway toward activation. This provides a template to investigate the gating of eukaryotic neurotransmitter receptors, for which intermediate states also participate in activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23955.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23955.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the nervous system, proteins of the pLGIC family are found in the membrane that surrounds each neuron. These proteins have channels that can allow ions to pass through the membrane and are responsible for transmitting electrical signals from one neuron to the next. Small molecules called neurotransmitters interact with the pLGICs to open or close the ion channel. If the ability of the pLGIC channels to open is altered, it can lead to behavioral changes like addiction, or diseases such as schizophrenia or epilepsy.</p><p>For a pLGIC channel to switch between the “open” and “closed” states, specific parts of the protein need to move in relation to each other. However, to study these transitions researchers have previously relied on comparing the three-dimensional structures of open and closed pLGICs extracted out of the cell membrane. Different techniques are needed to directly follow these movements within membranes.</p><p>Bacteria also have proteins belonging to the pLGIC family, and Menny et al. have now investigated one such bacterial protein to understand how pLGICs open. First, a small fluorescent molecule that glows differently if the environment around it changes was attached to various parts of the bacterial channel. These fluorescent markers revealed how several parts of the protein move and they also made it possible to measure how quickly these movements take place. Some of these movements happen before the channel opens, suggesting that the activation of this pLGIC protein happens in stages and involves the protein adopting a temporary intermediate state.</p><p>The next step will be to better understand the structure of the intermediate state, which could help us to understand how pLGICs work in the nervous systems of animals. In future this may aid the design of new drugs that can modify the activity of these channels in patients with neurological conditions or addictions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

fast chemical signaling between cells. Prominent members of the family include nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChRs), serotonin-type-3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs), glycine (GlyRs) and γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) receptors that are widely expressed in the nervous system. Their mutation can cause congenital myasthenia, epilepsy, hyperekplexia and possibly autistic and schizophrenic syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinlein, 2012</xref>). They are the target of major classes of therapeutic substances, including anxiolytics and sedatives, general anesthetics, smoking cessation drugs and antiemetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corringer et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying their chemo-electric conversion is currently the matter of intensive work.</p><p>Following the medium resolution structure of the <italic>Torpedo marmorata</italic> nAChR by electron microscopy in lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyazawa et al., 2003</xref>), the first X-ray structures of full-length pLGICs were obtained on the bacterial homologs <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> Ligand-gated Ion Channel (ELIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hilf and Dutzler, 2008</xref>) and <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> Ligand-gated Ion Channel (GLIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hilf and Dutzler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>), followed by structures of eukaryotic members: the GluClαR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Althoff et al., 2014</xref>), the β3GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2014</xref>), the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hassaine et al., 2014</xref>), the α1GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2015</xref>) by electron microscopy, the α<sub>3</sub>GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) by crystallography and the α4β2 nAChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>) showing a highly conserved fold from bacteria to mammals. pLGICs are composed of five identical or homologous subunits arranged pseudosymmetrically around a central ion-conducting channel. They bind neurotransmitters within their extracellular domain (ECD), promoting remote opening of an intrinsic ion channel within their transmembrane domain (TMD). Each subunit’s ECD is composed of a rigid β-sandwich. The orthosteric binding sites for neurotransmitters are located at the subunit interface, halfway between the membrane and the top of the ECD. Each subunit’s TMD is composed of four membrane-spanning α-helices named M1–4. M2 lines the ion channel, its upper part contributing to the gate that shuts the pore in the closed conformation. The well-conserved loops 2, 7 and M2–M3 are found at the ECD-TMD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of GLIC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Positions for fluorophore and quencher insertion.

The major states can be classified as: resting (with a closed channel and a low affinity for agonists), active (with an open channel) and desensitized (with a closed channel and a high affinity for agonists) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Changeux and Edelstein, 2005</xref>). In addition, ensemble and single-channel kinetic analyses identified short-lived intermediate states during activation of nAChRs and GlyRs. These states, named ‘flip’ and ‘prime’, display increased agonist affinity as compared to the resting state but still carry a closed channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burzomato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, desensitization was early described as involving multiple conformations, including fast and slow desensitized states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakmann et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>Among pLGICs of known structures, GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prevost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>), GluClα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Althoff et al., 2014</xref>) and α1GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2015</xref>) were each solved in three different conformations showing multiple tertiary and quaternary conformations that are difficult to assign to a particular allosteric state. Notably, all the structures were solved on detergent-solubilized proteins, most of them constrained in a crystal lattice that appears, in several cases, to be favoring a particular conformation regardless of the nature of bound ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al., 2012</xref>). Complementary methods are thus required to study the conformational changes of lipid-inserted, unconstrained receptors, in a time-resolved manner.</p><p>Here, we used the proton-gated ion channel GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>) to identify the conformational changes that occur during gating in the family of pLGIC channels. GLIC has been crystallized in three conformations (called open, closed and locally-closed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prevost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>) and studied by molecular dynamics, normal mode analysis and EPR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calimet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Velisetty et al., 2014</xref>).

The methods consist in covalently linking the protein with a fluorophore, here the small and pH-insensitive bimane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), together with the insertion of a tryptophan or a tyrosine residue that quenches the fluorophore when the inter-residue Cα-Cα distances are less than approximately 15 Å and 10 Å, respectively. The Tr/TyrIQ approach was validated on the model system T4 lysosyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansoor et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones Brunette et al., 2014</xref>) and was previously used to follow the allosteric transitions of proteins such as the β2-adrenoceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2006</xref>) and the lactose permease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smirnova et al., 2014</xref>). Previous fluorescence-based studies on pLGICs have used large fluorophores to follow conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Talwar and Lynch, 2015</xref>), but the TrIQ method has the unique advantage of allowing the assignment of fluorescence changes to relative motions between a fluorophore and a quencher of small sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smirnova et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bimanes characteristics and labeling of GLIC-expressing cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Structures of the Monobromo bimane (mBBr) and the bimane Bunte salt (BBs) before and after reaction with cysteines.

A bimane was introduced at: (1) the subunit interface at the top of the ECD (D136 and V135 on loop B) and the middle of the ECD (R133 on loop B, at the level of the orthosteric site), to monitor the quaternary reorganizations of this domain; and (2) at both sides of the ECD-TMD interface, at the bottom of the ECD (K33 on loop 2), on the M2-M3 loop (the most N-ter proline of the loop P250), and at the top of pore-lining M2 α-helix (E243, also termed E19’, which is nearby the channel gate residues I233/I9’ and I240/I16’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each targeted position, a cysteine was engineered on the GLIC Cys-less background (C27S, which does not produce functional alterations [<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>]), followed by bimane labeling through cysteine modification. Each mutant was first characterized by two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes before and after bimane labeling to verify the functionality of the channel. Mutants were then expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes, labeled with bimane and studied by fluorescence in detergent (n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside) or asolectin liposomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Electrophysiological characterizations of the bimane-labeled mutants</title><p>We first developed a labeling procedure in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Indeed, we found that the currently used mBBr (Monobromo bimane) does not efficiently label surface receptors, since the reporter mutant GLIC Q193C (pre-M1), which is fully inhibited by reaction with methyl-methanethiosulfate (MMTS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), is neither affected nor protected from MMTS inhibition by mBBr treatment. Control experiments on chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing GLIC-D136C showed no surface labeling, but clear accumulation of the fluorophore in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To decrease the hydrophobicity of the reagent, we synthesized the bimane-derived Bunte salt (BBs), introducing a negatively charged SO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> leaving group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). After reaction with cysteine residues, the mBBr and BBs yield almost the same coupling product, with similar fluorescence and side-chain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansoor and Farrens, 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). GLIC-expressing CHO cells show weak entry of the BBs in the cytoplasm and strong labeling at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, BBs labeling of Q193C-expressing oocytes led to a severe loss of function indicating an efficient reaction with the surface receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Most mutants investigated herein were functional, generating robust pH-elicited currents, with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). For all functional mutants, after BBs labeling, currents showed wild-type like biphasic GLIC activation kinetics, with time constants ranging from 1 to 2.8 s (τ1) and 5 to 8.9 s (τ2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), except for P250C baring its endogenous quencher Y197 (termed P250C-Y197) which displays slower kinetics of activation (5.4 s and 50 s). pH-current relationship measurements show ∆pH<sub>50</sub> (pH value for which half of the maximal electrophysiological response is recorded) of less than one between wild-type and BBs-labeled mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

For mutant Bimane-133, the introduction of W23 (β1 strand), W44 (β2 strand) and W101 (β6 strand) has little impact on the fluorescence at all pHs suggesting that these positions are never within quenching distances of the bimane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For mutant Bimane-136, the introduction of W93 (β5 strand) produces a strong fluorescence decrease at all pHs indicating in this case that this residue is always within quenching distance of the bimane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, both the Bimane-133-W103 and Bimane-136-W101 show a marked pH-dependent fluorescence decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

The GLIC structures show a tryptophan (W72 on loop 4) on the same subunit that could play the role of an endogenous quencher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). W72 is a residue strictly conserved in all pLGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corringer et al., 2012</xref>). To determine whether W72 has a role in the fluorescence phenotype while avoiding severe mutation-induced structural alteration that would result from the loss of W72, we solved the X-ray structure of Bimane-135 GLIC at pH 4 at 2.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The structure shows a protein conformation quasi-identical to the wild-type GLIC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>) at pH 4 (RMSD = 0.26 Å), with an additional electron density around C135 allowing unambiguous construction of a bimane moiety in two out of the five subunits. The data indeed show that the bimane is at a minimal 3.2 Å distance from the indole ring of W72, which is therefore most likely the major partner in the pH-elicited fluorescence changes of Bimane-135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As the 135 side chain projects at the subunit interface, the quenching of Bimane-135 by W72 seen up to pH 4 suggests a contraction of the domains interfaces, driving the bimane moiety toward W72, although other mechanisms are possible. At very low pH, the bimane appears to move away from the W72.</p><p>Finally, we investigated a local tertiary motion of the orthosteric site, by combining the Bimane-136 (loop B) mutation with the introduction of a tryptophan at position 178 at the tip of the loop C from the same subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). W178 leads to a 50% decrease in fluorescence at all pHs tested, indicating that both positions (136 and 178) are within quenching distance, and suggesting that their relative distance is unchanged upon increase of proton concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), in agreement with EPR measurements that suggest an immobility of this position upon pH drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>). It is noteworthy that loop C has been proposed to undergo a closing motion during activation of pLGICs, a feature not seen here with fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analysis of bimane-quencher pairs at the ECD/TMD interface in DDM micelles</title><p>First, we introduced a bimane at the tip of loop 2 in the ECD (Bimane-33), which lies on top of the M2 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bimane-33 shows a twofold pH-dependent decrease in fluorescence from pH 7.3 to pH 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A putative quencher near Bimane-33, W160, is located on the adjacent subunit on the β9 strand at the bottom of the outer beta sandwich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Its mutation (W160F) essentially abolishes the proton-elicited fluorescent decrease, with only a 20% decrease in intensity at pH 6, followed by a return to pH 7-like values at lower pHs, showing that Bimane-33 and W160 come closer together in the presence of protons.</p><p>Second, we introduced a bimane at position 250 within the M2-M3 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bimane-250 shows a 30% increase in intensity as the pH is decreased from 7.3 to 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The effect of three surrounding tyrosines and a single tryptophan were investigated through mutation to phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutants Bimane-250-W160F (β9 strand) and -Y194F (pre-M1) both lead to a modest increase in fluorescence at all pHs suggesting that W160 and Y194 remain at similar quenching distances of the bimane, independently of the protein conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, Y197F (M1 helix) and Y251F (M2-M3 loop) reduce the fluorescence quenching at high pHs, yielding a flat pH-dependent curve. The mutant Bimane-250-Y251F is non-functional (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which could result in its incapacity to visit different conformations and thus account for this phenotype. In contrast, the mutant Bimane-250-Y197F is functional, the unquenching phenotype showing that positions 250 and 197 move away from each other in the presence of protons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Third, we introduced a bimane on the top of the M2 α-helices (Bimane-243) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon acidification, the fluorescence decreases slightly at pH 4 and then increases at pH 3, pointing to complex reorganizations. We introduced tryptophan residues around the probe but failed to engineer new pH-dependent quenching pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, the mutants were either non-functional (Bimane-243-W33, -W201 and -W242) or functional but not eliciting pH-dependent fluorescence variations (Bimane-243-W238 and -W241) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Nonetheless, regardless of the functionality of the mutants, Bimane-243 is robustly quenched by all the introduced tryptophans at pH 7.3. As most introduced tryptophans are located in the TMD, the fluorescence data, in combination with GLIC structure inspection, suggests that the bimane fused bis-heterocycle at position 243 points toward the helix bundle of the adjacent subunit. In addition, the mutant Bimane-243 shows an emission blue shift (10 nm) and a fluorescence 1.6 times higher than the denatured protein at pH 7.3 possibly reporting a confined/hydrophobic environment of the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) adding more evidence to its presence inside the bundle of helix. Hence, the unassigned fluorescence variations at position 243 could account for motions of the top of the M2-helix relative to the rest of the subunit’s TMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The six fluorescent sensors report allosteric reorganizations of GLIC</title><p>Altogether, the TrIQ/TyrIQ analysis generates a series of fluorescent reporters spanning from the apex of the ECD to the top of the pore lining M2 helices. Sensors at positions 136–101, 135–72, 133–103, 33–160, 250–197 and 243 follow the reorganizations of fully functional channels and have been selected for further analysis. In contrast, some sensors, such as the 250–160 and 243–101, are of non-functional channels but still show specific quenching signals. This illustrates that particular conformational motions are not necessarily linked to pore opening. Since the molecular mechanisms impairing the function of these mutants are not known, they were not used for further analysis.</p><p>At each selected position, changes in bimane/quencher distances could be the result of: (1) local side chains reorganizations, for example due to the protonation of residues surrounding the fluorophore and/or quencher, possibly affecting their orientation, regardless of the allosteric state of the receptor, or (2) global allosteric protein motions, mainly comprising backbone reorganizations. Two sets of experiments strongly support the latter hypothesis. First, we generated the mutant Bimane-135-W72-E67Q-E75Q-D91N, for which all titratable residues surrounding the Bimane-135-W72 pair were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This mutant shows the same pH-dependence of fluorescence as the simple mutant Bimane-135-W72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the fluorescence variations are independent of the protonation of surrounding titratable residues. Second, we measured fluorescence variations in the presence of propofol, a negative allosteric modulator of GLIC. Propofol binds to the transmembrane domain of GLIC with an IC<sub>50</sub> ≈ 25 µM and stabilizes closed channel conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nury et al., 2011</xref>). In presence of saturating concentrations of propofol, mutants Bimane-136-W101, Bimane-135-W72, Bimane-250-Y197 and Bimane-243 show a shift of the pH-fluorescence relationship curve toward higher proton concentrations, in agreement with the effect of an allosteric inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The observation that the binding of an effector to the TMD influences the fluorescence variations at the top of the ECD, more than 50 Å away, establishes that the fluorescence sensors indeed report global allosteric motions.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Effects of amino acid protonation and propofol on the fluorescence variations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Fluorescence intensities of the mutants Bimane-135-W72 and Bimane-135-W72-E67Q-E75Q-D91N normalized on each mutant’s intensity at pH 7.3.

To better visualize the pH-dependent changes, the data were normalized to the pH 8/7 values, showing that the marked pH-dependent changes of Bimane-250 and Bimane-33 are conserved in lipids, although Bimane-33-W160F is significantly brighter in detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Additionally, Bimane-243 shows similar pH-dependent variations in fluorescence in detergent and lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The data thus suggest that the relative movements at positions 33–160 and 250–197 are also essentially conserved in lipids.</p><p>We propose that the differences in fluorescence intensity at certain positions between detergent and lipids are in line with their proximity to the membrane. Indeed, the GLIC structure at pH 4 shows the presence of a bundle of detergent within the pore and of a bound lipid in the upper part of the TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>). These bound molecules could contribute to the differences in microenvironment observed here.</p><p>It is noteworthy that, contrary to GLIC, most pLGICs are highly sensitive to the membrane environment. For instance, CHAPS-solubilized muscle nAChRs are strongly stabilized in a desensitized conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martinez et al., 2002</xref>) and their reconstitution in the absence of anionic lipids or cholesterol (PC liposomes) yields an ‘uncoupled’ conformation that binds agonist with resting state–like low affinity, but does not undergo agonist-evoked conformational transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">daCosta et al., 2013</xref>). GLIC does not exhibit the same propensity to adopt an uncoupled conformation and, contrary to ELIC, retains the ability to undergo proton-elicited conformational change and to activate in PC liposomes and other lipid mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labriola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dellisanti et al., 2013</xref>).

While this very fast component is not resolved here, completion of the fluorescence variations in 2 ms indicates an upper value of the time constant below 1 ms.

As the slow components at all positions (except E243) show fluorescence variations in the same direction as the very fast component, it may suggest that the whole protein follows the previously described motions under prolonged applications of protons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Ion flux assays in liposomes and comparison with fluorescence data</title><p>We next investigated how the kinetics of the conformational changes measured above compare with kinetics of activation/desensitization of GLIC. For this, we recorded channel activity from purified GLIC reconstituted in asolectin liposomes, using a fluorescence-based sequential-mixing stopped-flow assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rusinova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCoy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Posson et al., 2015</xref>). GLIC Cys-less and mutant Bimane-136-W101 were reconstituted in liposomes containing the water-soluble fluorophore 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and mixed sequentially, first with protons to activate the channels (step 1), and then with the channel-permeable ANTS-fluorescence-quencher thallium to assess the flux through open channels (step 2). By including a variable delay time (10–200 ms) between the two steps, we are able to capture the channels in various levels of activation and/or desensitization and thus populate different functional states. Upon thallium influx into the liposomes via active GLIC the ANTS fluorescence gets quenched, and the quenching rate is proportional to channel activity. Due to intrinsic variations in liposome sizes (the mean diameter of vesicles is ~ 150 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010</xref>]) and different numbers of channels per liposome, the data were fit with a stretched exponential in order to obtain the average quenching rate at 2 ms, a measure of channel activity (see Materials and methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingólfsson and Andersen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rusinova et al., 2014</xref>]).</p><p>Both GLIC Cys-less and mutant Bimane-136-W101 show fast fluorescence decay with a rate of ≈ 80 s<sup>−1</sup> after incubation for 15 ms at pH 4.5 and 4.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

According to these data the pH<sub>50</sub> for GLIC Cys-less and GLIC Bimane-136-W101 is estimated at pH 4.6 and pH 4.7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Increasing the pre-mix time did not increase the rates of fluorescence quenching at any of the pH values tested, suggesting that 15 ms are sufficient to reach the maximal activation of GLIC.

Indeed, at pH 5, the majority of the fluorescence changes are completed, whereas almost no receptors are yet active. This directly reveals an intermediate conformation of the protein, where the quaternary motion of positions 136 and 101 moving closer together has occurred, but where the channel is still closed. Interestingly, a similar scenario is seen at other positions, for which activation curves in oocytes (∆I curves) are significantly shifted to higher proton concentrations as compared to ∆F curves, especially at positions 135 and 250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Since ∆I curves are shifted to the left as compared to ∆If curves (for GLIC Cys-less and Bimane-136-W101), it is expected that ∆If and ∆F would be even more separated for the other mutants. Hence, our data suggest that the intermediate conformation involves global motions of the protein, notably the adjacent subunits moving closer at the level of the ECD (positions 136–101 and 135–72) as well as the separation between positions 250 and 197 and thus the outward motion of the M2-M3 loop.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed a series of allosteric sensors of the conformation of GLIC using the TrIQ/TyrIQ method. Upon pH drop, GLIC undergoes a cascade of allosteric transitions from the resting to the active and desensitized states. This method allows the investigation, in a time resolved manner, of the global evolution of this mixture of states depending on the proton concentration.</p><p>While the quenching method follows the fate of mixed populations of receptors, it is informative to compare these ensemble conformational motions to those inferred from the static structures of GLIC solved by crystallography. GLIC was solved at a low proton concentration in a closed-channel conformation (pH 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>) and at a high proton concentration in an apparently open-channel conformation (pH 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hilf and Dutzler, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, measurement of the variation of Cβ-Cβ distances between the pH 7 and pH 4 structures parallel the motions inferred from fluorescence measurements at positions 136–101, 133–103 and 33–160 in the ECD, that are reporting the subunits moving closer together, and positions 250–197 that follow the separation of the M2-M3 loop from the top of M1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). It is thus likely that the molecular reorganizations inferred from the comparison of the two X-ray structures are contributing to the ensemble motions followed by fluorescence. However, at other positions, namely at pairs 243–238 (top of the TMD) and 136–178 (Loop C), no correlation between the structures and the population ensembles can be observed. This suggests that, at these levels, the receptors might undergo different reorganizations when GLIC is outside of the crystal, and/or that additional conformational states are contributing to the overall fluorescence signal.</p><p>A key finding of the work is the identification of an intermediate state, where the ECD compaction and the outward movement of the M2-M3 loop, monitored by bimane quenching, are not concerted with channel opening. This is directly demonstrated with the 136/101 pair, that reports nearly complete ECD compaction in steady-state conditions, at pH 5, when no ion fluxes are yet recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We also show that the isomerization toward this intermediate state is very fast, since 60% of the transition is achieved in less than 2 ms at pH 5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). This suggests that the isomerization toward this intermediate state precedes or is at least concomitant with activation. Indeed, previous studies identify GLIC as a slow activating channel within the pLGIC family. For GLIC reconstituted in asolectin liposomes recorded in the inside-out configuration, the activation time constant (τ) is in the 10 ms range upon activation by a very high proton concentration (pH 2.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>). Likewise, in HEK cells, out-side-out patch clamp recordings under fast perfusion, at pH 4, reveal activation time constants ranging from 30 to 150 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laha et al., 2013</xref>). While the activation kinetics of GLIC in liposomes could not be resolved in the present study, it is likely that the very fast transition toward the intermediate state is part of the activation mechanism. Altogether, we propose a kinetic scheme where a global ‘pre-activation’ step first occurs in under 2 ms, involving the whole ECD compaction and the outward motion of the M2-M3 loop, followed by a slower and more localized transition for channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This latter motion may plausibly be related to the fluorescence changes observed in the 5–966 ms ranges, that are particularly marked for the 243 reporter which is located near the channel gate.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Conformational motions summary.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Global and zoomed in view of the GLIC<sub>pH 7</sub> structure, representing only two subunits, with the left structures viewed from the outside of the pentamer and the right structures from the inside.

Among these, the structures of GLIC bearing a disulphide bridge C33-C245, as well as the single mutant GLIC E243P, show a particularity with the M2-M3 loop revolved outwards, identically as for GLIC<sub>pH 4</sub>, but still with a closed ion channel. Hence, we may speculate that this particular LC conformation could be a candidate for the pre-active state of GLIC, since it shows compaction of the ECD and motion of the M2-M3 loop without channel opening.</p><p>We also observe molecular reorganizations occurring on longer time scale. First, quenching experiments show small fluorescence changes in the 966 ms–30 s range for all positions. Second, ion flux experiments show a decrease in channel activity when GLIC is pre-incubated with protons for a more than 100 ms. These events could thus be linked to receptor desensitization. Indeed, in HEK cells, out-side-out patch clamp recordings show desensitization to be biphasic, with a fast component observed on half of the patches (τ around 200 ms), followed by a slow component observed in all patches (τ around 10 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laha et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, previous analysis of the desensitization mechanism of GLIC by EPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Velisetty and Chakrapani, 2012</xref>), and of other pLGICs by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gielen et al., 2015</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinde et al., 2015</xref>), support the view that desensitization proceeds through a narrowing of the lower part of the channel. Additionally, recently published X-ray structures of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2014</xref>) and of the α4β2 nAChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>) were proposed to correspond to a desensitized conformation and show a channel constriction in the bottom part of the ECD. Therefore, desensitization might occur through reorganizations in the TMD, with comparatively smaller motion at the ECD and particularly at the ECD-TMD interface.</p><p>In conclusion, the monitoring of electrophysiologically silent states by the TrIQ/TyrIQ method allows us to structurally describe an intermediate state and propose a pre-activation mechanism. Interestingly, available structures of eukaryotic pLGICs, namely the GluClαR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Althoff et al., 2014</xref>) and the α1GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2015</xref>), also suggest a quaternary compaction of the ECD upon agonist binding, as well as outward motions of the M2-M3 loop upon channel opening that are similar to that observed on GLIC. In addition, ϕ-value analysis following extensive mutational analysis of the muscle nAChR further suggest that the top of the ECD around the orthosteric pocket, as well as the M2-M3 loop move early in the course of the gating transition toward the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purohit et al., 2013</xref>). The present study thus not only sheds light on the gating mechanism of the pLGIC model GLIC, but also provides a structural template to investigate the gating of eukaryotic and mammalian receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Buffers and chemicals</title><p>Buffer A consists of 20 mM Tris and 300 mM NaCl, adjusted to pH 7.4 unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Buffer B consists of 300 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 5.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, adjusted to pH 8 unless otherwise stated.

Briefly, MBP-GLIC was produced at 20° C in BL21 bacteria after IPTG (20 mM) induction. After cell disruption by sonication, membranes were separated through ultracentrifugation (40,000 rpm) and MBP-GLIC extracted in buffer A 2% DDM overnight. MBP-GLIC was purified on an amylose resin and eluted by maltose addition in buffer A 0.02% DDM. Proteins were run on a gel filtration (superpose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL)) column for removal of remaining maltoporin contaminants. The MBP was subsequently cleaved from GLIC by addition of thrombine (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) overnight, and GLIC purified again through gel filtration in buffer A 0.02% DDM. For receptors with the K33C and E243C mutations, the protein was incubated for 1 hr with 10 mM DTT prior to the gel filtration to reduce potential disulfide bridges. Pentameric GLIC was then incubated with mBBr at a five molar excess ratio (monomer 1:5 mBBr) while ensuring the final DMSO concentration did not exceed 1%, overnight, under agitation, at 4°C.

GLIC was reconstituted in liposomes with a 1:5 GLIC/asolectin w:w ratio. For 200 µg of protein reconstitution, the following procedure was used and all the steps performed at room temperature: 1 mg of asolectin in buffer B was mixed with DDM to reach a final DDM concentration of 0.7% and the solution equilibrated for 40 min to solubilize the pre-formed multilayered liposomes. The 200 µg of protein in buffer A 0.02% DDM was added to the solution and the overall volume brought to 1 mL to lower the DDM concentration to 0.2%, followed by equilibration for 1.5 hr under gentle agitation. For liposome formation and gentle inclusion of the protein, detergent was removed by incremented step addition of SM2 Bio-Beads (50 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)) pre-activated using methanol. Bio-beads were removed through light centrifugation and the proteoliposomes were either used fresh or stored at 4°C for a maximum of 4 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Steady-state fluorescence recordings</title><p>All fluorescence recordings were done on a Jasco 8200 fluorometer (MD, USA). Buffers and proteins were equilibrated at room temperature before each recording which were made at 20°C. mBBr and Bimane-GLIC samples were excited at 385 nm and their emission spectra were recorded from 420 to 530 nm through 2.5 nm slits at excitation and emission. Scan speed, sampling and PMT values were kept constant for all measures for subsequent comparisons. The membrane receptor GLIC being activated by protons (pH<sub>50</sub> = 5.3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>), we confirmed that both the mBBr fluorescence and its quenching properties are identical in proton concentrations ranging from pH 9 to pH 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Control experiment with the Cys-less GLIC treated with mBBr show negligible non-specific fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All measurements were made on 1 mL of protein sample in disposable UV transparent 2.5 mL cuvettes (Sigma). As a consequence to the small volumes used, it was not possible to precisely acidify the protein sample using concentrated acid, or diluted acid without considerably changing the final concentrations of ions and protein. Hence, measurements were made after mixing one volume of protein in buffer A 0.02% DDM, with one volume of buffer B 0.02% DDM previously acidified by 1 M HCl to reach, after mixing, the desired pH value. The time necessary for the sample mixing and recording of fluorescence was evaluated to be approximately 30 s; this time is sufficient to reach steady-state conditions as shown by the plateau of fluorescence variations recorded on the stopped-flow after 20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The same mixing protocol was used for the protein samples reconstituted in asolectin. For every recording, the fluorescence emission spectra were stable over multiple recordings, not showing signs of fluorophore bleaching. For each pH tested, tryptophan emission spectra were recorded (excitation at 280 nm) to ensure the proteins did not suffer denaturation and all fluorescence changes were reversible upon return to pH 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the propofol recordings, the bimane-labeled mutants were recorded, followed by addition of propofol to a final concentration of 100 µM, and re-recording of the sample. In these experiments, the tryptophan fluorescence was not followed as the propofol produces a strong contamination signal at these excitation and emission wavelengths.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Stopped-flow fluorescence recordings</title><p>Recordings were made on a SFM-300 stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). To ensure lamp and temperature stability, the apparatus was turned on and equilibrated at 20°C by temperature-controlled circulating water for at least 1 hr before recordings. Excitation was set at 385 nm through an 8 nm slit and emission fluorescence recorded through a 420 nm high-pass filter. A two-syringe injection system was used where syringe one was loaded with the protein sample in buffer B at pH 8, and syringe two loaded with buffer B equilibrated at specified pHs. The injection volume was 150 µL for each syringe at an injection speed of 8.7 mL/s (total speed of 17.4 mL/s). The filling of the FC15 recording flow cell (0.15 × 0.15 cm, 35 µL total) was thus achieved after a theoretical 2.1 ms mixing dead-time (manufacturer’s information). To follow with good time resolution the first fast events, 30 s long recordings were made through three sampling times: the first 500 ms were recorded with a 100 µs sampling time, followed by 0.5 to 1.5 s with a 1 ms sampling time, and 1.5 to 30 s with a 50 ms sampling time. The first 3 ms of recordings were excluded from the analysis because of non-reproducibility, yielding a 5.1 ms total ‘non-analyzed’ data (3 ms + 2.1 ms dead-time). For each condition, a mean of 10 recordings was counted as n = 1 and all conditions were recorded with n = 3 or 4. Each data set at pH 6, pH 5 and pH 4 was normalized to the integral 30 s recording made at pH 8 on the same day and same batch of proteoliposomes, to correct potential unspecific drifting/bleaching of fluorescence during the recordings.

Briefly, oocytes were co-injected in the nucleus with a mix of two separate pmt3 vectors containing either the cDNA of GLIC-HA (80 ng/µl) or GFP (10 ng/µl). Control oocytes were injected with the GFP alone. After 72 hr of protein expression, GFP positive cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (4°C, O/N), blocked in PBS + 4% horse serum (30 min, RT [Sigma Aldrich]), and immunolabeled in PBS + 2% horse serum using a rabbit anti-HA primary antibody (1.5 hr) and an anti-rabbit Cy5 coupled secondary antibody (1 hr, RT ([ThermoFisher Scientific]). Oocytes were then re-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4°C, O/N), placed into 3% low-melting agarose blocks, and subsequently sliced at 40 µm intervals. Slices of three different oocytes per constructs were analyzed using epi-fluorescence microscopy with constant exposure times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>CHO culture, transfection and labeling</title><p>Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1 CCL-16 from ATCC, USA) cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12K Kaighn’s modification medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and containing penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL). As the CHO cells were solely used for the bimane membrane-permeability test, they were not tested for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were plated in 35 mm diameter polystyrene plates (Corning, Corning, NY) and transfected with GLIC cDNA and mCherry cDNA, as a transfection control, using a JetPRIME kit (Polyplus Transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein expression was allowed for 48–72 hr before cell labeling. Throughout the labeling process, cells and buffers were kept at 4°C to avoid endocytosis of the fluorophore. For labeling with BBs, cells were rinsed three times (5–10 min, gentle agitation, 4°C) in labeling buffer and incubated for 1 hr with 1 mM BBs in labeling buffer. They were then rinsed two times with labeling buffer (5–10 min, gentle agitation, 4°C) and kept in conservation buffer at room temperature during the imaging process. Each observation was made at least three times on different cell batches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Confocal laser scanning of fluorescence was performed using an Ultima scanning head (Bruker Fluorescence Microscopy, Middleton, USA) mounted on an Olympus BX61W1 microscope and equipped with a 60x (1.1 NA, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) water immersion objective. Bimane and mCherry were excited at 405 nm with a laser power of 1.5–2.5 µW and at 561 nm with a laser power of 0.8–4 µW, respectively. Emitted fluorescence was collected through the same objective lens, and focused on a 150 or 100 μm pinhole (≈ 1 to 1.5 Airy unit), placed on a conjugate image plane (the confocal pinhole). Fluorescent emission from Bimane was filtered with a 525/50 nm band pass filter and detected in gallium arsenide phosphide-based photocathode photomultiplier tube (H7422P, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). mCherry fluorescence was filtered with a 605/70 band pass filter (all filters were from Chroma, Taoyuan City, Taiwan) and detected in a side-on multi-alkali PMT (3896, Hamamatsu Photonics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Crystallography</title><p>The bimane labeled GLIC V135C was crystallized in the same conditions as WT GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauguet et al., 2013</xref>). The crystals were directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Data sets were collected on the PROXIMA1 beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.

As expected, the crystals were isomorphous to the previously described crystal lattice of the open receptor and belonged to space group C121 (unit-cell parameters: a = 182.034 Å, b = 134.075 Å, c = 159.945 Å, α = γ = 90.00°, β = 102.51°) with one pentamer in the asymmetric unit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>The phases were directly calculated by performing rigid-body refinement with REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murshudov et al., 2011</xref>) using PDB entry 3EAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>) as a starting model. The structure was then subjected to restrained refinement with REFMAC5 using NCS restraints. As the covalent link between the bimane and the cysteine side chain is non-standard, its description was defined in an additional library and incorporated in the pdb file. The resulting model was subsequently refined by BUSTER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanc et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Baron Chanda (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lucia Sivilotti (Reviewer #2); Ryan Hibbs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The proton gated GLIC channels have become excellent model systems to understand how structural changes determine the function of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Despite the fact that there are now multiple high-resolution structures of GLIC channels and its mutants, our understanding of how proton activates these channels remain limited. This is in large part due to absence of experimental studies to probe dynamics of GLIC channels. Current models of ligand activation are based on studies of other pentameric ion channels which, on the other hand, are not as well characterized from a structural standpoint. In this study, Menny et al., map the time-resolved structural changes in GLIC using fluorescent probes and stopped flow kinetics. The authors find that the GLIC channels transition into a pre-active conformation within the first few milliseconds when activated by pH jump and that these transitions in the ligand binding domain precedes channel opening. This clearly is an important contribution to the field and provides new insight into the nature of the flipped state. Nevertheless, the reviewers have few key concerns that should be addressed in the revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the authors have conclusively ruled out the possibility that these effects on fluorescence quenching is not due to titration of di-amide group in bimane. I am not sure what the pKa of this group is but pKa of amide carbonyl is pH 3.0 and it is important to rule out the possibility that these changes in fluorescence are not due to protonation/deprotonation. For instance, one could argue that the differences in pH sensitivity just reflects the changes in pKa of the di-amide carbonyls due to the local environment rather than a conformational change. Although, the authors have shown that the fluorescence is unaffected going from pH 4.0 to pH 7.0, they cannot conclusively rule out the alternate possibility. This can be addressed by discussing these caveats when interpreting their data. In addition, the authors may want to show that the dye fluorescence is unaffected even the pH titration is extended by at least one pH unit on both ends.</p><p>2) It is nice to see that the 243 position shows additional slow kinetics that is in the same range as channel opening but actual change compared to the large baseline noise is pretty small. Can the authors rule out alternate possibility that this small decrease is not due to bleaching, for instance? The fact that the pH titration curves at 243 position for TRIQ and Tl+ flux overlaps, is a strong evidence that this position probably reports on channel opening.</p><p>3) Introduction, last paragraph: quenches the fluorophore when the distance is less than… Could you expand on that? Once you get below 15 Å for Trp, is there a relation between the effectiveness of quenching and the distance? For instance – D136 is always quenched by W93.

I am not sure what the pKa of this group is but pKa of amide carbonyl is pH 3.0 and it is important to rule out the possibility that these changes in fluorescence are not due to protonation/deprotonation. For instance, one could argue that the differences in pH sensitivity just reflects the changes in pKa of the di-amide carbonyls due to the local environment rather than a conformational change. Although, the authors have shown that the fluorescence is unaffected going from pH 4.0 to pH 7.0, they cannot conclusively rule out the alternate possibility. This can be addressed by discussing these caveats when interpreting their data. In addition, the authors may want to show that the dye fluorescence is unaffected even the pH titration is extended by at least one pH unit on both ends.</italic> </p><p>The referee is right to point out that this was not properly discussed in the text but only in the Methods section. We have now added the following text at the beginning of the Results section: “GLIC being activated by protons, we additionally performed control experiments to confirm that, as previous studies have shown (Jones Brunette and Farrens 2014), both the bimane fluorescence and its quenching by tryptophans are unaffected by proton concentrations ranging from pH 9 to pH 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) (see Methods). Hence, the fluorescence variations of bimane-labeled mutants can be interpreted as reporting local structural reorganizations.”</p><p>As suggested by the referees, we extended our measurements of the fluorescence and tryptophan quenching of Bimane-Cys to pH 9 and pH 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data show that both the fluorescence intensity and the quenching efficiency are unaffected, notably at a pH as low as 2. Clearly, the pH does not influence the bimane fluorescence and it is very likely that the bimane moiety is not protonated at any pH tested. This is consistent with its chemical structure. As amide carbonyl typically display pKa values lower than 0, it is reasonable to speculate that the pKa of the bimane imide carbonyls should be in the same negative range. In addition, simulations of pKa using ACDLab, ChemAxon or JChem base show that the bimane may be protonated at pHs lower than -9 on the remote hydrazide nitrogen. Moreover, the effects that are relevant to the GLIC allosteric transitions are essentially observed at pH 5 and pH 4, several orders of magnitude lower than the putative proton concentration necessary to protonate the bimane.</p><p>Lastly, we see that for quenching couples (e.g. Bimane-136 +/- W101 or Bimane-133 +/- W103) the bimane fluorescence is unaffected by pH variations up to pH 3 in absence of quencher (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The differences in bimane fluorescence are solely recorded when a tryptophan is at a quenching distance from the bimane, and thus the fluorescence variations discussed in the manuscript are due to the presence of a tryptophan and not to the protonation/deprotonation of the bimane.</p><p><italic>2) It is nice to see that the 243 position shows additional slow kinetics that is in the same range as channel opening but actual change compared to the large baseline noise is pretty small. Can the authors rule out alternate possibility that this small decrease is not due to bleaching, for instance? The fact that the pH titration curves at 243 position for TRIQ and Tl+ flux overlaps, is a strong evidence that this position probably reports on channel opening.</italic> </p><p>In order to assess the possibility of fluorophore bleaching during stopped-flow experiments (30 s), we systematically performed control recordings of every mutant at pH 8, a pH for which there are no protein reorganizations. For most mutants, including the mutant Bimane-243 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), these recordings do not show fluorescence variation over the 30 s, indicating there is no significant bleaching of the bimane.</p><p>In addition, to be thorough and remove from the data any minor participation of fluorescence bleaching to the recorded variations, all the recordings performed at lower pHs were normalized to the pH 8 trace, as described in the Methods: “Each data set at pH 6, pH 5 and pH 4 was normalized to the integral 30 s recording made at pH 8 on the same day and same batch of proteoliposomes, to correct potential unspecific drifting/bleaching of fluorescence during the recordings.” (This protocol was applied for all mutants).</p><p>We wish to point out though, that the dose-response curves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> for mutant 243 represent in black the fluorescence variations and in red the oocyte-recorded electrophysiological response rather than the thallium flux. It is likely that, as observed at position 136, the thallium flux dose-response curve would be slightly shifted to lower pHs as compared to the electrophysiological response in oocytes. This speculation would imply that the ΔF curve would be left-shifted as compared to ΔI curve, in agreement with the stopped-flow recordings that suggest that position 243 follows reorganizations both prior (very-fast component) and during (slower components) activation.</p><p><italic>3) Introduction, last paragraph: quenches the fluorophore when the distance is less than… Could you expand on that? Once you get below 15 Å for Trp, is there a relation between the effectiveness of quenching and the distance? For instance – D136 is always quenched by W93. This suggests that their distance is less than 15 Å in all conditions, but does it exclude this distance changing during activation, while remaining below 15?</italic> </p><p>For molecules in solution with free diffusion/rotation, the relationship between the degree of quenching and the donor-acceptor distance in electron transfer mechanisms (both photoinduced or Dexter) is exponential (Dexter D.L., J Chem Phys 21, 836, 1953 and Strauch S. et al., J Phys Chem, 87, 3579 1983). However, when they are tied to a structured protein, the rate-distance relationship cannot simply be described by an exponential as it depends on the orientation of the fluorophore (Williams R.M. Photochem Photobiol Sci, 2010). This complexity, and thus the need for approximations in solving quenching equations, is the main reason why we never extrapolate the fluorescence variations to numerical values of distances. To evaluate distances changes, we used the empirical values collected by Jones Brunette and Farrens (2014) on the lysozyme, where tryptophan and tyrosine quench the fluorophore when the donor-acceptor Cα-Cα distances are less than approximately 15 Å and 10 Å, respectively, as stated in the Introduction.</p><p>In the specific case of the mutant Bimane-136-W93, the data indeed suggest that both the fluorophore and quencher are always at quenching distances from pH 7.3 to pH 3. There is a small variation between pH 7.3 and pH 6 that suggests a significant, although minor, distance variation. The signal is then stable from pH 6 to 3, and approximately corresponds to an 80% of fluorescence quenching. Thus, the quenching is not complete, since the theoretical maximal quenching is 100% when the fluorophore and quencher are always in contact. The stable 80% quenching can thus be interpreted in two ways: 1) there are no allosteric reorganizations occurring in this region from pH 6 to pH 3 or, 2) the region does undergo structural reorganizations but, on average, the mean quenching, that is the mean fluorophore/quencher distance of all the GLIC molecules in solution, is constant. The present data cannot discriminate between these two possibilities.</p><p><italic>4) Steady state quenching measurements at pH values &lt; 5 are likely reporting on a desensitized conformation, correct? The results in the steady-state sections are framed largely from a context of understanding activation, but at low pH, from studies on patches, I would expect the receptor to be desensitized. Clarification of this point in a rebuttal and/or in the text (e.g. see subsection “The six fluorescent sensors report allosteric reorganizations of GLIC”, first paragraph) would be helpful to me.</italic> </p><p>As stated in the Discussion, the desensitization of GLIC is not well understood, as illustrated by the patch clamp study of Laha et al. (2013) that shows that only half of the patches show macroscopic desensitization of the pH-elicited response. It is thus evident that in steady state conditions, fluorescence recordings are following reorganizations from the resting state towards the active and desensitized states, but we do not know the proportion of each of these states at the end of the equilibration. This is why in the Results section, we were careful to interpret the data in terms of pH-elicited reorganization but without referring to activation and desensitization.</p><p>We only address these questions in the last section of the Results and in the Discussion, as it is the combination of steady state and kinetics experiments that gives a coherent picture and allows us to discriminate between activation and desensitization.</p><p>At all positions except 243, we show that most of the fluorescence variations occurred with very fast kinetics, compatible with their contribution to the activation transition, particularly with regards to the known kinetics of GLIC published in the literature. We then conclude that the remaining minor quenching changes are linked to the transition from the active to the desensitized state.</p><p>These considerations, which are based on the entire set of experimental data, are stated in the Discussion, and could thus not be introduced earlier in the body of the Results section.</p><p><italic>5) Presumably, in liposome reconstitution experiments beginning at the subsection “Detergent-solubilized and lipid-reconstituted GLIC show similar pH-elicited reorganizations”, ~50% of the receptors have their ECDs (and H<sup>+</sup> binding sites) inside the vesicle. Protons should permeate the channel (correct?) but the kinetic response would likely be different (delayed) from those receptors with their ECDs facing the solution exchange directly. Reconstitution was performed with labeled receptors, so fluorescence signal will be coming from both 'inward' and 'outward' oriented receptors. How does this complication affect analysis and interpretation of the time constants derived from multi-exponential fitting?</italic> </p><p>The question of the referee is quite pertinent. As stated in the Methods section, we used two different reconstitution protocols for the thallium fluxes and the bimane-quenching experiments, yielding two types of liposomes with the same lipidic composition but large (150 nm in diameter) and small (70 nm in diameter), respectively.</p><p>In the thallium flux experiments, the ANTS fluorescence variations report on the fraction of open-channel receptors at the membrane, regardless of their orientation. We used these measurements not for the absolute value of thallium rate entry but to compare the fraction of active receptors between different pHs. In this frame, as the orientation of GLIC pentamers in the liposomes would be identical at all pHs, the possibility of delayed activation of receptors would not impact our conclusions.</p><p>However, in the case of the stopped-flow recordings of bimane, a delayed activation of GLIC could have a strong impact on the analysis and conclusions drawn. To address this issue, we performed three sets of experiments:</p><p>1) We evaluated the orientation of GLIC into liposomes. To this end, we reconstituted separately two unlabeled GLIC mutants for which a cysteine was introduced either at the top of the ECD (D136C), or at the bottom of the TMD facing the cytoplasmic side (T219C). After reconstitution, the proteoliposomes were labeled with the non-permeant fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 546 maleimide for 10 minutes and the reaction was then stopped by addition of excess cysteines. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were successively imaged by fluorescence and analyzed by Coomassie blue staining. In parallel, an identical labeling protocol was performed on the same DDM-solubilized mutants to measure the maximal labeling efficiency of each position. By analysis of each band’s intensity in fluorescence and Coomassie blue, we could calculate the fraction of labeled receptors (Alexa fluorescence intensity/Coomassie blue intensity) of both mutants. The data in the author response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that, as compared to DDM-solubilized protein, 75 ± 11% of the D136C mutant and 35 ± 6% of the T219C mutant are labeled in liposomes, meaning that their mutated cysteine is facing the outside of liposomes. Our results thus strongly suggest a preferential orientation of GLIC with the ECD outside of the liposomes.</p><p>2) We measured the kinetics of proton entry into the liposome using stopped-flow recordings with identical injection volume and speed parameters as the ones used for bimane fluorescence recordings. We generated asolectin liposomes in the absence or presence of GLIC, which were loaded with the fluorescent pH-sensitive dye 8-HydroxyPyrene-1,3,6-Trisulfonic Acid (HPTS). When excited at 372 nm this dye shows a 1.7 fold increase in fluorescence intensity from pH 7.3 to pH 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>). Rapid mixing experiments from pH 7.3 to pH 4 show a slow proton entry into the liposomes (without GLIC), with time constants in the second to tens of seconds range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1D</xref>). In sharp contrast, similar experiments with proteoliposomes (with GLIC) show very fast proton entry, which occurs with sub-millisecond kinetics, in the dead-time of the apparatus. As a control, we performed additional recordings under conditions for which GLIC is non-conducting, either of proteoliposomes going from pH 7.3 to pH 6 (pH too high for channel opening), or going from pH 7.3 to pH 4 in presence of the pore blocker picrotoxin. These recordings showed similar very-fast entry of the proton in the proteoliposomes indicating that this entry does not require GLIC-channel opening.</p><p>3) We evaluated the radius of the liposomes using dynamic light scattering. The data shows that the liposomes display a mean radius of approximately 70 nm, while proteoliposomes are smaller, with a mean radius around 35 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1B</xref>). These data also show that our samples do contain formed mono-dispersed proteoliposomes and not individual lipidated GLIC particles.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that a non-negligible portion of the reconstituted proteins have an “inside-out” configuration with their ECD facing the inside of the vesicles. However, the proteoliposomes are permeant to protons with very fast kinetics. Therefore, in our recording conditions, the inner solution of the proteoliposomes is entirely equilibrated with the outer solution, in terms of proton concentration, within the mixing dead-time. Thus, all receptors, regardless of their orientation in the liposomes, will be protonated with sufficiently fast kinetics such that there is no impact on the observed bimane stopped-flow kinetics at the current time resolution.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of proteoliposomes used for Bimane quenching studies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE gel fluorescence scan (left) and labeling quantification (right) of GLIC mutants D136C and T219C reconstituted in liposomes (PL) or in detergent (DDM) and labeled with Alexa Fluor 546.

One idea is that this intermediate state is a broadly-relevant point along the resting-activation pathway. What do the authors think of an alternative hypothesis, that the intermediate state results from partial occupancy of proton agonists at multiple sites that have different pKa values?</italic> </p><p>The question is interesting and quite pertinent, but in light of the present data we can only speculate on alternative models. A number of different mechanisms can account for the fluorescence data, and two have been proposed by the referees:</p><p>1) The simplest one is described in the “Additional Note by one of the reviewers”. In this case, a single class of “proton activation site” is present, one per subunit, five per pentamer. As shown by the theoretical curves provided by the referee, the concerted model of R to pre-O to O nicely accounts for the experimentally measured dose response curves, notably for the left shift of the △F curves as compared to the △I curve.</p><p>2) It is also possible that more than one “proton activation site” per subunit exists. Each subunit could carry a low sensitivity and a high sensitivity site, and it is possible that the transition towards the pre-active state would reflect the protonation of the high sensitivity sites, the activation requiring further protonation of the low sensitivity sites.</p><p>Future work, notably by mutagenesis, would be required to discriminate between these possibilities.</p><p><italic>7) How does the locally closed model (Prevost NSMB 2012 and Gonzalez-Gutierrez PNAS 2013) fit into the concept of this new pre-activated conformation? Please also consider citing that 2013 PNAS paper.</italic> </p><p>We added a section (Discussion, fourth paragraph) discussing the possibility that one particular LC conformation could be a candidate for the pre-active state. This remains highly speculative and is stated as such in the text: “Several mutants and a wild-type GLIC C-terminally tagged with 10 histidines, were found to crystallize in different locally-closed “LC” conformations characterized by an overall conformation of the ECD nearly identical to GLIC<sub>pH 4</sub>, but with a closed channel (Prevost et al. 2012; Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al. 2013). […] Hence, we may speculate that this particular LC conformation could be a candidate for the pre-active state of GLIC, since it shows compaction of the ECD and motion of the M2-M3 loop without channel opening.”</p><p>MINOR POINTS:</p><p><italic>1. How do the authors rule out that the ion influx kinetics is not limited by the number of functional channels? There should be some discussion about this. Please provide information regarding the size of the liposomes, number of dye molecules per liposome etc.</italic></p><p>The ion flux kinetics are dependent on the number of functional/active channels as documented in previous reports establishing this technique (Ingolfsson and Andersen 2010). The amount of protein used for the reconstitution thus has to be adjusted to yield quenching kinetics that can be resolved at the highest and the lowest channel activity under the specific conditions of the experiment. Since all the experiments comparing kinetics under different activating conditions are measured using vesicles from the same reconstitution, the differences in kinetics can be safely assigned to differences in the pH dependent activation. Moreover, in the experiments shown here, the recorded channel activity from different reconstitutions shows a variation of quenching rates of less than 10%. This point is now addressed in the method section for the flux assay p.29 l27-28.The LUVs prepared according to this protocol are extruded through a 100 nm filter and have a mean diameter of 150 nm after extrusion (Ingolfsson and Andersen 2010). This is now specifically stated p.19 l14. Thus the mean volume of the vesicles is 1.7671 mm<sup>3</sup> ·10<sup>-12</sup> = 1.767x10<sup>-12</sup> ml. With 25 mM ANTS present during the reconstitution (see Methods p.29), the actual number of ANTS molecules inside the vesicles is 4.4175x10<sup>-14</sup> mol or 2.66x10<sup>10</sup> molecules. In every experiment shown here, fluorescence is quenched to about 70% of the initial fluorescence (under these particular conditions fluorescence quenching cannot decrease to less than 40% of the initial fluorescence (Ingolfsson and Andersen 2010)). Thus the amount of ANTS molecules is not limiting for the quenching reaction.</p><p><italic>2. 100% labeling efficiency seems unlikely. In cases where labeling results in a non-functional channel, is there a concern that some experiments are measuring function from the fraction of receptors that are unlabeled?</italic></p><p>The referee is right to point out this issue. First, for mutations at positions E243 or P250, we found that bimane labeling altered the pH50 of activation and/or the shape of the current traces. In these cases, as there is a difference in the currents, electrophysiology clearly does record labeled receptors.In contrast, at position 133, 135, 136 and 33, there is no such significant change in the pH50 or current kinetics observed after bimane labeling. In addition, in all cases bimane labeling did not decrease the maximal currents evoked by proton (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Since positions 133, 135 and 136 are far away from the transmembrane domain, it is likely that their labeling with bimane is similar between the membrane-anchored protein and the DDM-solubilized protein. We thus evaluated the extent of bimane labeling in DDM-purified protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Author response table 1</xref>). To this end, we calculated the efficacy of bimane labeling by dividing the fluorescence of the bimane-labeled proteins in denatured condition (SDS) by the amount of protein. This F<sub>SDS</sub>/protein ratio calculated for all the mutants indicates that the position Q193C has the lowest labeling efficiency (37 units of fluorescence per mg of receptor), in particular as compared to the major quenching pairs D136C Q101W (85 units) V135C (119 units), R133C L103W (53 units) and K33C (113 units). Functional recordings of the mutant Q193C shows that our labeling protocol produces almost 100% of function loss. Therefore, we can extrapolate that at all other positions, as the labeling efficiency is higher, if bimane labeling were to lead to a complete loss of function we would, as for Q193C, record it in oocytes. We conclude that, in these cases, bimane labeling did not significantly impair the function of the channel.<table-wrap id="tbl6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23955.027</object-id><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><p>Labeling efficiency of GLIC mutants by Bimane. n stands for number of experiments.
