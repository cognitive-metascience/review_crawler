synthase. ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted F<sub>O</sub> region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F<sub>1</sub> region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the F<sub>O</sub> region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring within the F<sub>O</sub> region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation-driven rotation in ATP synthases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10180.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10180.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10180.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency in cells. Most of the ATP used by cells is made by the membrane-embedded enzyme ATP synthase. This enzyme is found in membranes inside specialized compartments known as mitochondria. ATP synthase is made up of many protein subunits that work together as a molecular machine. Hydrogen ions flow across the membrane through the ATP synthase, turning a rotor structure within the enzyme, which leads to the production of ATP.</p><p>It is not known how the transport of hydrogen ions causes rotation of the rotor. Some researchers have proposed that the enzyme works as a ratchet that is driven by the random Brownian motion of the rotor. That is, the rotational position of the rotor fluctuates randomly, but a ratchet mechanism ensures that there is a net rotation in one direction. However, there is currently little experimental evidence to back up this theory, which is known as the Brownian ratchet model.</p><p>Zhou, Rohou et al. used a technique called electron cryomicroscopy (or cryo-EM) to study ATP synthase from cows. The cryo-EM data made it possible to use computer software to construct a three-dimensional model of the enzyme that is more detailed than previous attempts. Zhou, Rohou et al. show that the structure of ATP synthase is flexible, with the different protein subunits bending, flexing, and rotating relative to each other. This variability in the position of the rotor is consistent with the Brownian ratchet model.</p><p>Together, these findings reveal important new details about the structure of ATP synthase and provide some of the first experimental evidence for the Brownian ratchet model. The new three-dimensional structure of ATP synthase will open the door to testing hypotheses of how the ATP synthase works.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10180.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10180.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>bovine</kwd><kwd>ATP synthase</kwd><kwd>evolutionary covariance</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 81294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105663150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>John E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohou</surname><given-names>Alexis</given-names></name><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canada Research Chairs (Chaires de recherche du Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postgraduate scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postgraduate scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schep</surname><given-names>Daniel G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural analysis of the ATP synthase – in combination with evolutionary covariance analysis – reveals the fold of the a subunit and shows that the enzyme can adopt several different conformations, which support the Brownian ratchet model for generating rotation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the mitochondria of eukaryotes, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced by the ATP synthase, a ∼600 kDa membrane protein complex composed of a soluble catalytic F<sub>1</sub> region and a membrane-inserted F<sub>O</sub> region. The ATP synthase is found in the inner membranes of mitochondria, with the F<sub>1</sub> region in the mitochondrial matrix and the F<sub>O</sub> region accessible from the inter-membrane space between the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes. In the mammalian enzyme, the subunit composition is α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γδε for the F<sub>1 </sub>region with subunits a, e, f, g, A6L, DAPIT, a 6.8 kDa proteolipid, two membrane-inserted α-helices of subunit b, and the c<sub>8</sub>-ring forming the F<sub>O</sub> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker, 2013</xref>). The rotor subcomplex consists of subunits γ, δ, ε, and the c<sub>8</sub>-ring. In addition to the rotor, the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>O</sub> regions are linked by a peripheral stalk composed of subunits OSCP, d, F<sub>6</sub>, and the hydrophilic portion of subunit b. Approximately 85% of the structure of the complex is known at high resolution from X-ray crystallography of constituent proteins, which have been assembled into a mosaic structure within the constraints of a cryo-EM map at 18 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The proton motive force, established by the electron transport chain during cellular respiration, drives protons across the F<sub>O</sub> region through the interface between the a subunit and the c<sub>8</sub>-ring, inducing rotation of the rotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walker, 1998</xref>). While the mechanism by which ATP synthesis and hydrolysis are coupled to rotation of the γ subunit is now understood well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker, 2013</xref>), it is still unresolved how rotation of the central rotor is coupled to proton translocation through the F<sub>O</sub> region. The most popular model suggests that proton translocation occurs through two offset half channels near the a subunit/c subunit interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Junge et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junge, 2005</xref>). In this model, one half channel allows protons to move half-way across the lipid bilayer in order to protonate the conserved Glu58 residue of one of the c subunits. The other half channel allows deprotonation of the adjacent c subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lau and Rubinstein, 2012</xref>), setting up the necessary condition for a net rotation of the entire c-ring. Rotation does not occur directly from the protonating half channel to the deprotonating half channel, but in the opposite direction so that the protonated, and therefore uncharged, Glu residues traverse through the lipid environment before reaching the deprotonating half channel. The deprotonated Glu residue prevents the ring from rotating in the opposite direction, which would place the charged residue in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer. Rotation of the c-ring occurs due to Brownian motion, making the enzyme a Brownian ratchet.</p><p>A recent cryo-EM map of the <italic>Polytomella</italic> sp. ATP synthase dimer showed two long and tilted α-helices from the a subunit in contact with the c<sub>10</sub>-ring of that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allegretti et al., 2015</xref>). This arrangement of α-helices from the a and c subunits was also seen in the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> V-type ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2015a</xref>). Cryo-EM of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> V-ATPase demonstrated that images of rotary ATPases could be separated by 3D classification to reveal conformations of the complex that exist simultaneously in solution. In the work described here, we obtained and analyzed cryo-EM images of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. 3D classification of the images resulted in seven distinct maps of the enzyme, each showing the complex in a different conformation. By averaging the density for the proton-translocating a subunit from the seven maps, we generated a map segment that shows α-helices clearly. Analysis of evolutionary covariance in the sequence of the a subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Göbel et al., 1994</xref>) allowed the entire a subunit polypeptide to be traced through the density map. The resulting atomic model for the a subunit was fitted into the maps for the different rotational states, suggesting a path for protons through the enzyme and supporting the Brownian ratchet mechanism for the generation of rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Junge et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2005</xref>), and thereby ATP synthesis, in ATP synthases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Specimens of ATP synthase were isolated from bovine heart mitochondria and prepared for cryo-EM as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Runswick et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Initial 3D classification produced three classes, each of which appear to show a ∼120° rotation of the central rotor within the F<sub>1</sub> region of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, blue arrows), similar to what was seen previously with the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> V-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao, et al., 2015a</xref>). Further classification of these three rotational states was able to separate state 1 into two sub-states, subsequently referred to as states 1a and 1b. State 2 could be divided into states 2a, 2b, and 2c, while state 3 could be separated into states 3a and 3b. Each of these 3D classes shows a different conformation of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). While the rotational states of the yeast V-ATPase were found to be populated unequally after 3D classification, bovine ATP synthase classes corresponding to different positions of the rotor had approximately equal populations. State 1 contained 43,039 particle images divided almost equally over its two sub-states, state 2 contained 48,053 particle images divided almost equally over its three sub-states, and state 3 contained 46,257 particle images divided almost equally over its two sub-states. The resolutions of the seven classes were between 6.4 and 7.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10180.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cross-sections through maps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cross-sections through the F<sub>1</sub> regions of the different maps show that states 1, 2, and 3 are related by ∼120° rotations of the γ subunit within the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> hexamer (blue arrows).

This bent structure was seen previously in a lower-resolution cryo-EM map of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). It is consistent with electron tomograms of ATP synthases in mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies et al., 2011</xref>) and was also observed recently by electron tomography of membrane-reconstituted 2D crystals of the bovine enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiko et al., 2015</xref>). The e and g subunits are expected to reside in the portion of the F<sub>O</sub> region distal to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring because cryo-EM maps of the mitochondrial ATP synthase from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where subunits e and g were removed by detergent, lacked this bent portion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lau et al., 2008</xref>). The f subunit is also thought to be associated with the e and g subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belogrudov et al., 1996</xref>). DAPIT and the 6.8 kDa proteolipid are not expected to be present in this preparation because the necessary lipids for maintaining their association were not added during purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll, 2009</xref>). While a detergent micelle can be seen around the entire F<sub>O</sub> region, the portion of F<sub>O</sub> distal to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring also contains a feature with unusually low density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, white arrows). The content of this low-density region is uncertain. Low density in cryo-EM maps is often due to partial occupancy, flexibility, or disorder of a protein subunit. However, the low-density feature here is bounded on one side by unusually sharp density from the detergent micelle, suggesting more order than in the rest of the micelle, and on the other side by the a subunit, which also appears well ordered. Therefore, the low density region could be due to bound material with low density, possibly lipid, that remains after purification of the enzyme.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel feature in the F<sub>O</sub> region</title><p>The F<sub>O</sub> regions of all seven maps also revealed a remarkable feature not resolved previously in cryo-EM maps of ATP synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allegretti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rubinstein et al., 2003</xref>). The feature appears to consist of an elongated membrane-embedded density, possibly an α-helix, that extends from the rotor-distal portion of F<sub>O</sub> to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring. The orientation of this density would cause it to pass through the inter-membrane space of the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, orange arrow). While not identified in the previous cryo-EM map of the enzyme at 18 Å resolution, the structure is consistent with a poorly-resolved ridge along the surface of the F<sub>O</sub> region seen in the earlier map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Because it extends from the bent end of the F<sub>O</sub> region, this feature may correspond to the soluble part of the e subunit. Indeed, a similar structure was observed in single particle EM of negatively stained ATP synthase dimers from bovine heart mitochondria, and was proposed to be interacting e subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Minauro-Sanmiguel et al., 2005</xref>). However, in the present structure the feature is not positioned to interact between dimers of the enzyme and its role in the complex remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Subunit a, b and A6L in the F<sub>O</sub> region</title><p>In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for the F<sub>O</sub> region of the complex, the membrane regions from the seven different maps were aligned and averaged. Averaging maps increases the signal-to-noise ratio where the structures are similar, but blurs regions where the maps differ. In principle, this method could also be applied to other map regions of the ATP synthase or other heterogeneous protein complexes by applying an appropriate transform before averaging. Averaging the F<sub>O</sub> region provides a clear view of the portion of the F<sub>O</sub> region adjacent to the rotor, allowing the trans-membrane α-helices from the a, b, and A6L subunits to be identified reliably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, green arrows, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The averaged density for the F<sub>O</sub> region revealed the a subunit to have five membrane-inserted α-helices and an additional α-helix along the plane of the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Spatial constraints from covariance analysis were sufficient not only to identify tentatively trans-membrane α-helices of the a subunit that are adjacent to each other, but also suggest which face each α-helix presents to the other α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, red lines). The constraints show patterns of interaction consistent with the predicted α-helical structure of the a subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as well as interactions between the a subunit and the outer α-helix of a c subunit in the c<sub>8</sub>-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a result, we were able to trace the path of the a subunit polypeptide through the cryo-EM density map.

The conserved general architecture of the membrane-inserted regions in F-type ATP synthases and V-type ATPases suggests that the observed arrangement of α-helices is functionally important and likely involved in proton translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The matrix half channel of the ATP synthase is likely to be formed by the cavity between the c<sub>8</sub>-ring and the matrix ends of tilted α-helices #5 and #6 of the a subunit. The lumenal half channel in the V-ATPase is probably formed entirely from α-helices from the a subunit, whereas the corresponding inter-membrane space half channel in the ATP synthase is likely composed of the inter-membrane space ends of α-helices #5 and #6 and one or both of the two trans-membrane α-helices of the b subunit. Defining the exact placement of half channels will likely require higher-resolution maps from cryo-EM or X-ray crystallography that reveal amino acid side chain density and bound water molecules.</p><p>In addition to bending and twisting of the peripheral stalk and central rotor of the enzyme, the differences between the sub-states of each state show variability in the rotational position of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring in relation to the a subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), even in the nucleotide-depleted conditions in which cryo-EM grids were frozen for this analysis. This lack of a rigid interaction between the c<sub>8</sub>-ring and a subunit is consistent with the Brownian ratchet model of proton translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Junge et al., 1997</xref>). In the Brownian ratchet model, the rotational position of the ring fluctuates due to Brownian motion, but the ring cannot turn to place the Glu58 residue of a c subunit into the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer until the Glu58 is protonated at the inter-membrane space half channel. Therefore, with this model, the different sub-states would correspond to energetically equivalent or nearly-equivalent conformations that occur due to Brownian motion. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref> illustrates the extent of rotational oscillation predicted from the transition between states 2a and 2c. It is most likely that this oscillation occurs as each c subunit passes the interface with the a subunit, with 8/3 c subunits on average contributing to the synthesis of one ATP molecule. The rotational flexibility of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring that exists even when the γ subunit is locked within the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> hexamer suggests that flexing and bending of the components of the ATP synthase smooths the coupling of the 8-step rotation of the c<sub>8</sub>-ring with the 3-step rotation of the F<sub>1</sub> region. This model suggests that the observed flexibility in the enzyme, which apparently complicates determination of atomic resolution structures directly from cryo-EM data, is also essential to the mechanism of ATP synthesis.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10180.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model for proton translocation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) The a subunit (green), along with the membrane-intrinsic α-helices of the b subunit (red), form two clusters that could be the half channels needed for trans-membrane proton translocation.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor), and two reviewers, Stephen Harrison (also Reviewing Editor) and Yifan Chang.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This very thoughtful cryoEM analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase at subnanometer resolution is impressive for its thoughtful approach and for the straightforwardness of its conclusions. The authors took full advantages of single particle cryo-EM for dealing samples with significant conformational heterogeneity, and identified seven different conformational states of the ATP synthase enzyme. The resolutions of these cryo-EM reconstructions are in the sub-nanometer range, sufficient to resolve most, if not all, secondary structural features. The flexible fitting is well described, and the restriction of interpretation to well-resolved helices is laudable. The requested revisions below are purely at the level of presentation and should be straightforward to implement.</p><p>1) The authors identified a total of seven states, 3 sub-states for state 1, 2 for state 2 and 3 for state 3. It is very difficult to visualize the significant differences between these sub-states from the figures presented. Thus, it is difficult to appreciate the subtle conformational changes and the significances represented by these sub-states. The manuscript does not include any quantitative descriptions of these conformational changes. Showing two overlapping maps with different colors might make the differences more obvious, and a quantitative description of the conformational differences might likewise be useful. The authors should choose some way of making the differences clear.</p><p>2) A related question: how are these sub-states connected and do they have any functional significance, or are they simply evidence of the distribution of states in a &quot;flat&quot; well around the equilibrium position? It is easier to identify the sequence of conformational changes between major states, 1, 2 and 3.</p><p>3) At the end of the second paragraph of the Results, a feature with &quot;unusually low density&quot; is interpreted as lipids. This is not very convincing. Lipid density confined in such a small region may not be that weak. Is there any additional evidence for this interpretation (perhaps from the molecular structure achieved in the end by fitting known components)?</p><p>4) The authors averaged seven maps to enhance the SNR of the membrane region. This averaging certainly enhances SNR of certain parts of the molecule, where the conformation remains unchanged, but it of course weakens the other parts. This point, obvious to some readers, should be stated clearly, as it also relates to question above: why it is critical to separate these small conformational differences (other than to get maps that can yield good local averages? Indeed, have the authors considered local averaging of other regions, using suitable rigid-body transformations based on the fitting of models? (This might go beyond the present paper, but the comment is worth considering.)</p><p>5) The authors should include raw data as supplements to one or more of the figures: micrographs, power spectra of the micrographs, Euler angle distributions, and 2D class averages, all of which are needed for a reader to judge the quality of cryo-EM results.</p><p>6) The authors should provide some additional description at various points to help readers unfamiliar with the details of the ATP synthase structure. For example, in the second paragraph of the Results, the paper discusses &quot;a distinct bend&quot;. It is hard to figure out which part of the text is about previous structures and which part is about the current structure. For readers not familiar with this complicated complex, it is also not clear which part of the illustrated structure is F0 and which part is F1. It will be useful to mark this clear in a figure, either as part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> or as a supplementary figure. As a further example of assisting a reader not familiar with mitochondrial protein structures, one reviewer asked: in the subsection &quot;A novel feature in the F0 region&quot;, what does &quot;inter-membrane&quot; mean?</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10180.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors identified a total of seven states, 3 sub-states for state 1, 2 for state 2 and 3 for state 3.

We also include the following quantification statement in the text:</p><p>“The largest change between the sub-states of each state can be approximated by rotations of the α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>3</sub> hexamer relative to the rest of the complex by angles ranging from 10 to 16°. A comparison of the maps for the different sub-states and the axes of these rotations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>. The resulting conformational changes can be seen most clearly in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5.</xref>”</p><p>The caption for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> provides further quantification of these rotations.</p><p><italic>2) A related question: how are these sub-states connected and do they have any functional significance, or are they simply evidence of the distribution of states in a &quot;flat&quot; well around the equilibrium position?

Instead, the differences in conformation between sub-states when taken together illustrate the flexibility of the enzyme, a property already linked to its rapid rate of enzymatic activity (<sub>8</sub>-ring with respect to the subunit, as discussed below.”</p><p>The Discussion section describes the rotational variation:</p><p>“This lack of a rigid interaction between the c<sub>8</sub>-ring and a subunit is consistent with the Brownian ratchet model of proton translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jung, Lill and Engelbrecht, 1997</xref>). In the Brownian ratchet model […]”</p><p>We have also added the following to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Therefore, with this model, the different sub-states would correspond to energetically equivalent or nearly-equivalent conformations that occur due to Brownian motion.”</p><p><italic>3) At the end of the second paragraph of the Results, a feature with &quot;unusually low density&quot; is interpreted as lipids. This is not very convincing. Lipid density confined in such a small region may not be that weak. Is there any additional evidence for this interpretation (perhaps from the molecular structure achieved in the end by fitting known components)?</italic> </p><p>We are still unsure of what is causing the appearance of this part of the map. We can find no insight from the structure or by fitting known components. We cannot identify any literature that lends support to the lipid hypothesis or any other hypothesis. We have expressed this uncertainty by modifying the section to read:</p><p>“The content of this low-density region is uncertain. […] Instead, the low density could be due to bound material with low density, possibly lipid, that remains after purification of the enzyme.”</p><p><italic>4) The authors averaged seven maps to enhance the SNR of the membrane region. This averaging certainly enhances SNR of certain parts of the molecule, where the conformation remains unchanged, but it of course weakens the other parts. This point, obvious to some readers, should be stated clearly, as it also relates to question above: why it is critical to separate these small conformational differences (other than to get maps that can yield good local averages? Indeed, have the authors considered local averaging of other regions, using suitable rigid-body transformations based on the fitting of models? (This might go beyond the present paper, but the comment is worth considering.)</italic> </p><p>We agree completely with the comment and have re-written this section of the manuscript:</p><p>“In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for the F<sub>O</sub> region of the complex […] suggesting that its position differs between maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, pink arrows).”</p><p><italic>5) The authors should include raw data as supplements to one or more of the figures: micrographs, power spectra of the micrographs, Euler angle distributions, and 2D class averages, all of which are needed for a reader to judge the quality of cryo-EM results.</italic> </p><p>We now include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> that shows a portion of a raw micrograph, power spectrum, 2D class averages, particle trajectories from the micrograph from the <italic>alignparts_lmbfgs</italic> optimization, and the distribution of Euler angles from particles that went into the 3D maps.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should provide some additional description at various points to help readers unfamiliar with the details of the ATP synthase structure. For example, in the second paragraph of the Results, the paper discusses &quot;a distinct bend&quot;. It is hard to figure out which part of the text is about previous structures and which part is about the current structure. For readers not familiar with this complicated complex, it is also not clear which part of the illustrated structure is F0 and which part is F1. It will be useful to mark this clear in a figure, either as part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> or as a supplementary figure. As a further example of assisting a reader not familiar with mitochondrial protein structures, one reviewer asked: in the section &quot;A novel feature in the F0 region&quot;, what does &quot;inter-membrane&quot; mean?</italic></p><p>We have re-written the description of the bend in the F<sub>O</sub> region to more clearly distinguish past and present results:</p><p>“There is a distinct bend in the F<sub>O</sub> region of the complex between the portion that is proximal to the c<sub>8</sub>-ring […] was also observed recently by electron tomography of membrane-reconstituted 2D crystals of the bovine enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiko et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to indicate the F<sub>1</sub> region and the F<sub>O</sub> region.</p><p>We have also modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> (formerly supplement 1) to indicate the bend in the F<sub>O</sub> region.</p><p>To clarify the term “inter-membrane space” we have added a sentence to the Introduction:</p><p>“The ATP synthase is found in the inner membranes of mitochondria, with the F<sub>1</sub> region in the mitochondrial matrix and the F<sub>O</sub> region accessible from the inter-membrane space between the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes.”</p></body></sub-article> </article>
