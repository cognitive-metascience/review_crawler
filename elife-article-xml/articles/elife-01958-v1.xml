Symptoms include tremors, rigidity, and slowness, as well as dementia and depression. While most cases of Parkinson's disease have no known genetic cause, mutations in either of two genes—<italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>—are known to lead to the disease.</p><p>PINK1 and parkin belong to a single pathway that regulates the structure and function of mitochondria, the organelles that generate energy inside cells. Identifying inhibitors of this pathway is critically important for development of future therapies. In addition, previous studies showed that mice with mutations in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>, as opposed to those in humans and flies, display subtle signs of Parkinson's disease: the fact that these are weak suggests that other unknown proteins or cellular pathways might compensate for loss of the genes.</p><p>Yun et al. have now identified one such protein by showing that an increase in the level of a Protein called MUL1 counteracts the deleterious effects due to the loss of PINK1 or parkin in fruit flies. MUL1 is a mitochondrial protein that regulates another protein called mitofusin; the role of mitofusin is to promote the fusion of mitochondria. Conversely, removing MUL1 from PINK1 or parkin mutant worsens the symptoms because MUL1 is no longer present to compensate for the defects.</p><p>Yun et al. also show that MUL1 operates through a pathway that is independent of PINK1/parkin. Moreover, this pathway is found in both flies and mouse neurons, which suggest that it has been conserved during evolution. The work of Yun et al. also suggests that MUL1 as a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

most common neurodegenerative disorder and there is no cure for this progressive illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo, 2012</xref>). Mutations in PINK1, a mitochondria-localized serine–threonine kinase, and Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, lead to autosomal recessive forms of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valente et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> first demonstrated that <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> act in the same genetic pathway, with <italic>PINK1</italic> positively regulating <italic>parkin</italic>, to regulate mitochondrial integrity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Mitochondrial morphology is maintained by a balance between two opposing actions, mitochondrial fusion that is promoted by <italic>mitofusin (mfn)</italic> and mitochondrial fission that is controlled by <italic>Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>). Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that downregulation of <italic>mfn</italic> or overexpression of <italic>drp1</italic> suppresses multiple phenotypes associated with lack of <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin,</italic> including defects in mitochondrial integrity, cell death, tissue health, and flight ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poole et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Parkin ubiquitinates Mfn and promotes Mfn degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ziviani et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is not clear if increased <italic>mfn</italic> or decreased <italic>drp1</italic> levels are sufficient to cause the phenotypes observed in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutants.</p><p>In addition to mitochondrial dynamics, the <italic>PINK1/Parkin</italic> pathway promotes mitophagy, selective autophagic degradation of defective mitochondria in mammalian cells. Accumulation of mitochondrial damage can result in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This leads to recruitment of Parkin to the depolarized mitochondria, ultimately resulting in autophagic degradation of these mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gegg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narendra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okatsu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). Parkin-mediated mitophagy also occurs in mouse cortical neurons and heart muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>). An important step during this process is Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of Mfn and other substrates, followed by their proteasome-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). Relevant to PD, <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutant fibroblasts from PD patients also show deregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and modest defects in the clearance of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rakovic et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2013</xref>).</p><p>An important puzzle in the field of PD research is why mice lacking <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> bear only subtle phenotypes related to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration or mitochondrial morphology change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palacino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez and Palmiter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank-Cannon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gispert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akundi et al., 2011</xref>). This raises the possibility that other mechanisms may compensate for loss of <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>. Indeed, when <italic>parkin</italic> is knocked down in adult dopaminergic neurons rather than during development, more striking neuronal degeneration is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which loss of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> function can be compensated are not known.</p><p>Mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase 1 (MUL1), also known as mitochondrial-anchored protein ligase (MAPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neuspiel, 2008</xref>), mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NF-kB (MULAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2008</xref>), or growth inhibition and death E3 ligase (GIDE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), was identified as an E3 protein ligase by three independent groups. Work in mammalian systems shows that MUL1 has small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase activity, stabilizing Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braschi et al., 2009</xref>), or ubiquitin ligase activity, degrading Mfn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lokireddy et al., 2012</xref>). As expected from a protein with these proposed biochemical activities, <italic>MUL1</italic> expression in mammalian cells results in smaller and more fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neuspiel, 2008</xref>). However, the consequences of loss of <italic>MUL1</italic> in vivo have not been reported in any organism.</p><p>In this study, we show that overexpression of <italic>mfn</italic> is sufficient to recapitulate many <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes, underlining the central importance deregulation of this protein has for PD pathogenesis. Expression of wild-type MUL1, but not a ligase-dead version, suppresses <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes, and those due to <italic>mfn</italic> overexpression in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Conversely, removing <italic>MUL1</italic> in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> null mutants results in enhanced phenotypes as compared with the single mutants, suggesting that <italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway. MUL1 physically binds to Mfn and promotes its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. MUL1, but not a ligase-dead version, also regulates Mfn levels and mitochondrial morphology in human cells. Experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian systems suggest that <italic>MUL1</italic> regulates <italic>mfn</italic> through a pathway parallel to that of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway. Finally, knockdown of <italic>MUL1</italic> from <italic>parkin</italic> knockout mouse cortical neurons augments mitochondrial damage and induces neurodegeneration-like phenotypes than does removing either gene alone. Together, these results suggest that <italic>MUL1</italic> plays an important compensatory function in organisms or cells lacking <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overexpression of <italic>MUL1</italic>, but not a ligase-dead form, suppresses <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes in dopaminergic neurons and muscle</title><p>We identified <italic>MUL1</italic> as a novel suppressor of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes.

Together, these results show that overexpression of <italic>mfn</italic>, but not loss of <italic>drp1</italic>, leads to phenotypes similar to those due to lack of <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>, suggesting a direct link between increased Mfn levels and pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title><italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/Parkin</italic> pathway</title><p>Our observations that <italic>MUL1</italic> overexpression suppresses <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes, and that both Parkin and MUL1 promote Mfn degradation, suggest two possible scenarios of how <italic>MUL1</italic> and <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> interact. <italic>MUL1</italic> may be a downstream target of the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway and upstream of <italic>mfn</italic>. Alternatively, <italic>MUL1</italic> could function in a parallel pathway to <italic>PINK1/Parkin</italic>, but with action on a common target such as Mfn. Characterization of double null mutants provides an effective way of distinguishing these possibilities. If <italic>MUL1</italic> functions in the same pathway as <italic>PINK1</italic>, double null mutants of <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>MUL1</italic> would be expected to show the same phenotype as the single mutant alone, as is observed in the case of <italic>PINK1 parkin</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, if <italic>MUL1</italic> and <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> act in parallel pathways, the phenotypes of double null mutants may be stronger than those of single mutants.</p><p>We generated <italic>PINK1 MUL1</italic> and <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double mutants<italic>.</italic> Several lines of evidence show that double mutants have significantly enhanced phenotypes as compared to those of single mutants alone. First, <italic>PINK1 MUL1</italic> and <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double null mutants show a high frequency of pupal lethality as compared with single mutants (data not shown), while double null mutants of <italic>PINK1 parkin</italic> have the same level of viability as single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Second, a thoracic indentation observed in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> null mutants is much more severe in <italic>PINK1 MUL1</italic> and <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double null mutants. In contrast, <italic>PINK1 parkin</italic> double null mutants show the same degree of thoracic indentation as <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> single mutants alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–G</xref>). Third, at the cellular level, <italic>PINK1 MUL1</italic> and <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double null mutants have highly elongated and interconnected mitochondria, as determined using anti-mitochondrial ATPase antibodies. These mitochondrial phenotypes are very different from those of <italic>PINK1</italic>, <italic>parkin</italic>, or <italic>MUL1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–O</xref>). <italic>PINK1 parkin</italic> double null mutants show similar mitochondrial morphology phenotypes as <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> single mutants alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,M</xref>). Fourth, ATP levels in <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double null mutants were further reduced compared to those of <italic>parkin</italic> or <italic>MUL1</italic> single null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>). Fifth, the ability of <italic>parkin</italic> overexpression to rescue <italic>PINK1</italic> mutants is not dependent on <italic>MUL1</italic>, and <italic>MUL1</italic> overexpression can still suppress <italic>PINK1</italic> mutants in the absence of <italic>parkin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sixth, knockdown of both <italic>MUL1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> in S2 cells further reduces Mfn ubiquitination below levels seen with knockdown of <italic>MUL1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R</xref>). Seventh, <italic>PINK1 MUL1</italic> and <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double null mutants have higher Mfn levels as compared to single null mutants of <italic>MUL1</italic>, <italic>PINK1</italic>, or <italic>parkin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, knockdown of <italic>mfn</italic> in the background of <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double mutants almost completely rescues the thoracic indentation and mitochondrial phenotypes of <italic>parkin MUL1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,P</xref>). These genetic observations, in combination with biochemical findings that MUL1 physically interacts with Mfn, and that loss of <italic>MUL1</italic> results in decreased ubiquitination of endogenous Mfn and increased Mfn levels, indicate that <italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway to regulate a common target Mfn.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01958.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the PINK1/parkin pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>H</bold>) Images of thoraces of various mutants.

When cells are treated with a mitochondrial uncoupler, mitochondria lose their membrane potential. This leads to recruitment of Parkin to the depolarized mitochondria, ultimately resulting in autophagic degradation of these mitochondria. Because of the genetic interactions observed between <italic>MUL1</italic> and <italic>PINK1</italic>/<italic>parkin</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we asked if <italic>MUL1</italic> was able to modulate Parkin-mediated mitophagy.</p><p>We induced mitophagy by exposing HeLa cells to antimycin A, which inhibits electron transport and depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane. Wild-type, <italic>MUL1</italic> knockout, and <italic>PINK1</italic> knockout (as a control) HeLa cells were transfected with YFP-Parkin and treated with DMSO or antimycin A for indicated time. In wild-type, without antimycin A treatment, Parkin mainly localizes in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, following antimycin A treatment for 3 hrs, most Parkin was translocated to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>). After 24 hrs of antimycin A treatment, Parkin was found dispersed in the cytosol and mitochondria were no longer observed, indicating that mitophagy had occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,E</xref>). To ensure there was no delay in mitophagy, we also assayed cells that were treated with antimycin A for 6, 12, 16 and 20 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, data not shown). In all cells, mitophagy was observed at least 16 hrs after antimycin A treatment. No significant differences were observed in the fraction of Parkin recruited to mitochondria, or the fraction of mitochondria that underwent mitophagy, at any of these time points, for wild-type and <italic>MUL1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–F</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>MUL1</italic> using shRNA also had no effect on Parkin translocation or mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Dissipation of the membrane potential is a strong indication of unhealthy mitochondria, which can lead to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell death. The Δψ<sub>m</sub> can be measured using a fluorescent dye tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). We used two independent MUL1 shRNAs to suppress endogenous MUL1 expression in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Cortical neurons expressing CFP-mito, from either wild-type mice co-expressing two independent MUL1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–D′</xref>), or <italic>parkin</italic> gene KO mice co-expressing a scrambled shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–E′</xref>), showed no significant decrease in the intensity of TMRE fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,C′,G</xref>). However, <italic>parkin</italic> KO neurons co-expressing <italic>MUL1</italic> shRNA showed a significant reduction of Δψ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–F′,G</xref>), suggesting that proper <italic>MUL1</italic> expression in primary cortical neurons is required to compensate for loss of <italic>parkin</italic> in maintaining mitochondrial integrity.</p><p>Next, we asked if <italic>MUL1</italic> knockdown alters Mfn2 levels in mouse cortical neurons. Neurons from wild-type or <italic>parkin</italic> KO mice were transfected with either scrambled shRNA or <italic>MUL1</italic> shRNA, followed by co-staining with anti-Cytochrome C and anti-Mfn2 antibodies. Relative Mfn2 intensity in individual neurons was analyzed by calculating the ratio of Mfn2 to Cytochrome C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to wild-type neurons transfected with scrambled shRNA, wild-type neurons with <italic>MUL1</italic> shRNA, or <italic>parkin</italic> KO neurons with either scrambled shRNA or <italic>MUL1</italic> shRNA had an increased intensity ratio of Mfn2 to Cytochrome C. This suggests that MUL1's role in regulating Mfn2 levels is also conserved in neurons.</p><p>Finally, we investigated if loss of either <italic>MUL1</italic> or <italic>parkin,</italic> or loss of both, has any impact on cultured primary cortical neuron morphology. <italic>MUL1</italic> knockdown in cells from wild-type mice resulted in a minor increase in dendritic retraction but no significant process fragmentation as compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H,L,M</xref>). Cortical neurons from <italic>parkin</italic> KO mice showed slightly increased process fragmentation but no dendritic retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J,L,M</xref>), as compared with wild-type cells. In contrast, <italic>MUL1</italic> knockdown in <italic>parkin</italic> KO neurons resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of neurons with dendritic and axonal fragmentation and retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K–K″,L–M</xref>; process fragmentation: total number of neurons examined: n &gt; 115 and n &gt; 127 each genotype for fragmentation and dendritic retraction analysis, respectively), indicative of early neurodegeneration. The observed phenotypes were confirmed using a second <italic>MUL1</italic> shRNA in <italic>parkin</italic> KO neurons (data not shown). These observations suggest that <italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway to ensure mitochondrial integrity and function, thus maintaining neuronal health in primary cortical neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we identified <italic>MUL1</italic> as a robust suppressor of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>MUL1</italic> overexpression, but not expression of a ligase-dead version, strongly suppresses <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes. The mechanism of this suppression is unique in that <italic>MUL1</italic> does not act on <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>, nor does it function as a downstream target. Rather, <italic>MUL1</italic> acts by suppressing <italic>mfn</italic> in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). <italic>mfn</italic> is crucial for actions downstream of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> to maintain mitochondrial function and tissue health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), as overexpression of <italic>mfn</italic> leads to pathology similar to lack of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> function. We hypothesize that the increase in the Mfn level needs to reach a threshold, such as that observed in the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> mutant backgrounds, but not in the <italic>MUL1</italic> null background, in order for overt muscle cell degeneration to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Biochemically, MUL1 binds to Mfn, and loss of <italic>MUL1</italic> results in decreased ubiquitination of Mfn and increased Mfn levels. These observations suggest that MUL1 may directly ubiquitinate Mfn, leading to its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Alternatively, MUL1 may act via an intermediary that promotes Mfn ubiquitination and degradation. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, overexpression of <italic>MUL1</italic> almost completely suppresses all aspects of the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> null phenotypes. Thus, treatments that manipulate <italic>MUL1</italic> expression or activity may have potential as therapeutics strategies.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01958.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Models for how <italic>MUL1</italic> interacts with <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depictions of how MUL1, PINK1, Parkin, and Mfn interact in the mitochondria. In mammalian cells, upon mitochondrial damage (CCCP or antimycin A treatment), PINK1 is stabilized onto the mitochondrial OM of damaged mitochondria, with its kinase domain facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). PINK1 recruits Parkin onto the OM, either through direct phosphorylation or indirect interaction with other proteins (not depicted here) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin and Youle, 2012</xref>). Parkin then ubiquitinates multiple substrates on the OM, including Mfn. MUL1, a mitochondrial OM-anchored ligase with its RNF domain facing the cytosol, also mediates ubiquitination of Mitofusin. (<bold>B</bold>) The <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway and <italic>MUL1</italic> act in parallel to regulate <italic>mfn</italic>, and maintain mitochondrial function and tissue health. Reducing either <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> or <italic>MUL1</italic> leads to increased levels of Mfn.

Removal of <italic>MUL1</italic> in the <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> null background significantly aggravates the phenotypes due to lack of <italic>PINK1 or parkin</italic> alone.

In addition, while <italic>parkin</italic> KO mature mouse cortical neurons or <italic>MUL1</italic> knockdown neurons show only mild neuronal phenotypes, neurons with <italic>parkin</italic> KO and <italic>MUL1</italic> KD show significantly diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction.

Finally, human HeLa cells, which have little or no endogenous Parkin, show a dramatic stabilization of Mfn when <italic>MUL1</italic> is eliminated.</p><p>Our findings may help to address an important puzzle in the field of PD research: why do <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> knockout mice, or even <italic>parkin/DJ-1/PINK1</italic> triple knockout mice, bear only subtle phenotypes related to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration or mitochondrial morphology changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palacino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez and Palmiter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank-Cannon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gautier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gispert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akundi et al., 2011</xref>). Our studies provide genetic and cellular clues that suggest compensation by <italic>MUL1</italic> may contribute to the subtle phenotypes in <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> mutant mice. It will be interesting to determine whether <italic>PINK1/MUL1</italic> or <italic>parkin/MUL1</italic> double knockout mice show more severe PD-related pathology. Regarding PD therapies, optimizing the function of <italic>MUL1</italic> is likely to be beneficial for <italic>PINK1/PARKIN</italic> patients; upregulating <italic>MUL1</italic> may rescue the pathology due to lack of <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>PARKIN</italic>. In contrast, downregulating <italic>MUL1</italic> and/or mutations in <italic>MUL1</italic> may lead to disruption of this compensatory pathway in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, and result in accelerated disease progression.</p><p>Why do cells have multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases acting on a common target? Mfn is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and is a key molecule that regulates mitochondrial fusion in response to various cellular processes. Due to its importance, the level of Mfn is expected to be tightly regulated, and this may require several E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases that respond to different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gegg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leboucher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lokireddy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of mitochondrial damage, Parkin translocates to depolarized mitochondria before it degrades Mfn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), thus preventing damaged mitochondria from fusing with healthy ones. As an E3 ligase anchored on the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), MUL1 is constantly present in the vicinity of Mfn, thus mediating Mfn clearance either constitutively or in a regulated manner in response to different stress signals. It is also possible that multiple E3 ligases work in a concerted way to ensure constant Mfn levels. In our study, CHX treatment leads to the stabilization of Mfn levels in HeLa cells lack of <italic>MUL1</italic>. However, steady-state Mfn levels in these cells are not strongly affected. This may result from the existence of other pathways for Mfn regulation, such as direct transcriptional feedback regulation on Mfn expression, activities of deubquitinases, and additional E3 ligases. Similar considerations may explain the viability and apparently mild phenotypes of <italic>MUL1</italic> mutant flies. More severe phenotypes may be uncovered in flies lacking <italic>MUL1</italic> in response to specific stresses that cannot be buffered by other components.</p><p>A recent study reports that <italic>MUL1</italic> promotes mitophagy, when muscle wasting is stimulated in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lokireddy et al., 2012</xref>). To monitor mitophagy, this study measured mitochondrial DNA content and emission of a mitochondrial fluorescent protein that changes color in an acidic environment such as the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lokireddy et al., 2012</xref>). However, since these methods do not directly visualize mitochondrial fate, it is possible that the observations may reflect early signs of mitochondrial dysfunction or turnover of the indicator protein, rather than clearance of the mitochondria. Also, it is unknown whether <italic>MUL1</italic> interacts with the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway to regulate the mitochondrial clearance. Our results show that overexpression or lack of <italic>MUL1</italic> does not affect Parkin-mediated mitophagy induced by mitochondrial damage in HeLa cells. This further strengthens our hypothesis that <italic>MUL1</italic> acts in <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic>-independent pathway for regulating mitochondrial quality control.</p><p>Given our observations, it will be interesting to ask if human mutations in <italic>mfn1 or mfn2</italic> that decrease their abilities to be targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, or mutations in <italic>MUL1</italic>, result in susceptibility for PD. It will also be interesting to see if polymorphisms in <italic>MUL1</italic> that affect <italic>MUL1</italic> expression levels or activity occur in PD patients. In this regard, it is worth noting that MUL1 forms a complex with VPS35 and VPS26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braschi et al., 2010</xref>). Since mutations in <italic>VPS35</italic> have been identified in multiple PD families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vilarino-Guell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zimprich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lesage et al., 2012</xref>), it will be particularly interesting to determine if PD-associated mutations in <italic>VPS35</italic> have effects on <italic>MUL1</italic>-dependent degradation of Mfn. Finally, our observation that overexpression of <italic>mfn</italic> alone is sufficient to recapitulate key phenotypes associated with loss of <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> suggests that inhibition of <italic>mfn</italic> may have important therapeutic potential for PD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology and constructs</title><p>To generate UAS-<italic>MUL1</italic>, an EST clone from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Research Center (DGRC), AT15655, was subcloned into the UASt vector using EcoR1 and Xho1.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, including member of our Board of Reviewing Editors Ray Deshaies and reviewer Hugo Bellen, who agreed to reveal their identities.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript from the Guo lab provides evidence that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the ubiquitin ligase <italic>MUL1</italic> acts in a pathway parallel to <italic>PINK</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> to maintain low levels of mitofusin protein. These findings are of considerable interest to the biological function of parkin and the consequences of its mutation in neurodegenerative disease, and are likely to be of interest to a general audience. In evaluating the claims made by the authors, the reviewers were of the consensus opinion that several modifications to the experimental data are needed to bring the claims in-line with the evidence provided to support them, as noted below:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> appears to be the exact same blot as the first four lanes of Figure 5R. This is not acceptable. Since there is a quantification of the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> beneath the gel with error bars, it should be possible to change the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> to one of the three repeat gels so it is not exactly the same gel shown as Figure 5R. Alternatively, the full figure could be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and the authors can refer back to the last 2 lanes when describing this result in the context of the rest of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>2) Test whether endogenous Mfn co-IPs with endogenous <italic>MUL1</italic>. This would strengthen the fairly weak conclusion of a “direct” activity of <italic>MUL1</italic> on Mfn.</p><p>3) The lack of mitochondrial fusion in their drp1 RNAi in Figure 4P needs to be omitted or addressed in much more detail. If the authors with to sustain their claims regarding Drp1, they need to provide biochemical data to document that Drp1 is strongly silenced, and if it is not they would need to use a strong mutant or more potent RNAi to achieve a compelling loss-of-function.</p><p>4) It is surprising that both <italic>Parkin/Pink</italic> and <italic>Mul1</italic> pathways ubiquitinate mitofusin but Mul1 is not required for mitophagy in their model. They should test mitophagy at intermediate points before all the mitochondria disappear (e.g., 6,12, and 18 hr). The present data do not exclude the possibility that mitophagy is delayed in <italic>MUL1</italic> mutant cells. The authors should also test whether antimycin A can trigger mitophagy in cells that overexpress <italic>MUL1</italic>, in the presence and absence of <italic>Parkin</italic> or <italic>PINK</italic>. For both of the experiments described above, it would be desirable to have a more quantitative read-out, such as immunoblots of mitochondrial matrix proteins.</p><p>5) No data are presented to confirm that SUMO RNAi was effective in <italic>PINK1</italic> mutants suppressed by <italic>MUL1</italic> OE. Moreover, the data presented for wild type flies treated with SUMO RNAi is not quantitative. Given that this observation brings into question a published finding from the McBride lab, either the evidence for SUMO loss-of-function should be strengthened (e.g., by including blotting data) or the data should be removed.</p><p>In addition to these modifications to the data, there are a number of issues noted below that need to be addressed, but this can be done adequately by modifications to the text.</p><p>6) There is some concern among the reviewers concerning how the findings are presented. For example, the authors say that <italic>MUL1</italic> compensates for loss of <italic>Parkin</italic> and that <italic>MUL1</italic> ensures mitochondrial integrity and function. This seems to be an excessively 'parkin-ocentric' viewpoint, since it seems unlikely that MUL1 exists solely to compensate for the potential loss of <italic>PINK</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>. The title and abstract should be modified to emphasize the parallel nature of the <italic>PINK/parkin</italic> and <italic>MUL1</italic> pathways.</p><p>7) In the Results section the authors refer to a “ligase-dead” version of MUL1, but there is no citation or data to establish why this mutant should be ligase-dead, or that it is in fact ligase-dead.</p><p>8) Provide more support for the claim in the Results section that visualization of mitochondrial ATPase is independent of mitochondrial import? Does assembly of ATPase holoenzyme rely on functional import pathway?</p><p>9) Report the Y-axis on the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5S</xref> as Mfn:actin ratio. Essentially all of the “increase” in relative Mfn in the double mutant is not due to an increase in Mfn at all, but rather a decrease in actin. Is it possible to normalize the samples in some other way (total protein or some other housekeeping protein besides actin)?</p><p>10) There was some divergence of opinion among the reviewers regarding the lack of a clear phenotype for mutant flies lacking <italic>MUL1</italic> (see comment #1 of reviewer 3). The authors should at least comment on whether knockdown/knockout of MUL1 has any noticeable effect on mitochondrial morphology. The authors should also discuss possible physiological roles of <italic>MUL1</italic> that could be further tested. Related to this, the authors should expand on their model in the discussion to explain that Mitofusin degradation presumably needs to reach a threshold to observe a phenotype like that seen for <italic>Pink1/Parkin</italic> mutants.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, I</xref>: despite the fact that both Mfn1 and Mfn2 are stabilized upon depletion or deletion of MUL1, the steady-state levels of these proteins are either not affected or barely affected. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>In addition to these points, each reviewer raised additional points for which a consensus opinion did not emerge regarding how they should be dealt with. In these cases it is left to the discretion of the authors as to how to respond. These are listed below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>1) The authors state, “...supporting the idea that <italic>MUL1</italic> suppresses <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant phenotypes through reduction of Mfn levels”. Although this is shown in wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), it was not shown in <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant. While this may seem like a detail one could argue it is a relatively important omission since it is at the core of their interpretation of how <italic>MUL1</italic> OE is exerting its effect.</p><p>2) Figure 4M, O, S, U: does overexpression of parkin or MUL1 proteins reduce the level of overexpression of mitofusin protein?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, K</xref>: why don't the <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>parkin</italic> mutants shown here look much better (i.e., much less defective) than those shown in multiple panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig4">Figures 1, 2, and 4</xref>?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: what effect do these various manipulations have on mitofusin levels in cortical neurons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript concludes that Mul1, a mitochondrial E3 ligase, ubiquitinates and causes proteosomal degradation of mitofusin in Drosophila and mammalian cells. Furthermore, <italic>Mul1</italic> loss exacerbates the phenotype of Parkin loss. The loss of <italic>Mul1</italic> is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to make the loss of <italic>Parkin/Pink1</italic> mutant flies worse, which indicates they work by different mechanisms. However, this is not surprising – many mutations in flies will cause stress by different paths and exacerbate one another's phenotype. Therefore, the key issue is whether or not both <italic>Mul1</italic> and <italic>Parkin</italic> function by inducing the ubiquitination and elimination of mitofusin. <italic>Mul1</italic> decreases the expression level of Mfn1 but this may be indirect and cell free experiments could conclusively show <italic>Mul1</italic> ubiquitinates Mfn. However, cell free experiments seems to be beyond the scope of this manuscript. Why would increased Mfn level lead to the mitochondrial and cellular defects? Is this through decreased mitophagy? If not mitophagy what? MUL1 is not likely expressed simply to statically reduce the steady state level of Mfn. How MUL1 is regulated and why and when it ubiquitinates MFn (if it is direct) remains unexplored. Although there are clearly mysteries here, this is a very thorough genetic study with intriguing conclusions in need of only minor corrections.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>MUL1 compensates for loss of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> in maintaining mitochondrial integrity. In the present manuscript, Yun et al. uncover a parallel pathway to PINK1/parkin acting through MUL1. Both pathways converge on a shared target mitofusin to maintain mitochondrial integrity in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. Recently, MUL1 was identified as a novel regulator of mitochondrial fission by activation of Drp1 through sumolyation and degradation of MFN1 and MFN2 through ubiquitination. In this manuscript the authors provide genetic evidence that MUL1 is required for mitofusin turnover in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cell lines. Moreover, MUL1 overexpression can suppress phenotypes associated with pink and parkin mutants through mitofusin degradation, suggesting a compensatory role for MUL1. As <italic>Pink1/Parkin</italic> also ubiquitinate mitofusin, they decided to test if MUL1 and <italic>Pink1/Parkin</italic> act in the same pathway. Double mutant of MUL1 with either <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic> have a more severe phenotype than the single mutants, which suggests that MUL1 and <italic>Pink1/Parkin</italic> act in parallel pathways. I believe the manuscript suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors address these concerns:</p><p>1) The subtle phenotypes associated with <italic>MUL1</italic> mutants suggest a compensatory role of this pathway. The authors should highlight the importance of <italic>MUL1</italic> in physiological conditions. Can the authors document, either by loss of one copy of <italic>Pink1</italic> or <italic>Parkin</italic> or by stressing mitochondria, a stronger phenotype in <italic>MUL1</italic> mutants. They should test life span or fertility in <italic>MUL1</italic> mutants under normal and stressed conditions to provide a comparison with <italic>pink/parkin</italic> mutant phenotypes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “<italic>MUL1</italic> acts in parallel to the <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic> pathway in regulating mitofusin and compensating for loss of <italic>PINK1/parkin</italic>” for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. The authors have addressed most of the comments that were raised in the original review, with one notable exception. The authors have not shown that there is a direct physical interaction between the endogenous Mul1 and Mfn proteins. The authors state that this is not possible, because there is no antibody against <italic>Drosophila</italic> Mul1 and the antibody against mammalian Mul1 does not work for IP. However, there are antibodies available against mammalian Mfn that have been reported to work for immunoprecipitation. This experiment should be done, as originally requested, or the authors should present a strong argument for why it cannot be done.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01958.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref> <italic>appears to be the exact same blot as the first four lanes of Figure 5R.

However, there is no anti-<italic>Drosophila MUL1</italic> antibody available, which prevents us from carrying out this experiment in flies. We also tried the experiments using mammalian anti-<italic>MUL1</italic> antibodies in mammalian cells, but found the antibody not suitable for immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins.</p><p>It is important to note that we have not made any strong argument that the interaction of MUL1 and Mfn is “direct”. In the Discussion, we state “These observations suggest that MUL1 may directly ubiquitinate Mfn, leading to its degradation. Alternatively, <italic>MUL1</italic> may act via an intermediary that promotes Mfn ubiquitination and degradation”.<italic>3) The lack of mitochondrial fusion in their drp1 RNAi in Figure 4P needs to be omitted or addressed in much more detail. If the authors with to sustain their claims regarding Drp1, they need to provide biochemical data to document that Drp1 is strongly silenced, and if it is not they would need to use a strong mutant or more potent RNAi to achieve a compelling loss-of-function.</italic> This is a great point.</p><p>In this revision, we have used flies with two different <italic>drp1</italic> null alleles (<italic>drp1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>and <italic>drp1</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, as previously reported by Vestreken et al.) instead of flies with <italic>drp1</italic> RNAi. Consistent with the RNAi results, flies with a complete loss-of-function of <italic>drp1</italic> do not show any TUNEL-positive cell death, which is distinct from lack of <italic>PINK1</italic> or <italic>parkin</italic>, or <italic>mfn</italic> overexpression. These panels are included as Figure 4V and Y.</p><p><italic>4) It is surprising that both</italic> Parkin/Pink <italic>and Mul1 pathways ubiquitinate mitofusin but Mul1 is not required for mitophagy in their model. They should test mitophagy at intermediate points before all the mitochondria disappear (e.g., 6,12, and 18 hr). The present data do not exclude the possibility that mitophagy is delayed in</italic> MUL1 <italic>mutant cells. The authors should also test whether antimycin A can trigger mitophagy in cells that overexpress</italic> MUL1<italic>, in the presence and absence of Parkin or PINK. For both of the experiments described above, it would be desirable to have a more quantitative read-out, such as immunoblots of mitochondrial matrix proteins</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we have now tested 4 additional time points (6, 12, 16 and 20 hours) in addition to 24 hours for mitophagy. We were unable to see any differences between <italic>MUL1</italic> null cells and wildtype cells. We have modified the text accordingly.</p><p>Regarding testing whether antimycin A can trigger mitophagy in cells that overexpress <italic>MUL1</italic>, in the presence and absence of <italic>Parkin or PINK1</italic>, we think that it is an important question. However, we believe that it is beyond the scope of this work. The focus of the mammalian work in this manuscript is to address the requirement and physiological roles of MUL1 in mitophagy, when expressed at physiological levels. We will address whether MUL1 is sufficient to induce mitophagy in future work. However, if Reviewers feel strongly that these experiments are absolutely required for publication, we will of course carry out the experiments and report back to you.</p><p><italic>5) No data are presented to confirm that SUMO RNAi was effective in</italic> PINK1 <italic>mutants suppressed by</italic> MUL1 <italic>OE. Moreover, the data presented for wild type flies treated with SUMO RNAi is not quantitative. Given that this observation brings into question a published finding from the McBride lab, either the evidence for SUMO loss-of-function should be strengthened (e.g., by including blotting data) or the data should be removed</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent point.

Mfn is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A) and is</xref> a key molecule that regulates mitochondrial fusion in response to various cellular processes. Due to its importance, the level of Mfn is expected to be tightly regulated, and this may require several E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases which respond to different stimuli {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park, 2010</xref> #5648;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leboucher, 2012</xref> #5649;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu, 2013</xref> #5650;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gegg, 2010</xref> #1310;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lokireddy, 2012</xref> #1337;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton, 2013</xref> #5651}. In the case of mitochondrial damage, <italic>Parkin</italic> translocates to depolarized mitochondria before it degrades Mfn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), thus preventing damaged mitochondria from fusing with healthy ones. As an E3 ligase anchored on the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), <italic>MUL1</italic> is constantly present in the vicinity of Mfn, thus mediating Mfn clearance either constitutively or in a regulated manner in response to different stress signals. It is also possible that multiple E3 ligases work in a concerted way to ensure constant Mfn levels.</p><p>In our study, CHX treatment leads to the stabilization of Mfn levels in HeLa cells lack of <italic>MUL1</italic>. However, steady-state Mfn levels in these cells are not strongly affected. This may result from the existence of other pathways for Mfn regulation, such as direct transcriptional feedback regulation on Mfn expression, activities of deubquitinases, and additional E3 ligases.

However, this is not surprising – many mutations in flies will cause stress by different paths and exacerbate one another's phenotype. Therefore, the key issue is whether or not both</italic> Mul1 <italic>and Parkin function by inducing the ubiquitination and elimination of mitofusin.</italic> Mul1 <italic>decreases the expression level of Mfn1 but this may be indirect and cell free experiments could conclusively show</italic> Mul1 <italic>ubiquitinates Mfn. However, cell free experiments seems to be beyond the scope of this manuscript. Why would increased Mfn level lead to the mitochondrial and cellular defects? Is this through decreased mitophagy? If not mitophagy what? MUL1 is not likely expressed simply to statically reduce the steady state level of Mfn. How MUL1 is regulated and why and when it ubiquitinates MFn (if it is direct) remains unexplored.

The authors have not shown that there is a direct physical interaction between the endogenous Mul1 and Mfn proteins.

However, there are antibodies available against mammalian Mfn that have been reported to work for immunoprecipitation. This experiment should be done, as originally requested, or the authors should present a strong argument for why it cannot be done</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the editors that it is important to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the endogenous MUL1 and Mfn. We have made repeated attempts to carry out this experiment in mammalian cells, using both anti-MUL1 and anti-Mitofusin antibodies. However, we have not been able to detect consistent binding between the endogenous proteins. It is possible that the interaction is too weak or transient, and that it therefore evades detection in our system, even though we can detect interactions between the two proteins when both are overexpressed.</p><p>It may be useful to provide a point of comparison with another well-established Mfn-binding protein, Parkin. None of the papers detailing interactions between Parkin and Mfn, and Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of Mfn, have shown these interactions using Co- IP between endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gegg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ziviani et al., 2010</xref>). While this state of affairs is not ideal, and it is not our preferred form of rebuttal, it does highlight what may be a general difficulty in detecting interactions between endogenous Mfn and other proteins. This has not prevented people in the field, including us, from concluding that Parkin binds to Mfn.</p><p>Finally, we interpret our data cautiously in the Discussion: “These observations suggest that MUL1 may directly ubiquitinate Mfn, leading to its degradation. Alternatively, MUL1 may act via an intermediary that promotes Mfn ubiquitination and degradation”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
