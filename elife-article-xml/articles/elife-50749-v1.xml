endocytosis (CME), which from yeast to humans involves a burst of actin assembly. To gain mechanistic insights into this process, we performed a side-by-side quantitative comparison of CME in two distantly related yeast species. Though endocytic protein abundance in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is more similar than previously thought, membrane invagination speed and depth are two-fold greater in fission yeast. In both yeasts, accumulation of ~70 WASp molecules activates the Arp2/3 complex to drive membrane invagination. In contrast to budding yeast, WASp-mediated actin nucleation plays an essential role in fission yeast endocytosis. Genetics and live-cell imaging revealed core CME spatiodynamic similarities between the two yeasts, although the assembly of two zones of actin filaments is specific for fission yeast and not essential for CME. These studies identified conserved CME mechanisms and species-specific adaptations with broad implications that are expected to extend from yeast to humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>clathrin-mediated endocytosis</kwd><kwd>protein counting</kwd><kwd>budding and fission yeast</kwd><kwd>force generation</kwd><kwd>N-WASp and Type I myosin</kwd><kwd>actin patch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drubin</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Biomedical Scholars Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Ke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative comparison of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in budding and fission yeast identified conserved mechanisms and species-specific adaptations with broad implications that extend from yeast to humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) takes up nutrients, regulates responses to extracellular stimuli, and controls the chemical composition and surface area of the plasma membrane. From yeast to humans, cells recruit several dozen highly conserved proteins to CME sites in a regular, predictable order to facilitate plasma membrane internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haucke and Kozlov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>During CME, cells deform the plasma membrane locally and subsequently pinch off a vesicle into the cytoplasm. However, the forces required to achieve membrane deformation and the sizes of the resulting vesicles can vary widely between species and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>). For animal cells, different cell types, and even different areas of the same cell, may exhibit differences in plasma membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>), affecting the forces required to create a membrane invagination. Both budding and fission yeast have high internal turgor pressure, which strongly opposes plasma membrane invagination necessary for endocytosis. Actin filament assembly mediated by the Arp2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) complex generates force to overcome plasma membrane tension in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merrifield et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yarar et al., 2005</xref>) and turgor pressure in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sirotkin et al., 2005</xref>). How various organisms utilize a similar set of proteins to satisfy their particular force generation requirements for endocytosis is an unanswered, fundamental question.</p><p>Observations of CME in live cells combined with the superb genetics of yeast, have advanced our understanding to this process. Studies of budding yeast have used electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buser and Drubin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Idrissi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mulholland et al., 1994</xref>), super resolution microscopy of fixed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mund et al., 2018</xref>) and comprehensive, high frame rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>), live-cell imaging of many of the proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galletta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newpher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>) to produce a detailed protein recruitment time course that was mapped onto precise morphological stages of membrane deformation (such as invagination length and vesicle release) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boettner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goode et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Quantitative fluorescence microscopy of live fission yeast also provided counts of endocytic proteins over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu and Chang, 2011</xref>). Super resolution imaging of endocytosis in fission yeast provided more details about the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasada et al., 2018</xref>) and electron microscopy of chemically fixed cells suggested that the endocytic tubules may elongate over 250 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Encinar del Dedo et al., 2014</xref>). While much of what is known about CME was learned from decades of classic cell biology studies in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>), more recent advanced experimental approaches, such as genome editing, stem cell technology, and sophisticated new imaging modalities, are beginning to make mammalian cells accessible to studies similar to those performed on yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cocucci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dambournet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadlecova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ancestors of budding yeast and fission yeast separated about 330–420 million years ago, so these two yeasts are almost as distant from each other as either is to animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hedges, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sipiczki, 2000</xref>). Since actin assembly accompanies CME from yeast to humans, this association must be ancient. Given that relating CME protein numbers and dynamics to membrane morphology is still difficult in mammalian cells, a direct, quantitative comparison of CME in the two highly divergent yeasts provides a promising approach to reveal the fundamental and evolutionarily adaptable aspects of the process.</p><p>The quantitative data have generated two distinct models for how actin polymerization produces force for endocytosis, a push and pull model for budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>) and a two-zone model for fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacy et al., 2018</xref>). Precise knowledge of endocytic protein numbers and dynamics is essential for understanding basic mechanisms and how they are adapted by evolution. Therefore, we compared directly the protein numbers and dynamics in the two yeasts using the same methods to provide insights into how the process has been modified during evolution. Quantitation of protein numbers at endocytic sites was a critical, pioneering development in fission yeast studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>). Lower numbers of homologous proteins were reported to be present at budding yeast endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and some differences were reported even for the same protein in the same yeast species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu and Chang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Pollard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galletta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>), highlighting the importance of direct comparisons. Furthermore, the dynamics of some of the proteins including WASp, one of the main nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) for the Arp2/3 complex, were reported to be distinctly different in budding and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of peak protein numbers in actin patches.</title><p>Calibration methods: Sirotkin, Arasada, Chen, Epstein, MacQuarrie: a range of internal standards tagged with YFP or GFP; Basu: comparison with actin patches in other cells marked with Arp2/3 complex subunit mYFP-arc5 assumed to be 330 molecules per patch from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al.

A new extracellular standard particle with 120 copies of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsia et al., 2016</xref>) was used to calculate the absolute numbers of some of these proteins at endocytic sites and to compare the relative abundance of multiple endocytic proteins. The live-cell imaging data were processed using a centroid tracking method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005</xref>) and then analyzed quantitatively using newly-developed custom software, which detects the different stages of fission yeast endocytic internalization, such as invagination elongation, scission, and vesicle release. Three-dimensional stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (3D-STORM) of fixed fission yeast cells revealed new structural details of endocytic vesicle formation. Finally, we examined the mechanism of endocytic actin assembly by performing two-color live-cell imaging on fission yeast mutants with deletions of the Arp2/3 complex-activating CA domains of WASp or type I myosin.</p><p>Our quantitative, direct comparison of budding and fission yeast revealed that endocytosis in the two yeasts is remarkably similar in spite of 400 million years of divergent evolution. Differences in the importance of the WASp and type I myosin nucleation promoting factors and the longer invaginations in fission yeast are notable adaptations. These results provide a framework for developing a deeper understanding of CME in these and other species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Side-by-side quantitative ratiometric imaging reveals modest differences in numbers of homologous proteins at endocytic sites in budding and fission yeast</title><p>To make accurate comparisons of the numbers of homologous proteins that are recruited to endocytic sites in budding and fission yeast, we recorded the dynamics of endogenously-tagged fluorescent endocytic proteins in both yeasts simultaneously in the same microscope field.

Throughout this manuscript we use ‘sp’ to denote a protein from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and ‘sc’ to denote a protein from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. spPan1 and scPan1 are homologues of mammalian intersectins and couple actin assembly to endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). spEnd4 and scSla2 are homologs of mammalian HIP1R and couple the endocytic actin network to the plasma membrane and clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). The maximum amount of spPan1 is approximately 1.7 times that of scPan1, while spEnd4 and scSla2 are present at endocytic sites in similar numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). spWsp1/scLas17 and spVrp1/scVrp1 are yeast homologs of mammalian WASp and WIP, respectively. The maximum levels of spWsp1 and spVrp1 are modestly higher (1.4 and 1.2 fold, respectively) at endocytic sites than scLas17 and scVrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). scMyo3 and scMyo5 are budding yeast type I myosins. The combined number of scMyo3 and scMyo5 molecules is ~1.8 times the number of spMyo1 molecules at endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). spArc5 and scArc15 are homologues of mammalian ARPC5, one of the seven subunits of Arp2/3 complex. The numbers of spArc5 and scArc15 molecules recruited to endocytic sites are indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

(<bold>A</bold>) In budding yeast, actin filaments are proposed to be nucleated near the base of the invagination. Continued polymerization driven by the nucleation promoting activity (NPF) of scMyo3/5 and scLas17 pushes the actin network toward cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). The endocytic membrane is coupled to the actin network by coat proteins such as Sla2 and is pulled inward with the actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). The membrane invagination is ~100 nm deep at the time of vesicle scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kukulski et al., 2012</xref>). Previously, HA-tagged Myo5 was observed not only at the base but also at the tip of endocytic membrane invaginations in chemically fixed budding yeast cells by immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Idrissi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Idrissi et al., 2012</xref>). These results led to the proposal that two distinct endocytic actin networks exist in budding yeast. However, two independent live-cell imaging studies indicated that Myo5-GFP patches stay non-motile at the cell cortex during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galletta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy suggested that Myo5-GFP forms a Nano-template for actin nucleation at the membrane base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mund et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that most if not all of the type I myosin is localized at the base of invaginated endocytic membranes. (<bold>B</bold>) In fission yeast, a two-zone model proposes that actin nucleation by spMyo1 and spWsp1generate two independent actin networks that push against each other and pull the tip of the invagination into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>). The depth of the fission yeast membrane invagination is not clear.

The different stages of fission yeast endocytic internalization (initiation of membrane invagination, membrane elongation and vesicle release) have not been clearly defined. To elucidate such information for fission yeast, we compared the recruitment and spatial dynamics of endocytic proteins side by side in budding and fission yeast. We acquired images in the equatorial plane of cells at high frame rate (more than 7 Hz). The time-lapse images were processed and analyzed using the ImageJ Particle Tracker plugin, which records the centroid position and fluorescence intensity of a fluorescently-tagged protein over time to generate a trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We developed Python-based software to analyze the trajectory data.</p><p>The dynamics of the actin filament network were compared in the two yeast species as a function of time by tracking scAbp1-GFP (Actin-Binding Protein 1) in budding yeast and spFim1-mEGFP (fimbrin) in fission yeast in data collected from the same movies at a frame rate of 9 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Both scAbp1-GFP and spFim1-mEGFP patches show little motility at the beginning of their lifetimes in endocytic patches while the fluorescence intensity gradually increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). All trajectories for each protein were aligned at 50% of their maximum intensity, then averaged and the average plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). The scAbp1-GFP moves about 125 nm with relatively high regularity (as indicated by the small standard deviations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as the intensity approaches the maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Once the scAbp1-GFP intensity starts to decline, the movement of the centroid becomes far more irregular (as indicated by a pronounced increase in the standard deviation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Since the irregular movement likely reflects diffusive movement of the free vesicle, endocytic membrane invaginations in fission yeast appear to be substantially deeper than in budding yeast before vesicle scission occurs. Moreover, in both yeasts, the predicted scission time point is tightly correlated with the maximum intensity of the endocytic actin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>).</p><p>Our quantification of actin (represented by Fim1) dynamics predicts the timing of endocytic membrane scission in fission yeast. To determine when endocytic invagination starts, we carried out a similar quantitative analysis for the endocytic coat proteins scSla1-GFP and spPan1-mEGFP, which are closely associated with the invaginating membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In both yeasts, the coat proteins are stationary for a relatively long period (~30 s –120 s) before moving into the cell interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Presumably, the initiation of coat protein movement reflects the starting point of endocytic membrane invagination. We defined the initiation of coat protein movement by an inflection point in the ‘distance from origin’ vs ‘time’ graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Our custom software automatically detects the inflection point for each trajectory and aligns multiple trajectories at the inflection point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). After the inflection point, scSla1-GFP and spPan1-mEGFP move regularly (indicated by a relatively small standard deviation) for about 4–5 s, followed by a sharp transition to a period of irregular movement (indicated by a pronounced increase in the standard deviation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that endocytic vesicle scission likely occurs around 4–5 s after the initiation of endocytic membrane invagination in both yeasts. The scSla1-GFP patches in budding yeast move ~100 nm before vesicle scission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for scSla2-GFP, scPan1-GFP and scEnd3-GFP (data not shown).

These results suggest that that the fission yeast endocytic membrane invagination reaches to ~200 nm prior to vesicle scission. While the initiation of both spPan1-mEGFP and scSla1-GFP patch movement is tightly correlated with attainment of the maximum intensity for each protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), the invagination speed in fission yeast is about twice as fast as in budding yeast (51.8 nm/s vs 23.8 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Quantitative comparison of endocytic coat dynamics for budding and fission yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Single endocytic event detected by tracking fluorescent scSla1 in budding yeast (<bold>A</bold>) or spPan1 in fission yeast (<bold>B</bold>).

About ~2 s later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, dotted line 2), both fluorescent proteins start to move in a regular manner more than 200 nm over 4–5 s prior to beginning to move irregularly when the endocytic vesicle is presumed to be released.

The length of the spFim1 structures ranged from 120 nm to 350 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which likely represents progression through the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasada et al., 2018</xref>). In a similar STORM study in fixed budding yeast, the length of the endocytic actin network was estimated to range from 70 nm-240 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mund et al., 2018</xref>). EM studies in budding yeast suggest that a dense network of actin filaments occupies a large area outside the invaginated membrane prior to scission. This area is expected to be larger than that traveled by the centroid of actin network fluorescence in the dynamics experiments described above because those studies do not describe the extent of the network but instead its center. Thus, the greater length of endocytic actin structures observed in fission yeast is consistent with the possibility that the invaginated membrane that it covers is deeper than in budding yeast. The length of spPan1 structures in fission yeast ranged from 50 nm to 180 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which is much smaller than the range for spFim1 structures. spPan1 is a coat protein that is expected to localize on the invaginated membrane, more precisely representing the morphology of invaginated membrane. In addition, 3D-STORM analysis revealed that spPan1 forms a ring structure in the X-Y plane, presumably encircling the invaginated membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Budding yeast WASp, scLas17, in has been reported to remain near the base of the endocytic pit (close to the plasma membrane) as the actin network moves into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>), while fission yeast WASp, spWsp1, was reported to move away from the base with the actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>). One possible source of the different observations on these two yeasts is that a fluorescent protein-tag was added at C-terminus of budding yeast scLas17 but to the N-terminus of fission yeast spWsp1. Therefore, we generated a budding yeast strain with the GFP tag on the N-terminus of Las17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) by making an in-frame fusion at the native <italic>LAS17</italic> locus. More than 70% of GFP-Las17 patches showed dynamics similar to those observed for Las17-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). However, some GFP-Las17 patches appeared to split into two parts toward the end of the patch lifetime: the majority of the GFP-Las17 signal remained non-motile until it disappeared from the endocytic site while a small amount of the GFP-Las17 moved away from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In spite of these differences, the populations of actin patches in the <italic>GFP-LAS17</italic> strain and the <italic>LAS17-GFP</italic> strain were indistinguishable by two criteria: (1) patch lifetimes were identical; and (2) the actin network markers Abp1p-RFP and Myo5p-RFP behaved similarly over space and time in the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our high frame rate live-cell image analysis confirmed that mEGFP-spWsp1 patches move away from their origin, into the cytoplasm in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

However, these counting studies were done in several different laboratories, which focused exclusively on either budding or fission yeast, and they largely used different methods for calibration. In fact, different results have been reported for the number of molecules of the same protein in the same yeast species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu and Chang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Pollard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galletta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>). To reconcile these differences, we made great efforts to validate our methods for an accurate quantitative analysis of protein numbers, and to make direct comparisons between the yeasts.</p><p>Firstly, we determined the relative abundance of homologous proteins in the two yeasts in the same microscope fields to eliminate imaging inconsistencies. The fluorescence intensities were processed and analyzed in parallel, further ensuring a faithful comparison. For these reasons, we believe that our approach improves the accuracy of comparisons between species. Strikingly, the abundances of the endocytic protein homologues in the two yeasts are more similar than indicated by the published literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, we adopted 120-sfGFP-tagged nanocages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsia et al., 2016</xref>) as our fluorescent standard for counting absolute protein numbers. Each nanocage is a stable icosahedron with a diameter of ~25 nm. Like endocytic patches, the nanocages appear as diffraction limited spots by 2D-wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Nanocages are easy to purify and handle and as a result, large sample sizes can be imaged in the same field, giving more reliable and precise results providing that the medium has a pH of ~7.0 (details in Materials and methods). Moreover, intensity histograms for 120-sfGFP-tagged nanocages prepared on different days give highly reproducible results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As validation for our new standard, we used the 120-sfGFP-tagged nanocages to estimate that clusters of 16-kinetochores in budding yeast carry 92 ± 19 Cse4-sfGFP molecules, consistent with results of several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galletta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our counts of Abp1 and the Arp2/3 complex in actin patches of budding yeast agree well with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galletta et al.

These systematic differences in absolute number estimates are likely due to use of different calibration standards. Picco et al. used the kinetochore protein Nuf2 at the anaphase to telophase transition as a standard. However, a recent study demonstrated that Nuf2 levels change dynamically during the anaphase to telophase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhatchinamoorthy et al., 2017</xref>), which complicates its use as a standard. For fission yeast, our counts of Fim1, spWsp1 and spMyo1 are substantially lower than some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>) but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Pollard, 2013</xref>) previous measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These differences might be explained by the live cell imaging conditions and methods to correct for local background.</p><p>To date, few counts of proteins have been reported at sites of CME in animal cells due to technical difficulties associated with genetic manipulation of genomes. However, dynamin numbers have been determined in genome-edited mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cocucci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>). Pertinent to the current study, Akamatsu et al (under revision) recently generated a cell line that expresses an endogenously-tagged fluorescent subunit of Arp2/3 complex and estimated its peak number at endocytic sites as ~200, which is lower than, but close to, the peak numbers at CME sites in budding (294) and fission (302) yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, the numbers of endocytic proteins at CME sites in yeast may approximate the numbers in human cells, and differences may provide a basis for understanding cell type-specific requirements for CME such as the forces necessary for vesicle formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison of protein dynamics and endocytic site morphology for CME internalization stages</title><p>We analyzed fission yeast endocytic internalization using high time resolution live-cell imaging and custom analytical software. Wide-field fluorescence microscopy in the equatorial plane of yeast cells enabled fast acquisition, high signal intensity and the opportunity to observe the complete endocytic internalization process from a side view. However, the endocytic protein imaged by this method may not remain in the same focal plane during the full-time course, especially after endocytic vesicle scission. For this reason and because of variation in kinetic profiles of different events, the fluorescence intensity profiles varied from one recorded trajectory to another. We therefore developed a conceptually different alignment method from those used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>) to suit our imaging method. Our custom software automatically transformed the tracking data for numerous individual events into visually intuitive graphs, showing the 2-D trajectory, raw (unprocessed) fluorescence intensity, and displacement over time. Comparing graphs for numerous events allowed us to identify the signatures for each endocytic protein and align the trajectories of the proteins accordingly. Our software not only recapitulates the dynamic endocytic protein profiles reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>), but also distinguishes the stages of endocytic internalization, such as invagination elongation, scission, and vesicle release.</p><p>In the early studies of fission yeast, the trajectories of most endocytic protein(s) were aligned relative to the initiation of patch movement in movies of lower time resolution (0.3–0.5 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>) without knowing how this movement correlates with specific endocytic steps. A later study improved the temporal resolution and provided an in-depth analysis of Fim1 dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>). However, in the absence of a comparative analysis of actin and coat protein spatiodynamics, knowledge of how the actin (Fim1) timeline maps onto the morphological stages of CME was still unclear in fission yeast. Our high time resolution movies (more than 7 Hz) and new alignment software revealed that the centroid position of the endocytic actin network (represented by spFim1), the endocytic coat (represented by spPan1) and the presumed scission protein (spHob1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaksonen et al., 2005</xref>) move ~200 nm from their initiation sites prior to predicted vesicle release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that the endocytic membrane invagination is ~200 nm deep at the time of scission, nearly twice the depth observed for budding yeast. The nanoscale structural organization of spFim1 and spPan1 at endocytic sites determined by super-resolution imaging further supports this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This possibility agrees with the observation of membrane invaginations over 200 nm long in the chemically fixed fission yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Encinar del Dedo et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the initiation of membrane invagination is tightly correlated with the maximum intensity for spPan1-mEGFP, while the predicted scission time point is tightly correlated with the maximum intensity of Fim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Our results agree with and provide an explanation for the previous finding that the motion of Fim1 patches is diffusive rather than directional after the peak number at endocytic sites is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berro and Pollard, 2014</xref>). Another intriguing result is that the elongation speed for membrane invagination is twice as fast in fission yeast as in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>The two yeasts studied here show dramatic differences in endocytic site dimensions and dynamics. As similar differences have been reported within a range of mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dambournet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>), comparative studies between the yeasts might identify mechanisms for controlling CME structure and dynamics more generally. Compared to budding yeast, the greater abundance of key proteins at endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) in fission yeast, might account for faster invagination rates and greater invagination lengths. In the future, direct comparisons of turgor pressure between the yeasts and determination of how cargo size and concentration affect rates and vesicle capacity are likely to provide additional insights into the mechanistic basis for observed differences.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Peak molecules per patch vs total molecules per cell for various endocytic proteins in budding and fission yeast.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4" valign="top">A. Peak molecules per patch vs total molecules per cell in budding yeast</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="author-callout-style-b1" valign="top"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <break/>Protein</td><td style="author-callout-style-b1" valign="top">Total molecules per cell</td><td style="author-callout-style-b1" valign="top">Peak molecules per patch</td><td style="author-callout-style-b1" valign="top">Ratio</td></tr><tr><td style="author-callout-style-b1" valign="top"/><td style="author-callout-style-b1" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al.

The coat proteins spPan1, spEnd4, scSla1, scPan1, scEnd3 and scSla2 reach their maximum numbers at endocytic sites before actin assembly is initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C, D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A (I and II), 9B (I and II)</xref> and data not shown). Recruitment of spWsp1 at endocytic sites in fission yeast begins as spPan1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A (I)</xref>) followed in both yeasts by switch-like activation of the Arp2/3 complex when ~ 70 molecules of WASp are recruited to endocytic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A(II) and B(II)</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). These properties suggest that ~70 WASp molecules are key for establishing a WASp-Arp2/3 complex stoichiometry sufficient for a burst of actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Case et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Second, the two yeasts recruit type I myosin and WASp to endocytic sites differently. The assembly/disassembly profiles of mEGFP-spWsp1 and mEGFP-spMyo1 are similar in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A (I)</xref>), while the two budding yeast type one myosins, scMyo3 and scMyo5, appear at endocytic sites more than 10 s after scLas17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B (I)</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Third, WASp-mediated actin assembly initiates membrane deformation in both yeasts. Endocytic membrane invagination is first detected when spWsp1 peaks and actin assembles to ~50% of its maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A (III), 9B(III)</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, although both yeasts recruit WASp and myosin-I to endocytic sites, the yeast show different dependencies on the NPF activities of these two proteins. Budding yeast recruit a total of 300 molecules of two isoforms of myosin-I (vs. 170 in fission yeast) and the NPF activity of their CA motifs is important for robust internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>) but not in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and F</xref>). Nevertheless, complete deletion of fission yeast spMyo1 shows that, as in budding yeast, functions other than its NPF activity contribute to endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pedersen and Drubin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, endocytic sites in fission yeast accumulate more WASp molecules (~140 Wsp1) than in budding yeast (~100 Las17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and the WASp NPF activity is crucial for endocytosis in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B and D</xref>) but not budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Fifth, once membrane invagination begins, both WASp and myosin-I dissociate more quickly from actin patches in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A (IV) and 9A(V)</xref>) than in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B(IV) and 9B(V)</xref>).

The cells were adhered to the surface of a concanavalin A-coated coverslip, which was then inverted onto a glass slide, and sealed with vacuum grease (Dow Corning).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image J software was used for general processing of images and movies, such as background subtraction and photobleaching correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>). A median filter was used to subtract local background around patches as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Picco and Kaksonen (2017)</xref>. Particle Tracker plugin was used to track endocytic patch protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The trajectory selection was confirmed by visual inspection. Trajectories that any point in their lifetime were too close to another patch to be clearly resolved were excluded from our analysis. The sample size for each experiment is shown on the figure or/and in the figure legend. The sample sizes used in this study are more than what have been used in other landmark papers in this type of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2010</xref>). For each pair of variables, pooled data of analysis were compared by a two-sided Mann-Whitney test using the Prism 8 graphing software.</p><p>We built a custom data analysis pipeline that operates on individual tracks listed in the trajectory selection. For each track, the intensity values (I<sub>t</sub>), and the positions in x (x<sub>t</sub>) and y (y<sub>t</sub>) for each time point (t) of the track are recorded. Different CME proteins might show different dynamics during their intensity time course and, depending on their role in CME, might show regularity patterns other than intensity profiles, such as protein displacement.</p><p>To identify such patterns, our pipeline is split into two parts: 1) In a first data preprocessing and examination step, multiple characteristics are quantified for each track (movement speed, time of 50% intensity, time of maximum intensity, etc.). This first step makes it possible to search for and find patterns and regularities among the recorded tracks. In step 2, alignments are calculated based on the new observed patterns from step 1. As a result, conclusions can be drawn from an aligned and averaged set of tracks. In this study, two characteristics proved to be most useful for our alignments: inflection point (see below) and 50% raw intensity.</p><p> <italic>Inflection point:</italic> Quantified coat protein tracks can usually be divided into two phases: An initial, non-motile phase (a) during which protein accumulates on the plasma membrane with little detectable movement and a second phase (b) in which the protein moves, likely reflecting the time when the plasma membrane deforms into an invagination (b<sub>1</sub>), and when the freed endocytic vesicle pinches off and moves into the cytoplasm (b<sub>2</sub>). We used the transition point between these two phases (a, b<sub>1</sub>), which we refer to as the inflection point t<sub>inflection</sub>, for CME track alignment. To calculate t<sub>inflection</sub>, first, the frame by frame displacement <italic>d<sub>t</sub></italic> was calculated for all subsequent timepoints t and t+1 in a track: d<sub>t+1</sub> = sqrt[(x<sub>t+1</sub>+1-x<sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup> +(y<sub>t+1</sub>-y<sub>t</sub>)<sup>2</sup>]. The signature behavior is that <italic>d<sub>t</sub></italic> is flat in phase (a) and then suddenly shows a slope change upon the transition to phase (b<sub>1</sub>). To identify t<sub>inflection</sub>, <italic>d<sub>t</sub></italic> is first linearized using linear regression d<sub>t,linear</sub> = linregress(d<sub>t</sub>) and then d<sub>t,linear</sub> is subtracted from <italic>d<sub>t</sub></italic>. t<sub>inflection</sub> now is the minimum in the resulting function: t<sub>inflection</sub> = argmin(d<sub>t</sub> - d<sub>t,linear</sub>).</p><p> <italic>50% raw intensity:</italic> The time point for 50% raw fluorescence intensity t<sub>0.5,raw</sub> can be helpful to align the tracks for endocytic proteins with short lifetimes and/or complex displacement patterns. This value is found at Intensity(t<sub>0.5,raw</sub>)=0.5 * max(Intensity(t)).</p><p> <italic>Implementation:</italic> The pipeline is implemented as a python software library with a Jupyter based user interface, which allows user-friendly and interactive access to its functionality.

After purification as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mund et al. (2014)</xref> we obtained an AF647 GFP-nanobody solution with a concentration of 49.3 µM and a labeling ratio of approximately 1.2 dye per nanobody.</p><p>Fission yeast fixation and AF647 GFP-nanobody labeling: fission yeast cells were fixed and labeled following a method commonly used for good actin structure preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaplan and Ewers, 2015</xref>). Low speed centrifugation (1000 rpm) was used to pellet yeast cells. Paraformaldehyde was directly added to the culture to a 4% final concentration, followed by 15 min incubation. Cells were washed twice with CS (cytoskeleton) buffer (10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM Glucose, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.005% NaN3, pH6.1) containing 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, for 5 min with gentle shaking. The cells were collected and resuspended with CS buffer contain 5% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.25%(vol/vol) Triton X-100. After 30 min gentle shaking, AF647 GFP-nanobody was added to the fixed cells to a final concentration of 0.5 µM. The fixed cells were incubated with AF647 GFP-nanobody with gentle shaking overnight at 4°C.</p><p>Alexa Fluor 647-labeled cell samples were mounted on gel pads with STORM imaging buffer consisting of 5% (w/v) glucose, 100 mM cysteamine, 0.8 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 40 µg/mL catalase in 1M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). Coverslips were sealed using Cytoseal 60. STORM imaging was performed on a homebuilt setup based on a modified Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted fluorescence microscope using a Nikon CFI Plan Apo λ 100x oil immersion objective (NA 1.45). Dye molecules were photoswitched to the dark state and imaged using a 647 nm laser (MPB Communications, Quebec, Canada); this laser beam passed through an acousto-optic tunable filter and an optical fiber into the back focal plane of the microscope and onto the sample at intensities of ~2 kW cm<sup>−2</sup>. A translation stage was used to shift the laser beams towards the edge of the objective so light reached the sample at incident angles slightly smaller than the critical angle of the glass-water interface. A 405 nm laser was used concurrently with the 647 nm laser to reactivate fluorophores into the emitting state. The power of the 405 nm laser was adjusted (typical range 0–1 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) during image acquisition so that at any given instant, only a small, optically resolvable fraction of the fluorophores in the sample were in the emitting state. For 3D STORM imaging, a cylindrical lens was inserted into the imaging path so that images of single molecules were elongated in opposite directions for molecules on the proximal and distal sides of the focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). The raw STORM data was analyzed according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). Data were collected at a frame rate of 110 Hz, for a total of ~60,000 frames per image.</p><p>Endocytic sites were first identified through signals in the 488 nm channel. Conventional images of yeast containing puncta or bright spots were then overlaid with the image in the super-resolution channel by adding the super-resolution image to the conventional image. If signals in both the conventional and super-resolution channel overlapped, the structure in the super-resolution channel was cropped. The corresponding molecule list (includes X, Y, Z positions of all molecules in the reconstructed image) were generated from the cropped structures for further data analysis. If no signal overlap was observed between the conventional and super-resolution channel, the site was not subjected to analysis. The puncta in crowded regions of the cell could not be clearly resolved as a single endocytic site and therefore were not included in our analysis.</p><p>The single molecule positions for the structures of interest obtained from the reconstructed STORM image were loaded into MATLAB. A rotation matrix was applied to the molecule position list such that the invagination site was rotated to a horizonal orientation. The length of the invagination was measured by computing the distance between every pair of molecules within a set threshold (~0.01 difference in pixel size) along the y-axis, until the longest distance was found. The distance between the two molecules was calculated by the distance formula (d = √ ((x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)). The length, in pixel size, was then converted to nanometers using the conversion scale one pixel = 160 nm. The position of the plasma membrane relative to the endocytic structures was estimated by the background signals showing the cell shape.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Drubin/Barnes laboratory for helpful discussions.

submitting your article &quot;Direct comparison of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in budding and fission yeast reveals conserved and evolvable features&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vladimir Sirotkin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. <italic>eLife</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors employed several creative and rigorous approaches to systematically compare protein abundances, morphology and kinetics of late, actin-dependent steps of endocytosis in budding versus fission yeast. A number of previous studies have comparatively examined endocytosis in fission and budding yeast and reported significant differences in the copy numbers of several proteins at the endocytic structures. New data obtained in the present study suggest that protein abundances and molecular mechanisms of actin-mediated membrane invagination and scission are more similar in these two yeasts than previously thought. In particular, new experiments did not support previously proposed hypothesis of the essential role of two-zone actin polymerization in fission yeast. At the same time, several differences in protein concentrations and in dynamics of the endocytic process, for example, in the extent and rate of membrane invagination were found. Overall, while this study does not seem to offer a significant conceptual advance in the mechanistic understanding of endocytosis in yeast cells, the completion of this rigorous analysis is important for reconciling previous conflicting reports and models, thus creating much needed basis for future mechanistic studies. For this reason, it should be revised as an <italic>eLife</italic> RESOURCE.</p><p>1) With regard to presenting the value of this work to a wide reader of <italic>eLife</italic> who are not experts in yeast endocytosis, it is unclear whether observed differences have any functional implications. In other words, it is unclear if the abundances of proteins and the length/rate of membrane invagination substantially affect the rate and capacity of endocytosis. Are the internalization rates of cargo, such as transporters or receptors, different in fission and budding yeast? Or would observed differences provide opportunities for species-specific regulatory mechanisms? If not addressed by direct measurements, the authors must discuss these points and make the present manuscript more widely appreciated by the broad <italic>eLife</italic> readership.</p><p>2) Substantial homo-FRET likely occurs within the nanocage between closely positioned GFP molecules which could result in a reduced fluorescence signal per GFP molecule as compared to single-molecule measurements. Although this will not affect measurements of the relative concentrations of GFP-tagged proteins at the endocytic structures in two yeast types, their absolute protein copy numbers might be underestimated.</p><p>3) Do protein concentrations at the endocytic bud correlate with their total expression levels? In Figure 1C, total cellular concentration of spWsp1 appears to be higher in fission yeast than that of scLas17 in budding yeast, which correlates with their concentrations at endocytic structures. On the other hand, in Figure 1A, Pan1 is more abundant at endocytic structures in fission than in budding yeast but total Pan1 fluorescence intensities are similar in two yeasts. It would strengthen the manuscript if the information about total cellular levels of proteins listed in Supplementary file 1 in two yeasts is presented and discussed, if available from mass-spectrometry databases or microscopy studies.</p><p>4) The authors state in subsection “Absolute numbers of proteins at endocytic sites quantified using ratiometric comparison to fluorescence intensity of a 120-sfGFP-tagged nanocage” that 'the numbers we determined for several key fission yeast proteins were 1.5-2 times lower than previously reported (Figure 2E, 2F and 2G (Sirotkin et al., 2010)'. But actually, the difference is not that dramatic as one can see from calculating the ratios of numbers from Supplementary file 1: two Arp2/3 complex subunits, 1.05; WASp, 1.67; verprolin, 1.47; myosin-1, 2.35; Fim1, 1.35; HIP1R, 1.29; intersectin, 1.19. So, for 6 out of 8 proteins the ratio is less than 1.5, which was very satisfying to see. And while the WASp count might indeed be inflated in Sirotkin et al., (2010) due to high cytoplasmic background of Wsp1 and, as the current study suggests, background correction method used, greater than 2-fold difference for Myo1 is to me genuinely puzzling. In my hands, mGFP-Myo1 patches are always 1.5-2.0-fold brighter than mGFP-Wsp1 patches. While I do not think that reconciling this discrepancy is strictly necessary for the current study, it might be important to do it in the long-term. But I am wondering if the authors attempted to reconcile this discrepancy by (i) changing location of the tag to the N-terminus, (ii) imaging the mGFP-Myo1 strain from Sirotkin et al., (2010) side-by-side with their Myo1-GFP strain on their calibrated microscope, and (iii) sequencing their Myo1-GFP strain to make sure there are no mutations in the GFP?</p><p>5) Both N-terminally (Sirotkin et al., 2005, 2010) and C-terminally GFP-tagged Wsp1 proteins are only partially functional based on their synthetic lethality with myo1 deletion. Since the current study is going to be the definitive gold-standard description of timing of endocytic events in relation to the numbers of molecules, it is very important to provide a control for any possible effects of spGFP-Wsp1 on the dynamics of Fim1-mCherry. This can be easily done by imaging side-by-side GFP-Wsp1+Fim1-mCherry strain versus Fim1-mCherry alone strain.</p><p>6) One of the major conclusions from the work is that the endocytic invaginations in <italic>S. pombe</italic> seem to be longer and grow faster. On one hand, the longer length of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> endocytic invaginations could already be expected from comparing the live cell imaging and super-resoultion microscopy data on chemically fixed samples (Arasada et al., 2018; Mund et al., 2018), and from comparing electron microscopy images of endocytic invaginations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Encinar del Dedo et al., 2014; Idrissi et al., 2008). The observation that the invaginations might grow faster is more interesting and novel, but the time of vesicle fission is only inferred in the manuscript by Sun and coworkers. Defining the dynamics of the scission machinery would be helpful in this context.</p><p>7) An interesting observation is that deletion of the CA domain of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> myosin-I does not influence the endocytic coat and actin dynamics, whereas deletion of that of N-WASP does. This is used to imply that the hypothesis proposing the existence of two distal actin networks organized by the myosin-I and N-WASP at the base and the tip of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> invaginations is not functionally relevant. Much care should be taken with this conclusion though. It might just be that the CA domains of the endocytic NPFs are redundant, as it has been shown for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, only that in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, because the lower number of myosin-I molecules, N-WASP might be the prominent NPF. In this context, the authors are requested to combine the mutations of both NPFs. On the other hand, the CA domains of the endocytic NPFs might basically work to trigger the formation of a branched actin network on the endocytic coat at the beginning of the budding process, and this network might then be organized by the different actin binding proteins and even grow in the absence of further Arp2/3 complex activation. Please discuss here that the presence of two distinct actin networks associated with endocytic invaginations has also been proposed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, being the Arp2/3 complex associated with the network positioned at the tip, but not the base of the invagination (Idrissi et al., 2012; Idrissi et al., 2008). It should be mentioned that description of endocytic actin by in vivo imaging or super-resolution mostly uses Abp1 and Arp2/3 components as markers, and one should keep in mind that those will label mainly branched actin networks but do not necessarily follow all actin filaments at endocytic sites.</p><p>8) Missing information in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>(i) There is no strain table, which will be important for people wishing to request strains from this study.</p><p>(ii) There is no detailed description of how the genes were tagged. This is particularly important because the authors specifically test the effect of tag placement on molecular counts and dynamics of Las17.</p><p>(iii) Were tagged strains verified by sequencing?

In subsection “Comparison of protein dynamics and endocytic site morphology for CME internalization stages” we added text suggesting that different turgor pressures in the two evolutionarily distant yeasts might account in part for the differences in the sizes of endocytic vesicles and the numbers of endocytic proteins. Turgor pressure might have contributed to selection of the differences during the divergent evolution of the two yeasts. Our data lay a solid foundation of investigating the mechanisms in the future. Such work may help to explain why clathrin-coated pits differ in size in various species (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If not addressed by direct measurements, the authors must discuss these points and make the present manuscript more widely appreciated by the broad eLife readership.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for encouraging us to discuss in more detail how comparative studies contribute to understanding the mechanism of endocytosis. The high conservation of the proteins that drive endocytosis means that the common ancestor of fungi and animals had genes for these proteins, so the studies performed here and in other labs on yeast provide a foundation for understanding of CME in animals. Of course, all organisms that diverged from this common ancestor now provide examples of how proteins that arose from the ancient genes have been adapted to many lifestyles. To relate our findings to those in other eukaryotes, we list the names of the mammalian homologues in tables and figures (e.g., Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2, etc).</p><p>Our results summarized in Figure 9 emphasize that yeasts have provided more details about molecular recruitment and function in CME pathways than in any other cell type. For example, fully understanding endocytic internalization depends on knowing local numbers of each participating protein and the corresponding membrane morphology. Acquisition of such information would be very difficult if not impossible to achieve in mammalian cells. Even with new genome editing methods and sophisticated new imaging modalities, it will be a long while before a complete set of mammalian cell lines with endogenously GFP-tagged endocytic proteins is available to measure systematically the numbers of proteins and their dynamics. Before this study, we did not know if the reported differences in protein abundances and membrane invagination dynamics in budding and fission yeast were meaningful. Therefore, our rigorous study not only contributes essential new knowledge about endocytosis in the two yeast species, but also provides the most detailed and precise information available for mathematical modeling studies to provide rigorous tests of mechanistic hypotheses. More importantly, our results are useful for future identification of conserved, essential principles (what is adaptable and what is not) of the endocytosis in general. We modified the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion section to emphasize these points.</p><p>In addition, this work reports technical advances in protein counting and particle tracking analysis that will benefit cell biology research in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Substantial homo-FRET likely occurs within the nanocage between closely positioned GFP molecules which could result in a reduced fluorescence signal per GFP molecule as compared to single-molecule measurements.

First, we verified our approach using a previously used kinetochore calibration (Figure 2D).

Using 3D-STORM, we collected data for over 5 minutes for many endocytic sites to produce reconstructions and to gain the spatial resolution required to determine that Fim1 assembles into a structure with the longest length of approx. 350 nm, which likely outlines and extends beyond the membrane invagination.</p><p>We were not aware that immuno-EM had been done in fission yeast when we wrote the manuscript. We appreciated learning about this work and have now referred to Encinar del Dedo et al., 2014 at the appropriate parts of the text to strengthen our conclusions (Introduction; subsection “Comparison of protein dynamics and endocytic site morphology for CME internalization stages”).</p><p>In most previous studies, the dynamics of coat proteins (Sla1, Pan1, Sla2), scission proteins (Rvs167 and Rvs161) and actin (Abp1) were used as spatial and temporal landmarks to predict the membrane shape. These studies assumed that these proteins appear when and where they exert their functions during endocytic invagination. We took an alternative approach to align numerous tracks of an endocytic protein (regardless its function) and calculated the average and standard deviation (SD) of displacement over time with high temporal resolution. The spatial displacements of various endocytic proteins transitioned sharply from low SD to high SD in both single color or two-color live-cell imaging. We interpret the transition as vesicle scission. Our approach confirmed previous observations on budding yeast and showed that the longer endocytic invagination in fission yeast elongate faster than in budding yeast.</p><p>We followed the reviewers’ suggestion to look at the scission machinery in fission yeast by examining the dynamics of Hob1-GFP together with Fim1-mCherry, because sequence similarity suggests that spHob1 is the fission yeast homologue of scRvs167, which has been implicated in scission (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Kishimoto et al., 2011). New Figure 5C and 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2 show that spHob1-GFP appears slightly after Fim1 (Figure 5D, dotted line 1) and rapidly reaches its peak intensity (Figure 5D, dotted line 2). The spHob1-GFP intensity begins to drop just before spFim1 reaches its peak intensity (Figure 5D, dotted line 3). The dynamics of Hob1 are consistent with the idea that Hob1 facilitates vesicle scission, and moves away from the cell surface with the retracting endocytic tubule, as observed for Rvs167 in budding yeast (Kaksonen ea al., 2005, Picco et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) An interesting observation is that deletion of the CA domain of the S. pombe myosin-I does not influence the endocytic coat and actin dynamics, whereas deletion of that of N-WASP does.

Subsection “The relative importance of spWsp1 and spMyo1 NPF activity for fission yeast endocytosis” explains that Fim1-mCherry puncta still turn over at the cell cortex in the Wsp1-CA∆ strain, implying that Myo1 alone can facilitate actin polymerization. However, only 8% of Fim1-mCherry puncta move inward in the <italic>Wsp1-CA∆</italic> strain, indicating that endocytosis is severely compromised. Thus, these observations suggest that actin nucleation by Wsp1 CA domain has a non-redundant role in endocytic internalization in fission yeast.

However, two independent live-cell imaging studies observed that Myo5-GFP remains at the cell surface during the lifetime of endocytic patches (Galletta et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2006). In addition, super-resolution microscopy suggested that Myo5-GFP forms a nano-template for actin nucleation at the membrane base (Mund et al., 2018). For these reasons it seems very likely that most if not all type I myosin is localized at the base of invaginated endocytic membranes.
