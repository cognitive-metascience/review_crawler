Previously we used ancestral reconstruction to determine how CMGC group kinase specificity evolved (Howard et al., 2014). In the present study, we reconstructed ancestral kinases to study the evolution of regulation, from the inferred ancestor of CDKs and MAPKs, to modern ERKs. Kinases switched from high to low autophosphorylation activity at the transition to the inferred ancestor of ERKs 1 and 2. Two synergistic amino acid changes were sufficient to induce this change: shortening of the β3-αC loop and mutation of the gatekeeper residue. Restoring these two mutations to their inferred ancestral state led to a loss of dependence of modern ERKs 1 and 2 on the upstream activating kinase MEK in human cells. Our results shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the tight regulation of a kinase that is central in development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>ancestral reconstruction</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>erk</kwd><kwd>extracellular regulated kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002374</institution-id><institution>Vilcek Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sang</surname><given-names>Dajun</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinglay</surname><given-names>Sudarshan</given-names></name><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Liam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA016087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sang</surname><given-names>Dajun</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinglay</surname><given-names>Sudarshan</given-names></name><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Liam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-17-1-0412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiewiora</surname><given-names>Rafal P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chodera</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chodera</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM104047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Hua Jane</given-names></name><name><surname>Turk</surname><given-names>Benjamin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tight regulation of a central developmental kinase cascade evolved through two key mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein kinases regulate most aspects of <italic>Eukaryotic</italic> biology, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. They are one of the largest protein families in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lahiry et al., 2010</xref>); more than 500 kinases in the human genome comprise ~2% of all protein coding genes. Due to their central importance in signaling networks, kinase activity has evolved to be precisely regulated by a myriad of distinct mechanisms. A breakdown in kinase regulation is the underlying cause of many human diseases; in particular, inappropriate kinase activation drives most cancers.</p><p>Kinases have evolved a multitude of mechanisms to control their activation. Some examples such as the requirement for allosteric modulators, regulation by inhibitory interactions, and localization control are highly variable across the kinome. However, the activation of most kinases requires phosphorylation of the activation loop, a conserved structural feature that connects the N and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain. Most serine/threonine kinases and a subset of tyrosine kinases are regulated by phosphorylation of a conserved TxY motif within this loop. This phosphorylation affects both substrate binding and the arrangement of catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolen et al., 2004</xref>), leading to robust regulation of enzyme activity.</p><p>Extensive structural and biochemical studies have afforded insight into the mechanisms of kinase regulation by activation loop phosphorylation. In the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2, several structural elements are important for activity. These include the p+1 binding pocket that binds the substrate peptide proline, the regulatory αC helix, and the L16 loop. Upon phosphorylation of the TxY threonine and tyrosine residues, a number of changes occur. A network of electrostatic contacts with the phospho-threonine and phospho-tyrosine drives a conformation change around the p+1 substrate binding site, enabling substrate binding. The regulatory αC helix rotates inwards, allowing a glutamate on the αC helix (Glu-69) to form a salt bridge with Lysine (Lys-52) on the β3 strand that is crucial for catalytic activity. Extension of the C terminal L16 loop enables rotation of the N- and C-terminal domains, leading to ‘domain closure’, bringing Lys-52 closer to other catalytic residues, such as aspartates in the DFG and HRD motifs. Together, these conformational changes can lead to a 1000-fold increase in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canagarajah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roskoski, 2012</xref>). Similar conformational changes contribute to the regulation of many kinases beyond the MAPK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Some kinases are able to autophosphorylate and thus autoactivate. Multiple mechanisms for autophosphorylation have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beenstock et al., 2016</xref>). Some kinases, for example most receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beenstock et al., 2016</xref>) are autophosphorylated in <italic>trans</italic>, where distinct molecules transfer phosphates to one another. Other kinases autophosphorylate in <italic>cis;</italic> that is the kinase catalyzes an intramolecular transfer of phosphates onto its own TxY. In the latter case, autophosphorylation of dual-specificity tyrosine regulated kinases (DYRK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β(GSK3β) has been proposed to occur during intermediate stages of protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lochhead et al., 2005</xref>). Other mechanisms include binding to allosteric modulators that reorient the activation loop towards catalytic residues (e.g. p38α, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeNicola et al., 2013</xref>) or conformational changes driven by dimerization (e.g. RAF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rajakulendran et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, many other kinases require phosphorylation of the activation loop in <italic>trans</italic> by a distinct upstream kinase. For example, many MAPKs are dependent on phosphorylation by upstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) for their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang and Karin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 exhibit very low autophosphorylation activity as purified proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levin-Salomon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beenstock et al., 2014</xref>), and they manifest high activity in vivo only when they are phosphorylated by the upstream MAPKK, MAP/ERK kinase (MEK). ERK1 and ERK2 mutants have been described that exhibit much higher autophosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emrick et al., 2006</xref>), and one such mutant can drive oncogenic transformation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smorodinsky-Atias et al., 2016</xref>) highlighting the importance of stringent control of ERK phosphorylation.</p><p>In earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howard et al., 2014</xref>), we used ancestral reconstruction methods to study the evolution of the specificity of the CMGC group of kinases, which include cyclin dependent kinase (CDK), MAPK, GSK, and casein kinase (CK). CDKs are major regulators of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan, 2007</xref>) and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher, 2005</xref>). MAPKs are crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses. As part of this study, we observed that an inferred deep ancestor of this group had high basal activity even in the absence of any activating kinase or allosteric activators. This finding was surprising given the tight control of many MAP kinases by upstream activators, and the dependence of CDKs on both cyclin binding and upstream activating kinases. Therefore, to study how suppression of autophosphorylation and thus strong dependence on upstream activating kinases evolved, we decided to investigate the regulatory evolution of the CMGC group, ultimately focusing on the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2.</p><p>Throughout the evolutionary history of MAP kinases, gene duplications and diversifications resulted in multiple paralogs with diverse regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howard et al., 2014</xref>). For example, within the p38 subfamilies, p38β has a much higher basal catalytic activity than p38α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beenstock et al., 2014</xref>) and within the ERK family, ERK7 is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abe et al., 2001</xref>), and the core kinase domain of ERK5 has a much higher autophosphorylation rate, and thus higher basal activity, than ERK1 and ERK2, which are almost completely inactive in the absence of the activating kinase MEK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buschbeck and Ullrich, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Through biochemical analysis of reconstructed kinases, we found that the transition to dependence on MEK occurred between the inferred common ancestor of ERK1, 2 and 5, and that of ERK1 and 2. Through a targeted mutagenesis approach we identified the key evolutionary mutations that mediated this transition. Two changes— mutation of the gatekeeper residue and a single amino acid deletion in the linker loop between the β3 strand and αC helix accounted for this regulatory evolution. Reversal of these inferred evolutionary mutations in modern ERK1 and ERK2 led to full autoactivation in the absence of an upstream activating kinase. Thus, we believe we have identified key steps in the regulatory evolution of the ERK MAPK family.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstruction of the lineage leading to ERK kinases</title><p>To understand how kinase activity evolved, we reconstructed ancestors of the kinases leading to ERK1 and ERK2.

As previously reported, the inferred deep ancestor of the CMGC group contained hallmarks of specificity found along multiple branches of the CMGC phylogenetic tree including +1 proline, −2 proline and −3 arginine preference. The new inferred CDK and MAPK ancestors generated for the current study lost the −3 arginine specificity at the transition to the inferred ancestor of CDK and MAPK (AncCDK.MAPK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). This was most likely due to the mutation of Glu to Ser in the conserved HRDxKPEN motif, previously reported to be a strong determinant of −3 arginine preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). All inferred ancestors had a strong preference for proline at the +1 position including the inferred ancestor of all MAP kinases (AncMAPK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as expected.

We found that all inferred ancestors prior to and including AncERK1-5 had relatively high activity, while AncERK1-2 had low activity, almost comparable to modern ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). One alternative possibility for this decreased phosphorylation of MBP is that kinase specificity changed such that AncERK1-2 does not efficiently recognize the MBP substrate. However, PSPL specificity arrays indicated that there was very little change in specificity from AncERK1-5 to modern ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also assessed the activity of AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2 to a second substrate, ELK1. AncERK1-2 also had had much lower activity towards EL-1 than AncERK1-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>), strongly indicating a change in kinase activity, not specificity. Thus, a transition in kinase activity occurred between AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2. Importantly, AncERK1-2 was activated ~6 fold either by coincubation with MEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or by purification from an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain that coexpressed MEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C and D</xref>), indicating that the decrease in activity was a regulatory evolution event rather than a general problem with kinase reconstruction leading to loss of activity for trivial reasons such as failure to fold correctly. We believe that the modest activation of AncERK1-2 by MEK is due to the high specificity this activating kinase; AncERK1-2 is likely a poor MEK substrate compared to modern ERKs 1 and 2. The decrease in activity of AncERK1-2 was due to both an increase in the Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>M</sub>) and a decrease in k<sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).

This dual phosphorylation causes the N- and C-terminal domains in ERK2 to rotate toward one another, thus organizing the catalytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canagarajah et al., 1997</xref>).

To test the role of the ‘TxY’ motif in the evolution of kinase activity, we first mutated the ‘TxY’ motif to ‘AxF’, thus removing the phosphoacceptor hydroxyl groups, rendering the motif non-phosphorylatable. These mutations greatly reduced the activity of all inferred kinase ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that requirement for ‘TxY’ phosphorylation was an early evolutionary event. Next, we quantified the phosphorylation level of threonine and tyrosine in the ‘TxY’ motif in reconstructed ancestral kinases and ERK1 by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides (LC-MS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with the kinase activity transition, we observed that the level of phosphorylated tyrosine (Tx-pY) was relatively high in deeper inferred ancestors: AncCDK.MAPK (22.9%), AncMAPK (32.3%), AncJPE (48.1%), AncERK (76.3%) and AncERK1-5 (76.0%), and then dropped precipitously at the transition to AncERK1-2 (5.7%), which had levels similar to modern Erk1 (3.8%). Phosphorylation of threonine in the ‘TxY’ motif (pT-xY), followed a similar pattern of higher levels in inferred deep ancestor kinases, including AncCDK.MAPK (35.1%), AncMAPK (7.6%), AncJPE (12.4%) and AncERK (7.3%), and almost undetectable levels in AncERK1-5, AncERK1-2 and modern Erk1. Notably, we also detected di-phosphorylation of the ‘TxY’ motif (pT-x-pY) in the inferred deep ancestor kinases AncCDK.MAPK (6.3%), AncJPE (27.6%) and AncERK (7.9%). These results suggest that autophosphorylation at the ‘TxY’ loop became much less efficient in AncERK1-2, thus leading to dependence on upstream activating kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Shortening of linker loop and mutation of gatekeeper residue led to tight regulation in the ERK1-2 family</title><p>To understand how this regulatory evolution occurred, we next sought to identify the specific mutations underlying the transition in kinase activity that occurred between AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2. First, however, we wished to determine whether the activities of AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2 were robust to uncertainties in ancestral sequence reconstruction. To address this issue, we synthesized alternative inferred ancestors combining all alternate residues with posterior probability &gt;0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>). The inferred ancestors of alternative kinases behaved similarly to the original inferred ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The alternative ancestor Alt.AncERK1-2 had 2.5-fold higher activity than the maximum likelihood AncERK1-2, possibly due to slight differences in the activation segment and the L16 loop. Nevertheless, Alt.AncERK1-2 still has 100-fold lower activity than AncERK1-5 and both of its alternative reconstructions. These results further suggest that the transition of kinase activity occurred between AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2 and that our results are robust to phylogenetic and reconstruction uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanson-Smith et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>With this test, we were confident to compare inferred ancestors in an attempt to identify causal evolutionary mutations. As an initial strategy, we constructed a series of chimeras between AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2. First, we divided the inferred ancestor kinases into three parts (N terminus, middle, and C terminus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), and shuffled these parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, chimera 1–3). One strong possibility was that changes in the flexibility of the activation loop would account for differential TxY autophosphorylation. However, chimeras that swapped the middle domain of the inferred ancestors had no effect on activity. Rather, our initial chimeras indicated that changes in the N-terminus were responsible for most of the difference in the activity of these inferred ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We narrowed the causal variation using two additional chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>, chimera 4 and 5). A key advantage of ancestral reconstruction is that the number of amino acid transitions between inferred ancestors is typically far lower than the number of differences between extant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thornton, 2004</xref>). Therefore, after our chimera analysis there were only two possible changes to assess within the causal fragments, an insertion of an arginine after the 44<sup>th</sup> amino acid (ins44R, AncERK1-2 numbering) and a transition from glutamine to methionine at the 89<sup>th</sup> amino acid (Q89M, AncERK1-2 numbering). Indeed, reverting these amino acids to the inferred ancestral state in AncERK1-2 (referred to as the AncERK1-2-ins44R-Q89M mutant) was sufficient to confer high basal activity to this kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This increased activity is almost as high as ERK1 activated by MEK, or the activated ERK1 mutant suggesting that reversion of these two evolutionary changes to the inferred ancestral state makes AncERK1-2 mostly independent of activating kinases. Adding MEK to the AncERK1-2-ins44R-Q89M does not increase the kinase activity much. Adding MEK to AncERK1-2 increases activity ~6 fold, but this leads to &lt; 10% of the activity of the active mutant. We believe that this inefficiency is due to the known high specificity of MEK for ERK1 and 2. We speculate that MEK doesn not recognize AncERK1-2 as efficiently as ERK1 and 2, accounting for the lower efficiency of activation of AncERK1-2. Conversely, introducing just these two mutations into AncERK1-5 (i.e. deletion of R46 and mutation of M90 to Q) suppressed basal activity to the levels of AncERK1-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and E</xref>). By modeling the AncERK1-2 sequence onto the Erk2 structure (PDB: 1ERK), we mapped the 44R insertion to the loop between the β3 strand and helix αC, and the Q89M mutation to the gatekeeper position at the back of the ATP-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Mutation in the gatekeeper residue has been reported to activate ERK2 in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emrick et al., 2006</xref>), but this mutation was to ALA or GLY, therefore it is interesting that both small residues and the evolutionary mutation to a bulky polar residue activate ERK1. When we combined the loop insertion and Q122M gatekeeper mutation, the double mutant was much more active than either single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, the combination of these two mutations raised ERK1 activity by more than 2 orders of magnitude, almost to the levels of ERK1 after activation with MEK.

Thus, we hypothesized that loop-length rather than precise amino acid identity might explain the increased kinase activity. To test this hypothesis, we inserted and deleted residues along this loop.

To provide further support for an intramolecular mechanism, we measured autophosphorylation rates as a function of ERK1 concentration. <italic>Cis</italic>-autophosphorylation should scale linearly with ERK1 concentration, while <italic>trans</italic>-autophosphorylation should scale as the square of ERK1 concentration. We found the former result to be true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

ERK2-ins55N showed increased flexibility at the glycine rich loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), ERK2-Q103M showed increased flexibility at loop 16 (L16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and the ERK2-ins55N-Q103M double mutant was more flexible at both the glycine rich loop and L16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, each mutation has subtle effects on peptide backbone dynamics and the double mutant combines both of these effects.</p><p>We next investigated the dynamics of the catalytic residues. There are several residues critical for catalysis: K52/71, D147/166 and D165/184 (rat ERK2/human ERK1 numbering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roskoski, 2012</xref>). The salt bridge between the ß3-Lys52 and αC-Glu69 (K52-E69) promotes kinase activity and corresponds to the ‘αC-helix in’ active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roskoski, 2012</xref>), thus the distances between these residues are informative for the expected catalytic rate of the active site. Indeed, the K52-E69 salt bridge was more frequently present in mutants than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Next, we studied other inter-residue distances in the catalytic site, K52-D165 and E69-F166 from the DFG motif. Here, average inter-residue distances were significantly reduced in at least one of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). The ERK2-ins55N and ERK2-Q103M mutants both altered these average distances, and the ERK2-ins55N-Q103M double mutant was roughly the sum of the effects consistent with the additive effect of mutations observed in our experiments. This result is consistent with the idea that the catalytic site of ERK2 can more readily adopt an active conformation when reverted to the inferred ancestral state, thereby increasing the rate of autophosphorylation.</p><p>The gatekeeper residue lies between two conserved non-consecutive structural ‘spines’ of hydrophobic amino acids, the R- and C-spines that connect the two lobes and reorganize upon kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>). We therefore analyzed the organization of the R-spine and C-spine. We did not observe statistically significant differences in distances along the R-spine residues between the WT and mutant simulations. However, there were some changes in C-spine distances. Distributions of these distances are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C–E</xref>. Gatekeeper mutations were previously shown to activate kinases through changes in the R-spine conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azam et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies focused on activation mutations that lead to drug resistance, which are from smaller to larger gatekeeper amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tamborini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azam et al., 2008</xref>), while our mutation is between similarly sized but chemically distinct amino acids (glutamine to methionine). Therefore, this mechanism may not be at play. It is also quite possible that our MD simulations are too short to capture changes in the R-spine.</p><p>Previous MD simulations have shown changes in angles between the N- and C-terminal domains in gatekeeper mutants of ERK2. This domain closure is a key step in kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we studied domain closure by calculating the angle between the C and E helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We found a wider distribution of angles in the ERK2-ins55N and ERK2-ins55N-Q103M mutants compared to the WT, suggesting an increase in inter-domain flexibility. However, a true understanding of the relevance of our mutations to domain closure will require much longer simulations as NMR measurements have shown that these motions occur on the millisecond timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We next took an unbiased approach to identify contacts that were gained or lost by determining a differential contact map between the mutant and wild type kinases for all residue pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In all three mutant simulations, we observed contact changes compared to WT along the activation lip that includes the phosphorylation sites (T183 and Y185). Furthermore, in ERK2-Q103M and ERK2-ins55N-Q103M double mutant simulations, we also observed changes in contacts between the L16 loop (Res.310–336) and αE (Res. 121–141) regions. Additionally, in simulations with the ß3-αC loop insertion mutant (ERK2-ins55N) and the ERK2-double mutant (ERK2-ins55N-Q103M) we observed contact changes between the ß3-αC loop and glycine-rich loop regions (Res. 30–35). We visualized residues that undergo large contact changes on the ERK2 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D–F</xref>). This analysis indicated that these changes are mostly in the activation lip and in regions close to mutation sites in the N-lobe. These results are consistent with the changes in RMSF observed above, and additionally implicate changes in activation loop dynamics as a potential mechanism for increased autoactivation.</p><p>To gain a deeper understanding of the dynamical impacts of mutations, we built Markov state models (MSMs) from a set of 125 highly informative inter-residue distances (see Materials and methods). MSMs help integrate information from multiple simulations to reveal the system’s kinetically distinct clusters of conformations, which are referred to as macrostates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chodera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pande, 2010</xref>). We used MSMs to determine which macrostate populations can be perturbed by mutations. We first built MSMs for ERK2-WT and Q103M systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) and identified three macrostates. We found that the Q103M mutation increased the populations of macrostates A and C, which had high contact disruption along the activation segment. Macrostate A had the highest overall contact disruption among the three states, and to a lesser extent macrostate C showed a pattern of changes in the activation segment similar to macrostate A, but also had increased disruptions along the L16 loop. We then identified four-state MSMs for the ß3-αC loop insertion and double mutant systems (ERK2-ins55N and ERK2-ins55N + Q103M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Comparing the double mutant MSM to ins55N, we found an increase in the population of macrostate D in the ins55N mutant, which had very little change along the L16 loop but featured an alternative, ‘open’, conformation of the ß3-αC loop. These MSMs present a vivid picture of the structural changes caused by evolutionary mutations and further implicate increased flexibility in the activation segment as a potential mechanism for increased activity of mutants.</p><p>Finally, we compared our simulation data to a previously proposed mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emrick et al., 2006</xref>) where gatekeeper mutations were shown to control the accessibility of conformations able to autophosphorylate the activation lip. In all systems, we found a low population of conformations (up to 1.7%) where the Y185 of the ‘TxY’ motif is hydrogen bonded to the active site D147, an interaction required for autophosphorylation. A large displacement of the Y185, which resides in a hydrophobic pocket, 8.3 Å away from D147 in the crystal structure, is required to achieve this contact. We found these conformations sampled in many of our trajectories (e.g. 325 out of the 1,000 WT trajectories). Unexpectedly, the frequency of these conformations is the highest in WT (1.7%) and decreases for the mutants (0.9% for 55N, 0.4% for Q103M, and 0.2% for 55N-Q103M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, which shows only D147-Y185 distances of &lt;4 Å). The top 100 conformations from the ERK2-WT system with the smallest D147-Y185 distance are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>. While demonstrating the structural feasibility of autophosphorylation, these results don’t implicate increased contact frequencies between D147 and Y185 as the mechanism for increased autophosphorylation in our case. We note that our simulations do not include ATP, which could affect these conformational equilibria. We examined additional contacts proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emrick et al., 2006</xref>) to influence the stability of the activation lip: V186-L168, T188-D147 and T188-K149. Of these, only V186-L168 showed significant differences in the distributions of the distances in mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Consistent with the unexpected decreased frequency of conformations with the Y185 rearranged for hydrogen bonding with D147 in our mutants, the population of conformations with the V186-L168 contact perturbed is highest in WT (42%) and decreases for the mutants (24% for 55N, 29% for Q103M, 22% for 55N-Q103M). In light of these results and the earlier observation of contact changes along the activation lip compared to WT, we sought to examine those changes in more detail. We hypothesized that contact changes to Y185 would be a part of any true autophosphorylating conformations. We therefore specifically examined residues that have large changes in contact frequencies with Y185 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). For all three mutants, the same seven residues had absolute mean contact changes larger than 0.05: L168, R192, I196, K201, G202, I207, and Y231. Of those, I207 and Y231 lost contacts with Y185 in all mutants, and R192 gained contacts in all mutants. We hypothesize that these residues might tune the rate of the autophosphorylation. It will be interesting to experimentally test these ideas in the future.</p><p>While these MD simulations were not long enough to observe the full transition to an active kinase conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilburt et al., 2017</xref>), they pave the way for future adaptive and enhanced sampling efforts, and offer hypotheses for further mutations to test experimentally. For now, our MD data primarily support the hypothesis that evolutionary mutations tune the contact frequencies of catalytic residues in the kinase active site. It is likely that additional mechanisms will be important at longer timescales, which warrant further investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Reversal of evolutionary regulatory mutations leads to MEK independent ERK activity in vivo</title><p>Next, we sought to determine whether the evolutionary insertion mutation led to higher ERK1 activity in vivo. We generated lentivirus encoding ERK1-WT or ERK1-ins74N and transduced NIH 3T3 cells with these two alleles. We used an ERK-KTR reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Regot et al., 2014</xref>), as our reporter for ERK kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This reporter contains an ERK docking site and phosphoacceptor sites within nuclear localization and export sites. The reporter is designed such that it is localized in the nucleus when unphosphorylated and then translocates to the cytosol when phosphorylated by ERK. Before imaging, cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor Trametinib to prevent activation by endogenous mechanisms. When we performed time lapse imaging of cells to observe the localization of the ERK1-KTR reporter, we found that the ERK-KTR reporter was mainly localized in the nucleus in ERK1-WT cells, and only a small percentage of cells indicated any ERK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). This confirms that WT-ERK activity was low after inhibition of MEK by Trametinib. In contrast, cells expressing ERK1-ins74N had significantly more ERK-KTR in the cytoplasm.

However, the mechanisms by which this diverse array of regulatory mechanisms evolved from a common ancestor remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the regulatory evolution of the ERK kinases that lie within the CMGC group. Ancestral reconstruction revealed that the ability of these kinases to autophosphorylate at their activation loop sharply decreased at the split between the ERK5 and ERK1-2 kinase subfamilies. While the basal activity of the ERK5 subfamily remained relatively high, the ERK1-2 kinase subfamily became strongly dependent on the upstream activating kinase MEK. We identified two mutations that together account for most of the difference between modern ERK1-2 and ERK5. Strikingly, reversal of these evolutionary mutations in modern ERK1 led to high kinase activity and autophosphorylation independent of the upstream activating kinase MEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mutations in the β3-αC loop are cancer alleles in other kinase families</title><p>It has recently been discovered that changes in the β3-αC loop length of BRAF, EGFR, and HER2, none of which are in the CMGC group of kinases, also led to activation of these kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foster et al., 2016</xref>). In these cases, the activating mutations shorten the loop rather than lengthen it. In these cases, the shortened loop may pull in the αC helix favoring the ‘αC in’ conformation. It is interesting that ERK has the opposite behavior. What is generally clear is that the length of the β3-αC loop is a crucial determinant of basal kinase activity.</p><p>In previous studies on the evolution of specificity within the CMGC kinase group, we found that an inferred ancestral DFG +1 mutation was also sampled in cancer mutations throughout the kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howard et al., 2014</xref>), therefore it is possible that our evolutionary studies within the CMGC group of kinases may be more generally reflected throughout the kinome. The decreasing confidence in reconstructions with evolutionary distance makes it impossible to reconstruct an ur-kinase but features of this progenitor are certain to be retained across every kinase group. Thus, we speculate that β3-αC loop length was has been a critical modulator of basal kinase activity throughout kinase evolution.</p><p>Why, then, is ERK not a major oncogene? Oncogenic activation mutations in upstream kinases BRAF, MEK, EGFR and HER2 are frequently observed in cancer. Indeed, the Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is one of the most important signaling axes in oncogenesis. One possibility is that the upstream regulators have multiple targets in addition to ERK, and indeed this is certainly the case for Ras. Another intriguing possibility is that the dynamical properties of ERK signaling are crucial for its role in oncogenesis. ERK is not simply an ON/OFF switch, but rather oscillates or adapts in various contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>). It will be interesting to leverage our mutants and investigate more recent inferred ancestral states that may have distinct dynamical properties to investigate this latter possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolutionary mutations synergize</title><p>We found that the evolutionary changes that place ERKs 1 and 2 under stringent regulation synergize in their effects. One change, a polar substitution in the ‘gatekeeper’ residue of the active site has been previously described as an activating mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emrick et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azam et al., 2008</xref>). Evolution at the gatekeeper after AncERK1-5 proceeded along two divergent paths. The permissive methionine residue was retained along the branch that led to the modern ERK5 family, which also has high rates of autophosphorylation. The acquisition of a large C-terminal domain is thought to be an alternative source of regulation for ERK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buschbeck and Ullrich, 2005</xref>). In ERK1-2 the gatekeeper was shifted to glutamine, a more restrictive state for autoactivation.</p><p>The second evolutionary change that we implicated in the decrease in autophosphorylation at the transition to AncERK1-2, a change in loop length between the β3 strand and αC helix, has not been reported before. The inferred deeper CMGC ancestors and the modern ERK kinases that have higher basal activity, ERK5 and ERK7, all had one extra amino acid in this loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The reversal of the shortening of this loop in AncERK1-2 and in modern ERK1 and ERK2 drastically increased kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Each of these evolutionary changes confers an order of magnitude change in basal activity, and when combined, these two mutations increase the basal activity of ERKs 1 and 2 by more than two orders of magnitude. This additive, relatively independent effect of the two mutations may have provided evolutionary pathways that could have both conferred a selective advantage to intermediates and allowed for evolution towards a tightly controlled system without major fitness barriers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Structural dynamics and control of kinase activity</title><p>Our molecular dynamics simulations indicated that reversal of the inferred evolutionary mutations (i.e. reversion to a more active inferred ancestral state) had two clear effects on the rapid timescale (ns - μs) dynamics of ERK2. First, there was increased flexibility in the glycine rich loop and loop 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). The reorganization of loop 16 is important in the domain closure of kinases, which is an intrinsic part of the conformational shift to an active state. This observation is consistent with earlier MD simulations that showed that gatekeeper mutations can increase domain closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2011</xref>). However, our simulations are too short to directly observe domain closure. Markov State Models also suggested increased dynamics of the activation segment. The most compelling hypothesis suggested by our MD simulations was that the active site is more likely to attain a productive conformation in mutants, as indicated by more frequent formation of the K52-E69 salt-bridge in mutants than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Robust evolution in the CMGC kinase group</title><p>Previous ancestral reconstruction studies have highlighted the importance of epistasis in the diversification of function. For example, changes in the specificity of hormone-receptor ligand binding domains required stabilizing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thornton et al., 2003</xref>) prior to the advent of mutations that alter specificity, and the acquisition of novel mutations after acquisition of a new function made it difficult to revert to the inferred ancestral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>). In our previous study on the evolution of kinase specificity, we found no requirement for stabilizing mutations – robust activity was maintained as specificity changed. In the current study, we find that the reversion of a single or double evolutionary mutation is also well tolerated and that we can revert modern ERK1 and ERK2 to an inferred ancestral state of high basal activity - there is not a strong &quot;evolutionary ratchet&quot;. Together these observations suggest that kinases are quite tolerant of mutations, which perhaps explains their frequent dysregulation in diseases like cancer. The diversification of kinase specificity and regulation may also be underpinned by this surprising tolerance of a dynamic domain to mutations that drive neofunctionalization. Perhaps this ‘evolvability’ explains the prevalence of kinases as regulatory enzymes in <italic>Eukaryotes</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

We constrained all covalent bonds involving hydrogen and did not remove the center of mass motion since this was unnecessary given the use of a Langevin integrator.</p><p>Next, we packaged these simulations as seeds with OpenMM 6.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eastman et al., 2013</xref>) to initiate massively parallel distributed MD simulations (production simulations) on Folding@home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shirts and Pande, 2000</xref>). For all simulations, we used the parameter files included in the OpenMM 7.2 distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eastman et al., 2017</xref>) for the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>) and the TIP3P rigid water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>). For NaCl, we used the adapted Aqvist (Na<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aqvist, 1990</xref>) and Smith and Dang (Cl<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Dang, 1994</xref>) parameters. For production simulations, we used the same Langevin integrator as the NpT equilibration described above, except that to provide realistic heat exchange with a thermal bath while minimally perturbing dynamics, we set the Langevin collision rate to one ps<sup>−1</sup>. In total, we generated 1000 independent MD simulations on Folding@home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shirts and Pande, 2000</xref>) for each system, which totaled 4,000 MD simulations, of which 3999 successfully collected data. We propagated the simulations until a total of at least 500 μs of simulation time for each system had been collected, resulting in the grand total of 2.05 ms of simulation time and 4,104,841 frames (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> for trajectory length distribution histogram). The average trajectory length was 513 ns. This amount of simulation time corresponded to ~240 GPU-years on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 processor. To use conformational snapshots (frames) in subsequent analyses, we stored them at intervals of 0.5 ns/frame.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Calculation of RMSFs</title><p>To study the flexibility of the kinase, we calculated root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) for each trajectory using NumPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliphant, 2006</xref>). These calculations measure the amplitude of residue Cα atom motions during MD simulations. To allow for further relaxation from the initial equilibrated structures, we did not use the first 50 ns of each trajectory. We used Seaborn (mwaskom/seaborn) with Matplotlib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunter, 2007</xref>) to plot the RMSF means over all trajectories, 95% confidence intervals of the means, and differences between the wild type and mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Calculation of domain closure</title><p>To study the motion between N and C domains we calculated the domain closure as the angle between the helices C and E. We did a least squares fit of a vector ('helix axis') for each helix to the positions of the carbonyl C and O atoms, and then recorded the angle between those vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). To allow for further relaxation from the initial equilibrated structures, we did not use the first 50 ns of each trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Calculation of residue-residue distances</title><p>To understand the mutation-induced changes in the interactions between residues that are important for activity and/or along the regulatory and catalytic spines, we calculated the closest heavy atom residue-residue distances using all frames using MDTraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGibbon et al., 2015</xref>) for each trajectory. Again, we did not use the first 50 ns of each trajectory. Specifically, in ERK2, we calculated the residue-residue distances between: 1) Catalytic sites (E69-F166, K52-E69, D165-K52) 2) Regulatory spine (I84-L73, L73-F166, F166-H145, H145-D208) and 3) Catalytic spine (V37-A50, A50-L154, L153-L155, L153-M106, L155-M106, M106-I215, I215-M219). To determine whether the probability distributions of the distances were significantly altered due to mutation, we performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test with SciPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 2001</xref>) using the K-S statistic cutoff of 0.1. We plot the probability distributions of distances where at least one of the mutants showed difference from that of the WT using Seaborn with Matplotlib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunter, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>). Analogically, to understand the mutation-induced changes in the interactions between residues proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emrick et al., 2006</xref>) to be important in controlling accessibility of conformations able to autophosphorylate the activation lip, we calculated the following closest heavy atom residue-residue distances: V186-L168, T188-D147, T188-K149, Y185-D147.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Calculation of contact maps</title><p>We calculated the closest heavy atom residue-residue distances for all pairs of residues for each trajectory using MDTraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGibbon et al., 2015</xref>), converted to binary contact maps using a contact cutoff of 4 Å, and averaged over all frames of the trajectory using NumPy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliphant, 2006</xref>). The first 50 ns of each trajectory were not used to allow for further relaxation from the initial equilibrated structures. The contact maps for all trajectories of a given system were averaged. The wild type contact maps were subtracted from the mutant contact maps to generate differential contact maps for further annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Construction of Markov state models (MSMs)</title><p>We trained the XGBoost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Guestrin, 2016</xref>) gradient boosted decision tree algorithm on the per-trajectory mean binary contacts to classify the origin of a trajectory from the four protein systems. Following an established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2018</xref>) using an iterative exclusion principle, we trained and cross-validated (2/3 of the dataset were used for training, and 1/3 for testing) the model, then removed the contact feature with the highest importance to classification and repeated the procedure with remaining features. This was continued until the classification accuracy dropped below 90%, resulting in 125 top contact features. The distances corresponding to those contacts were calculated and used as features for Markov state models (MSMs). All modeling was performed using PyEMMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scherer et al., 2015</xref>). First, we commute-mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noé et al., 2016</xref>) and reduced the dimensionality of the data using time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>), keeping 95% of the kinetic variance, resulting in X tICs. The data were then clustered into 100 microstates using k-means, to partition the data into a minimal number of states sufficient for reasonable description of the dynamics, while avoiding overfitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Husic et al., 2016</xref>). There was negligible overlap in state space between WT/Q103M and the insertion containing 55N/55N-Q103M – the former occupied 30 microstates and the latter occupied 71 microstates, with only one microstate in common, likely to be due to noise. We hence built two separate MSMs – one for WT and Q103M combined, the other for 55N and 55N-Q103M combined. The MSMs were built from two different systems so that we could find a common definition of macrostates, under the assumption that the Q103M mutation causes changes to the populations of macrostates but not their metastability. We assessed the implied timescales of the MSMs, and found approximate convergence at 100 ns lag time. The top timescales were 0.47 µs and 1.81 µs for the WT/Q103M and 55N/55N-Q103M MSMs, respectively. We sought to coarse-grain the MSMs into less than five macrostates for easy interpretability, and we chose their number so that the sum of population differences between WT and Q103M, or 55N and 55N-Q103M was maximized for best interpretability of differences caused by the mutation. This resulted in 3 and 4 macrostates for the WT/Q103M and 55N/55N-Q103M MSMs, respectively. The coarse graining was performed using PCCA++. The MSMs were validated with Chapman-Kolmogorov (C-K) tests using those macrostate definitions. To calculate the populations of the macrostates in each individual system, four separate MSMs were also built. The choice of the lag time and model fidelity were again evaluated with implied timescales and C-K tests. Finally, the macrostate populations were calculated by weighted sum over microstate populations in each of the four individual MSMs, using the PCCA ++fuzzy memberships of microstates to macrostates from the 2 MSMs built with combined systems as weights. We randomly drew 100 samples from the dataset for each macrostate and calculated their mean contact maps. As a reference, we calculated the average contact map for WT weighted by macrostate populations, and subtracted it from the mutant macrostate contact maps to generate differential contact maps for further annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title>Data and code accessibility</title><p>The molecular dynamics simulation data is available via the Open Science Framework at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/dp4cb/">https://osf.io/dp4cb/.</ext-link></p><p>The code used to analyze the data is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/choderalab/ERK-ancestral-materials">https://github.com/choderalab/ERK-ancestral-materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wiewiora, 2019</xref>; copy archived at </ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ERK-ancestral-materials">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ERK-ancestral-materials</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ancestral reconstruction of the ERK1 and ERK2 lineage</title><p>We identified orthologs of human ERK1, ERK2, ERK5 and ERK7 using a protein BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) search against the genomes of a diverse set of eukaryotes.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor and the Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Dorothee Kern (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper, Sang et al. use ancestral reconstruction to study the evolution of MAP kinase regulation. The authors analyzed the specificity and activity of several kinases that represent common ancestors of major kinase families within the CMGC group. Interestingly, they found that the dependence on upstream MAPKK phosphorylation occurred at the transition between the common ancestor of the ERK 1/2/5 kinases (AncERK1-5) and the common ancestor of ERK 1/2 (AncERK1-2). Specifically, the authors present convincing data that a two amino acid change late in evolution between the ancestor of ERK5 and ERK1 and 2 toward ERK1-2 caused a large decrease in autophosphorylation rate, and autophosphorylation was replaced by MEK phosphorylation. This is a beautiful result!</p><p>Overall, the study is well designed and presented, and the results will be of high interest to investigators studying kinase regulation.</p><p>The manuscript builds upon the authors' previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper, which described the divergence of substrate specificity in related kinases using similar approaches, and thus warrants publication as an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance after revision.</p><p>Major issues that must be addressed, with additional experiments as necessary:</p><p>Although this is broken down into separate points, 1 to 6 below, all of these issues are related to putting the activities of the relevant kinases on a more rigorous footing. We ask that a substantial response be prepared for these questions, but the authors should judge whether particular experiments can be done in a realistic timeframe or not. Note that these questions are important, so a simple response that none of the experiments can be done in a timely fashion will not be deemed a satisfactory response.</p><p>1) The authors use MBP phosphorylation as readout for intrinsic activity, but as in their previous paper, they show that each ancestral kinase has a slightly different substrate specificity. Is it possible that the differences observed for MBP phosphorylation are due to difference in sequence specificity, rather than intrinsic activity?</p><p>2) In this assay, does MEK have any significant activity toward MBP? This should be measured as a control.</p><p>3) The activity measurements done in the paper are endpoint assays of myelin basic protein phosphorylation. For at least the key proteins (ERK1, AncERK1-5, AncERK1-2), the authors should carry out kinetic experiments. This would allow them to determine whether the effects are driven by changes in k<sub>cat</sub>, K<sub>M</sub>, or a combination.</p><p>4) What are the phosphorylation states of each protein prior to the MBP phosphorylation reactions? It would be important to compare the activities of all proteins for the same phosphorylation states (nonphosphorylated versus doubly phosphorylated proteins). The activity data presented in Figure 1B represent the results of different mixtures of non- and phosphorylated kinases according to Figure 2B and C.</p><p>For this, the quantification of phosphorylation for all samples need to be measured first, and then activity data collected for clean species (in Figure 2B and C, only a subset of proteins were characterized). Particularly AncERC1-5and AncRC1-2 are missing in respect to analysis of differential phosphorylation rates, the crucial proteins where the switch seem to happen in evolution.</p><p>5) A distinction should be made throughout the manuscript between &quot;intrinsic activity&quot; and regulation by activation loop auto-phosphorylation. Differences in &quot;intrinsic activities&quot; would ideally be assessed by comparing the enzymatic activities of all kinases in the same phosphorylation states. In other words, how active are each of the unphosphorylated kinases, and how active are those same kinases after activation loop phosphorylation? What the authors are measuring in the beginning of the Results section, and in Figure 1B, appears to be the consequence of a difference in the ability to auto-phosphorylate and thus auto-activate, not necessarily a difference in intrinsic activity.</p><p>6) Related to these points, it would be informative to see raw data (phosphorimages) from the MBP phosphorylation reactions in Figure 1B as a figure supplement, rather than just a normalized quantification of endpoint intensities.</p><p>7) Finally, we ask that the amino acid sequences of all proteins (modern and resurrected) be included in the supplementary materials, and it would be of value to give the number of substitutions in the text. The full tree used for ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), including the species, needs to be included for reproducibility for the field. A supplementary figure that shows the probabilities of the nodes, and information of the posterior probabilities for the full sequences is essential to evaluate ASR.</p><p>Other important issues that require response:</p><p>1) The authors should avoid language that implies that the ancestral protein sequence is actually known. A sophisticated reader will understand what is meant, but we are concerned that the way that much of the paper is written a strong impression is given that the ancestral sequence is actually synthesized. This is not just a semantic point, because it may turn out that errors in the sequence reconstruction have led to misleading results. We do not consider this point to invalidate the conclusions of this study, but we ask that the language used to describe the &quot;ancestral&quot; sequences be changed throughout the manuscript. A few comments, given below, should help explain what we mean.</p><p>The method of ancestral sequence reconstruction is a powerful approach to dissect molecular differences between close-related biomolecules. However, the use of the dramatic term &quot;resurrection&quot; should be avoided throughout this manuscript, as it implies that we have explicit knowledge of the true protein sequences found in ancestral organisms, which is then &quot;resurrected&quot;. The more common term, &quot;reconstruction&quot;, is more appropriate, as it indicates that a sequence model of a plausible ancestral protein is being generated using the best available evidence. An example of a statement that implies that the ancestor is truly known, and that the authors should avoid is the following:</p><p>&quot;As part of this study, we observed that a deep ancestor of this group had relatively high intrinsic activity even in the absence of any activating kinase of or allosteric activators.&quot;</p><p>In the beginning of the main section of the paper, the authors use the following phraseology, which correctly captures the inherent uncertainty in the &quot;resurrected&quot; sequences: &quot;We synthesized the coding sequences for these inferred ancestors&quot;.</p><p>2) The manuscript is focused on the specific late evolution between ERK5 and ERK 1 and 2, and there is no information about the evolution of regulation towards CDKs, MAPKs, <italic>JNK</italic>, p38. Therefore the Introduction, Abstract and title should be modified to reflect the data from this manuscript (for instance: &quot;Ancestral resurrection reveals mechanism of kinase regulatory evolution of ERK&quot;).</p><p>3) To enlighten the reader about the evolutionary trajectory, key information to add would be how modern ERK5, ERK 7 that branch off the ancestors used in this study are behaving in respect to activities of their nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated activation loop states towards substrates, and their ability to autophosphorylate.</p><p>4) What is the explanation of a much higher activity of AncERK1-2 with the two mutations in the presence of MEK relative to AncERK1-2 in the presence of MEK? Could the authors also include the data for the reverse experiment, AncERK1-5 M89Q 44Rdel, both in the absence and presence of MEK, in Figure 3?</p><p>5) 300 ns trajectories are very short MD simulations, and it is quite unlikely that refolding of the L16 loop coupled to domain closure is on that time scale. NMR data for ERK has suggested that these processes occur on the millisecond time-scale. Thus, the MD simulations are not convincing due to the discrepancy in time scale between the suggested conformational changes and the length of the simulations, and rather weaken the manuscript than strengthen it. The authors should consider carefully what information is contributed by the MD simulations, and then describe that with appropriate cautionary notes. Alternatively, remove the MD simulations from the manuscript.</p><p>Should the MD simulations be retained, the authors should clarify what atoms are being used to measure the distances between residues in the analyses of MD simulations. In particular, for salt bridges, as in the one analyzed in Figures 5C, F, it would be most informative to look at distances between terminal or near-terminal atoms of the side chains (e.g. the terminal nitrogen of the lysine sidechain and the δ carbon or one of the oxygens of the glutamate residue).</p><p>6) The figures could be better arranged and assembled, it is hard to jump back and forth between gels and activity figures. Could all data be presented in a quantitative format (activity towards MBP and autophosphorylation)?</p><p>7) The authors should include an LC/MS quantification of TEY motif phosphorylation for AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2 (i.e., a similar analysis as was done in Figure 2C).</p><p>8) Figure 4E does not conclusively establish the mechanism of autophosphorylation; His6-ERK1 ins74N could still be undergoing intermolecular (trans) autophosphorylation. This point would need to be established by kinetic experiments, e.g. by measuring the concentration dependence of autophosphorylation.</p><p>9) Figure 6D: the authors should present a quantification of the Western blots (the ratio of phosphorylated ERK1 to total ERK1).</p><p>10) The activation loops of the ancestral kinases differ in length and sequence. Notably, the ancestral CDK.MAPK kinase has a -3 Arg residue, for which this kinase still has some residual preference. If canonical sequence-specificity is not relevant because of a cis-autophosphorylation mechanism, it is still worth noting that the sequence of the activation loop could affect activation loop dynamics. The authors should discuss how the composition of activation loop itself might impact their findings. This is somewhat addressed by the chimera experiments but would still be worth mentioning.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Ancestral reconstruction reveals mechanisms of ERK regulatory evolution&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers. The manuscript is now, in principle, suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but the reviewers have identified some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Please use your best judgement in revising the manuscript with reference to these points, and we will make a final decision as quickly as possible. When submitting the revised manuscript, please provide a point-by-point response to the review comments. Also, please add figure numbers to each individual figure in the submitted manuscript, and include page numbering on each page of the manuscript – the lack of such numbering introduced an element of confusion in the review of the previous manuscript.</p><p>The premise of this study, that ancestral sequence reconstruction can be used to identify molecular mechanisms by which kinase regulation evolved, is quite intriguing. The authors do a nice job of exploring this premise within the MAP kinase family. The results are novel and of broad interest to the kinase field. Furthermore, the authors have adequately addressed most of the concerns raised after the original submission, although a few remaining points require attention before acceptance.</p><p>1) A major issue is that for AncERK, AncJPE, AncMAPK, AncCDK.MAPK (which are evolutionary further from the modern proteins), still no posterior probabilities are provided. They need to be shown, as previously asked by the review. In addition, no experiments were performed to test for their phosphorylation status, and no experiments were done on their modern counterparts. Only activity was measured for these ancestors (Figure 1A), but their relation in respect to modern CDK, MAPK, <italic>JNK</italic>, p38 is not discussed either in the manuscript. Without the proper analysis on those ancestors the authors may wish to remove them and to keep the focus on the ERK ancestors. The latter is the story of this manuscript, and this part is interesting and convincing.</p><p>2) The manuscript still does not correctly describe the quantification of the percentages of non-phosphorylated, single and double phosphorylated (TxY motif) proteins used in the activity studies. Figure 2—figure supplement 1B is provided, but one cannot follow what is exactly shown, and how these data can be used for quantification of phosphorylation. In the text it is described as &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; phosphorylation. Since differences in autophosphorylation is the center of the findings of this manuscript, this needs to be quantified accurately. Are these full-length proteins, or peptides shown in this figure, and the results of what kind of experiment are shown? Even ERK 1 appear to have some phosphorylation. What does &quot;modified TxY &quot; mean?</p><p>3) The part of the manuscript pertaining to Point No. 4 in the &quot;Other Important Points&quot; in the original review, still needs further clarification in the manuscript. If this result is puzzling and currently cannot be explained unambiguously with a model, it is important to articulate this for the reader.</p><p>4) The MD simulations are done on ERK2 (Figure 5), but all the experiments in the manuscript are performed on ERK1 (Figure 4). Why is this?</p><p>There is difficulty in seeing how the MD figures provided now help explain why the mutants of ERK1 autophosphorylate the TxY motive in cis much more efficiently than wtERK1. In Figure 5 all proteins have a bimodal distribution for the plotted distances (which are slightly altered). If one of these two substates is interpreted to be the active conformation, one would not expect the experimental result of a big difference in phosphorylation state between these proteins. The authors correctly note that there is no difference I domain closure either. These points should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38805.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major issues that must be addressed, with additional experiments as necessary:</p><p>Although this is broken down into separate points, 1 to 6 below, all of these issues are related to putting the activities of the relevant kinases on a more rigorous footing.

To check this possibility more carefully, we added two experiments. First, we expanded our specificity arrays to include AncERK1-5 (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). There is not much change in specificity between AncERK1-5 and ERK2. We were unable to get good specificity array data for AncERK1-2 due to low activity. However, we believe it unlikely that a major specificity change would occur from AncERK1-5 to AncERK1-2 and then back again from AncERK1-2 to ERK2. Nevertheless, we also checked the relative activities of AncERK1-5 and AncERK1-2 with a second substrate, ELK1: see the new Figure 1—figure supplements 4A and 4B. We see the same drop in activity from AncERK1-5 to AncERK1-2 with this second substrate. Taken together, we are confident that our results indicate changes in activity without a major contribution from specificity changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In this assay, does MEK have any significant activity toward MBP? This should be measured as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested this possibility and found that MEK has negligible toward MBP (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). MEK is known to be highly specific for ERK, so we were happy to see this result. To further confirm that MEK can activate AncERK1-2, we co-expressed MEK and AncERK1-2, purified the ancestor away from MEK and found that this approach also led to increased AncERK1-2 activity (Figure 1—figure supplement 4C and 4D). Together, these experiments reinforce the conclusion that MEK can activate AncERK1-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The activity measurements done in the paper are endpoint assays of myelin basic protein phosphorylation.

Interestingly, the values for AncERK1-2 look very similar to reported values of unphosphorylated ERK2 and the values for AncERK1-5 look very similar to phosphorylated ERK2 (Prowse and Lew, JBC, 2000). We have added these data to a new Figure 1D.</p><p>Prowse, C.N., and Lew, J. (2001). Mechanism of Activation of ERK2 by Dual Phosphorylation.

We have added experiments to address this issue. Adding MEK to the AncERK1-2 Q89M ins44R doesn’t increase the kinase activity much. Adding MEK to AncERK1-2 increases activity ~6 fold, but this leads to &lt; 10% of the activity of the active mutant. We believe that this inefficiency is due to the known high specificity of MEK for ERK1 and 2. We speculate that MEK doesn’t recognize AncERK1-2 as efficiently, accounting for the lower efficiency of activation of AncERK1-2.</p><p>We tried experiments adding MEK to AncERK1-5 (Figure 3—figure supplement 5) and saw only a slight potentiation. We also added MEK to AncERK1-5 M89Q del44R and again saw only an ~2-fold increase in activity. It is likely that AncERK1-5 is an even worse substrate for MEK than AncERK1-2. We have added these experiments to Figure 3—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) 300 ns trajectories are very short MD simulations, and it is quite unlikely that refolding of the L16 loop coupled to domain closure is on that time scale.

We performed extensive analyses of multiple (1,000) long MD simulations per sequence, generating ~500 microseconds aggregate simulation data for each sequence, and compared the WT and mutants. In total, we generated and analyzed a total of ~ 2 ms of aggregate simulation data.</p><p>We did not observe a sufficient number of very slow conformational rearrangements (e.g. DFG flips or large-scale domain motion) to be able to construct a Markov state model of the complete conformational dynamics. Therefore, we have taken care not to make such claims in the manuscript. However, this new far larger simulation dataset (&gt; 3 orders of magnitude more than the previous experiment) is consistent with the leading edge of what has been done for biomolecular simulations of kinases, e.g., compare to the Scientific Reports paper from Sultan and Pande where they have 1.7 ms aggregate from the simulation of two kinase sequences (we have ~ 2 ms for 4 sequences):</p><p>Sultan, M.M., Denny, R.A., Unwalla, R., Lovering, F., and Pande, V.S. (2017). Millisecond dynamics of BTK reveal kinome-wide conformational plasticity within the apo kinase domain. Sci Rep <italic>7</italic>, 15604.</p><p>We are happy to report that the more active configuration of catalytic residues is maintained in these much more extensive data (Figure 5D-F). We can also clearly see synergy between the two mutations. Furthermore, each mutation gives increased flexibility at two points in the kinase (Figure A-C). While we can’t comment on domain closure and have therefore removed this language, we do see increased variance in domain angles (Figure 5G). These last data are presented with strong caveats. We believe these data provide starting points for future biochemical and simulation work and therefore are valuable to the study.</p><p>These new data were obtained in collaboration with John Chodera and Rafal Wiewiora at MSKCC, therefore they are now included as co-authors on the study. They have seen and approved the manuscript and are in agreement with their placement in the author list. They collaborated with Myvizhi Selvan, a new postdoc in the lab of Zeynep Gumus, therefore she is now added as an author.

Only activity was measured for these ancestors (Figure 1A), but their relation in respect to modern CDK, MAPK, JNK, p38 is not discussed either in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this discussion (subsection “Reconstruction of the lineage leading to ERK kinases”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without the proper analysis on those ancestors the authors may wish to remove them and to keep the focus on the ERK ancestors. The latter is the story of this manuscript, and this part is interesting and convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss the regulation of p38, ERK1-2 and CDKs in the Introduction as well as the outgroups DYRK and GSK groups of kinases.</p><p>We have added the posterior probabilities for all of these ancestors (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We have also performed extensive additional mass spectrometry and have analyzed the phosphorylation status and added these results (new Figure 2C). Therefore, we have kept the deeper ancestors in the paper (additionally the specificity analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 is valuable for future studies on the evolution of kinase specificity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript still does not correctly describe the quantification of the percentages of non-phosphorylated, single and double phosphorylated (TxY motif) proteins used in the activity studies. Figure 2—figure supplement 1B is provided, but one cannot follow what is exactly shown, and how these data can be used for quantification of phosphorylation. In the text it is described as &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; phosphorylation. Since differences in autophosphorylation is the center of the findings of this manuscript, this needs to be quantified accurately. Are these full-length proteins, or peptides shown in this figure, and the results of what kind of experiment are shown? Even ERK 1 appear to have some phosphorylation. What does &quot;modified TxY &quot; mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, these data were quite unclear before. We quantified tryptic peptides in this analysis. We have updated the Materials and methods section and manuscript to clarify these points (subsection “The higher basal activity of deep inferred ancestors is due to autophosphorylation of the TxY motif”, Figure 2 legend and Materials and methods). We have also reanalyzed all of our data and presented the fraction of pT-E-Y, T-E-pY, and pT-E-pY (e.g. where pT is phosphothreonine) for all experiments. We include the precise sequences and modifications of all peptides in Source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The part of the manuscript pertaining to Point No. 4 in the &quot;Other Important Points&quot; in the original review, still needs further clarification in the manuscript. If this result is puzzling and currently cannot be explained unambiguously with a model, it is important to articulate this for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>The original question was: 4. What is the explanation of a much higher activity of AncERK1-2 with the two mutations in the presence of MEK relative to AncERK1-2 in the presence of MEK? Could the authors also include the data for the reverse experiment, AncERK1-5 M89Q 44Rdel, both in the absence and presence of MEK, in Figure 3?</p><p>Our reply was: This is a good question. We have added experiments to address this issue. Adding MEK to the AncERK1-2 Q89M ins44R doesn’t increase the kinase activity much. Adding MEK to AncERK1-2 increases activity ~6 fold, but this leads to &lt; 10% of the activity of the active mutant. We believe that this inefficiency is due to the known high specificity of MEK for ERK1 and 2. We speculate that MEK doesn’t recognize AncERK1-2 as efficiently, accounting for the lower efficiency of activation of AncERK1-2.</p><p>We tried experiments adding MEK to AncERK1-5 (Figure 3—figure supplement 5) and saw only a slight potentiation. We also added MEK to AncERK1-5 M89Q del44R and again saw only an ~2-fold increase in activity. It is likely that AncERK1-5 is an even worse substrate for MEK than AncERK1-2. We have added these experiments to Figure 3—figure supplement 5. We have now added this discussion to the subsection “Shortening of linker loop and mutation of gatekeeper residue led to tight regulation in the ERK1-2 family”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The MD simulations are done on ERK2 (Figure 5), but all the experiments in the manuscript are performed on ERK1 (Figure 4). Why is this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is because we have crystal structures of unphosphorylated ERK2 but not of ERK1. We chose to focus our analysis on unphosphorylated kinase as we decided the initial autophosphorylation would be most relevant. Furthermore, there was previous MD simulation work and mechanistic suggestions on ERK2 autophosphorylation (Barr, et al., 2011 and Emrick, et al., 2006), hence we decided it would be most valuable to extend this research direction on the same system.</p><p>We have performed biochemical experiments with ERK2 and obtain similar results as with ERK1, i.e. the same gatekeeper and insertion mutations lead to increased activity due to higher basal phosphorylation. Therefore, we believe that results that we obtain with the ERK2 structure will be relevant to both ERK1 and ERK2. We have added the ERK2 experiments to Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We have also now explained our reasoning in the manuscript (subsection “Molecular dynamics simulations reveal increased flexibility at the glycine rich loop and loop 16, and a higher probability of an active organization of catalytic residues in mutant kinases”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is difficulty in seeing how the MD figures provided now help explain why the mutants of ERK1 autophosphorylate the TxY motive in cis much more efficiently than wtERK1. In Figure 5 all proteins have a bimodal distribution for the plotted distances (which are slightly altered). If one of these two substates is interpreted to be the active conformation, one would not expect the experimental result of a big difference in phosphorylation state between these proteins. The authors correctly note that there is no difference I domain closure either. These points should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the MD simulations to explore some of the structural changes influenced by the mutants and suggest hypotheses for further mutational studies. While these simulations were extensive and long (2.05 ms in aggregate from 4,000 MD simulations for four systems), they were still not long enough to sample and capture some of the conformational changes that occur on a millisecond scale, such as domain closure. Hence, the data clearly do not describe the true (global) equilibria of the systems, rather it is informative about the neighborhood (local equilibrium) of the inactive conformation. While not offering definitive explanations as to the full autophosphorylation activation pathway, the data show the relaxation processes of the mutated systems that would eventually lead to the global equilibrium. Hence, it is not surprising that we observe only small changes to the conformational ensembles at these limited timescales, and with more sampling we expect the differences to keep increasing until we have described the full activation mechanism leading to the experimental magnitude of change in activity. However, knowledge of the initial stages of this relaxation process towards the global equilibrium, particularly the patterns of residue-residue contact disruptions, would provide enough information to make informed hypotheses about mutations that can further tweak the behavior of the protein.</p><p>To maximize the understanding of the structural changes seen in the current datasets, we have now developed Markov state models (MSM) trained on the inter-residue distances corresponding to contacts most relevant to distinguishing the conformational ensembles of the four protein systems from each other. MSMs help integrate information from multiple simulations to reveal the system’s kinetically distinct macrostates, whose populations can be perturbed by mutations. The MSMs revealed how different structural changes caused by the mutants are kinetically coupled with each other. Again, these insights will allow for generation of further mutational hypotheses to further study structural aspects of the autophosphorylation activation process.</p><p>In addition to the mutants promoting formation of active-like conformations, cis-autophosphorylation requires that the phosphorylation sites be able to intramolecularly reach the active site – a mechanism of activation lip destabilization leading to that has been previously proposed (Emrick et al., 2006). We have analyzed our data according to this proposed mechanism, and found the presence of small populations of conformations where the phosphorylation site tyrosine can access the active site aspartate in all systems. We did not observe other changes proposed by the mechanism, instead we analyzed the patterns of contact changes in our simulations at the activation lip and indicate crucial residues for future mutational studies.</p><p>We have updated the text to indicate the observations and limitations of our current MD simulation. The results of these simulations will be used in future studies as seeds for adaptive sampling to generate MSMs describing all relevant activation steps involved, and to generate first guesses at reaction coordinates for enhanced sampling. We note that a description of the full activation mechanism would be a significant research project in itself, and is far outside the scope of this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
