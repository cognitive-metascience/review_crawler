Physiologically, native α-synuclein promotes presynaptic SNARE-complex assembly, but its molecular mechanism of action remains unknown. Here, we found that native α-synuclein promotes clustering of synaptic-vesicle mimics, using a single-vesicle optical microscopy system. This vesicle-clustering activity was observed for both recombinant and native α-synuclein purified from mouse brain. Clustering was dependent on specific interactions of native α-synuclein with both synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 and anionic lipids. Out of the three familial Parkinson's disease-related point mutants of α-synuclein, only the lipid-binding deficient mutation A30P disrupted clustering, hinting at a possible loss of function phenotype for this mutant. α-Synuclein had little effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion in our reconstituted single-vesicle system, consistent with in vivo data. α-Synuclein may therefore lead to accumulation of synaptic vesicles at the active zone, providing a ‘buffer’ of synaptic vesicles, without affecting neurotransmitter release itself.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00592.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00592.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00592.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The central nervous system coordinates many different activities by sending instructions to large numbers of cells and, simultaneously, processing all the signals that are sent back to the brain. All these messages are carried by electrical pulses that travel along chains of neurons, with neurotransmitter molecules enclosed inside synaptic vesicles conveying the messages across the synapses between neurons. A protein called α-synuclein is thought to have a role in the transport of neurotransmitter molecules across synapses, but the details of its involvement are not fully understood.</p><p>Mutations in the gene that codes for α-synuclein, and also duplications and triplications of this gene, are known to lead to an increased risk of early onset Parkinson's disease, a condition where the central nervous system degenerates. Moreover, the Lewy bodies found in the neurons of patients with Parkinson's disease contain high concentrations of α-synuclein. Again, however, none of this is fully understood.</p><p>Diao et al. have shed new light on these questions by creating synthetic vesicles to mimic what happens in real synapses, and using optical microscopy to observe the behaviour of these vesicles. They found that native α-synuclein (and another set of membrane proteins) increases the availability of synthetic vesicles at the synapse by causing them to cluster together. In a second experiment, Diao et al. showed that native α-synuclein does not decrease calcium-triggered fusion between membranes, the process that releases neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. In contrast, it is known that pathogenic α-synuclein aggregates directly interfere with the release of the neurotransmitter molecules. Moreover, when Diao et al. used a particular mutant form of α-synuclein that is associated with Parkinson's disease, the vesicles did not form clusters. If these results are confirmed in vivo, the role played by native α-synuclein in the central nervous system, and the connection between α-synuclein and Parkinson's disease, will be much clearer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00592.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00592.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminal</kwd><kwd>alpha-synuclein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Südhof</surname><given-names>Thomas C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-MH63105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS077906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Südhof</surname><given-names>Thomas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments on synthetic models of synaptic vesicles have shed new light on the role of the protein α-synuclein in the central nervous system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is an abundant presynaptic protein that is expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and associated with synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maroteaux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 1998</xref>).

Moreover, Lewy bodies observed in Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other neurodegenerative diseases contain high concentrations of α-Syn aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hardy and Gwinn-Hardy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spillantini et al., 1998</xref>). In aqueous solution, α-Syn is a largely unfolded protein and has a propensity to aggregate in a nucleation-dependent manner, forming β-sheet rich amyloid-like fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serpell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burré et al., In press</xref>). Fibrils, protofibrils and/or large oligomers are believed to be cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conway et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg and Lansbury, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucciantini et al., 2002</xref>), and may be responsible, at least in part, for the neurodegeneration observed in diseases featuring Lewy bodies. Physiologically, α-Syn increases the rate of SNARE-complex formation at the synapse via binding to the SNARE protein synaptobrevin-2 (also called VAMP2, vesicle associated membrane protein 2) and to phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burré et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In adult canaries and zebra finches, α-Syn expression correlates with plasticity in the developing song control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clayton and George, 1998</xref>). However, deletion of α-Syn in mice has been reported to show either no or very small and opposing effects on neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeliovich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yavich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Unger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Senior et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burré et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia-Reitbock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anwar et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of α-Syn either in transgenic mice or using stereotactic injections of adeno-associated virus have resulted in conflicting effects on neurotransmitter release, although chronic overexpression nearly always leads to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burré et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nemani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaugler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Structurally, α-Syn is a 14-kDa protein composed of an amphipathic, positively charged 100 residue N-terminal domain with a lysine-rich N-terminus that binds reversibly to anionic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhoades et al., 2006</xref>), and a 40-residue highly acidic C-terminal domain that interacts with the N-terminal sequence of synaptobrevin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burré et al., 2010</xref>). Recombinant, erythrocyte, and brain α-Syn is predominantly monomeric in solution with a smaller fraction of multimeric species, and is largely unstructured with a small (approximately 21–24%) helical contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fauvet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burré et al., 2013</xref>). At high concentrations (∼500 μM) and in the presence of β-octylglucoside, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed weak intramolecular NOEs in regions of α-helical propensity but no tertiary interactions, reminiscent of a molten globule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The interaction with anionic lipids induces α-helicity in α-Syn, as revealed by CD spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jo et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, solution NMR studies, EPR analyses, calorimetry, and single molecule fluorescence resonance transfer experiments in the presence of SDS micelles and small unilamellar vesicles revealed that the N-terminal 100 residues form a broken amphiphatic α-helix upon binding to anionic lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bussell and Eliezer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandra et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ulmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferreon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lokappa and Ulmer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maltsev et al., 2013</xref>). Binding of α-Syn to the membrane is transient, and the C-terminal 40 residues of α-Syn are unstructured and not bound to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodner et al., 2009</xref>). N-terminal acetylation of α-Syn does not induce significant structure in recombinant α-Syn in solution (i.e., absence of detergents or lipids), but further enhances its binding to anionic membranes and induced α-helicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maltsev et al., 2012</xref>). Although initially largely monomeric, purified brain α-Syn associates into partially folded multimers and aggregates in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burré et al., 2013</xref>). It is likely that these different monomeric and oligomeric states exist in an equilibrium in vivo, which is modulated by a variety of factors and interactions, such as membrane binding. This labile mixture of conformations provides a potential explanation for why α-Syn is so susceptible to pathological aggregation and fibril formation as observed in multiple neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Devine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the effect of native α-Syn on synaptic vesicle fusion, we employed a recently developed in vitro system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2012a</xref>) that allowed us to measure the effect of α-Syn on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion with reconstituted neuronal SNAREs, synaptotagmin-1, and complexin-1 on a sub-sec timescale. We found that native α-Syn does not significantly affect the efficiency and kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synaptic protein-mediated fusion itself. Rather, α-Syn induces clustering of vesicles with reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 or with both reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1. The clustering effect is dependent on specific binding to both anionic lipid membranes and synaptobrevin-2 as revealed by deletion and mutagenesis studies, including the Parkinson's disease mutant A30P that disrupts lipid binding. Furthermore, clustering is induced by both recombinant and brain-purified native α-Syn, both of which are initially in a largely monomeric state in the absence of membranes. This clustering or lack thereof may account for the increase in SNARE-complex levels observed upon overexpression of native α-Syn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burré et al., 2010</xref>), and, conversely, the decrease in SNARE-complex assembly in αβγ-Syn triple knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burré et al., 2010</xref>).<boxed-text id="box1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00592.003</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>Definitions</p></caption><p><bold>v-vesicle</bold>: proteoliposome with reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 in all experiments except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig4">Figures 1, 2, and 4D</xref> where both synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1 were reconstituted.

We showed previously that our particular vesicle preparation and protein reconstitution protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyoung et al., 2012</xref>) produce homogeneous populations of vesicles with an average diameter of approximately 80 nm, and physiological protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>). The resulting t-vesicle solution was diluted 10× and immobilized on an imaging surface via biotin/neutravidin interactions under saturating conditions. Specifically, 100 µl of the diluted t-vesicle solution was injected into the sample chamber and incubated for 30 min, followed by a 200 μl vesicle buffer exchange (vesicle buffer is defined as 90 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 20 μM EGTA, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). V-vesicles (with reconstituted synaptobrevin-2 and synaptotagmin-1) containing self-quenched content dye (sulforhodamine B; Invitrogen) were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyoung et al., 2012</xref>). The v-vesicle solution was diluted 150× and added to the immobilized t-vesicle surface with 2 μM complexin-1 in presence or absence of 2 μM α-Syn. The presence of 2 μM α-Syn corresponds to a v-vesicle-lipid to α-Syn-protein ratio of 11:1, with the actual lipid to protein ratio being larger due to the presence of the saturated t-vesicle surface; at this condition, we did not observe destabilization of the v-SNARE vesicles by α-Syn since no leaking of content dyes from docked v-vesicles was observed. The system was incubated for 30 min, followed by buffer exchange (1 × 200 μl vesicle buffer for 6 s), removing unbound or weakly bound complexin and α-Syn. Then, 500 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer was injected into the sample chamber, and the fluorescence intensity of the content dye for each docked v-vesicle (but excluding few large fluorescent spots, see arrow in the lower right image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was monitored with total internal reflection (TIR) wide-field microscopy (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) using an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (iXon+ DV 897E; Andor Technology USA, South Windsor, CT). The smCamera program (written in C++) from Taekjip Ha's laboratory was used for data acquisition and analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyoung et al., 2012</xref>). The number of v-/t-vesicle associations was calculated by counting the number of fluorescent spots prior to Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection, averaged over the specified number of images in the same sample channel. This simple averaging procedure was possible since the surface coverage was homogenous within the sample channel.</p><p>An instance of complete fusion was characterized by a stepwise increase in the content dye fluorescence intensity; this increase resulted from the approximately twofold dilution of the content dye upon fusion between a v- and a t-vesicle, and subsequent dequenching of the dye. For the histograms shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the time stamp of Ca<sup>2+</sup> injection was defined as the instance of the first content-mixing event among all docked vesicles within a particular field of view. Histograms were combined from several fields of views by using these time stamps for post-synchronization. Histograms were self-normalized with respect to total number of fusion events, and cumulative distributions calculated. Histograms were fitted to bi-exponential decay functions using OriginPro 8.6 (OriginLab, Inc. Northampton, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-vesicle clustering experiments</title><p>For the clustering experiments the same v-vesicle preparation and protein reconstitution, and vesicle immobilization protocols were used as for the single vesicle-vesicle fusion experiments described in the previous section, except that lipid dyes were added. Specifically, a saturated layer of 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate, DiIC18(5) (DiD) labeled synaptobrevin-2 containing v-vesicles was immobilized on an imaging surface via biotin/neutravidin interactions.

We confirmed that the vesicle-covered surfaces were saturated and produced a homogeneous distribution for each surface preparation with red laser excitation (633 nm) of the DiD-labeled immobilized vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right image).

This step was followed by buffer exchange (1 × 200 μl vesicle buffer for 6 s), removing unbound or weakly bound α-Syn. Next, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate, DiIC18(5) (DiI)-labeled synaptobrevin-2 vesicles were also prepared with our reconstitution protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyoung et al., 2012</xref>) and diluted 500×. 100 µl of diluted free-floating DiD-labeled v-vesicle solution was injected into the sample chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel); note that this v-vesicle solution did not contain α-Syn in order to prevent pre-clustering of this vesicle solution.

Details regarding software, slide assembly, and imaging protocols are described in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diao et al., 2012b</xref>). The number of v-/v-vesicle interactions (clustering) was determined by counting the number of fluorescent spots from emission of DiI upon excitation at 532 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The counts were averaged over the specified number of images at random locations in each sample channel. This simple averaging procedure was possible since the surface coverage was homogeneous.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Reinhard Jahn (Reviewing editor), and Jose Rizo and Yeon-Kyun Shin (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The concentration of synuclein used in the experiments is very high (2–20 μM), resulting in high protein:lipid ratios, raising the possibility that the liposomes are completely covered with protein. We suggest to carry out experiments testing whether such high concentrations are required. A straightforward option would be to run dynamic light scattering experiments on mixed liposome solutions using increasing concentrations of synuclein, but other approaches addressing the same problem are also acceptable.</p><p>2) A second related question is whether vesicle aggregation is caused by homooligomerization of synuclein between membranes. While we realize that this question may not be trivial to address, one possible option is to pre-incubate the docked vesicles with synuclein, wash away any unbound material, and then test whether synaptobrevin-liposomes still bind.

A straightforward option would be to run dynamic light scattering experiments on mixed liposome solutions using increasing concentrations of synuclein, but other approaches addressing the same problem are also acceptable</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately, dynamic light scattering experiments did not produce statistically meaningful results due to the relatively small effect of small numbers of vesicles clustering in such bulk experiments. However, we would like to point out that the effective concentration in our single vesicle clustering experiments (new Figures 3 and 4) is lower than 2–20 μM. The reason is that α-Syn was added after surface immobilization of acceptor DiD-labeled v-vesicles at 2–20 μM; after the incubation, unbound α-Syn was washed away by buffer exchange. Moreover, it is likely that the buffer exchange also removed some of the v-vesicle-bound α-Syn molecules since kinetic studies by NMR spectroscopy revealed that α-Syn binding to membranes is transient with exchanges occurring in the range of 1–10 s (Bodner et al., 2009). Then, donor DiI-labeled v-vesicles were injected in the absence of free α-Syn. Indeed, as Figure 4A shows, v-vesicle clustering has not reached saturation at 2 μM α-Syn incubation concentration. We added a new illustration (Figure 3B), along with a discussion of this point in the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) A second related question is whether vesicle aggregation is caused by homooligomerization of synuclein between membranes. While we realize that this question may not be trivial to address, one possible option is to pre-incubate the docked vesicles with synuclein, wash away any unbound material, and then test whether synaptobrevin-liposomes still bind. Although such experiments would not be completely conclusive (particularly if the outcome is negative), this question should be approached by such or other suitable experiments</italic>.</p><p>We apologize that the description of our protocol was somewhat hidden in the Materials and methods section. We therefore added the above-mentioned new Figure 3B. Indeed, we already did what the reviewers suggested by removing unbound α-Syn prior to adding free v-vesicles to the surface-mmobilized v-vesicles. Furthermore, we have measured α-Syn mediated liposome clustering with liposomes that either contain synaptobrevin-2, or lack synaptobrevin-2 (Figure 4A). Only in the former case did we observe significant v-vesicle clustering, whereas in the absence of synaptobrevin-2, no clustering was observed. Thus, v-vesicle clustering is not caused by homo-oligomerization of α-Syn, but requires specific binding of α-Syn to synaptobrevin-2, as well as binding to anionic lipids.</p><p><italic>3) All referees had difficulties with your model that seems highly speculative and almost counter-intuitive: the data presented in the paper actually show a reduction of docking between v-vesicles and t-vesicles by addition of α-synuclein. If this model is correct, wouldn't one expect a substantial effect of synucleing KO on neurotransmitter release? See the recent paper by Choi et al. (PNAS, 19 Feb 2013), where the authors argue that vesicle clustering by large α-synuclein oligomers inhibit vesicle fusion and reduce neurotransmitter release</italic>.</p><p>We apologize that our explanation was unclear. To better explain the observed reduction of fluorescent spots in the v-/t-vesicle fusion experiments, we performed an analysis of the distribution of the fluorescence intensities of the observed fluorescent spots (new Figure 2B). The major peak (&lt;1.5 a.u.) at low florescence intensity corresponds to single donor v-vesicles docked to the imaging surface, while the high intensity tail (&gt;2 a.u.) corresponds to small clusters (doubles, triples, …) of v-vesicles docked to the surface. In the presence of α-Syn, we observed a reduction of the low intensity population and a concomitant increase of higher intensity spots (Figure 2B, insert), along with a few very large spots (arrow in lower right image in Figure 2A). This observation implies the formation of v-vesicle clusters, resulting in a decrease of particle number in the finite volume of our system since the initial concentration of individual v-vesicles is identical for both experiments. A new illustration (Figure 2C) has been added to better illustrate this point. Moreover, we would like to note that extensive studies performed in our and in Pablo Castillo's laboratory failed to observe an effect of the α/β-synuclein double KO and the α/β/γ-synuclein triple KO mice on neurotransmitter release (see Chandra et al., PNAS 2004; Burre et al., Science 2010). Our model does not necessitate a role for α-Syn in regulating release, consistent with the actual physiological results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
