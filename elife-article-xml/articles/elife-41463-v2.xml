principal risk factor (IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, 2012) for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Lower Mekong River Basin countries including Thailand, Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia. We exploited this link to explore the role of the secreted growth factor termed liver fluke granulin (<italic>Ov-</italic>GRN-1) in pre-malignant lesions by undertaking programmed CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN-1 gene from the liver fluke genome. Deep sequencing of amplicon libraries from genomic DNA of gene-edited parasites revealed Cas9-catalyzed mutations within <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN-1. Gene editing resulted in rapid depletion of <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN-1 transcripts and the encoded <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN-1 protein. Gene-edited parasites colonized the biliary tract of hamsters and developed into adult flukes, but the infection resulted in reduced pathology as evidenced by attenuated biliary hyperplasia and fibrosis. Not only does this report pioneer programmed gene-editing in parasitic flatworms, but also the striking, clinically-relevant pathophysiological phenotype confirms the role for <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN-1 in virulence morbidity during opisthorchiasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41463.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the rural regions alongside the Mekong River in South East Asia, traditional cuisines often use uncooked or under cooked fish, many of which carry a worm known as <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>. Once inside the body, this parasite settles in the human liver, causing a tropical disease known as liver fluke infection. Out of the 10 million people affected by <italic>O. viverrini</italic>, thousands will also develop a type of liver cancer that is triggered by the presence of the worm. In particular, the parasite secretes a protein known as granulin that may encourage certain liver cells to multiply, potentially raising the risk for cancer.</p><p>A gene editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9 allows scientist to precisely target and then deactivate the genetic information a cell needs to produce a given protein. While the tool has been used in other species before, it was unknown if it could be applied to <italic>O. viverrini</italic>. Here, Arunsan et al. harnessed CRISPR/Cas9 to deactivate the gene that codes for granulin and create parasites that can only produce very little of the protein.</p><p>Hamsters infected with the gene-edited worms had fewer symptoms of liver fluke infection compared to those carrying normal <italic>O. viverrini</italic>. The animals with parasites that cannot produce granulin also had fewer changes to the liver that are associated with cancer. These findings confirm that granulin has a role in promoting liver fluke infection and liver cancer.</p><p>Alongside this work, <italic>Ittiprasert et al.</italic> used CRISPR/Cas9 to inactivate a gene in a species of worm that causes a human disease called schistosomiasis. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that the gene editing method can be adapted for use in parasitic worms, which are a major public health problem in tropical climates. This tool should help scientists understand how the parasites invade and damage our bodies, and provide new ideas for treatment and disease control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic></kwd><kwd>gene-editing</kwd><kwd>carcinogenic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004396</institution-id><institution>Thailand Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHD/0111/2557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arunsan</surname><given-names>Patpicha</given-names></name><name><surname>Laha</surname><given-names>Thewarach</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1109829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Neil David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1085309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loukas</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Sotillo</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name><name><surname>Laha</surname><given-names>Thewarach</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA164719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loukas</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Laha</surname><given-names>Thewarach</given-names></name><name><surname>Brindley</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1117504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loukas</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107475/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brindley</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene knockout of liver fluke granulin by CRISPR/Cas9 attenuates the virulence of infection with a carcinogenic liver fluke.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Liver fluke infection caused by species of <italic>Opisthorchis</italic> and <italic>Clonorchis</italic> remains a major public health problem in East Asia and Eastern Europe. <italic>O. viverrini</italic> is endemic in Thailand and Laos, where ~10 million people are infected with the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sripa et al., 2011</xref>). In liver fluke endemic regions, this infection causes hepatobiliary morbidity including cholangitis, choledocholithiasis (gall stones), and periductal fibrosis, and is the principal risk factor for bile duct cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sripa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sripa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mairiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tyson and El-Serag, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin et al., 2010a</xref>). Indeed, there is no stronger link between a human malignancy and a parasitic infection than that between CCA and infection with <italic>O. viverrini</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pagano et al., 2004</xref>). Northeastern Thailand suffers the highest incidence of CCA in the world, often exceeding 80 cases per 100,000 population and for which up to 20,000 people annually are admitted for surgery. The prognosis for liver fluke infection-induced cancer remains poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sripa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khuntikeo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khuntikeo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luvira et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How and why opisthorchiasis induces cholangiocarcinogenesis is likely multi-factorial, including mechanical irritation of the biliary tract during migration and feeding of the liver fluke, secretion by the parasite of inflammatory molecules, and nitrosamines in fermented foods that are a dietary staple in northeastern provinces of Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Songserm et al., 2012</xref>). To survive in the hostile host environment, parasitic helminths produce an assortment of excretory/secretory (ES) products including proteins with diverse roles at the host–parasite interface. This interaction has long been thought, but not fully understood, to modify cellular homeostasis and contribute to malignant transformation during chronic opisthorchiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brindley and Loukas, 2017</xref>). Feeding activity of the liver fluke inflicts wounds in the biliary tree, resulting in lesions that undergo protracted cycles of repair and re-injury during chronic infection. The liver fluke secretes mediators that accelerate wound resolution in monolayers of cultured cholangiocytes, an outcome that is compromised following silencing of expression of the liver fluke secreted growth factor <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 using RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papatpremsiri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smout et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that proliferation of biliary epithelial cells induced by <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 is a pivotal factor in maintenance and progression of a tumorigenic microenvironment in the liver during chronic opisthorchiasis.</p><p>Progress with development of genetic tools for functional genomic studies with platyhelminth parasites has been limited to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffmann et al., 2014</xref>). The use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated with Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, has revolutionized genome editing in biomedicine, agriculture and biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sander and Joung, 2014</xref>).

Here, we deployed a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach, aiming to knockout (mutate) the <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 gene and assess the virulence of gene-edited flukes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a hamster model of opisthorchiasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Programmed mutation of growth factor secreted by carcinogenic liver fluke</title><p>Following transfection of adult flukes with the gene-editing construct targeting <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1, the activity and efficiency of programmed editing was evaluated by two approaches. First, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was employed, which relies on the inefficiency of binding of a primer (here termed OVR-F) overlapping the target genomic sequence of the guide RNA (gRNA), that is where mutations are expected to have occurred, compared to the binding efficiency of flanking primers, that is outside the mutated region (flanking primers termed OUT-F and OUT-R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The ratio between the OVR-F and OUT-R products and OUT-F and OUT-R products provided an estimate of the amplification fold-reduction in the sample of CRISPR/Cas9-edited compared to genomic DNA (gDNA) from control, wild-type liver flukes at the target sequence of the sgRNA, that is the annealing site for the OVR primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). A reduction in relative fold amplification of 2.7% was detected in gDNA from the Cas9-treated worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Second, to identify, quantify and characterize the mutations that arose in the genome of <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1-edited (termed Δ<italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1) flukes, we used an amplicon-sequencing approach. A targeted (amplicon) sequence library was constructed from gDNA from some of the flukes (7 to 21 days after pCas-<italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 transfection). A fragment of 173 bp spanning the predicted site of the programmed double stranded break of <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 was amplified from gDNA primed with oligonucleotides flanking 1496–1668 nt of <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN1. Adaptors and barcodes were ligated into the amplicon libraries. Deep sequencing of the amplicon libraries was undertaken using the Illumina MiSeq system. Insertion-deletion (INDEL)/mutation profiles in the sequence reads were compared in multiple sequence alignments with the reference template sequence, nt 1,496–1,668 of wild type <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1. The CRISPResso computational pipeline was used to quantify gene-editing outcomes and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canver et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pinello et al., 2016</xref>); among &gt;2 million reads aligned against the reference sequence, 27,640 sequence reads exhibited non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mutations, including 170 reads with insertions (0.6%), 193 reads with deletions (0.7%) and 27,277 reads with substitutions (98.7%). Overall, 1.3% of the sequenced reads exhibited NHEJ mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The adult flukes from either WT or Δ<italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 groups were collected individually at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 after electroporation (three flukes per group). Groups of three flukes were homogenized by sonication (Sonics and Materials) in 1× PBS with alternating pulses of 5s duration (with 5s pause between pulses) for 45 s at 4°C.

Protein concentration of fluke homogenates was determined by the Bradford assay. Homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%) electrophoresis, and the resolved proteins transblotted to nitrocellulose membrane using a Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad).

The genome of each fluke was investigated for mutation(s) expected to have resulted from the repair by NHEJ events following the sgDNA programmed double stranded break (DSB) of the <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1 locus by Cas9. For analysis of gDNA from individual adult liver flukes recovered from infected hamsters, we performed a qPCR assay to detect and quantify the frequencies of newly induced mutations. The approach employed two pairs of primers for the target locus, with one putative amplicon extending beyond the putative INDEL site and the other overlapping it, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). The primers were named <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1-OUT-F, <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1-OVR-F, and <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1-reverse (OUT/OVR-R), respectively.

Whereas both primer pairs exhibited equivalent amplification efficiencies with the genomic DNA template from WT flukes, the <italic>Ov-</italic>GRN<italic>-</italic>1-OVR-F and OUT/OVR-R primer pair was mutation sensitive, whereas the other pair was not. The OUT and OVR amplicons were 817 and 714 bp in size, respectively, using the following PCR conditions: 7.5 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (TaKaRa Perfect Real-time Kit), 0.5 μl (0.4 μM) of each primer, 10 ng/μl of gDNA and distilled water to 15 μl. The thermal cycles included initiation for one cycle at 95°C, 3 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C, 30s, annealing at 55°C, 30s, extension at 72°C, 45s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The SYBR green signal was read at each annealing cycle and reported as threshold cycle (Ct). Efficiency of programmed CRISPR/Cas editing was estimated as the ratio of Ct<sub>OUT</sub>:Ct<sub>OVR</sub> from the experimental group compared with Ct<sub>OUT</sub>:Ct<sub>OVR</sub> of the control group, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). The Ct<sub>OUT</sub>:Ct<sub>OVR</sub> ratio from the control group would equal ‘1’ (CRISPR efficiency = 0) since there was difference in Ct values from the OUT and OVR primers. By contrast, the OVR primer can be anticipated to be inefficient when compared to the OUT primer for the experimental group, and hence the Ct<sub>OUT</sub>:Ct<sub>OVR</sub> likely would be &lt;1. Here, we calculated percent mutation indirectly by subtraction of the CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency value from ‘1’, as indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref

Thereafter, the sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min in a humidified chamber and washed in three times in 1× PBS, 3 min each with occasional shaking. The slides were probed with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-ACTA2 antibody (Abcam) diluted 1:200 in 1% BSA in PBST, 18 hr at 4°C in a humidified atmosphere. Lastly, slides were washed as above, mounted in glycerol, diluted 1:4 with 1 × PBS, and examined under bright and fluorescent lights (Zeiss Axio Observer; AxioVision SE64 Rel. 4.9.1 software, Jena, Germany). Images with a bile duct containing a fluke were selected and ImageJ used to define regions adjacent to the epithelium that excluded potential blood vessels (ovate structures). Three sites, free of bile ducts and blood vessels, were selected at random in order to establish levels of background fluorescence, each comprising 5–10% of the image. The fluorescence intensity of the biliary epithelium was measured and blanked against the mean of the three background readings and reported as mean intensity per cm<sup>2</sup> at 300 pixels per inch (PPI). Twenty-five to 30 discrete images of bile ducts per treatment group (three hamsters) were assessed. Zero values from the uninfected group were assigned a value of 1 to enable use of a log axis. The groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Biological and technical replicates, statistics</title><p>These biological replicates represented parallel measurements of biologically discrete samples in order to capture any random biological variation.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Programmed knockout mutation of liver fluke granulin attenuates virulence of infection-induced hepatobiliary morbidity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including James B Lok as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers concur that this paper represents a ground breaking advancement in functional genomic methodology for parasitic flatworms, and we congratulate you for this. We also concur that your findings are of special importance in that they demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in <italic>O. viverrini</italic> and parasitic flatworms generally. All reviewers concur that the findings reported in this paper are sufficient to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and that no further experimentation is required. That said, there are several substantive points that should be addressed, given that this paper, along with its co-submitted manuscript on <italic>S. mansoni</italic> omega 1, will likely be prototypes upon which further studies involving programmed gene editing will be based. The general areas in need of this attention are 1) the difficulty in reconciling the very low mutation frequencies determined by deep sequencing with the very large decrements seen in parameters of target gene expression (mRNA, protein) and parasite virulence assessed on a worm-for-worm basis, 2) the need for clarification of how pooling of parasites and assignment to categories of high, medium and low were carried out and 3) addressing the rigor of controls used in the experiments. These concerns may be addressed by clarifying the points indicated and adding in-depth discussion of what could be improved with regard to informative indices of mutation frequency and proper controls going forward.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>With regard to point 1 in the summary, provide an assessment of the deep sequencing approach as an informative estimate of mutation frequency compared with possible alternative methods that would yield an estimation of the frequency of mutations in the target on a worm-for-worm basis. Comments on how the low mutation frequencies obtained by the deep sequencing approach can be reconciled with the dramatic decrements in <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> transcripts and protein and in the virulence of the parasites would also greatly improve the paper. As suggested by reviewer 1 (and by all of us in consultation) a discussion of the site of <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> expression within the worms as it relates to efficiency of transduction with CRISPR elements would also be helpful.</p><p>With regard to point 2 in the summary, the segment on &quot;Longevity of programmed mutation at <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic>&quot; was somewhat confusing to all three reviewers before and during our consultation. It is essential to clarify this section along lines specified by reviewers 1 and 3.</p><p>With regard to point 3 in the summary, the three reviewers concurred that a control in which Cas9 was expressed without a functional gRNA would have added to the rigor of the study. There was difference of opinion about the advisability of including in such a control a nonfunctional gRNA (i.e. one that contained a scaffold with no seed sequence or that contained a scaffold with a seed sequence having no homology in the <italic>O. viverrini</italic> genome). All this is to say that since this paper is likely to constitute a prototype for future studies, some discussion of what constitutes a rigorous control in experiments of this kind is warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the first report of CRISPR driven gene editing in a parasitic flatworm, in this case the oriental liver fluke <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>. The focus of the transfection efforts is liver fluke granulin, shown previously to play a role in establishing the tumorigenic microenvironment.</p><p>The authors effectively demonstrate successful transfection and then provide extensive analysis of the model host pathology induced by transfected fluke relative to wild-type (control) fluke. The manuscript charts an important step forward in the field, providing evidence for the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 in flatworms. The work on granulin biology extends the current understanding of its role. Overall, the manuscript is generally well presented and the results are compelling.</p><p>The authors should address the following points for clarification etc.</p><p>It would have been helpful to discuss where granulin is expressed in the worm as this can help inform the tissue-specific efficiency of the transfection methods used.</p><p>The efficiency of transfection data was provided for the directly transfected adults and yet the biology was performed on adults derived from transfected of NEJs – it's unclear why the transfection data were not generated for the juvenile flukes OR from adults of transfected NEJs.</p><p>Mutation frequencies are provided for adult fluke with low, medium and high levels of target gene transcript expression. It's not clear if the data for the pooled samples from each group are based on an n=1 or multiple pools of each type. Either way, this needs to be clarified and, if multiple pools were used, the range or SE values included with all the relevant data in the manuscript..</p><p>The ranges used to assign to define the H, M and L groups appear to differ between the Results (subsection “Longevity of programmed mutation at <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic>”) and Materials and methods (subsection “Extraction of nucleic acids”).</p><p>In the subsection “Programmed mutation of growth factor secreted by carcinogenic liver fluke”, the three outcomes of transfection (insertion, deletion, substitution) totaled 27640 against the total number of NHEJ reads of 27616 – but why these differ is not stated.</p><p>Subsection “Attenuated infection-induced hyperplasia of the biliary tract”, last – sentence is incomplete and needs rewriting.</p><p>Materials and methods – Wrt transfection of mature adult fluke, the authors need to state if the 20 worms were transfected individually (1 per cuvette) or otherwise?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper of Arunsan et al. reports on the functional characterization of <italic>O. viverini</italic> granulin, a secreted parasite protein. By CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and a combination of molecular analyses, cell culture and animal experiments as well as histochemical studies, the authors demonstrate a role of granulin in the liver/bile duct-associated pathology in the hamster as a host model.</p><p>This is an elegant and well-designed study showing for the first time that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO studies are possible in an important human parasite. Along with the accompanying paper about schistosome CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO, this is groundbreaking work and worth to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript confirms the overall role of the liver fluke <italic>Opisthorchis viverrini</italic>, and its secreted granulin 1 as direct agents of hepatobiliary disease, including cholangiosarcoma, in humans. But beyond these confirmatory findings, this paper is groundbreaking in that its evidence derives from phenotypes resulting from CRISPR/Cas9-programmed disruption of <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic>, the gene encoding the parasite's pathogenic secreted granulin-1 protein. This, in combination with its co-submitted manuscript on CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of the gene encoding the secreted egg protein, omega-1 in <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, at once marks proof of principle for programmed gene editing in pathogenic trematodes and the first experiments in which this powerful method is applied to determining pathogenicity of specific molecules in these important parasites. In this paper, the authors demonstrate by deep sequencing the creation of indels at the target locus in the <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> gene and estimate frequency of these among PCR amplicons of the target locus in from pooled parasites. They go on to demonstrate that these mutations correlate with marked declines in <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> transcript and protein levels as well as decreases in the capacity of parasite secretions to incite cell proliferation and simulated wound healing in vitro. Finally, they report that although parasites with CRISPR-induced disruption of <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> retain the ability to infect hamsters, the levels of thickening and structural disorder they incite in biliary epithelia of these animals and the fibrosis resulting from this is greatly reduced from those induced by wild type parasites. This is a highly significant milestone in the study of molecular determinants of pathogenicity in trematode parasites. That said, I noted two substantive points about the manuscript that, if not addressed by additional experiments in the present instance, should at least be acknowledged to improve upon this approach in future studies.</p><p>Substantive issues:</p><p>1) If I understand the narrative under &quot;Longevity of programmed mutation at <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic>&quot; it suggests that individual flukes were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR to determine levels of expression, classed according to three levels of expression: low, medium and high, and then their gDNA pooled for deep sequencing to determine mutation rates. Is it not possible to genotype individual flukes, or does mosaicism tend to render mutant genomes in these worms practically undetectable?</p><p>If possible to obtain, an estimate of the percentage of worms in a sample population that showed any mutation might be easier to reconcile with the very large reductions you see in <italic>Ov-grn-1</italic> protein and the large changes in the parameters relating to hepatobiliary disease that you see.</p><p>2) The control groups (subsection “Transfection of liver flukes with pCas-<italic>Ov-grn-1”</italic>) in this study appear to have been WT parasites and &quot;mock transected&quot; parasites that were electroporated in complete medium lacking plasmid DNA. Wouldn't a more rigorous control be parasites electroporated with a vector containing all functionalities except that the target-specific gRNA was replaced with either a gRNA with a scaffold but no seed sequence, or, better yet, a gRNA containing a seed sequence with no homology in the <italic>O. viverrini</italic> genome? This would control for any non-specific effects of Cas9 expression on parasite fitness. Such effects have been noted in other systems, notably in <italic>C. elegans</italic> lines that express Cas9 constitutively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41463.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>With regard to point 1 in the summary, provide an assessment of the deep sequencing approach as an informative estimate of mutation frequency compared with possible alternative methods that would yield an estimation of the frequency of mutations in the target on a worm-for-worm basis.

Second, we did directly genotype individual flukes using the tri-primer qPCR approach (Figure 5). Second, it is technically feasible also to genotype individual worms using the targeted amplicon library-NGS-CRISPResso computational algorithm-based analysis, and whereas this approach will provide more information including the NHEJ profile of% insertions,% deletions, and% substitutions, it is technically more challenging, more time consuming, and more expensive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If possible to obtain, an estimate of the percentage of worms in a sample population that showed any mutation might be easier to reconcile with the very large reductions you see in Ov-grn-1 protein and the large changes in the parameters relating to hepatobiliary disease that you see.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this issue experimentally following the reviewers’ recommendation; please see Figure 5 and related text.

Wouldn't a more rigorous control be parasites electroporated with a vector containing all functionalities except that the target-specific gRNA was replaced with either a gRNA with a scaffold but no seed sequence, or, better yet, a gRNA containing a seed sequence with no homology in the O. viverrini genome? This would control for any non-specific effects of Cas9 expression on parasite fitness. Such effects have been noted in other systems, notably in C. elegans lines that express Cas9 constitutively.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to point 3 above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
