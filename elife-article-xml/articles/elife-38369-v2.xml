Such intermediates are key features of the landscape; they can facilitate folding, but they can also lead to misfolding and aggregation, resulting in a breakdown of proteostasis and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karamanos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2016</xref>). While identifying and characterizing these intermediates is critical to understanding and engineering a protein’s energy landscape, their transient nature and low populations present experimental challenges. Currently, we know very little about how evolutionary variations in the primary amino acid sequence affect these transient conformations and the overall folding pathway of a protein. Recent technological improvements in hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HX-MS) have provided access to the structural and temporal details of folding intermediates at near-single amino-acid resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Walters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghera and Udgaonkar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vahidi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khanal et al., 2012</xref>). This pulsed-labeling HX-MS approach is particularly well suited to studies of multiple variants or families of proteins, as it does not require large amounts of purified protein or NMR assignments, and is a powerful platform to test hypotheses on how folding pathways and protein conformations are dictated by sequence and the environment. Thus, pulsed-labeling HX-MS can be used to address long-standing questions in the field: How robust is a protein’s energy landscape to changes in the amino acid sequence, and how conserved is the folding trajectory over evolutionary time?</p><p>Ribonuclease HI (RNase H) is an ideal system to investigate protein folding over evolutionary time. RNase H from <italic>E. coli</italic>, ecRNH* (the asterisk denotes a cysteine-free variant of RNase H), is arguably one of the best-characterized proteins in terms of its folding pathway and energy landscape. Both stopped-flow ensemble studies and single-molecule optical trap experiments demonstrate that this protein populates a major obligate intermediate before the rate-limiting step in folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raschke and Marqusee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raschke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cecconi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosen et al., 2014</xref>). A rare population of this intermediate can also be detected under native-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamberlain et al., 1996</xref>). Several homologs of RNase H have also been studied, yielding insight into the folding trends of extant RNases H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollien and Marqusee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ratcliff et al., 2009</xref>). Given the wealth of data available on several extant RNases H, this seemed like an ideal system to explore the evolutionary basis of these observations.</p><p>One can use a phylogenetic technique called ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to access the evolutionary history of a protein family and study the properties of ancestral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harms and Thornton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>). ASR has been applied to a variety of protein families and in addition to revealing the evolutionary history, these ancestral proteins can act as intermediates in sequence space to uncover mechanisms underlying protein properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Starr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaucher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hobbs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perez-Jimenez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Risso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akanuma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siddiq et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, ancestral sequence reconstruction was applied to the RNase H family and the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of seven ancestral proteins connecting the lineages of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> RNase H (ecRNH* and ttRNH*) were characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim and Marqusee, 2017</xref>). Stopped-flow kinetics monitored by circular dichroism (CD) demonstrate that all seven ancestral proteins populate a folding intermediate before the rate-limiting step. Additionally, the folding and unfolding rates show notable trends along the phylogenetic lineages, and the presence of a folding intermediate plays an important role in modulating these evolutionary trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). Although the kinetic mechanism appears conserved, the structural similarities and differences between the folding intermediates across these RNases H are unknown.</p><p>For ecRNH*, multiple methods have confirmed the structural details of the folding intermediates. This major folding intermediate, termed I<sub>core</sub>, which forms before the rate-limiting step, involves secondary structure formation in the core region of the protein, including Helices A-D and Strands 4 and 5, while the rest of the protein (Helix E and Strands 1, 2, 3), remains unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raschke and Marqusee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spudich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connell et al., 2009</xref>). Pulsed-labeling HX-MS with near amino acid resolution was developed using ecRNH* as the model protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). This approach confirmed the structure of I<sub>core</sub> and revealed the stepwise protection of individual helices leading up to the intermediate. Specifically, the amide hydrogens in Helix A and Strand four are the first elements to gain protection, followed by those in Helix D and Strand 5, and then Helices B and C to form the canonical I<sub>core</sub> intermediate. The periphery, comprising of Strands 1–3 and Helix E, gains protection in the rate-limiting step to the native state. Is this I<sub>core</sub> folding intermediate and the stepwise folding pathway conserved across evolution?</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38369.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNase H structure and schematic of pulsed-labeling HX-MS experiment</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RNase H* (ecRNH*) (PDB: 2RN2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katayanagi et al., 1992</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Pulsed-labeling setup and workflow. Unfolded, fully deuterated protein in high [urea] is rapidly mixed with low [urea] refolding buffer to initiate refolding. After some refolding time, hydrogen exchange of unprotected amides is initiated by mixing with high-pH pulse buffer. The hydrogen exchange reaction is quenched by mixing with a low-pH quench buffer. The sample is injected onto an LC-MS for in-line proteolysis, desalting, and peptide separation by reverse-phase chromatography followed by MS analysis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38369-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Here, we used pulsed-labeling HX-MS on the resurrected family of RNases H to investigate the evolutionary and sequence determinants governing the folding trajectory. Specifically, we find that the structure of the major folding intermediate (I<sub>core</sub>) has been conserved over three billion years of evolution, suggesting that this partially folded state plays a crucial role in the folding or function of the protein. However, the path to this intermediate varies, both during evolution and by designed mutations. The very first step in folding differs between the two extant homologs: for ecRNH*, Helix A gains protection before Helix D, while for ttRNH*, Helix D acquires protection before Helix A. This pattern can be followed along the evolutionary lineages: most of the ancestors fold like ttRNH* (Helix D before Helix A) and a switch to fold like ecRNH* (Helix A before Helix D) occurs late along the mesophilic lineage. These phylogenetic trends allow us to investigate how these early folding events are encoded in the amino acid sequence. By using single-point mutations to selectively modulate biophysical properties, notably intrinsic helicity of specific secondary structure elements, we are able to favor or disfavor the formation of specific conformations during folding and have engineering control over the folding pathway of RNase H.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monitoring a protein’s folding trajectory by pulsed-labeling HX-MS</title><p>We used pulsed-labeling hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HX-MS) on extant, ancestral, and site-directed variants of RNase H to examine the robustness of a protein’s folding pathway to sequence changes. These experiments allow us to characterize the partially folded intermediates and the order of structure formation during folding to ask whether these intermediates have changed over evolutionary time, and what role sequence might play in determining these intermediate conformations.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> outlines the scheme for the pulsed-labeling experiment (for details, see Materials and methods). Briefly, folding is initiated by rapidly diluting an unfolded (high [urea]), fully deuterated protein into folding conditions (low [urea]) at 10°C. After various folding times (t<sub>f</sub>), a pulse of hydrogen exchange is applied to label amides in regions that have not yet folded. The amount of exchange at each folding timepoint is then detected by in-line proteolysis and LC/MS. Data are analyzed first at the peptide level by monitoring the protection of deuterons on peptides as a function of refolding time, and then at the residue level, using overlapping peptides de-convoluted by the program HDsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kan et al., 2011</xref>). Protection from exchange in these experiments arises from formation of structure, however it is impossible to tell the exact structure using hydrogen exchange alone. Thus, nonnative or transient structures can be detected, but the characterization of them is limited.</p><p>Since the original folding studies on many RNases H were carried out at 25°C, we re-characterized the folding of each RNase H variant at 10°C using stopped-flow circular dichroism spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The refolding profiles were consistent with those at 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raschke and Marqusee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollien and Marqusee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). At low [urea], all ancestors show a large signal change (burst phase) within the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument (~15 msec), followed by a slower observable phase which fit well to a single exponential. The resulting chevron plots (ln(<italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>) vs [urea]) show the classic rollover at low [urea] due to the presence of a stable folding intermediate. As expected, the observed rates at 10°C are slower than 25°C, but the chevron profiles are similar for all RNase H variants. Thus the overall folding trajectory, notably the population of a folding intermediate, has not changed between the two temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Monitoring the folding pathway of ttRNH* using pulsed-labeling HX-MS</title><p>First, we characterized the conformations populated during folding of extant RNase H from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and compared its folding trajectory to the previously characterized folding trajectory of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). 374 unique peptides mapping to the ttRNH* sequence were identified by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The major folding intermediate in ttRNH*, I<sub>core</sub>, is strikingly similar to that of ecRNH* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to ecRNH*, peptides associated with I<sub>core</sub> (Helix A-D, Strands 4 – 5) gain protection early (within milliseconds), corresponding to the timescale for the formation of the folding intermediate. Peptides associated with the periphery of the protein (Strands 2 – 3, Helix E) gain protection on the order of seconds, corresponding to the rate-limiting step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although it has been shown by CD spectroscopy that the slow observed refolding kinetics of ttRNH* fit best to a biphasic exponential process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), we were not able to observe structural changes that can be attributed to these two phases by pulsed-labeling HX-MS.

Peptides corresponding to the I<sub>core</sub> region of the RNase H structure become protected on the timescale of milliseconds, while the rest of the protein gains protection on the timescale of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). Thus, the structure of this major folding intermediate is not only present in both extant RNases H, but is conserved over nearly three billion years of evolutionary history.</p><p>Similarly to the extant proteins, the periphery of the ancestral proteins gains protection on a much slower timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). The details of protection in this region, however, vary somewhat across the ancestors. The periphery becomes fully protected by the last time point in all ancestral proteins except for AncB* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). AncB* was previously characterized to be non-two-state with a notable population of the folding intermediate under equilibrium conditions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2016</xref>) and the lack of protection in the periphery in the folded state of AncB* is consistent with this observation. For Anc1* and Anc2*, there are also notable differences in the time course of protection for the terminal helix, Helix E. For these two proteins, the peptides spanning Helix E are decoupled from Strands 1 – 3 (which show protection on the same timescale as global folding) and do not gain protection even in the folded state of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that Helix E is improperly docked or poorly structured in Anc1* and Anc2*. Indeed, Helix E is known to be labile in ecRNH*: a deletion variant of ecRNH* without this final helix forms a cooperatively folded protein, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goedken et al., 1997</xref>) and recent single-molecule force spectroscopy of ecRNH* showed that Helix E can be pulled off the folded protein under low force while the remainder of the protein remains structured (manuscript in preparation). It appears that Helix E may be further destabilized in Anc1* and Anc2* such that it does not show protection in the native state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The early folding steps of RNase H change across evolutionary time</title><p>Since the order of events leading to I<sub>core</sub> differs between the extant homologs, we examined whether the ancestral RNases H spanning the lineages of these two homologs show any trends in their early folding steps.

For the first two ancestors along the mesophilic lineage (AncA* and AncB*), the order of protection is difficult to determine. For AncA*, there is no significant difference in the degree of protection among the peptides within I<sub>core</sub> (this analysis is limited by the availability of peptides associated exclusively within a region) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, when all overlapping peptides are analyzed using HDSite to obtain site resolution, we observe notable protection in Helix D at the earliest refolding times. Therefore, we conclude that although Helix D folding before Helix A is likely, the early folding events of AncA* cannot be unambiguously determined. For AncB*, all of I<sub>core</sub> gains protection at the same time point, both at the peptide and residue-level, so the order of assembly cannot be determined with our time resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The next ancestor along the mesophilic lineage, AncC*, shows protection first in Helix D, indicating that this pattern of protection is maintained through the mesophilic lineage to this ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). AncD*, the most recent ancestor along the mesophilic lineage, however, is similar to ecRNH* and gains protection first in Helix A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). As detailed for the other ancestors, the data were also analyzed using HDSite to determine residue-level protection for each ancestral RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). These data indicate a pattern in the order of protection in the early steps of the folding pathway across the RNase H ancestors. Early protection in Helix D is an ancestral feature of RNase H that is maintained in the thermophilic lineage, with a transition occurring late during the mesophilic lineage to a different pathway where Helix A is protected before Helix D, resulting in a distinct folding pathway for the two extant RNase H homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38369.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic helicity as a predictor for the early folding mechanism of RNases H.</title><p>Log-ratio of intrinsic helicity of Helix A and Helix D for each RNase H variant studied.

An analysis of the intrinsic helical propensity of each region using the algorithm AGADIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñoz and Serrano, 1994</xref>) shows a notable trend in helicity that correlates with the early folding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

For the variants where Helix D is protected first, the intrinsic helicity of Helix D is similar to or greater than Helix A.

To investigate this hypothesis, we turned to rationally designed variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Intrinsic helicity plays a role in determining the structure of the early intermediates</title><p>If the order of protection in the early folding events of RNase H is determined by intrinsic helix propensity, then we should be able to alter the protein sequence rationally and manipulate the folding trajectory. Thus, we asked whether single-site mutations that change the relative helix propensity of Helix A and Helix D could alter the folding trajectory of ecRNH* and make it fold in a similar fashion to ttRNH*. Two different point mutations were made in ecRNH*: A55G decreases helix propensity in Helix A, and D108L increases helicity in Helix D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Table 1). Pulsed-labeling HX-MS indicates that both of these variants alter the early folding events of ecRNH*. The peptide-level protection of ecRNH* A55G indicates that at 13 msec, both Helix A and Helix D show similar levels of protection. In contrast, for wild-type ecRNH*, Helix A shows protection by 1 msec and Helix D does not show comparable protection until 10 – 20 msec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the mutation A55G slows the gain of protection in Helix A such that it no longer protected before Helix D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The peptide-level protection of ecRNH* D108L indicates a change in the order of protection. Due to the limited number of peptides available, we could only confidently determine this using peptides spanning the N-terminus of Helix D. At 13 msec, the N-terminus of Helix D (residues 106 – 108) near the D108L mutation is protected significantly faster than any other region of the protein.

This approach was initially developed for use with NMR detection where it benefited from NMR’s site-specific resolution of individual amides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai, 2006</xref>). However, using NMR with pulsed-labeling HX requires tens of milligrams of sample and NMR peak assignments for the amides in each protein studied. In addition, probes are limited to amide sites stable to exchange in the final folded state (protection factors of &gt;~80,000) resulting in loss of information at individual sites, which can sometimes represent large regions of the protein. In contrast, detection by mass spectrometry as applied in this study requires much less protein sample, has much faster data collection, and can theoretically cover 100% of the protein sequence. Importantly, this approach does not demand any structural information of the folded state, such as NMR assignments, for the specific protein or variant studied. These advantages enabled us to obtain the stepwise folding pathway of nine variants of RNase H and study the evolutionary history and sequence determinants of the RNase H folding pathway in detail. While pulsed-labeling HX-MS has been used to characterize the folding pathways of several model systems, this study is the first to utilize the higher throughput nature of HX-MS to study an ensemble of protein variants. The advantages of this technique to study many different sequences of the same fold shows great promise for probing the relationship between amino acid sequence and a protein’s energy landscape and will likely be particularly valuable for protein engineering and design applications. Additionally, HX-MS should be also able to identify non-native states, backtracking, and misfolded conformations. We did not, however, observe such phenomena with our RNase H proteins.</p><p>Although pulsed-labeling HX-MS is a powerful technique, it is not without limitations. In particular, HX is a readout of the accessibility of the backbone amide to exchange with solvent, so we would not be able to distinguish between different protein conformations with the same protection pattern. Additionally, a variety of factors involved in protein folding from hydrogen bond formation and hydrophobic collapse can contribute to amide protection. Since the protection patterns we observe during folding are all consistent with protected regions in the native state, we see no evidence for non-native structure, indicating a sequential acquisition of native secondary structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>I<sub>core</sub> is a structurally conserved folding intermediate over 3 billion years of evolution</title><p>The native fold of a protein is robust to changes in sequence, and proteins with &gt;~30% sequence identity share the same fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sander and Schneider, 1991</xref>). Thus small variations in sequence, such as those found among homologs or site-specific mutations, do not affect the overall three-dimensional structure of a protein. These mutations can, however, affect the overall energy landscape, which in turn can have profound effects on function. Here, we find conservation of a high-energy structure populated during the folding of the RNase H family over incredibly long evolutionary timescales. Using pulsed-labeling HX-MS we identified and characterized the structure of the major folding intermediate in seven ancestral and several mutant RNases H, which together with previous studies on extant homologs, suggest that the conservation of this intermediate is a key feature of the RNase H energy landscape across ~3 billion years of evolutionary time.</p><p>Why does I<sub>core</sub> persist on the energy landscape of RNase H? One explanation is a simple topological constraint; all RNases H may need to fold via a populated I<sub>core</sub> intermediate to successfully reach the native state. This explanation, however, is countered by a previous study where a single mutation (I53D) in ecRNH* destabilizes I<sub>core</sub> such that it is no longer populated during folding—yet this variant still folds to the native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spudich et al., 2004</xref>). Adding osmolytes, such as sodium sulfate, stabilizes this folding intermediate and switches ecRNH* I53D back to a three-state folding pathway, showing that the presence of the folding intermediate can be modulated. Additionally, a fragment of RNase H containing only the I<sub>core</sub> sequence (and variants thereof) can autonomously fold and be studied at equilibrium, indicating that this structure is stable and robust to mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamberlain et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosen and Marqusee, 2015</xref>). The nature of the rate-limiting step, or folding barrier, which allows for the buildup of this intermediate is unclear. One possibility is that the I<sub>core</sub> intermediate is populated simply because the information for folding this region is completely encoded locally and I<sub>core</sub> can fold relatively fast, before this rate-limiting step to the fully folded state. Alternatively, the rapid collapse of I<sub>core</sub> may be the result of an evolutionary pressure to quickly sequester regions of the protein that might be particularly prone to aggregation. Indeed, there are several segments of RNase H that are predicted to be aggregation-prone, and most of these segments are found in the core region of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Table 2).</p><p>I<sub>core</sub> could also be conserved because it contributes to the biological function or fitness of the protein. Partially folded states and high-energy non-native conformations are known to be important for a variety of protein functions and proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin and Kay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehr et al., 2006</xref>). All of the ancestral RNases H we studied here are active, in that they cleave RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hart et al., 2014</xref>); and although the residues thought to contribute to substrate-binding affinity are contained in the core region of the protein, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanaya et al., 1991</xref>) the active site residues (D10, E48, D70) span both the core and the periphery. It is therefore possible that a stable folding core with an energetically independent periphery is important for the efficiency or dynamics associated with catalysis in RNase H.</p><p>While the presence of the I<sub>core</sub> intermediate has been observed in all proteins studied here, recent studies have suggested that some of the RNase H variants, notably for proteins along the thermophilic lineage, the I<sub>core</sub> folding intermediate may also involve structure in the first β-strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim and Marqusee, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosen and Marqusee, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). While we see slight protection in this region for ttRNH*, hydrogen exchange may not be the best probe of this—docking of Strand 1 without its hydrogen-bonding partners in the rest of the β-sheet may not be reflected by backbone amide protection. Therefore, amide protection may not be observed even if Strand 1 docks early to the core. The involvement of Strand 1 in other RNase H variants studied remains unclear from this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim and Marqusee, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosen and Marqusee, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Aspects of the folding pathway are malleable across evolutionary time</title><p>Our pulsed-labeling HX-MS results also illustrate how other features of a protein’s energy landscape can be altered over evolutionary timescales. Although the I<sub>core</sub> intermediate is conserved across all RNases H studied, the individual folding steps leading up to I<sub>core</sub> differ. Anc1*, the last common ancestor, folds through a pathway where the Helix D/Strand 5 region is the first structural element to gain protection. This ancestral feature is maintained along the thermophilic lineage to the extant ttRNH*. Along the mesophilic branch, we observe a switch from this ancient folding pathway to one that first forms protection in Helix A/Strand 4. This suggests that while the structure of I<sub>core</sub> has been conserved across 3 billion years of evolution, the steps to form this intermediate are malleable over time. Since an isolated helix is unlikely show protection by HX, we expect additional hydrophobic collapse of the polypeptide to contribute to the observed protection. Nonetheless, the switch in protection between Helix A and Helix D indicates that formation of native structure nucleates in a different region of the protein across the RNase H variants studied, with a clear evolutionary trend.</p><p>Despite these trends, it remains difficult to rationalize these observations in terms of a selective evolutionary pressure or fitness implication. These very early events occur on the order of one millisecond, significantly faster than the overall folding of the protein. Furthermore, all of these RNase H proteins fold to their native state efficiently with no evidence for aggregation or misfolding. So, although partially folded states have been implicated as gateways for aggregation for some proteins, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>) this does not appear to be the case for RNase H. It is possible that the change in the early folding step is a result of mutations that are coupled to another feature under selection or drift. Although the actual evolutionary implication for the RNase H folding pathway may be lost in history, the trend in folding pathway across evolutionary time demonstrates that folding pathways and conformations on the energy landscape of proteins can change over time, and this system provides an excellent tool to interrogate the role sequence plays in guiding the process of protein folding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The folding pathway of RNase H can be altered using simple sequence changes</title><p>Our study also shows how insights from evolutionary history can contribute to our understanding of the physiochemical mechanisms dictating the protein energy landscape and how we might use that knowledge to engineer the landscape. The regions that gain protection first involve helical secondary structure elements, and their folding order correlates with isolated helical propensity of these regions predicted by AGADIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muñoz and Serrano, 1994</xref>). Proteins where protection is first observed in Helix A have higher intrinsic helicity in Helix A than in Helix D. Proteins where Helix D gains protection first exhibit higher helicity in Helix D or roughly equal helicity in both regions. This property was used to guide our site-directed mutagenesis to select variants to alter the folding trajectory of ecRNH* in a predictive manner using intrinsic helicity as a guide.</p><p>While these results are consistent with local helicity as a determinant of the earliest folding steps, there may be other parameters that dictate the formation of these conformations. The parameter average area buried upon folding (AABUF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rose et al., 1985</xref>) which measures the average change in surface area of a residue from an unfolded state to a folded state, has been shown to correlate to the structure of the folding intermediate in apomyoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2011</xref>). Both helicity and AABUF are altered in the mutants considered in our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Table 1). Indeed, AABUF and helicity are often correlated and contributions of either parameter are difficult to disentangle. Nevertheless, our data suggest that parameters that are locally encoded in regions of a protein can be used engineer the energy landscape of a protein including its folding pathway.</p><p>We have used a combination of ASR and pulsed-labeling HX-MS to explore the conformations populated during the folding of multiple RNase H proteins, including homologs, ancestors, and single-site variants. All RNase H proteins studied populate the same major folding intermediate, I<sub>core</sub>, indicating that this conformation has been maintained on the energy landscape of RNase H over long evolutionary timescales (&gt;3 billion years). This remarkable conservation of a partially folded structure on the energy landscape of RNase H is contrasted with changes in the folding pathway leading up to this structure. The early folding events preceding this intermediate (Helix A protected before Helix D or vice versa) differ between the two homologs and also shows a notable trend along the evolutionary lineages. This pattern of protection correlates with the relative helix propensity of the sequences comprising these two helices, and we use this knowledge to alter the folding pathway of ecRNH* through rationally designed mutations. Our study illustrates how the energy landscape of a protein can be altered in complex ways over evolutionary time scales, and how insights from evolutionary history can contribute to our understanding of the physiochemical mechanisms dictating the protein energy landscape.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

For the pulsed-labeling experiment, 1 volume of deuterated protein was mixed in the SFM-4/Q with 10 volumes of refolding buffer (10 mM Sodium Acetate pH = 5.29, H<sub>2</sub>O) to initiate refolding. The pulse for hydrogen exchange was initiated by mixing with 5 volumes of high pH buffer (100 mM Glycine pH = 10.11) and then quenched after 10 msec with five volumes low pH buffer (200 mM Glycine pH = 1.95). The length of the delay line between the first and second mixer was changed to achieve a range of refolding times. An interrupted mixing protocol was used to measure the longest refolding time points (&gt;373 msec). Undeuterated protein was used to perform tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis to compile a list of peptides and their retention times in the HPLC system. Competition experiments where refolding and exchange were initiated at the same time were performed by diluting deuterated protein in high urea into high-pH refolding buffer (100 mM Glycine pH = 10.11). In this experiment each site will exchange with the solvent around it unless it can gain protection before exchange occurs (&lt;1 msec on average). Fully folded controls were created by diluting unfolded protein samples 1:10 in fully deuterated refolding buffer and incubating at room temperature for 4 hrs before loading on the SFM-4/Q to apply the same 10 msec high-pH pulse as the other time points.

Peptides identified in the pulsed-labeled refolding experiments with deuterated protein were used to determine the presence and deuteration level of each peptide at each refolding time point. The spectral envelope of each peptide was fit using two separate algorithms developed by the Englander Lab to determine their deuteration state — ExMS for identification and fitting of peptides and HDsite for deconvolution of overlapping peptides to achieve near-amino acid level deuteration levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kan et al., 2011</xref>).

In addition, HDExaminer (Sierra Analytics) was used to identify and fit each peptide and determine deuteration levels. Different charge states of the same peptide were averaged where noted and used for further analysis. Centroids of each peptide at each time point taken from HDExaminer were used for further analysis.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Tracing a protein's folding pathway over evolutionary time using ancestral sequence reconstruction and hydrogen exchange&quot; for consideration. Your paper has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The consensus is that the work is of general interest, although some revision is requested. No further experiments are required at this time.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reports a landmark, high-resolution determination of structure formation during the folding process of two extant ribonuclease H homologs (from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, ttRNH* and ecRNH*, respectively), a series of their reconstructed ancestral progenitors reaching back to their last common ancestor, and designed site-directed point mutations of ecRNH* that test the molecular basis for differences in folding. The biophysical analysis of this conceived set of variants provides a unique view of the molecular basis for how the energy landscape of protein folding may be modulated over the course of evolution. As there is very little such information currently known, this study provides unprecedented experimental detail to address critical, fundamental questions regarding how evolutionary variations in primary amino acid sequence determine tertiary structure. Such information has far-reaching impact, as the authors demonstrate how this powerful H/D method developed previously and applied to ecRNH* (PNAS 2013) may be widely applied and provide testable knowledge of folding that is important for advancing outstanding challenges in the accurate modelling of folding as well as in protein engineering and design. The key findings are that an obligatory partially folded intermediate is conserved over 3 billion years of RNH evolution, but the path to this intermediate can vary, both during evolution and by design. A significant modulator of the protein energy landscape is the intrinsic helical propensity of different secondary structural elements, i.e. helix A and helix D. Both A and D helices are formed in the conserved intermediate, but helix D is the first secondary structure element to fold in the common ancestor and in variants up to and including ttRNH*. In contrast, along the phylogenetic branch leading to ecRNH*, the folding of helix A is progressively increasingly favourable compared to helix D, such that helix A folds first in ecRNH and the preceding ancestral protein (AncD*). The relative formation of helix A and D during folding is mirrored in the corresponding relative intrinsic helical propensities in the different RNHs, and is demonstrated as rationally alterable by characterizing point mutants engineered to change helical propensity.</p><p>Although all reviewers enjoyed the paper and recognized the novelty of the work it was felt that it should be stressed more completely in the revised manuscript. This is particularly the case as several previous papers have been published by this group on the same RNH system, although structural information on the folding order is not provided there.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>- Do the authors think that there is a functional significance at all to the order of helix folding (D before A or vice versa)?</p><p>- Is the sequence that folds first, corresponding to the intermediate, more aggregation prone than the slower folding remainder? Could it be that the goal of the intermediate is just to sequester quickly sticky amino acids?</p><p>- Could the authors discuss a bit about the limitations of their hydrogen exchange method in terms of generating intermediate structures. They stress the positives of course in their paper. Yet, it seems like it is not possible to distinguish between the formation of different structural elements in cases where protection would be the same and hence the requirement for a somewhat native-centric folding model.</p><p>- Additional information should be provided on analysis of the HX-MS data and on the associated uncertainties. This is important to better define the current results and for other investigators who may use the results or the HX-MS method in future. For example, what are the estimated uncertainties in the residue-resolved data (panels D or E)? What specific criteria are used to assign results for an individual residue to grey (increased uncertainty) or black? Why does the grey/black colour change for different folding timepoints of the same protein? Some additional detail on how differences in protection of secondary structural elements (panels C or D) were calculated to be statistically different is also warranted. In panel C/D (and B/C), I guess each point represents data for 1 peptide in 1 experiment, or were the data determined in triplicate averaged? Please also clarify details regarding how the various normalizations were done and the extent of back exchange and the impact of back exchange on uncertainties. What are the impacts/significance for data interpretation of normalizing the data for ttRNH* to the theoretical maximum (e.g. will fractions deuterated tend to be systematically low in Figure 2). Much of this information could be in the supplementary information, perhaps including additional specific information on what peptides were observed/analyzed for different proteins.</p><p>- The authors discuss the pertinent point that the level of protection of the peripheral secondary structural elements (strands 1-3 and Helix E), which are not protected in the intermediate, differs in the folded RNHs. To what extent this different protection may impact interpretation of the results? Also, in principle the HX-MS may reveal non-native intermediates e.g. perhaps there is more structure in helix A in the intermediate than in the folded state (e.g. for Anc3*). This may also be worth commenting on?</p><p>- Comparison of the new results described in this paper with results obtained previously for ecRNH* (PNAS 2013) are central to the conclusions of this paper, but no data are shown for ecRNH*. The ecRNH* results were obtained at 25°C rather than the 10°C used for the new HX-MS results here, and that AncD*, like ecRNH*, shows protection of Helix A before Helix D. Still, it may be helpful to include some additional information on ecRNH* both for HX-MS and for folding kinetics in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Please clarify the significance/relationship of the 2 phases observed for ttRNH* for the HX-MS results, and whether/why 1 or 2 phases are observed for the other proteins.</p><p>- Figure 5 shows HX-MS at an early timepoint of folding for ecRNH* point mutations A55G (decreases helical propensity of Helix A) and D108L (to increase helicity of D). It would certainly be of interest to see also the corresponding residue resolved analysis, and if the observed effects persist throughout folding (i.e. add the equivalent of panel D).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38369.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Although all reviewers enjoyed the paper and recognized the novelty of the work it was felt that it should be stressed more completely in the revised manuscript.

We have added several sentences in the Introduction and Discussion section to further emphasize the novelty and key findings of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>- Do the authors think that there is a functional significance at all to the order of helix folding (D before A or vice versa)?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the earliest events in folding where helix D or helix A gain protection takes place very quickly (on the order of milliseconds), we found it difficult to rationalize a functional significance to this trend and have outlined our reasoning in the Discussion section (subsection “Aspects of the folding pathway are malleable across evolutionary time”). Although it is possible that intrinsic helicity can underlie functional effects in the folded state of the protein (i.e. substrate binding, native-state dynamics, catalysis) or be involved in stability (generally the more thermodynamically stable proteins show protection in helix D first), we can only speculate since we did not specifically probe the functional significance of the observed folding trends in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is the sequence that folds first, corresponding to the intermediate, more aggregation prone than the slower folding remainder? Could it be that the goal of the intermediate is just to sequester quickly sticky amino acids?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this interesting point. To examine this in the RNase H family, we ran three different aggregation predictors (Zipper DB, FISH Amyloid, AmylPred) on the RNase H sequences and we summarize the results in a new supplementary table (Table 2 in Supplementary file 1). The algorithms found several aggregation-prone protein segments, most of which are in the core region of the protein. Thus, as the reviewers hypothesized, it is entirely possible that the goal of the intermediate is to quickly sequester these sticky amino acids. We did not observe any aggregation-like behavior in our HX-MS experiments, but investigating whether this is a significant factor in RNase H folding and evolution would be an interesting future direction. We have also added some text in the Discussion to address this in the manuscript (subsection “I<sub>core</sub> is a structurally conserved folding intermediate over 3 billion years of evolution”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Could the authors discuss a bit about the limitations of their hydrogen exchange method in terms of generating intermediate structures.

It is true that hydrogen exchange measures protection, and cannot distinguish between different structures with the same residue protection. In this manuscript, we have done our best to refrain from drawing conclusions about specific structures of the partially folded states we observe in the RNase H proteins, and instead we focus on describing our data as protection during folding that are consistent with protected regions in the native state. We have reviewed our manuscript to ensure that our data interpretation and wording is consistent with this approach. Additionally, we have added language in the main text (subsection “Determining the folding pathway of multiple protein variants”) that explains both the advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen exchange, focusing particularly on the limitations and assumptions involved in inferring partially folded structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Additional information should be provided on analysis of the HX-MS data and on the associated uncertainties. This is important to better define the current results and for other investigators who may use the results or the HX-MS method in future.

We’d like to clarify that the grey/black coloring for the site-resolved data may be different for different folding time points because site-resolution was determined by the peptide coverage of each sample. For the same protein, slightly different peptides (both in identity and number) may be detected for any given MS run. We hope that this additional information can provide the details necessary for accurate interpretations of our work and for future investigators to build upon our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also clarify details regarding how the various normalizations were done and the extent of back exchange and the impact of back exchange on uncertainties.

As previously explained in our Materials and methods, for one protein, ttRNH*, we chose to normalize the data to the theoretical maximum because of the consistently poor peptide coverage in the back-exchange control (this may be due to its high stability and difficulty in peptide cleavage). Since the choice of normalization only affects the absolute value but not the relative differences between time points or secondary structure elements in deuterium protection, we believe the data interpretation and the statistical significance should not be affected in the ttRNH* dataset.</p><p>Additionally, we have provided supplementary information tables (Figure 2—source data 1, Figure 3—source data 1, Figure 5—source data 1) that lists the source data for each protein studied in this manuscript, the identity of all of the peptides and their normalized fractional deuterium content at each time point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors discuss the pertinent point that the level of protection of the peripheral secondary structural elements (strands 1-3 and Helix E), which are not protected in the intermediate, differs in the folded RNHs.

This may also be worth commenting on?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, we see interesting differences in the level of protection in the folded state across the different RNase H proteins. These data are consistent with previous results, such as the non-2-state equilibrium behavior of AncB* (Hart et al., 2014) and the relative lability of Helix E (Goedken, Raschke and Marqusee, 1997). For all of these proteins, I<sub>core</sub> forms during folding and is structurally conserved, and the folding steps to I<sub>core</sub> take place on a timescale much faster than typical folding of the periphery (msec vs. sec). Thus, we believe that differences in the native ensemble of the protein would not impact the interpretation of the results and the trends we observe regarding the early folding steps leading up to the conserved I<sub>core</sub> intermediate.</p><p>As the reviewer noted, it should be possible to reveal non-native intermediates with HX-MS, which we believe is a very important and powerful application of this technique. Specifically to Anc3*, however, we would like to clarify to the reviewer that the residue-resolved data spanning Helix A (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D) is missing because of a lack of peptide coverage in that region for that time point. When site-resolved data is not available, we use the symbol “x” to denote the lack of data at those residues, which the reviewer may have inadvertently interpreted as low protection values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Comparison of the new results described in this paper with results obtained previously for ecRNH* (PNAS 2013) are central to the conclusions of this paper, but no data are shown for ecRNH*. The ecRNH* results were obtained at 25°C rather than the 10°C used for the new HX-MS results here, and that AncD*, like ecRNH*, shows protection of Helix A before Helix D. Still, it may be helpful to include some additional information on ecRNH* both for HX-MS and for folding kinetics in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>First, thank you for pointing out that the manuscript would be more complete as a stand alone entity if we provided more information on ecRNH* for comparison. We have added this to the manuscript (see below). However, we would like to clarify an important point – the ecRNH* HX-MS data in the Hu et al., 2013 paper was actually conducted at 10°C (and not 25°C as suggestion by the reviewers), and is therefore under exactly the same conditions as the results in this manuscript. To help clarify this and provide a complete set of data on all the discussed proteins in this manuscript, we have included an additional panel (panel K) in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 showing the chevron plot for ecRNH* at both 25°C and 10°C. The data shown are identical to Figure 1C in the Hu et al., 2013 manuscript and re-plotted to be consistent with the other panels in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Additionally, we have provided the HX-MS results for ecRNH* from the Hu et al., 2013 manuscript and presented it as a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify the significance/relationship of the 2 phases observed for ttRNH* for the HX-MS results, and whether/why 1 or 2 phases are observed for the other proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Except for ttRNH*, all of the other RNases H studied here show a single observable phase and a burst phase (see Lim et al., 2016). It has been known for some time that the observable refolding kinetics for ttRNH* fits best to a biphasic exponential process (by CD spectroscopy). The underlying mechanism and structural implications of this second phase were studied extensively in a previous manuscript (Hollien and Marqusee, 2002). Although there is some evidence that proline isomerization is involved, the exact molecular process responsible for the second phase of ttRNH*, which was not observed in any other ancestral RNases H (see Lim et al., 2016), remains elusive. We do not see any evidence of a second phase in the pulse labeling HX-MS data. It would have been very exciting if our HX-MS data revealed two distinct phases in the rate-limiting step unique to ttRNH*. We have added a section in the manuscript (subsection “Monitoring the folding pathway of ttRNH* using pulsed-labeling HX-MS”, first paragraph) that expands on this topic, and acknowledge that this remains an open question in RNase H folding, which we hope a future HX-MS experiment or another method could eventually uncover.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 5 shows HX-MS at an early timepoint of folding for ecRNH* point mutations A55G (decreases helical propensity of Helix A) and D108L (to increase helicity of D).

For these two proteins, we only carried out the earliest folding time points and the folded state control in order to address the question and hypothesis of which helix is protected first.</p></body></sub-article></article>
