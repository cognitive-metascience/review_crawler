In its [4Fe-4S] cluster-bound form it represses iron uptake by binding to IRO Box sequences upstream of RirA-regulated genes. Under low iron and/or aerobic conditions, [4Fe-4S] RirA undergoes cluster conversion/degradation to apo-RirA, which can no longer bind IRO Box sequences. Here, we apply time-resolved mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine how the RirA cluster senses iron and O<sub>2</sub>. The data indicate that the key iron-sensing step is the O<sub>2</sub>-independent, reversible dissociation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> to form [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup>. The dissociation constant for this process was determined as <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = ~3 µM, which is consistent with the sensing of ‘free’ iron in the cytoplasm. O<sub>2</sub>-sensing occurs through enhanced cluster degradation under aerobic conditions, via O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidation of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> intermediate to form [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup>. This work provides a detailed mechanistic/functional view of an iron-responsive regulator.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47804.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Virtually all life forms require iron to survive, yet too much of the metal can be catastrophic. In healthy cells, many systems regulate this delicate balance. For instance, when a protein called RirA is active in <italic>Rhizobium</italic> bacteria, it can sense high levels of the metal and helps to shut down the production of proteins that bring in more iron. RirA contains a cluster of four iron and four sulphur atoms, which acts as a sensor for iron availability: however, exactly how this cluster structure detects the levels of the metal in a cell was previously unclear.</p><p>Pellicer Martinez, Crack, Stewart et al. used a technique known as time-resolved mass spectrometry to examine the sensory response of the iron-sulphur cluster of RirA when different levels of iron were available. The results revealed a ‘loose’ iron atom in the cluster; when iron levels fall down, this atom is rapidly lost as it is scavenged for use in other essential processes. Without it, the cluster in RirA collapses and the protein becomes inactive. This prompts the cell to produce proteins that enable it to take up iron from its surroundings. Once iron levels are high, RirA can regain its cluster and is active again, stopping the production of proteins that bring in more iron.</p><p>Iron-sulphur clusters are common in many proteins, and this work offers new insight into their various roles. It also highlights the potential to use time-resolved mass spectrometry to examine biological processes in depth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iron-sulfur</kwd><kwd>iron sensor</kwd><kwd>DNA regulation</kwd><kwd>rhizobia</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>EPR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/E003400/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Andrew WB</given-names></name><name><surname>Le Brun</surname><given-names>Nick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J003247/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Brun</surname><given-names>Nick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L006140/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crack</surname><given-names>Jason C</given-names></name><name><surname>Le Brun</surname><given-names>Nick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA15133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Brun</surname><given-names>Nick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular details of how the iron–sulfur cluster cofactor of a bacterial global iron regulatory protein simultaneously senses iron and O<sub>2</sub> are revealed by mass spectrometry and spectroscopy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron–sulphur clusters are ubiquitous protein cofactors that play essential roles across all of life in processes as diverse as respiration, photosynthesis, and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beinert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2005</xref>), with recent evidence that they may be even more abundant than initially thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouault, 2015</xref>). Elucidating the precise nature of their roles is a major challenge, which is often complicated by the extreme reactivity of the cluster to O<sub>2</sub> and other gases. However, this very sensitivity has been exploited through the evolution of iron–sulphur cluster-containing transcriptional regulators that enable cells to sense and respond to, for example, oxidative stress and changes in concentrations of metabolically important species such as O<sub>2</sub> and iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beinert and Kiley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crack et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Iron is an essential micronutrient for nearly all of life, but is also potentially extremely toxic due to its ability to catalyse, via redox cycling, the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species. Consequently, for life to flourish, not only must sufficient iron be obtained from the environment, but its precise form must be carefully controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2003</xref>). A central part of this control is exerted through the regulation of iron uptake into the cell in response to intracellular iron levels. In many bacteria, including such taxonomically diverse model organisms as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, iron uptake is under the control of the global iron regulator Fur (Ferric uptake regulator). Iron is sensed through the availability and binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup> directly to the Fur protein, resulting in a conformation that can bind <italic>cis</italic>-acting ‘Fur boxes’ close to the promoters of genes encoding proteins that function in the iron-uptake machinery, causing (usually) repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Helmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pohl et al., 2003</xref>). The direct binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup> as a co-repressor also occurs in DtxR (Diphtheria toxin Repressor) from <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic> and related species. Although DtxR has no significant sequence similarity to Fur, it shares significant structural features, in addition to Fe<sup>2+</sup>-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p><italic>Rhizobium</italic> and other closely related rhizobial genera that induce nitrogen-fixing nodules on legumes, as well as the pathogens <italic>Bartonella</italic>, <italic>Brucella</italic>, and <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, contain a very different global iron regulator called RirA (Rhizobial iron regulator A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Todd et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wexler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeoman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Todd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Todd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rudolph et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ngok-Ngam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viguier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhubhanil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crespo-Rivas et al., 2019</xref>), which has no structural or sequence similarity whatsoever to Fur or DtxR. Rather, RirA belongs to the Rrf2 super-family of transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keon et al., 1997</xref>) that includes IscR (regulator of iron–sulphur cluster biosynthesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rajagopalan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>) and NsrR (regulator of nitrosative stress response) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crack et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Volbeda et al., 2017</xref>), both of which are homodimeric and bind an iron–sulphur cluster. In <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum,</italic> the symbiont of peas, beans and clovers, RirA regulates many genes involved in iron homeostasis, by binding to <italic>cis</italic>-acting ‘IRO boxes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeoman et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, it was shown that <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic> RirA binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster and that this form of the protein binds to the IRO box sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). Although the structure of RirA is not yet available, a model based on the structure of dimeric [4Fe-4S] NsrR, the first reported for any cluster-bound Rrf2 regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Volbeda et al., 2017</xref>), is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Exposure of [4Fe-4S] RirA to low iron conditions and/or O<sub>2</sub> resulted in cluster conversion to generate a [2Fe-2S] form, which binds to the IRO box with lower affinity than the [4Fe-4S] form. The [2Fe-2S] form was also unstable under low iron conditions, resulting in apo-RirA, which did not bind the IRO box sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47804.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model of the homodimer form of [4Fe-4S] RirA.</title><p>Cartoon ribbon representation showing one protomer in blue and the other in beige, with iron and sulphide ions in brown and yellow, respectively.

Traditional approaches to studies of iron–sulphur cluster proteins cannot readily resolve intermediates of cluster conversion/decay. ESI-MS utilizing solution and ionisation conditions under which proteins remain folded enables accurate mass detection of intact proteins and protein complexes, and has been used extensively to study protein-protein interactions, interactions of proteins with drugs, nucleic acids, sugars and lipids, as well as protein structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopper and Robinson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodenburg et al., 2017</xref>). It has also been used to study protein-cofactor interactions where the cofactor remains bound following ionisation, and amongst these, ESI-MS of metalloregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glauninger et al., 2018</xref>) and iron–sulphur cluster proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>) and their reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crack and Le Brun, 2019</xref>) have also been shown to be valuable. Time-resolved mass spectrometry has been exploited for studying protein metal ion binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ngu and Stillman, 2006</xref>) and heme transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tiedemann et al., 2012</xref>), and for structural studies using H/D exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Konermann et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, time-resolved ESI-MS provided detailed mechanistic information of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing reaction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster binding FNR regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crack et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we employed time-resolved ESI-MS under non-denaturing conditions, along with EPR spectroscopy, to elucidate the exact series of molecular events involved in the conversion of the RirA cluster in response to key environmental signals. The data reveal, in remarkable detail, the nature of intermediates formed and differences in cluster conversion under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Importantly, we find that the key sensing step, the <italic>initiation</italic> of cluster conversion/degradation, is dependent on Fe<sup>2+</sup> but is independent of O<sub>2</sub>, and that the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the fourth iron binding to the cluster is in the low micromolar range, supporting a primary role for RirA as an iron sensor in vivo. Nevertheless, O<sub>2</sub> influences the overall rate of cluster decay through the oxidation of a key cluster intermediate and of cluster-derived sulphide. Together, the data provide a comprehensive mechanistic and functional view of an important iron-responsive regulator.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mass spectrometric analysis of [4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion under anaerobic conditions</title><p>Regular electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in water/acetonitrile acidified with formic acid results in denatured proteins and the loss of non-covalently attached cofactors. However, the use of a volatile buffer at physiological pH is known to preserve the protein’s folded state and, with it, any bound cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crack et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, using ESI-MS under such non-denaturing conditions, we set out to observe in real time the decay of the [4Fe-4S] RirA cluster in response to low iron conditions and to determine the identity of any intermediary cluster conversion breakdown products. The feasibility of this approach was indicated by the previously reported ESI-MS of [4Fe-4S] RirA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>), in which both dimeric and monomeric forms were observed. Ionisation of RirA in the MS experiment results in partial dissociation of the RirA dimer into monomers. Initially, conditions for the formation of the monomeric form were optimised because this enabled the unambiguous assignment of cluster species. Analysis of the RirA dimer follows in a later section.</p><p>The initial spectrum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (black line), in which the protein was held under non-denaturing anaerobic, iron-replete conditions, was very similar to that previously described for cluster-bound RirA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>); the major peak at 17,792 Da corresponds to the [4Fe-4S] form (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for predicted and observed masses), but a range of lower intensity cluster breakdown species was also present, which are most likely due to cluster damage sustained during the exchange of the protein into the volatile buffer necessary for ESI-MS studies. Indeed, these were observed to decay away while the [4Fe-4S] form remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous studies that demonstrated that the [4Fe-4S] form of RirA is entirely stable under anaerobic, iron-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47804.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ESI-MS analysis of [4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion under anaerobic, low iron conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deconvoluted (to neutral mass) mass spectrum of [4Fe-4S] RirA prior to the addition of 250 µM EDTA (t = 0, black line) and 30 min after the addition at 37°C (t = 30, red line). (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>) Deconvoluted mass spectra measured at intervening times: 0–8 min (from the point of EDTA addition, spectra recorded at 2 min intervals) (<bold>B</bold>) and 8–30 min (<bold>C</bold>).

However, the rate constant describing the loss of a sulphide to generate [4Fe-3S] is extremely low, indicating that this reaction does not occur as a significant part of the (chemical) conversion mechanism and that the observation of a [4Fe-3S] species (which is present at time zero following addition of EDTA) results from damage to the cluster during ionisation. It is important to note that the extent of cluster damage is low and this does not affect the mechanistic picture of the cluster conversion/degradation reaction that emerges. Thus, loss of an initial iron, [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S], is the heavily favoured route for the initiation of cluster conversion. Another important feature of the global fit is that the first step, loss of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup>, is reversible.</p><p>The overall rate of cluster conversion observed here is significantly higher than that previously reported from absorbance kinetic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). To confirm that ESI-MS and absorbance spectroscopy report on the same process, cluster degradation was followed by monitoring A<sub>382 nm</sub> (corresponding to the maximum absorbance of the [4Fe-4S] cluster) as a function of time for a [4Fe-4S] RirA sample in volatile ammonium acetate buffer (necessary for ESI-MS measurements) rather than the HEPES buffer previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. The decay fitted well to a bi-exponential function, where the initial, more rapid phase must correspond to the loss of the [4Fe-4S] cluster (in which it converts to a species that cannot be identified by its absorbance alone), followed by a slower phase that corresponds to further decay of the cluster. The rate constant for the initial phase, <italic>k</italic> = 0.34 min<sup>−1</sup>, is in excellent agreement with the rate constant (<italic>k</italic> = 0.30 min<sup>−1</sup>) for the conversion of [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S], derived from the ESI-MS kinetic data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Though [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters often have similar absorbance extinction coefficients, loss of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from the RirA [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster would be expected to result in some change in the UV-visible absorbance spectrum, as observed here and for a similar process in aconitase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emptage et al., 1983</xref>). Thus, the enhanced rate of conversion reported here is not a consequence of the ESI-MS method, but rather reflects the different buffer conditions used here compared to those of the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). The RirA cluster is clearly more labile in the ammonium acetate buffer, most likely because acetate is a weak iron chelator.</p><p>The ESI-MS data show that the [3Fe-3S] RirA species was formed from [3Fe-4S] and [4Fe-3S] clusters with similar observed rate constants (<italic>k</italic> = 0.090 and 0.087 min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). The temporal behaviour of the [3Fe-3S] intermediate, where it was observed to maximise at ~4 min before decaying away, is consistent with it being an intermediate in the [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] cluster conversion pathway. A novel [3Fe-3S] intermediate was recently observed by mass spectrometry during the O<sub>2</sub>-dependent [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] cluster conversion reaction of FNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crack et al., 2017</xref>). The observation of a similar intermediate here suggests that it may be a more widespread feature of [4Fe-4S] cluster conversions. While the structure of this particular [3Fe-3S] intermediate was not established, that of a small molecule [3Fe-3S]<sup>3+</sup> cluster was recently published, revealing a planar hexagonal arrangement of alternating iron and sulphide ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). If the [3Fe-3S] intermediate of RirA has a similar planar structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it would reveal a key feature of the [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] cluster conversion, in which the geometry of the coordinating ligands changes from tetrahedral (for the [4Fe-4S] cluster) to planar (for the [2Fe-2S] cluster).</p><p>[3Fe-3S] RirA degraded predominantly to form [2Fe-2S] (<italic>k</italic> = 0.5 min<sup>−1</sup>), before finally generating apo-RirA (<italic>k</italic> = 0.07 min<sup>−1</sup>). The mechanistic scheme indicates that [3Fe-3S] may also decay to [3Fe-2S] and then on to apo-RirA (in part via [2Fe-2S]). It is recognised that additional intermediate species are likely to be involved in the degradation of [3Fe-2S]/[2Fe-2S] to apo-RirA. While a [2Fe-S] form was observed in mass spectra, its temporal behaviour could not be sensibly modelled, suggesting that it might, at least in part, arise from spontaneous re-assembly of cluster fragments as iron/sulphide ions are released during cluster conversion/degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The effect of O<sub>2</sub> on [4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion revealed by mass spectrometry</title><p>Previous studies of [4Fe-4S] RirA showed that the cluster is sensitive to O<sub>2</sub>, undergoing conversion in an apparently similar manner to that observed under low iron conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). To gain a much more detailed view of this aspect of the conversion process, [4Fe-4S] RirA was investigated using non-denaturing ESI-MS under low iron conditions in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> (228 µM). Cluster conversion/breakdown species were observed to form and decay as a function of time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Plots of the individual cluster intermediate species as a function of time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, revealed marked differences to those in the absence of O<sub>2</sub>. We note that the presence of O adducts in experiments carried out under anaerobic conditions suggested that some O<sub>2</sub> might be generated during the ESI-MS experiment; however, the differences observed between the anaerobic and aerobic experiments suggest that this is relatively minor. Indeed, the formation of several intermediates, including the [3Fe-3S] and [2Fe-2S] forms, occurred significantly more rapidly under aerobic conditions, consistent with previous observations that a combination of low iron and O<sub>2</sub> enhanced the rate of cluster conversion/degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the formation of sulphur adducts of apo-RirA, which were confirmed to be derived from cluster sulphide by <sup>34</sup>S-dependent mass shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), occurred to a much greater extent in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, consistent with O<sub>2</sub> acting as oxidant for S<sup>2-</sup> ions released from the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Low abundance peaks due to oxygen adducts (the first at apo-RirA +16 Da) were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Signal intensities as a function of temperature at six microwave power values were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). The inclusion of a 1/T hyperbola (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) reveals the narrow temperature interval in which the EPR signal follows the Curie law (based on non-saturated and non-broadened lines originating from an undisturbed Boltzmann distribution of energy levels populations) for each microwave power. At a very low microwave power, such as 3.2 µW, the EPR signal perfectly obeyed the Curie law in the explored temperature range of 4–15 K. As the power was increased, the temperature dependence in the 4–9 K region became lower, indicating power saturation at these temperatures for all powers ≥ 100 µW. At temperatures above ~20 K, all dependences deviated from the Curie hyperbola, which is an effect of line broadening. No microwave power was able to produce any detectable EPR absorbance at temperatures above 50 K. This is a particular characteristic of [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> clusters; they exhibit the most sensitive dependence on increasing temperature, with signal disappearing at a lower temperature than for any other cluster type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Svistunenko et al., 2006</xref>). Such microwave power saturation behaviour, as well as the g-value and EPR line shape are highly characteristic of well-characterised [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beinert and Thomson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cammack, 1992</xref>) and so we conclude that, in the case of RirA, the EPR active species is the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster. It is perhaps surprising that none of the other intermediates identified by ESI-MS are detected by EPR; it appears that such species are diamagnetic.</p><p>To determine the kinetic properties of the RirA [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> intermediate, EPR measurements were performed for samples prepared at a range of time points following exposure to aerobic low iron conditions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>. Quantification of the g = 2.01 signal revealed that ~ 1 µM (~4%) of the cluster was present in the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> form at time zero, prior to the introduction of chelator and O<sub>2</sub>. The signal intensity increased with time up to ~4.5 µM (~18% of the original cluster concentration) by 3 min before decaying away over the next 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>). The [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster contains three Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, meaning that it is formed from a [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster through loss of a Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion and oxidation of the remaining Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>. EPR measurements were also carried out for [4Fe-4S] RirA samples under identical conditions except that O<sub>2</sub> was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). A signal similar to that observed in the aerobic experiment was detected, but at a significantly lower concentration. Beginning at ~4% of original cluster concentration, the signal increased only to ~6.5% after 5 min, then remained at that level up to ~15 min before returning to its pre-EDTA exposure concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). We note that the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> signal does not entirely decay away under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. One possibility is that this low intensity residual signal represents an ‘off pathway’ form of the cluster that is less reactive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The first step of 4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion is the O<sub>2</sub>-independent reversible loss of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to form [3Fe-4S]</title><p>While the presence of O<sub>2</sub> enhances several of the steps of cluster conversion/degradation, importantly, this is not the case for the initial <italic>reversible</italic> step in which the cluster loses a Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion to form the [3Fe-4S] intermediate: rate constants for the initial step (principally loss of iron) are similar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, the oxidation state of the [3Fe-4S] cluster is affected by the presence of O<sub>2</sub>. A comparison of the ESI-MS data for [3Fe-4S] from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and the EPR intensity data for [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. The data are generally in good agreement for the aerobic experiment. There is a slight lag in the appearance of the EPR signal relative to the ESI-MS [3Fe-4S] peak, which could arise from the initial formation of the EPR silent [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> intermediate, followed by its oxidation to the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> form in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>. In the anaerobic experiment, the observed intensity of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster is much lower, consistent with the major form being the EPR silent [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form. In combination, the ESI-MS and EPR data show that a [3Fe-4S] cluster intermediate is formed in both the absence and presence of O<sub>2</sub> (at similar abundance as judged by ESI-MS), but it is predominantly present in different oxidation states, being largely in the reduced [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form under anaerobic conditions and in the oxidised [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> form under aerobic conditions.</p><p>The insensitivity of the initial step to O<sub>2</sub> revealed here by time-resolved ESI-MS is consistent with the previous observation that the rate of the [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] cluster conversion reaction is O<sub>2</sub>-independent, leading to the conclusion that the rate-limiting step of the reaction does not involve O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). While the overall rates of reaction in the ammonium acetate buffer used here for ESI-MS and EPR experiments are greater than those previously reported, the <italic>global</italic> analyses indicate that, when O<sub>2</sub> is present, the initial reaction (corresponding to the loss of a single iron (as Fe<sup>2+</sup>) from the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster) is, or is close to, the rate-limiting step (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This accounts for why the absorbance decay at 382 nm follows a single exponential in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> but a bi-exponential in the absence of O<sub>2</sub>: in the former condition, the initial and subsequent reaction ([3Fe-4S] to [3Fe-3S]) occur at similar rates, while under anaerobic conditions, the second step is significantly slower. The independence from O<sub>2</sub> of the initial step is consistent with RirA functioning principally as an iron sensor.</p><p>In considering the question of why O<sub>2</sub> should significantly affect the [3Fe-4S] to [3Fe-3S] conversion, it is likely that the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> species resulting from O<sub>2</sub>-mediated oxidation of the initially formed [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> cluster is more labile, and differences in oxidation state of intermediate cluster irons could be an important stability factor throughout. Another factor that is likely to be of at least equal importance is the enhanced oxidation of cluster sulphide in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, which would be expected to accelerate the degradation of the [3Fe-4S], [3Fe-3S] and [2Fe-2S] forms towards apo-RirA. A comparison of the rate constants in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> suggests that both sulphide and iron oxidation processes are important for the overall enhanced rate of degradation towards apo-RirA in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Determination of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for binding of the fourth iron of the RirA [4Fe-4S] cluster</title><p>The data presented above point to the equilibrium [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> ↔ [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> + Fe<sup>2+</sup>, as being key for iron sensing.

In particular, the work further illustrates the remarkable potential of ESI-MS to provide time-resolved information on metallo-cofactor reactivity (that involves a change in mass), which is not available from other techniques. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the mechanism involves a complex series of events initiated by the loss of iron, resulting in a [3Fe-4S] intermediate that decays further to [3Fe-3S], [3Fe-2S] and [2Fe-2S] species along the pathway to apo-RirA. Importantly, ESI-MS and absorbance data showed that the iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) dissociation step occurs at a similar rate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, consistent with RirA functioning principally as an iron sensor.</p><p>Thus, the data presented here enabled us to elucidate at a molecular level the changes that occur in the transition from Fe-replete to Fe-depleted conditions. We propose a model in which the RirA [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster continually undergoes Fe<sup>2+</sup> dissociation, to form a [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form, and, under iron replete conditions, re-association to re-form [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup>. When cellular iron becomes scarce, competition for the dissociated Fe<sup>2+</sup> increases, and re-association is disfavoured. In order to effectively sense cytoplasmic iron levels, the affinity (dissociation constant) of the fourth cluster iron must be in the range of normal free (chelatable) iron levels. Although unknown for <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic>, cytoplasmic free iron has been measured for <italic>E. coli</italic> and found to be ~10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keyer and Imlay, 1996</xref>). Assuming that free iron levels are not very different in <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic>, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of ~3 µM determined here for the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> + Fe<sup>2+</sup> ↔ [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> equilibrium is entirely consistent with an iron-sensing function. Indeed, we note that Fur, the iron-sensing regulator of <italic>E. coli</italic>, binds Fe<sup>2+</sup> with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of ~1–10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagg and Neilands, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mills and Marletta, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although done in vitro, the parameters that emerged are in keeping with its role as a Fe-responsive regulator in vivo. Here, as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>), we have used the iron chelator EDTA to simulate low iron, via its ability to coordinate Fe<sup>2+</sup> that has dissociated from the RirA [4Fe-4S] cluster. While EDTA is clearly not a physiological ligand, it nevertheless induces low iron conditions by providing a sink for iron that simulates conditions under which cluster degradation occurs. Conditions such as this must exist in the cytosol of cells growing under iron-limiting conditions, where a myriad of iron-requiring systems are in competition for available iron, and where a drop in ‘free’ iron levels results in loss of RirA-mediated transcriptional repression leading to up-regulation of iron uptake systems.</p><p>Competitive loss of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> RirA results in a [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form that is unstable, undergoing degradation to an apo-form. This lability under low iron conditions is not a general property of [4Fe-4S] clusters, as previously demonstrated for the closely related [4Fe-4S] NsrR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>). This raises the question of why the RirA cluster is so fragile. One possibility is that the cluster is bound to the protein only by the three conserved Cys residues, with the tetrahedral coordination of the non-Cys bound iron completed by a weakly interacting ligand such as water or hydroxide. Such an arrangement, which would enhance the lability of the site-differentiated iron of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, would be similar to that found in the mammalian iron sensor protein IRE-BP (iron regulatory element-binding protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dupuy et al., 2006</xref>), and it is tempting to speculate that this may be a general feature of iron-sensing iron–sulphur clusters. We also note that the key step of iron-sensing in RirA, the simple equilibrium [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> ↔ [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> + Fe<sup>2+</sup>, mirrors the iron-sensing step of the better known bacterial global iron regulators Fur and DtxR in which Fe<sup>2+</sup> binds the apo-form of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Helmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pohl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D'Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 1996</xref>). However, the relative complexity of the RirA cofactor (co-repressor) enables it to also directly sense O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>A key step for O<sub>2</sub>-sensing is the oxidation of [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> to [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup>. The [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> intermediate was more reactive than the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form, and several other subsequently formed intermediates also showed higher reactivity, leading to an overall enhanced rate of degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The susceptibility of cluster iron and sulphide to oxidation in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> clearly drives the increased rate of cluster degradation. Thus, the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> cluster formed via the reversible dissociation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> RirA is susceptible to oxidation in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>. We propose that, even under iron-replete conditions, in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> some oxidation of the RirA [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form occurs before it can re-associate with Fe<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in cluster degradation.</p><p>Understanding how iron and O<sub>2</sub> signals are sensed and integrated is important for all organisms that depend on both iron and O<sub>2</sub>. In the case of <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic>, RirA regulates not only iron uptake, but also iron–sulphur cluster biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Todd et al., 2006</xref>). The RirA O<sub>2</sub>-sensing mechanism enables the cell to meet the requirement for iron–sulphur cluster biosynthesis under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imlay, 2006</xref>). Under low iron and in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, cluster degradation occurs more readily as a result of the combined effects of competition for iron and the enhanced rate of cluster degradation under oxidising conditions. The rate at which cluster conversion/degradation occurs is relatively slow, particularly compared to the rate at which the [4Fe-4S] ↔ [3Fe-4S] equilibrium is established. In some cases at least, sensing processes are relatively slow reactions. For example, the master regulator of the aerobic/anaerobic switch in many bacteria, [4Fe-4S] FNR, undergoes a similar [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] cluster conversion reaction over minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crack et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crack et al., 2007</xref>), with in vivo transcriptional responses occurring over a similar timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Partridge et al., 2007</xref>). Responses to changes in iron levels mediated by Fur also occur over several minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pi and Helmann, 2017</xref>). Thus, the cellular response to change does not necessarily need to occur instantly, perhaps reflecting that environmental changes themselves may occur over a period of time. The similarities between the FNR cluster conversion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crack et al., 2017</xref>) and that described here for RirA are remarkable in that the two proteins have no sequence or structural similarity beyond the cluster, and FNR does not sense iron levels; its cluster is stable in the presence of iron chelators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crack et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The advances reported here are relevant to all species that utilise RirA as a regulator, including several important pathogens of plants and animals. This work also contributes important new information about the widespread Rrf2 family of iron–sulphur cluster-binding regulators, and the variable ways in which they employ a cluster to sense environment change. Finally, it opens up new questions about RirA function, including: the nature of the cluster coordination; whether the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> ↔ [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> + Fe<sup>2+</sup> equilibrium and the mechanism of cluster disassembly are affected by [4Fe-4S] RirA complex formation with DNA; which steps of the degradation pathway are key for loss of DNA-binding; and, whether disruption of one cluster is sufficient to modulate DNA-binding of the RirA dimer. Efforts to address these are currently underway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> strain 8401)</td><td><italic>rirA</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>CAC35510</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td><italic>R. leguminosarum</italic> RirA</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td><italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> NifS</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crack et al., 2014b</xref></td><td/><td>The <italic>nifS</italic> plasmid was a kind gift from Prof. Dennis Dean (Virginia Tech)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td><sup>34</sup>S L-cysteine</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crack et al., 2019</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Origin</td><td>Origin Lab</td><td/><td>Version 8</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>DynaFit</td><td valign="bottom">BioKin Ltd; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuzmic, 1996</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008444">SCR_008444</ext-link></td><td>Version 4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Purification and reconstitution of [4Fe-4S] RirA</title><p><italic>R. leguminosarum</italic> RirA was over-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).

Mag-fura-2 forms a 1:1 complex with Fe<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in a shift of absorbance maximum from 366 nm (for metal-free mag-fura-2) to 325 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>). Mag-fura-2 was dissolved in ultra-pure water to give a 2 mM stock solution and stored at −80°C until needed. Titrations of ~7 µM [4Fe-4S] RirA in 25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 750 mM KCl, pH 7.5 with mag-fura-2 were carried out under anaerobic conditions at room temperature. Optimisation experiments showed that absorbance changes due to Fe<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the Mag-fura-2 occurred quickly and so UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Jasco V500 spectrometer immediately following each addition of the chelator, such that the titration was complete within ~60 min. Overnight incubation of RirA with Mag-fura-2 led to cluster conversion/breakdown, and increased coordination of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to the chelator. Thus, the dissociation of a single Fe<sup>2+</sup> from the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster occurred on a very different timescale to cluster conversion, permitting investigation of the [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S] equilibrium.</p><p>A potential difficulty of using this or any ligand that gives rise to absorbance in the UV-visible region is that its absorbance spectrum overlaps that of the RirA cluster. Furthermore, the absorbance due to the cluster changes upon loss of a single Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and so a robust method to correct for these changes was required. Fortunately, the absorbance profiles of apo- and divalent metal-bound mag-fura-2 overlap, with an isosbestic point at 346 nm, providing a means to correct for underlying absorbance changes due to the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simons, 1993</xref>). Firstly, the spectrum due to initial [4Fe-4S] cluster was subtracted from each subsequent spectrum. Then the data were normalised so that the resulting nest of spectra reported on the changing proportions of Fe<sup>2+</sup>-bound and apo-mag-fura-2. Finally, spectra were corrected for any changes in the subtracted cluster spectrum using a scaling factor that preserved the isosbestic point. Spectra of mag-fura-2 in apo and Fe<sup>2+</sup> forms (in the absence of RirA) were used to assist with this. Changes due to the scaling factor were &lt;0.07 absorbance units, within the range expected for the absorbance change during cluster conversion. From this, the percentage of maximum Fe<sup>2+</sup>-mag-fura-2 complex present (where 100% equated to the concentration of [4Fe-4S] RirA, that is one Fe<sup>2+</sup> per cluster) was plotted as a function of free mag-fura-2. This resulted in a plot with a hyperbolic form, which was fitted with an equation describing a simple binding isotherm using Origin8 (OriginLabs).

For kinetic modelling, in order to clearly resolve overlapping peaks, multiple Gaussian functions were fitted to the experimental data using a least-squares regression function in Origin 8 (Origin Lab) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laganowsky et al., 2013</xref>). Exact masses are reported from peak centroids representing the isotope average neutral mass. For apo-proteins, these are derived from m/z spectra, for which peaks correspond to [M + nH]<sup>n+</sup>/n. For cluster-containing proteins, where the cluster contributes charge, peaks correspond to [M + (Fe-S)<sup>x+</sup> + (n-x)H]<sup>n+</sup>/n, where M is the molecular mass of the protein, Fe-S is the mass of the particular iron–sulphur cluster of x+ charge, H is the mass of the proton and n is the total charge.

Time-resolved MS intensity data for global analysis was processed to generate relative abundance plots of ion counts for the relevant species as a fraction of the total ion count for all species. This permitted changes in relative abundance to be followed without distortions due to variations in ionisation efficiency that normally occur across a data collection run. Some variation in the starting spectrum was observed due to the presence of cluster breakdown products, which affected concentrations of intermediates during the cluster conversion/breakdown process; these variations are represented by error bars in the relative abundance plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>.

The presence of breakdown products in the starting spectrum was accounted for by allowing starting abundance to be offset from zero. Briefly, the kinetic model consisted of a series of sequential or branched reactions beginning with the dissociation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> to form [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> and the reverse reaction, the binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> to reform the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanisms of iron- and O<sub>2</sub>-sensing by the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the global iron regulator RirA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after extensive consultation between the reviewers. The reviewers' concerns are summarized below. We regret to inform you that in its present form, your work can not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, since all reviewers agreed that the work is technically elegant, innovative and exciting, we would be willing to consider a resubmission that addresses all concerns raised.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Pellicer Martinez et al., employs a combination of non-denaturing ESI-MS with more established techniques including UV-Vis absorption and EPR spectroscopy to elucidate the breakdown of the iron- and oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster from the global iron sensor RirA from Rhizobium.</p><p>The authors propose mechanisms of how RirA might sense iron (directly) and oxygen (indirectly) via different cluster degradation states.</p><p>The potential impact of this work stems from two angles: (1) providing insight into iron sensing in an agronomically important bacterium (and beyond, perhaps including mammalian IRE-BP), and (2) the sophisticated methodology employing non-denaturing ESI-MS with alternative stable isotopes that allow unambiguous assignment of cluster composition, at least in the monomer. Whilst neither using stable isotopes nor conducting kinetic experiments by ESI-MS are new, their application to iron-sulfur clusters, and using 34S, is innovative (as also demonstrated in a few recent papers by the same authors), and is likely to stimulate similar studies for other Fe-S proteins, where much remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The reviewers acknowledge that new FeS cluster states have been identified convincingly. However, a number of problems were identified, and are listed and elaborated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A convincing link of at least some of the (new) cluster states to the in vivo situation is missing.</p><p>The authors propose that Fe(II) reversibly dissociates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster leading to [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup>, and that this equilibrium is a key sensing mechanism for iron in the cell.</p><p>a) A key missing piece of information to support this mechanism is the affinity constant for the fourth iron (or indeed the seventh and eighth iron in the dimer). This could be determined, e.g., using a chelator competition assay (refer for an example to Rodrigues et al., 2015; they use Mag-fura-2, a metal chelator to determine iron equilibrium by UV-vis spectroscopy). The binding constant would then be expected to be in the range of cellular free iron.</p><p>b) A comment as to the suitability of EDTA to provide conditions of &quot;low iron&quot; would also be desirable. Is it thought that EDTA may abstract Fe(II) directly form the cluster, or are there two complexation equilibria at play? Are the conditions comparable to the bacterial cytosol?</p><p>c) Related to these issues: Is a [3Fe-4S] cluster RirA really binding with different affinity to DNA? In ref. (27), only [4Fe-4S], [2Fe-2S] and apo-forms were compared, and the [2Fe-2S] form bound (only) ca. 5-fold weaker.</p><p>Therefore, an affinity/dissociation constant for Fe(II) needs to be determined, and the proposed sensing mechanism needs to be put into physiological context.</p><p>2) What is the significance of the reported kinetic data?</p><p>The data are not only quite complex and require more elaborate explanations, but also need to be put into overall context.</p><p>a) There is a need to clarify the kinetic model(s) underlying the fits (first order/pseudo-first order?). The stoichiometry and mechanistic assumptions need to be laid out for each set of MS data fitted. This includes appropriate appreciation of involvement of monomers and dimers.</p><p>b) The magnitude of the reaction rates/kinetic constants: How do these relatively slow rates for cluster conversion relate to the physiological context? Why are the data reported in Pellicer Martinez et al., 2018 and those reported in the present manuscript so different (2 orders of magnitude)?</p><p>c) Furthermore, it appears that EDTA is added to mimic &quot;iron-depleted conditions&quot; – but can a direct removal of Fe by EDTA be excluded? This would require demonstrating independence of the reaction rates from EDTA concentration, or observing dissociation as a consequence of diluting holo RirA into buffer (which might perhaps also allow the determination of a dissociation constant).</p><p>d) Given that certain processes turn out to be affected by oligomerisation state (see subsection “Iron-responsive cluster conversion in dimeric [4Fe-4S] RirA revealed by mass spectrometry”), and that dimers will predominate in solution, it appears that the absorbance and EPR kinetic data should also be compared to the ESI-MS kinetic data of the dimer, inasmuch as this is possible (e.g. loss of the first two Fe(II) ions).</p><p>e) A related problem concerns the conflation of kinetics and thermodynamics. How may one conclude that there is no cooperativity when k(forward) is the same, but k(reverse) is larger in the dimer? Since KD = k(forward)/k(reverse) (for dissociation), it seems that binding of the &quot;eighth&quot; Fe(II) in the dimer would be stronger than in the monomer? Or could this be a consequence of the ESI conditions? Also – what does it mean when k2 and k-2 are equal? Perhaps it would be best not to invoke &quot;cooperativity&quot; at all (at least not with respect to ESI-MS results), as the monomers observed by ESI-MS are (mainly) generated from (reacted) dimers by the ESI process, rather than being already present in solution. In contrast, the Fe(II) dissociation is a process that occurs in solution, where the dimers dominate. These considerations also highlight that the significance of monomers and dimers has not yet been addressed thoroughly.</p><p>In summary, this part of the interpretation and discussion needs more thought, and may also be helped tremendously by the determination of a Fe(II) binding/dissociation constant requested above.</p><p>In relation to this part of the discussion, the authors also need to be careful with terms like &quot;stable&quot;, &quot;unstable&quot;, &quot;stability&quot; – these are thermodynamic, not kinetic terms. Perhaps &quot;reactive&quot; or &quot;labile&quot; would be more appropriate; but above all, the authors must take care to distinguish clearly between kinetics and thermodynamics.</p><p>3) The proposed mechanism of oxygen sensing via oxidation of the [3Fe-4S] cluster and accelerated degradation is not clearly and convincingly elucidated</p><p>It is proposed (mainly by EPR) that oxygen is sensed via oxidation to the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster intermediate. An EPR active species was observed at time zero (g = 2.01) and was assigned as the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> intermediate based on temperature and power dependencies (Figure 8). In the presence of oxygen the signal increased and decayed over time. This species, however, is present at the beginning of the experiment AND at the end in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Figure 8A,D). This unstable species should completely disappear under aerobic conditions (as predicted by the theoretical orange fitting curve in Figure 8C; overall poor fit!). Therefore, we are concerned that this initial signal at g = 2.01 is a (stable) species that may not necessarily be part of the reaction mechanism. Without error bars for the EPR data under anaerobic conditions in Figure 8C, it is hard to tell if the supposed intermediate actually increases with time.</p><p>The authors suggest that the initial difference in abundance of the [3Fe-4S] species between MS and EPR in Figure 8C is due to the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> species, which is EPR inactive (lines Subsection “The first step of 4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion is the O<sub>2</sub>-independent reversible loss of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to form [3Fe-4S]”). Can it be ruled out that the lack of EPR signal is simply due to the regulator converting from the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> state to the [3Fe-4S] state, in an oxygen dependent manner? This reaction would also explain the observation of the resolved buildup in the first couple of minutes of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> species by EPR. Does Fe dissociate from the [4Fe-4S] also in the absence of chelator? An explanation for the difference with MS could be that due to the ionization conditions of ESI-MS, temporal resolution of the initiation of the reaction is not possible. Without this resolution, the kinetic analysis that results from the speciation diagrams in Figure 4 and Figure 7 could be difficult to interpret. As displayed in Figure 2A, the ionization conditions of ESI-MS lead to many Fe-bound species at t = 0. Can the authors exclude that small amounts of oxygen at the injection port of the MS or in the dry gas may lead to the observed cluster decomposition at t = 0? Comparing Figure 2A and Figure 6A, there is sample variation before the addition of chelator, which may be the result of small amounts of oxygen. O<sub>2</sub> levels can be much better controlled in EPR sample preparation. Therefore overall, we feel it cannot be definitely concluded that O<sub>2</sub> is reacting with the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> species and not the [4Fe-4S] cluster.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanisms of iron- and O<sub>2</sub> -sensing by the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the global iron regulator RirA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David P. Giedroc (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Pellicer Martinez and coworkers provide elegant mechanistic studies on how RirA of Rhizobium may function as a global iron regulator through the decay of its [4Fe-4S] cluster. By using an assortment of spectroscopic and spectrometric methods, global reaction time courses for the conversion of various Fe/S cluster species are provided.</p><p>The work is significant in that it provides an impressive case study for how gentle ionization (ESI) or &quot;native-state&quot; mass spectrometry can be leveraged to learn something about intermediates along a reaction coordinate in a metal-sensing regulatory protein. Two key additional experiments substantially increase information content: (1) parallel experiments monitored by EPR under the same solution conditions; and (2) the dissociation of the first Fe from the cluster occurs with an equilibrium constant that is consistent with this equilibrium being &quot;tuned&quot; to the bioavailable Fe in the bacterial cell. The first is important in that minimizes a commonly raised criticism of (all) ESI-MS experiments like these, namely that the ionization process itself and injection into the gas phase, is perturbing the system. The second provides new insights into how one connects cluster disassembly to Fe-sensing in cells.</p><p>The authors further propose that RirA can additionally sense oxygen levels as evidenced by the increased rate of decay of an intermediate [3Fe-4S] species in the presence of oxygen.</p><p>The experimental data are sound and well controlled in the manuscript. This work is not the first where native ESI-MS has been applied to Fe-S clusters, and it is also not the first study on RirA either. Overall, the authors provide a nice follow-up study to their 2017 Chemical Science paper. RirA is thought to be operating in organisms that lack the conventional Fe-sensor, Fur, and thus detailed study of this metal sensor allows comparisons to previous (albeit less comprehensive) studies of Fur. This work also provides new regulatory insights into a member of the enigmatic Rrf2 family of putative oxygen and Fe-sensing regulators, which are generally lacking. We conclude that the topic as such and this work in particular is worthy of inclusion in <italic>eLife</italic>, based on quality, rigour, interest, and novelty. Future studies, especially work in vivo, will have to confirm the predictions from this in vitro study.</p><p>As far as the authors' responses to the joint reviewers' letter are concerned, we conclude that the concerns raised in the letter have been largely addressed. Remaining issues as listed below should be addressed in a (minor) revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Abstract: The phrase &quot;…for which K<sub>d</sub> = ~3 μM, consistent with this equilibrium sensing 'free' iron in the cell cytoplasm.&quot; sounds awkward and is not connected to the first part of the sentence. Further, it is not really explained in the Abstract how the authors envision iron and oxygen regulation. Please re-write and make these points clear.</p><p>Figure 4 and Figure 7: It is not fully clear to us why an apo species appears in Figure 4E (at least 70%) and 7F (plateau at 90%) but the A(382nm) does not decay substantially. As far as we understand, the cluster in MS analysis is gone after 30 min (all MS-detectable species are close to zero), but the colour at 382 nm remains. Please clarify and explain in text. Minor point: It may be didactically better to present Figure 4 and Figure 7 in the very same order.</p><p>It is also unclear how the presence of the initially present cluster breakdown products affects the kinetic data and their modelling. The authors state that &quot;The variation in the starting spectrum in terms of relative intensities does not affect the relative intensity behaviour of species as a function of time, as these are entirely reproducible.&quot; This is hard to comprehend – how can what is there at the start of a reaction not affect subsequent reactions? Perhaps the answer lies in what &quot;the relative intensity behaviour&quot; reflects and how it is used to arrive at the quantitative data, but this complication needs to be made clearer in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 5: The first equilibrium is shown for [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> going to a [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup>. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to show the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> species as the product of this first equilibrium, which then is converted to [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> in the presence of oxygen?</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1: The figure shows four highlighted Cys residues but only three are expected to be cluster coordinating. The homology model predicts that Cys17 is not close enough for cluster binding. This should be stated/clarified. It could also be stated that in the NsrR structure, Asp8 is the fourth coordinating residue. This Asp is not conserved in RirA.</p><p>One of the major previous concerns was the relation of the reported experiments to physiological context. In response, as requested by the reviewers, a dissociation constant for Fe(II) has been determined, even though – as the authors explain – they were concerned that this might not be possible due to the fragility of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> cluster formed in the initial &quot;sensing&quot; reaction. Surprisingly, the equilibrium titration worked nonetheless, with only ca. 1 Fe transferred to Mag-fura-2. An explanation why the subsequent cluster decay did, therefore, not happen (as the liberated Fe would also be picked up by the chelator) within the time frame of the experiment is missing. The time frame is mentioned but not specified. Was the titration done on a single solution, where subsequent additions of Mag-fura-2 were added to the same solution? Or does each point correspond to a different solution?</p><p>Further major concerns were related to erroneous kinetic constants – the ensuing corrections have addressed these concerns to a significant degree. This includes questions around the effects of oxygen.</p><p>However, in the discussion regarding the identity of the various adducts, the authors mention that O<sub>2</sub> can be generated in the ESI-MS source, and that this could be the origin of the adducts with oxygen. It is important to acknowledge this, and to clarify whether or not this phenomenon affects the results.</p><p>The question how the (relatively slow) kinetics observed in the current work relate to the processes occurring in vivo has been addressed in the response letter, but not necessarily in the manuscript. The conclusions mention continuous dissociation and association, but considering that kinetics are at the heart of the paper, it would be nice to have a comment on timescales here.</p><p>Finally, although the authors do a beautiful job exploring the disassembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster in RirA free in solution, they do not consider the impact that the bound DNA might have, in any way. If this is a true sensing mechanism then DNA binding by the repressing 4Fe-4S complex may well impact both the rate of dissociation of the &quot;fourth Fe&quot; as well as its equilibrium affinity (or not). Although we realize that such an investigation is well beyond the scope of this manuscript, simply ignoring this essential aspect of this system is less than satisfactory. We suggest the authors work a bit of this into their conclusions. Is it known whether the metallated RirA-DNA complex can be studied by native ESI-MS?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47804.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A convincing link of at least some of the (new) cluster states to the in vivo situation is missing.</p><p>The authors propose that Fe(II) reversibly dissociates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster leading to [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup>, and that this equilibrium is a key sensing mechanism for iron in the cell.</p><p>a) A key missing piece of information to support this mechanism is the affinity constant for the fourth iron (or indeed the seventh and eighth iron in the dimer). This could be determined, e.g., using a chelator competition assay (refer for an example to Rodrigues et al., 2015; they use Mag-fura-2, a metal chelator to determine iron equilibrium by UV-vis spectroscopy). The binding constant would then be expected to be in the range of cellular free iron.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment and for the suggestion of mag-fura-2 as a potentially useful ligand. We had not previously attempted to try to measure the affinity of the fourth iron for the cluster because we originally thought that the fragility of the cluster/subsequent breakdown of the [3Fe-4S] form would prevent us from doing this. However, following the reviewers’ advice, we have succeeded in determining the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> ↔ [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> + Fe<sup>2+</sup> equilibrium.</p><p>A potential problem of using mag-fura-2 as a competitive ligand is that its absorbance spectrum overlaps that of the RirA cluster (250 – 450 nm) (Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017). Given that the absorbance due to the cluster changes during the cluster conversion process, beginning with the [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S] equilibrium step, a method to correct for these changes was needed. Fortunately, both apo- and Fe<sup>2+</sup>-Mag-Fura-2 absorb and a titration results in an isosbestic point at 346 nm, as illustrated in Rodriguez et al.,2015, providing a convenient and robust means to correct for small underlying absorbance changes.</p><p>A series of titrations of [4Fe-4S] RirA with mag-fura-2 was carried out. To analyse the data, the spectrum due to initial [4Fe-4S] cluster was first subtracted from each subsequent spectrum. Then the data were normalised so that each spectrum simply reports on the proportions of Fe<sup>2+</sup>-bound and apo-mag-fura-2 present, and then corrected for any changes in the subtracted cluster spectrum by applying a correction factor to maintain the isosbestic point (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript). From this, the concentration of Fe<sup>2+</sup>-mag-fura-2 was determined at each point in the titration. Importantly, the concentration of Fe<sup>2+</sup>-mag-fura-2 plateaued at an equivalent of ~1 iron per cluster. This showed that one iron per cluster was readily available for complexation, confirming that the chelator experiments reported only on the [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S] equilibrium reaction (a requirement for determination of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>). A plot of percentage of maximum Fe<sup>2+</sup>-mag-fura-2 complex observed as a function of free mag-fura-2 concentration was generated. This had the form of a hyperbolic function and could be fitted as a simple binding isotherm using Origin8 (OriginLabs), yielding an apparent dissociation constant. This, of course, represents the competition between mag-fura-2 and [3Fe-4S] RirA for Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for RirA was determined from the expression:</p><p>KdMF2app=KdMF2(1+RirAKdRirA)</p><p>This gave a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 3 ± 0.2 µM (n = 3). Although the concentration of ‘free’ iron has not been reported for <italic>R. leguminosarum</italic>, it has been shown to be ~10 µM in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Keyer and Imlay, 1996), and Fur, the iron-sensing regulator of <italic>E. coli</italic>, binds Fe<sup>2+</sup> with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of ~1 – 10 µM (Bagg and Neilands, 1987; Mills and Marletta, 2005). There is no a priori reason to think that the values should be very different in other proteobacteria, including <italic>Rhizobium,</italic> so the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> measured here for RirA is entirely consistent with the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> to [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> equilibrium being the RirA iron-sensing step.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) A comment as to the suitability of EDTA to provide conditions of &quot;low iron&quot; would also be desirable. Is it thought that EDTA may abstract Fe(II) directly form the cluster, or are there two complexation equilibria at play? Are the conditions comparable to the bacterial cytosol?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown previously (Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017) that the rate of cluster degradation under anaerobic conditions showed no significant dependence on the concentration of EDTA. Furthermore, exposure to Chelex-100 resin separated from the protein by a semi-permeable membrane resulted in cluster conversion at a similar rate. Thus, low ‘free’ iron conditions are generated via the ability of iron chelators to coordinate Fe<sup>2+</sup> that has dissociated from the RirA [4Fe-4S] cluster (i.e. it involves two complexation equilibria: dissociation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from the cluster and then chelation of that Fe<sup>2+</sup> by the competing ligand (EDTA in this case). While EDTA is clearly not a physiological ligand, it nevertheless induces low iron conditions by providing a sink for iron, and thus simulates conditions under which cluster degradation occurs. Conditions such as this must exist in the cytosol under iron-limiting conditions, where a myriad of iron-requiring systems are in competition for available iron. A drop in ‘free’ iron levels results in degradation of the RirA cluster and up-regulation of iron uptake systems. We now describe the context of using EDTA in more detail in the revised manuscript both at first mention of EDTA and in the Conclusions section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Related to these issues: Is a [3Fe-4S] cluster RirA really binding with different affinity to DNA? In ref. (27), only [4Fe-4S], [2Fe-2S] and apo-forms were compared, and the [2Fe-2S] form bound (only) ca. 5-fold weaker.</p><p>Therefore, an affinity/dissociation constant for Fe(II) needs to be determined, and the proposed sensing mechanism needs to be put into physiological context.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we don’t formally propose that [3Fe-4S] RirA has a significantly different DNA-binding affinity than [4Fe-4S] RirA; it might, but we cannot stabilise it sufficiently to test it. The key point is that once [3Fe-4S] is formed under low iron conditions (or in presence of O<sub>2</sub>), it undergoes further conversion/degradation to the [2Fe-2S] and subsequently apo- forms, which we have shown bind DNA less tightly ([2Fe-2S]) or not at all (apo). So, even though the [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S] is the iron sensing step, the subsequent degradation of the cluster is required for the transduction of the signal. As explained above, we have determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for the binding of the fourth cluster iron and found that it is in the expected range for sensing free iron levels. We think that this and the revised discussion helps to frame the results reported here in a physiological context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the significance of the reported kinetic data?</p><p>The data are not only quite complex and require more elaborate explanations, but also need to be put into overall context.</p><p>a) There is a need to clarify the kinetic model(s) underlying the fits (first order/pseudo-first order?). The stoichiometry and mechanistic assumptions need to be laid out for each set of MS data fitted. This includes appropriate appreciation of involvement of monomers and dimers.</p></disp-quote><p>The kinetic model (illustrated in Figure 5) was based on a series of sequential/branched reactions beginning with the dissociation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> from [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> to form [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> and the reverse reaction, the binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> to reform the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster. This is the only second order step in the proposed mechanism; all other steps are first order. The kinetic data were analysed in terms of the kinetic model using the program DynaFit, which employs nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. Further explanation of the modelling is now given in the revised <italic>Methods</italic> section. We note that there was an error in Table 1, where the rate constant for the re-binding of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> was mis-reported. Our apologies for this error, which has now been corrected.</p><p>The significance of the kinetic data is that they reveal the mechanism of cluster conversion in detail. We would argue that the absolute rate constants determined are not so important, because the rate of reaction appears to be quite sensitive to the reaction conditions, e.g., buffer/pH, which most likely reflects the stability of the RirA protein and the lability of its cluster. However, the relative magnitudes of rate constants, which permit the observation of intermediate species, are important. Here, under a particular set of buffer conditions that permitted kinetic analysis by ESI-MS, UV-visible absorbance and EPR under identical conditions, the data show that the first step of the cluster degradation reaction is not affected by O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The ESI-MS data fitted here relate only to the monomeric form of RirA. Even though this was generated from the dimer during the measurement, no additional information relating to the dimer is contained with the data and so only the monomer form appears in the model. As described in the manuscript, we were also able to detect the dimeric form of RirA by ESI-MS (because the dissociation into monomers is partial). Although the kinetic modelling was limited by what can be assigned unambiguously, it is significant and consistent that the rate constants derived from the dimer data are similar to those obtained from the analysis of monomer (Table 1 and Supplementary file 2). Thus, there is no evidence for cooperativity between monomers of the dimer. However, because of the limited analyses of the dimer data, we take the reviewers’ later advice and do not address the issue of cooperativity in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The magnitude of the reaction rates/kinetic constants: How do these relatively slow rates for cluster conversion relate to the physiological context? Why are the data reported in reference 27 and those reported in the present manuscript so different (2 orders of magnitude)?</p></disp-quote><p>Reaction rates are indeed relatively slow, but in sensing processes, this is not particularly unusual. For example, the O<sub>2</sub> sensor FNR also undergoes a similar [4Fe-4S] to [2Fe-2S] cluster conversion reaction over minutes (shown in vitro and in vivo) (Crack et al., 2007; Crack et al.,2008) and so it is clear that response to change does not occur instantly. Perhaps this is because environmental changes themselves may occur over a period of time. The difference between rates measured here and those previously reported are in part addressed in our response to comment 2(a); under different buffer conditions, different rates are observed. Importantly, though, here we have measured rates by ESI-MS and absorbance (as a control) to ensure that these techniques are reporting on the same reaction. Why is the reaction rate higher in ammonium acetate? It is not clear, but the RirA cluster is clearly more labile in the ammonium acetate buffer. One factor that might be important is that acetate is weakly coordinating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Furthermore, it appears that EDTA is added to mimic &quot;iron-depleted conditions&quot; – but can a direct removal of Fe by EDTA be excluded? This would require demonstrating independence of the reaction rates from EDTA concentration, or observing dissociation as a consequence of diluting holo RirA into buffer (which might perhaps also allow the determination of a dissociation constant).</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in the answer to 1(b) above. We previously reported (Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017) that the rate of cluster degradation under anaerobic conditions showed no significant dependence on the concentration of EDTA, and a similar rate constant for cluster degradation to that observed with EDTA was measured in the presence of Chelex-100 resin (separated from the protein by a semi-permeable membrane), ruling out a direct interaction between the RirA cluster and EDTA. Indeed, the first indication of the lability of iron from the RirA [4Fe-4S] cluster came from gel filtration experiments (Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017) in which the amount of [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> present after the column was significantly greater than before (from undetectable to ~13% total cluster), indicating that dilution of RirA and separation from small molecules results in increased loss of a single iron from the cluster. Thus, data relevant to these questions are already available. Furthermore, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for this equilibrium has now been determined, see answer to 1(a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Given that certain processes turn out to be affected by oligomerisation state (see subsection “Iron-responsive cluster conversion in dimeric [4Fe-4S] RirA revealed by mass spectrometry”), and that dimers will predominate in solution, it appears that the absorbance and EPR kinetic data should also be compared to the ESI-MS kinetic data of the dimer, inasmuch as this is possible (e.g. loss of the first two Fe(II) ions).</p></disp-quote><p>Modelling of the RirA dimer ESI-MS data is difficult because of the described problem of assigning cluster species when more than one cluster is present. We have done this as best we can and the main conclusion arising from it is that there is not much difference between the monomer and dimer kinetic data. This is consistent with the monomer arising from dissociation of the dimer during ionisation. The only straightforward direct comparison with the dimer data that can be made is between [3Fe-4S] EPR data and the [3Fe-4S]/[3Fe-4S] species. This is now included as Figure 10—figure supplement 3. The absorbance data are also consistent in that they indicate that conversion/degradation occurs over the same timescale as observed for dimeric RirA species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) A related problem concerns the conflation of kinetics and thermodynamics. How may one conclude that there is no cooperativity when k(forward) is the same, but k(reverse) is larger in the dimer? Since KD = k(forward)/k(reverse) (for dissociation), it seems that binding of the &quot;eighth&quot; Fe(II) in the dimer would be stronger than in the monomer? Or could this be a consequence of the ESI conditions? Also – what does it mean when k2 and k-2 are equal? Perhaps it would be best not to invoke &quot;cooperativity&quot; at all (at least not with respect to ESI-MS results), as the monomers observed by ESI-MS are (mainly) generated from (reacted) dimers by the ESI process, rather than being already present in solution. In contrast, the Fe(II) dissociation is a process that occurs in solution, where the dimers dominate. These considerations also highlight that the significance of monomers and dimers has not yet been addressed thoroughly.</p><p>In summary, this part of the interpretation and discussion needs more thought, and may also be helped tremendously by the determination of a Fe(II) binding/dissociation constant requested above.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the monomer ESI-MS data can’t provide any information on cooperativity, and the dimer kinetic modelling is limited by the difficulty with unambiguous assignment, we agree that it is probably best not to discuss cooperativity in the manuscript. So, we have removed the sentence relating to this in the original version. Additionally, we apologise that there were errors in Table 2 (these resulted from a combination of a transposition error and using values from an earlier version of the modelling). These are now corrected, including <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub> as second order rate constants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In relation to this part of the discussion, the authors also need to be careful with terms like &quot;stable&quot;, &quot;unstable&quot;, &quot;stability&quot; – these are thermodynamic, not kinetic terms. Perhaps &quot;reactive&quot; or &quot;labile&quot; would be more appropriate; but above all, the authors must take care to distinguish clearly between kinetics and thermodynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a perfectly correct point, for which we thank the reviewers. We have addressed this in the way suggested in the Discussion/conclusions section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The proposed mechanism of oxygen sensing via oxidation of the [3Fe-4S] cluster and accelerated degradation is not clearly and convincingly elucidated</p><p>It is proposed (mainly by EPR) that oxygen is sensed via oxidation to the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> cluster intermediate. An EPR active species was observed at time zero (g = 2.01) and was assigned as the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> intermediate based on temperature and power dependencies (Figure 8). In the presence of oxygen the signal increased and decayed over time. This species, however, is present at the beginning of the experiment AND at the end in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Figure 8A,D). This unstable species should completely disappear under aerobic conditions (as predicted by the theoretical orange fitting curve in Figure 8C; overall poor fit!). Therefore, we are concerned that this initial signal at g = 2.01 is a (stable) species that may not necessarily be part of the reaction mechanism. Without error bars for the EPR data under anaerobic conditions in Figure 8C, it is hard to tell if the supposed intermediate actually increases with time.</p></disp-quote><p>It is already established that the RirA [4Fe-4S] cluster is prone to loss of a single iron during sample manipulation and so the detection of a small component (~4%) of cluster in a [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> form (and some also present in the EPR-silent [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form) was not unexpected. That this signal does not significantly increase under anaerobic conditions following exposure to an iron chelator is consistent with the absence of an oxidant that would generate the EPR active form. That the signal does not entirely decay away, remaining at ~4% after 21 mins, was also not expected initially, but we have seen this kind of behaviour before, with the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing regulator FNR, where the EPR-active intermediate also does not entirely decay away to zero (unpublished observations). It is likely that a small proportion of cluster gets stuck in the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> form, as an off-pathway product. However, this does not affect at all the main conclusion of these experiments – that the presence of O<sub>2</sub> results in significant oxidation of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> form to [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup>. This is an indisputable conclusion from the EPR data. Nevertheless, we have now addressed the lingering [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> signal in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that the initial difference in abundance of the [3Fe-4S] species between MS and EPR in Figure 8C is due to the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> species, which is EPR inactive (Subsection “The first step of 4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion is the O<sub>2</sub>-independent reversible loss of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to form [3Fe-4S]”). Can it be ruled out that the lack of EPR signal is simply due to the regulator converting from the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> state to the [3Fe-4S] state, in an oxygen dependent manner? This reaction would also explain the observation of the resolved buildup in the first couple of minutes of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> species by EPR.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure that we follow this point. The reviewers ask if we can ‘rule out that the lack of EPR signal is simply due to the regulator converting from the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> state to the [3Fe-4S] state, in an oxygen dependent manner’. They don’t specify that charge associated with the [3Fe-4S] cluster, but because they’re referring to an EPR silent form, we presume they mean [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup>? If so, then we are not sure why we would conclude that this is O<sub>2</sub>-dependent, particularly when we observe the same rate constants in the presence and absence of O<sub>2</sub>. We think that the simplest interpretation of the data is that [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> is generated as the first step, and this is oxidised to the [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> state when O<sub>2</sub> is present. That [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> is the first intermediate under anaerobic conditions is supported by the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> determination measurements now included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does Fe dissociate from the [4Fe-4S] also in the absence of chelator? An explanation for the difference with MS could be that due to the ionization conditions of ESI-MS, temporal resolution of the initiation of the reaction is not possible. Without this resolution, the kinetic analysis that results from the speciation diagrams in Figure 4 and Figure 7 could be difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We’re not sure which difference the reviewers are referring to. We measured the cluster conversion/degradation under identical conditions by ESI-MS and absorbance, observing the same rate constants for the initial reaction in both. Therefore, it is clear that the ESI-MS is faithfully reporting on the kinetics of cluster breakdown. Iron continuously dissociates from and re-associates with the RirA cluster in the absence of chelator. Re-association is affected in the presence of an iron-binding competitor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As displayed in Figure 2A, the ionization conditions of ESI-MS lead to many Fe-bound species at t = 0.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we acknowledge this issue. We think that this is due to the variable loss of some [4Fe-4S] clusters during the exchange of the RirA sample into ammonium acetate buffer for ESI-MS measurements, resulting in some cluster breakdown species. To investigate this further, we measured changes in the ESI-MS spectra recorded at 5 min compared to that after 37 min of RirA under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an iron chelator, see Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We observed that the [3Fe-2S] and [3Fe-3S] peaks reduced in intensity, while the [2Fe] and [2Fe-2S] increased, indicating that these part-degraded clusters continue to degrade. There is no apparent drop off in [4Fe-4S] and only minor increases in apo-forms, indicating that the [4Fe-4S] form that survived the buffer exchange is stable in the absence of either an iron chelator or O<sub>2</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors exclude that small amounts of oxygen at the injection port of the MS or in the dry gas may lead to the observed cluster decomposition at t = 0?</p></disp-quote><p>The answer above is also relevant here – if O<sub>2</sub> were an issue, we would continually observe the breakdown of clusters. After sitting in the injection syringe for half an hour, cluster breakdown products had decayed further. This is consistent with our previous measurements of O<sub>2</sub>-mediated FNR cluster degradation by ESI-MS (Crack et al., 2017). In that study we used the same methodology to exclude O<sub>2</sub> as employed here. We were able to measure the [4Fe-4S] FNR species for 2 hours in the absence of O<sub>2</sub> without decomposition, demonstrating that O<sub>2</sub> is not a significant factor in the injection port (which is flushed with deoxygenated buffer prior to measurements).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comparing Figure 2A and Figure 6A, there is sample variation before the addition of chelator, which may be the result of small amounts of oxygen. O<sup>2</sup> levels can be much better controlled in EPR sample preparation. Therefore overall, we feel it cannot be definitely concluded that O<sup>2</sup> is reacting with the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> species and not the [4Fe-4S] cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>There is some variation in the extent of cluster breakdown products from one experiment to another (as further emphasised in the figure above). We think this arises from some variation in the extent to which the [4Fe-4S] is partially degraded during the buffer exchange, and not due to reaction with O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, if [4Fe-4S] were reacting directly with O<sub>2</sub> we would see an O<sub>2</sub> dependence of the reaction. We don’t – we observed the same rate for the initial reaction (by ESI-MS and absorbance) in the absence and presence of O<sub>2</sub> (as mentioned in the manuscript, and this was also reported in Pellicer Martinez et al., 2017). The variation in the starting spectrum in terms of relative intensities does not affect the relative intensity behaviour of species as a function of time, as these are entirely reproducible.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Abstract: The phrase &quot;…for which Kd = ~3 μM, consistent with this equilibrium sensing 'free' iron in the cell cytoplasm.&quot; sounds awkward and is not connected to the first part of the sentence.

As far as we understand, the cluster in MS analysis is gone after 30 min (all MS-detectable species are close to zero), but the colour at 382 nm remains. Please clarify and explain in text. Minor point: It may be didactically better to present Figure 4 and Figure 7 in the very same order.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Significant A382 nm intensity remains at t=30 min, even though ESI-MS demonstrates that no [4Fe-4S] remains at this point and the major species detected are apo-forms of RirA. A382 nm arises from a range of contributing transitions, including from [2Fe-2S] and [2Fe] and other forms of Fe/S. Firstly, both [2Fe-2S] and [2Fe] are present in the 30 min ESI-MS spectrum under anaerobic conditions, and there is some [2Fe] under aerobic conditions (and we note that the ionization efficiency of species vary and so the relative abundances do not necessarily directly reflect absolute solution concentrations).</p><p>Secondly, and more importantly, Fe/S that were previously part of the Fe-S cluster remain, either bound to the protein, weakly attached, or in solution/suspension as Fe-S species, or as iron acetate (the red-brown colour of Fe(III) acetate was commonly used to quantitate Fe(III) in solution). All of these contribute to A382 nm but only Fe/S species tightly bound to the protein (which thus survives ionization) are detected by ESI-MS. The nature of the residual species may be different under anaerobic/aerobic conditions, and the greater percentage decrease in A382 nm observed in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> correlates with the enhanced level of sulfide oxidation observed under aerobic conditions (Figure 7), which would limit the availability of sulfide for complexation with released iron. Evidence for low molecular weight species, generated during cluster conversion, that contribute to A382 nm was previously reported (ref 28, supplementary data). In that study, a significant decrease in absorbance following passage of chelator-exposed [4Fe-4S] RirA down a gel filtration column was observed. The uncertainty of what A382 nm is due to essentially reflects the need to find new methods, such as we have applied here, that can determine which protein-bound FeS species are actually present.</p><p>We have added sentences to the legends of Figure 4 and Figure 7 to acknowledge/account for this point.

The authors state that &quot;The variation in the starting spectrum in terms of relative intensities does not affect the relative intensity behaviour of species as a function of time, as these are entirely reproducible.&quot; This is hard to comprehend – how can what is there at the start of a reaction not affect subsequent reactions? Perhaps the answer lies in what &quot;the relative intensity behaviour&quot; reflects and how it is used to arrive at the quantitative data, but this complication needs to be made clearer in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, the variation in the starting spectrum will indeed lead to variation in the relative intensities of intermediate species – these are represented by the error bars in the plots of Figure 4 and Figure 7. The behaviour of the relative intensities (in terms of increases/decreases) was found to be entirely reproducible, allowing rate constants to be estimated from the modelling. The starting intensities due to intermediates (which we have shown arise from some cluster breakdown during buffer exchange) were dealt with in the modelling by allowing these to be offset from zero at t = 0 (clearly no mechanism exists that can account for intermediates at t = 0!). We have clarified these issues in the manuscript (Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The first equilibrium is shown for [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> going to a [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup>. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to show the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> species as the product of this first equilibrium, which then is converted to [3Fe-4S]<sup>1+</sup> in the presence of oxygen?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we see the point here and agree – we have edited the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1: The figure shows four highlighted Cys residues but only three are expected to be cluster coordinating. The homology model predicts that Cys17 is not close enough for cluster binding. This should be stated/clarified. It could also be stated that in the NsrR structure, Asp8 is the fourth coordinating residue. This Asp is not conserved in RirA.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out – we have removed highlighting of Cys17 and added the points mentioned to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the major previous concerns was the relation of the reported experiments to physiological context. In response, as requested by the reviewers, a dissociation constant for Fe(II) has been determined, even though – as the authors explain – they were concerned that this might not be possible due to the fragility of the [3Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> cluster formed in the initial &quot;sensing&quot; reaction. Surprisingly, the equilibrium titration worked nonetheless, with only ca. 1 Fe transferred to Mag-fura-2. An explanation why the subsequent cluster decay did, therefore, not happen (as the liberated Fe would also be picked up by the chelator) within the time frame of the experiment is missing. The time frame is mentioned but not specified. Was the titration done on a single solution, where subsequent additions of Mag-fura-2 were added to the same solution? Or does each point correspond to a different solution?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment and we can see that we weren’t sufficiently clear in our description of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> experiments. We initially established that the first Fe<sup>2+</sup>, but not more than this, was available for chelation essentially immediately (i.e. complete before we could measure an absorbance spectrum), with cluster conversion occurring over a much longer time period (several hours, as previously reported). This was an important finding because it meant that the suggested <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> experiments were indeed feasible. The titrations were done with single solutions of RirA, to which increasing concentrations of mag-fura-2 were added. Because Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelation occurred rapidly, there was no requirement for prolonged incubation of samples between additions, and each titration was completed in ~60 mins, enabling us to measure the equilibrium distribution of the single available Fe<sup>2+</sup> between RirA and the chelator before any significant cluster degradation. We have added further details of the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> measurements to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further major concerns were related to erroneous kinetic constants – the ensuing corrections have addressed these concerns to a significant degree. This includes questions around the effects of oxygen.</p><p>However, in the discussion regarding the identity of the various adducts, the authors mention that O<sub>2</sub> can be generated in the ESI-MS source, and that this could be the origin of the adducts with oxygen. It is important to acknowledge this, and to clarify whether or not this phenomenon affects the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this in the section of the manuscript entitled ‘The effect of O<sub>2</sub> on [4Fe-4S] RirA cluster conversion by mass spectrometry’, where we now further acknowledge that some O<sub>2</sub> may be generated during the ESI-MS experiment. We conclude, though, that the significant differences between the anaerobic and aerobic datasets indicate that O<sub>2</sub> generated during the ESI-MS experiment is minor. Indeed, as we previously mentioned in our first response to reviewers comments, the fact that we can readily detect O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive [4Fe-4S] FNR using the same methodology is consistent with relatively minor amounts of O<sub>2</sub>. Again, the differences observed between the anaerobic and aerobic datasets indicate that any O<sub>2</sub> generated does not significantly affect the results, and we note that the O adducts observed are confined to apo-RirA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The question how the (relatively slow) kinetics observed in the current work relate to the processes occurring in vivo has been addressed in the response letter, but not necessarily in the manuscript. The conclusions mention continuous dissociation and association, but considering that kinetics are at the heart of the paper, it would be nice to have a comment on timescales here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in the conclusion section a paragraph exploring the timescales of sensing processes, along the lines of our response to the reviewers’ initial comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, although the authors do a beautiful job exploring the disassembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster in RirA free in solution, they do not consider the impact that the bound DNA might have, in any way. If this is a true sensing mechanism then DNA binding by the repressing 4Fe-4S complex may well impact both the rate of dissociation of the &quot;fourth Fe&quot; as well as its equilibrium affinity (or not). Although we realize that such an investigation is well beyond the scope of this manuscript, simply ignoring this essential aspect of this system is less than satisfactory. We suggest the authors work a bit of this into their conclusions. Is it known whether the metallated RirA-DNA complex can be studied by native ESI-MS?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and one that we are actively working on. Our previous studies of NsrR and FNR bound to DNA led to the conclusion that their reaction mechanisms with nitric oxide and O<sub>2</sub>, respectively, are not affected by DNA-binding (Crack et al., 2016 and Crack et al., 2014), but this may not be the case for iron/O<sub>2</sub>-sensing by RirA and that is something we plan to investigate. And, yes, we are exploring the potential to study regulator-DNA complexes using ESI-MS. We do actually raise some of the important remaining questions about RirA in the final paragraph of the conclusions, including aspects of DNA-binding. But we did not specifically raise the point about effects on <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> or cluster conversion mechanism, and so we have now included these outstanding future challenges in the final paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
