on their surface as key proteins involved in their identity, biogenesis, and fusion. Rab activation requires a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is Mon1-Ccz1 for Rab7. During endosome maturation, Rab5 is replaced by Rab7, though the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular determinants for Rab conversion in vivo and in vitro, and reconstitute Rab7 activation with yeast and metazoan proteins. We show (i) that Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5, (ii) that membrane-bound Rab5 is the key factor to directly promote Mon1-Ccz1 dependent Rab7 activation and Rab7-dependent membrane fusion, and (iii) that this process is regulated in yeast by the casein kinase Yck3, which phosphorylates Mon1 and blocks Rab5 binding. Our study thus uncovers the minimal feed-forward machinery of the endosomal Rab cascade and a novel regulatory mechanism controlling this pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rab5</kwd><kwd>GEF</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>Rab cascade</kwd><kwd>Rab7</kwd><kwd>Mon1-Ccz1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kümmel</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Ungermann</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reconstitution of the endosomal Rab cascade reveals that Rab5 binds and activates the Mon1-Ccz1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which in turn recruits Rab7 to membranes to drive fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In any eukaryotic cell the endolysosomal pathway is regulated by two members of the Rab subfamily of small GTPases, namely Rab5 and Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langemeyer et al., 2018a</xref>). Endocytic vesicles carrying cargo molecules pinch off at the plasma membrane and fuse in a Rab5-dependent manner with early endosomes. Early endosomes undergo fusion with other early endosomes, which in the end mature into late endosomes. All these organelles carry Rab5 as an identity marker. On the verge to late endosomes the identity changes from a Rab5-positive to a Rab7-positive compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). This allows fusion with the lysosome, where endocytic cargo is degraded.</p><p>Rab GTPases cycle between a GDP-bound (Rab-GDP) and a GTP-bound (Rab-GTP) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goody et al., 2017</xref>). To switch between these two forms, they need regulatory proteins. Rab-specific Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEF) bind to the Rab GTPase and stabilize the nucleotide-free form to allow dissociation of bound nucleotide and binding of the more abundant GTP. GTPase-Activating Proteins (GAP) are needed to complete the active site of Rab GTPases to hydrolyze bound GTP to GDP. Only when bound to GTP the Rab GTPase can interact with specific effector proteins. Effectors then function as tethering factors, motor proteins or localize specific enzymes, thereby giving a functional identity to organelles.</p><p>Rab GTPases are C-terminally prenylated and can thus bind membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goody et al., 2017</xref>). They are kept soluble in the cytosol by binding in their GDP-form to the Rab Escort Protein (REP) in the context of their posttranslational prenylation or to the Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor (GDI) as their general Rab chaperone. Prenylated Rab GTPases then sample randomly membranes in the cell by dissociating from the chaperone. This process has been postulated to be favored by GDI Displacement Factors (GDF), hence providing another layer of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dirac-Svejstrup et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calero and Collins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sivars et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heidtman et al., 2005</xref>). As long as Rab GTPases are not activated, GDI is able to extract the Rab-GDP again. When the Rab GTPase encounters its cognate GEF on a membrane, it is activated by nucleotide exchange and can then bind effectors. The cycle completes, when the corresponding GAP triggers GTP-hydrolysis, and GDI then removes the Rab from the membrane.</p><p>Within the endolysosomal system, Rab5 marks early endosomes, whereas Rab7 is found on late endosomes, autophagosomes, and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavrier et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucci et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wichmann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horazdovsky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McEwan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). The Rab5 family has four members in human cells (Rab5a, 5b, 5c, 5d), one member in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (RAB5), and at least three members in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Vps21, Ypt52, Ypt53). In human cells, Rab5 is activated by its GEF Rabex-5 in complex with the Rab5 effector Rabaptin5, which function together in a positive feedback loop to form a Rab5-domain on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, at least three Rab5-GEFs have been identified, which may function similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burd et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paulsel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabrera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bean et al., 2015</xref>). We and others identified the Mon1-Ccz1 complex as the Rab7 GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerondopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). In yeast, Mon1-Ccz1 forms a dimer, whereas metazoan cells have a third subunit, named RMC1 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaites et al., 2018</xref>), and Bulli in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Dehnen et al., submitted).</p><p>The Rab5-to-Rab7 transition in the endolysosomal pathway is thought to work as a so called Rab-cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Conte-Zerial et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfeffer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langemeyer et al., 2018a</xref>). According to prevailing models, Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5, and interactions have been shown by yeast-two- and three-hybrid studies and in pulldown experiments from lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Mon1-Ccz1 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, PI-3-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>), which is present on endosomes and autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schu et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kihara et al., 2001</xref>), and functions on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yasuda et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that Mon1/Sand1 alone can displace the Rab5 GEF Rabex-5 from membranes, thus promoting Rab5 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). A similar cascade of a Rab5 to Rab7 transition has been observed on mitochondria in vivo during Parkin-induced mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamano et al., 2018</xref>). Also here, Mon1-Ccz1 inactivation impaired Rab7 recruitment. Finally, Mon1-Ccz1 binds the LC3-like Atg8 protein and can thus recruit Ypt7 to the yeast autophagosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the evidence that Mon1-Ccz1 can interact with Rab5 and the consecutive order of Rab5 to Rab7 transition on endosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>), there is a lack of mechanistic understanding of this process. Mon1-Ccz1 is obviously key to the Rab5-to-Rab7 transition, but is it also sufficient to drive this process? Is binding to both Rab5-GTP and PI-3-P required for membrane binding and activity?</p><p>To address these questions in detail, we reconstituted the Rab5-to-Rab7 transition in vitro by using prenylated Rab5 and Rab7 as soluble factors in complex with their chaperones REP and GDI, and liposomes to mimic the in vivo situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langemeyer et al., 2018b</xref>). We now show that prenylated Rab5 on these membranes is necessary and sufficient to drive Mon1-Ccz1 dependent nucleotide exchange on prenylated Rab7, and subsequently membrane fusion – both in yeast and metazoan cells. In yeast, this process is strongly inhibited and thus regulated by the casein kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation of Mon1. We thus provide an important step in the mechanistic understanding of the endosomal Rab cascade and thus the elucidation of the fundamental principles and regulatory circuits underlying organelle maturation in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rab5 is necessary for Mon1-Ccz1 function in vivo</title><p>To address the role of PI-3-P and Rab5-like proteins for Mon1-Ccz1 targeting to endosomes or vacuoles, we used the lipophilic dye FM4-64, which is transported in yeast via the endocytic pathway toward the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vida and Emr, 1995</xref>). Wild-type cells take up FM4-64 readily, which results in staining of large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, in mutants lacking <italic>mon1</italic> less than 10% of the cells showed a normal vacuolar morphology. Cells deleted for the endosomal Vps30 subunit of the PI-3-Kinase complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kihara et al., 2001</xref>), or two members of the Rab5-family, Vps21 and Ypt52, which upon deletion impair CORVET or retromer targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabrera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paulsel et al., 2013</xref>), had wild-type like vacuoles. Similarly, combinations of different knockouts of members of the Rab5-family did not impair overall vacuole morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, deleting Vps30, Vps21 and Ypt52 together interfered with a normal endolysosomal maturation and fusion process and resulted in fragmented vacuoles as observed in <italic>mon1</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These observations agree with the current model of Rab7 activation on late endosomes, which suggests that Mon1-Ccz1 is brought to the endosomal membrane jointly by active Rab5 or the interaction with PI-3-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langemeyer et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rab5 effect on Mon1-Ccz1 function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vacuole morphology in Rab5 mutants.

To test for direct interaction, we purified 9 out of the 11 yeast Rab-GTPases fused to a C-terminal GST-tag. Rabs were loaded with GDP or GTP, immobilized on GSH-Sepharose, and incubated with purified Mon1-Ccz1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then probed eluates from beads for bound Mon1-Ccz1 by using an antibody against the TAP-tag on Ccz1. Surprisingly, we only detected weak interactions with most of the tested Rab-GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), including either one of the well-studied Rab5-family members Vps21, Ypt52, or Ypt53. However, we observed a strong interaction with Ypt10-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This poorly characterized Rab-GTPase has been assigned to the Rab5-family previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buvelot Frei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lo et al., 2011</xref>), and localizes to FM4-64 positive structures in yeast Ypt10 overexpression interferes with the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Louvet et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that the protein functions as a Rab5 protein under special growth conditions as shown for Ypt53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paulsel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the endogenously expressed GFP-tagged Ypt10 and Ccz1-mCherry colocalized in dot-like structures proximal to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We therefore took advantage of Ypt10 in further assays as the strongest Mon1-Ccz1 interactor among yeast Rab5-like proteins.</p><p>We next asked if localization of Ypt7 to vacuoles requires indeed Rab5-like proteins, and thus localized functional mNEON-tagged Ypt7 in several deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, none of the single Rab5 deletions showed altered Ypt7 localization. However, deletion of both Vps21 and Ypt52 resulted in a dot-like localization of Ypt7, whereas FM4-64 still stained round vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,F</xref>). This suggests that Rab5-proteins can affect Ypt7 localization in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mon1-Ccz1 membrane association requires charged lipids and Rab5 proteins</title><p>The Mon1-Ccz1 complex can interact with activated Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2014</xref>) and associates with membranes containing PI-3-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>).

When prenylated Vps21 was included, the membrane association of Mon1-Ccz1 increased further (46%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), comparable with Mon1-Ccz1 membrane association in the presence of prenylated Ypt10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that Mon1-Ccz1 takes advantage of a dual targeting mechanism to bind membranes via lipids and Rab5. We also observed comparable binding to membranes carrying other charged lipids at concentrations adjusted for equimolar negative charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, Mon1-Ccz1 seems to interact with phospholipids via unspecific electrostatic interactions rather than specific lipid head group recognition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Membrane recruitment of Mon1-Ccz1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Liposome binding assay.

If this were the case, then lower concentrations of recruiter on the membrane may reveal differences in GEF activity. However, lower concentrations of pRab5 in the recruiter assay resulted in the same activity of dimer and trimer as reflected by the similar rate constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). These data show that the ability of Rab5-dependent activation requires just the Mon1-Ccz1 core components – in metazoan and yeast.

Mon1-Ccz1 activity was limiting for Ypt7 recruitment and activation and thus HOPS function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langemeyer et al., 2018b</xref>). As Rab5 can promote Rab7 activation, we expected that a Rab5-like protein could also trigger the membrane fusion machinery in vitro. We reasoned that the presence of a recruiter GTPase such as pYpt10 should lower the demand of Mon1-Ccz1 to initiate the fusion process. First, we titrated Mon1-Ccz1 into the fusion reaction, and detected only minimal fusion at 12.5 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). However, in the presence of the recruiter pYpt10, this fusion strongly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When we tested the membrane fraction after fusion for the presence of Mon1-Ccz1, we observed comparable amounts of Ccz1 in the membrane fraction. In contrast, the Ypt7-effector Vps41 as a subunit of HOPS was strongly enriched on membranes in the presence of Ypt10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This indicates that Mon1-Ccz1 associates with membranes independently of a recruiter GTPase. Importantly, only in the presence of a Rab5-recruiter, Mon1-Ccz1 can exert sufficient GEF-activity to drive Ypt7 activation, and therey HOPS recruitment and fusion. This suggests that Rab5 directly stimulates catalytic activity of Mon1-Ccz1 beyond promoting binding to the membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Rab5 can trigger Rab7-dependent fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the Rab5-dependent fusion assay.

This abolishes the interaction with Rab5 and may in addition lead to a release of Mon1-Ccz1 from the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56090-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of yeast Mon1-Cz1 by Yck3 in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mon1-Ccz1 was incubated with different amounts of recombinantly produced Yck3 in the presence of ATP regenerating system for 30 min at 27°C.

It was known that Mon1-Ccz1 interacts with Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2014</xref>) and PI-3-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>). Also, the sequential appearance of Rab5, Mon1, and Rab7 on endosomal membranes was observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>) and has been supported by theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Conte-Zerial et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, it was shown that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of Mon1, Sand1, can displace the Rab5 GEF from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>), which would interrupt the previously described positive-feedback-loop of Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horiuchi et al., 1997</xref>). Despite the fact that the mechanism of Mon1-Ccz1 GEF-activity towards Rab7 has been revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiontke et al., 2017</xref>), there was little mechanistic understanding of how Mon1-Ccz1 function on endosomes is coordinated in vivo.</p><p>Here we demonstrate the first reconstitution of the endosomal Rab-cascade, where we recapitulate the transition from Rab5 to Rab7. We show that the Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex has a dual membrane targeting mechanism by binding both Rab5 and charged lipids like PI-3-P. Phospholipid interactions show no specificity for particular head groups but are driven by electrostatic interactions. Our data reveal that Mon1-Ccz1 is an evolutionarily conserved effector of Rab5, both in yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Once bound to Rab5-GTP, it can activate and thereby stably localize Rab7, which was previously soluble and in complex with GDI. Using the yeast system, we show that Rab5-GTP can be limiting for Ypt7 and HOPS driven, SNARE-dependent membrane fusion. Importantly, Rab5 binding strongly stimulates the catalytic activity of Mon1-Ccz1. The process of Mon1-Ccz1 membrane association and Rab5 interaction can be regulated by casein kinase-mediated Mon1-Ccz1 phosphorylation, most likely by promoting release of Mon1-Ccz1 from Rab5 and thus vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>While our data now recapitulate the essential role of Mon1-Ccz1 in Rab7 recruitment and activation from the GDI complex, we do not yet understand the exact crosstalk of Mon1-Ccz1 with Rab5 and PI-3-P levels on endosomes. The PI-3-Kinase Vps34 is a Rab5 effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christoforidis et al., 1999</xref>), and thus Rab5 and PI-3-P levels should both increase when endosomes grow and mature. Endosomal Rabs are not uniformly distributed along the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sönnichsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franke et al., 2019</xref>), which could result in selective enrichment of Mon1-Ccz1 and thus Rab7 to distinct domains on endosomes. Moreover, in vivo analyses showed the transition from Rab5 to Mon1 and Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that the interaction with charged lipids is insufficient for Mon1-Ccz1 GEF activity, yet may help for initial targeting to endosomes or autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement, we observe a synergistic effect of charged lipids and Rab5 in Mon1-Ccz1 binding to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, for GEF-activity of Mon1-Ccz1 towards prenylated Rab7/Ypt7:GDI recruitment by charged lipids was insufficient, and we required membrane-bound Rab5-GTP in the recruiter GEF assay, suggesting that Rab5 has a critical, and possibly rate-limiting role in Mon1-Ccz1 activity on membranes.</p><p>By utilizing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rab5-Rab7 system, we now provide evidence that the Rab5-dependent Mon1-Ccz1 GEF-activity is also conserved across species, and likely extends to the homologous mammalian complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaites et al., 2018</xref>). We could not observe any strong difference in the behavior of the dimeric and trimeric Rab7-GEF-complex, indicating that the third subunit does not influence the overall GEF-activity as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaites et al., 2018</xref>). Our data thus agree with our structural analyses of the Mon1-Ccz1 core complex, where we showed that the GEF activity depends solely on the Mon1-Ccz1 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiontke et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, human dimeric Mon1-Ccz1 complex is sufficient to activate Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerondopoulos et al., 2012</xref>), in agreement with recent findings on the related Rab23 GEF complex of Inturned-Fuzzy and its third subunit WDECP/fritz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerondopoulos et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, our data directly show that Rab5-interaction with the Mon1-Ccz1 subcomplex of the trimeric complex is preserved across species and does not depend on the third subunit. It is likely that the third subunit acts beyond the Mon1-Ccz1 GEF activity, an issue for future analyses.</p><p>In the yeast system, we identify the Rab5-like Ypt10 as a new interactor of Mon1-Ccz1. Ypt10 colocalizes with and strongly binds to Mon1-Ccz1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). We thus consider Ypt10 as a member of the Rab5-family in yeast. In agreement, overproduction of Ypt10 affects the endomembrane system and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Louvet et al., 1999</xref>), even though its detailed function on endosomal membranes remains to be analyzed.</p><p>In sum, our findings show that the GEF Mon1-Ccz1 is both necessary and sufficient for the endosomal Rab5 to Rab7 transition, in agreement with in vivo analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). They thus explain, how GEF localization and activation can drive organelle transition, and how Rabs can thus act consecutively. This model nicely agrees with previously implied Rab cascades, which were mainly based on in vivo correlation in Rab and GEF localization and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pusapati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stalder and Novick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamano et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, we now directly demonstrate the consecutive Rab activation by reconstituting the Rab5 to Rab7 cascade with purified components. Intriguingly, not only Rabs, but also an Arf GTPase can function as a recruiter GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomas and Fromme, 2016</xref>), which shows that GEFs use several organelle-specific small GTPases along the endomembrane system.</p><p>We propose a working model, in which Mon1-Ccz1 is recruited by charged lipids such as PI-3-P, and Rab5 to the endosomal membrane. Rab5 also directly stimulates Mon1-Ccz1, resulting in recruitment and activation of Rab7 out of the GDI complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Mon1-mediated displacement of the Rab5 GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>) would then favor the transition of a Rab5 to a Rab7-positive endosome, which subsequently can fuse with the lysosome-like vacuole in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langemeyer et al., 2018a</xref>). Here, the vacuolar casein kinase Yck3 phosphorylates Mon1-Ccz1 and thus disrupts the interaction with Rab5. We realize that this observation has similarity to the function of the homologous Yck1 and 2 casein kinases in the late secretory pathway in yeast. These kinases phosphorylate the GEF Sec2 and thus promote an interaction with Sec15, an effector of the Rab GTPase Sec4 and subunit of the exocyst tethering complex, which results in a positive-feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stalder and Novick, 2016</xref>). Once the Mon1-Ccz1 binding is lost, Rab5 can interact with its GAP and become a substrate of GDI-mediated extraction. Remaining phospholipid-bound Mon1-Ccz1 will activate Rab7 at a lower rate, maintaining the Rab7-domain on late endosomes or the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Alternatively, the complex may be released from vacuoles due to changes in the lipid composition. In agreement, Mon1-Ccz1 is found almost exclusively on endosomal dots proximal to the vacuole in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Future studies will need to clarify how Rab7 activation is coordinated with Rab5 inactivation to understand the entire cascade.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Proteins were detected using antibodies against GST-Ypt7 and the TAP Tag antibody (Invitrogen, CAB1001) directed against the TAP-tag at Vps41 and Ccz1, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Liposome Sedimentation Assay</title><p> Liposomes were generated from neutral (82 mol% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PC [POPC], and 18 mol% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PE [POPE]) or PIP containing (79 mol% POPC, 18 mol% POPE, 2 mol% PI-3-P, and 1 mol% dipalmitoylphosphatidylinositol-3–5-bisphosphate [PI-3,5-P<sub>2</sub>]) lipid mixtures. The lipids were dried for at least 1 hr in a speedvac, and dissolved in 1 ml of sedimentation buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5% sucrose) to a final lipid concentration of 2 mM. The liposome suspension was freeze/thawed for 10 times in liquid nitrogen and at 56°C respectively. To co-pellet the protein and the liposomes, final concentrations of 0.5 µM lipids, 1 µM prenylated Vps21, 25 µM GTP, and 1 µM yeast Mon1-Ccz1 were added in buffer without sucrose to a final volume of 200 µl. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the liposomes were pelleted at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C. The soluble fraction in the supernatant was separated from the membrane fraction in the pellet and precipitated with ice-cold 100% acetone, while the pellet was kept on ice. All samples were analyzed via SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining. The gels were scanned and the band intensity was quantified with Biorad Image Lab. Significance analysis were performed by two-tailed heteroscedastic t-test statistics (*, p≤0.05).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kumar Verma for help with the initial setup of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system, Claudine Kraft for helpful support with protein purifications, and Maya Schuldiner, Kirill Alexandrov and Roger Goody for kindly providing reagents.

pathways and regulate each other in an ordered, cascade fashion to provide directionality for these pathways. Here, the authors set out to define the minimal molecular determinants for conversion of Rab5 positive endosomes to Rab7 positive endosomes, specifically how Rab5 promotes Rab7 activation through the Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex and how Rab5 interaction with the GEF is modulated by casein kinase. This elegant biochemical study provides important molecular detail to a key step in progression along the endocytic pathway.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A conserved and regulated mechanism drives endosomal Rab transition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marino Zerial, Chris Fromme and Francis Barr.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Ungermann and co-workers set out to define the minimal molecular determinants for conversion of Rab5 positive endosomes to Rab7 positive endosomes, a process that occurs in cells during endosome to lysosome maturation. To fully explain this process, we need to understand how Rab5 promotes Rab7 activation, and how Rab7 promotes Rab5 release. The focus of this work is very much on how Rab5 promotes Rab7 activation through the Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex and how Rab5 interaction with the GEF is modulated by casein kinase. The authors provide a compelling case addressing this first part, and how the Rab5-dependent pool of Mon1-Ccz1 is finally released by casein kinase activity.</p><p>The reviewers were all very positive about this story and would like to see it in <italic>eLife</italic> after some additional issues regarding the physiological relevance of Ypt10 and its relationship to Ypt51/52/53 are addressed. I have included all the reviewer comments as many are textual and come from the leaders in this field so will benefit your efforts during revision. It is not necessary to do all the requested experiments but please try to address these issues as best as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript delves into the Rab5 to Rab7 conversion process in a thoughtful, well-executed and well-written manner, besides some incorrect choice of references. I would recommend publication. Their stated goals of determining whether Mon1-Ccz1 is sufficient to drive conversion and whether both active Rab5 and PI3P are necessary for the conversion process are satisfactorily addressed with very interesting results.</p><p>One intriguing conclusion is &quot;Importantly, only in the presence of a Rab5-recruiter, Mon1-Ccz1 can exert sufficient GEF-activity to drive Ypt7 activation, and thereby HOPS recruitment and fusion.&quot; If one thinks more broadly (including considering mammalian cells), it follows that Mon1-Ccz1 could not activate Rab7 once Rab5 has been removed by conversion. Ypt10 and Rab5 are quite different (primary sequence), can Ypt10 really be considered equivalent to Rab5? The authors should clarify how this would work in vivo.</p><p>One of the more intriguing concepts was the possible regulation by a third subunit, creating a trimeric GEF complex in metazoans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Given the suggestion by Pontano-Vaites et al. that mammalian RMC1 regulates Mon1-Ccz1, it was (mildly) disappointing that the trimeric <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bulli-Mon1-Ccz1 complex displayed GEF activity similar to that of the dimeric Mon1-Ccz1 complex. The authors cite &quot;Dehnen et al., submitted&quot; for a description of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system. However, this topic is sufficiently interesting that having access to data in the Dehnen et al. manuscript is crucial. For example, are the sequences of RMC1 and Bulli similar or has the Mon1-Ccz1 complex evolved two alternative pathways for regulation?

To fully explain this process, we need to understand how Rab5 promotes Rab7 activation, and how Rab7 promotes Rab5 release. The focus of this work is very much on how Rab5 promotes Rab7 activation through the Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex and how Rab5 interaction with the GEF is modulated by casein kinase. The authors provide a compelling case addressing this first part, and how the Rab5-dependent pool of Mon1-Ccz1 is finally released by casein kinase activity. However, this leaves open the question of how Rab7 feeds back on to Rab5 to promote Rab5 release. Previous literature provides some clues to this, and the authors should adjust their Abstract, manuscript text and model to better reflect this.</p><p>I will address the three key questions raised by the authors in their Abstract:</p><p>i) That Mon1-Ccz1 is an effector of Rab5.</p><p>This claim is based on observations that Ypt10 can interact with Mon1-Ccz1 and related Rabs. Overall the data is convincing. However, the hypothesis was surely that Ypt51/52/53 recruit Mon1-Ccz1, so there is a need to look at all these proteins together. Figure 1E shows Ypt10 and Ccz1, can the authors show similar data for Vps21 and Ypt52 which have a much greater effect on Ypt7 localisation (Figure 1F)?</p><p>Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Can the authors show the other subunits of the GEF, not only Ccz1. This is necessary to conclude that the GEF complex has bound, not only one subunit. How reproducible is this? Graphed data from multiple experiments would address this.</p><p>ii) That membrane-bound Rab5 is the key factor to directly promote Mon1-Ccz1 dependent Rab7 activation and Rab7- dependent membrane fusion.</p><p>Experiments on the interaction of Mon1-Ccz1 with membranes are done with Vps21 and PIPs (Figure 2), when based on the data in Figure 1 Ypt10 would be more appropriate. This becomes important for Figure 3, when the effects on Rab7 GEF activity are tested. Ypt10 shows a robust effect while the others Rab5-related proteins show a more modest stimulation. This is not reflected in the membrane pelleting shown in Figure 3E, where the amount of Mon1-Ccz1 recovered is equivalent in all cases.</p><p>Figure 5 switches back to Ypt10, and shows very clear evidence that it promotes Mon1-Ccz1 GEF activity and membrane fusion. Does this work for the other Rab5 family members?</p><p>iii) That this process is regulated in yeast by the casein kinase Yck3, which phosphorylates Mon1 and blocks Rab5 binding. Our study thus uncovers the minimal feed-forward machinery of the endosomal Rab cascade and novel regulatory mechanism, which can explain organelle maturation in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>This conclusion is supported by Figure 6 and the data show Yck3 blocks both Vps21 and Ypt10 interaction, presumably by acting at the same site on the complex. Do the authors have any idea where Yck3 phosphorylates the Mon1-Ccz1 complex? It is unlikely but can we completely exclude the possibility that the Rabs are Yck3 targets?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study from Langemeyer et al. presents an in vitro reconstitution reaction in which yeast Rab5-GTP recruits Mon1/Ccz1, the GEF for Rab7, to liposome membranes. The field has largely coalesced around support for a model of a Rab5-Rab7 cascade on endosomes. However, whether activated Rab5 directly interacts with Mon1/Ccz1 has not been clearly demonstrated. The authors present several convincing pieces of evidence in support for a direct role of activated Rab5 in recruiting Mon1/Ccz1 to endo-lysosomal membranes in order to activate Rab7 (Ypt7).</p><p>A summary of their findings:</p><p>The authors find that of the four yeast Rab5 paralogs, Ypt10 binds to Mon1/Ccz1 most strongly in vitro. They find that Mon1/Ccz1 prefers anionic membranes in vitro. They find that all four Rab5 paralogs stimulate Mon1/Ccz1 GEF activity towards Ypt7 on liposome membranes. They recapitulate these findings with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rab5, Mon1/Ccz1, and Rab7 proteins. They find that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Bulli protein, a third subunit of the complex, is dispensable for Rab5 binding and stimulation of Rab7 GEF activity. They are able to reconstitute a membrane fusion reaction in which Rab5-GTP is required to stimulate Mon1/Ccz1 activation of Ypt7. They show that the Yck3 kinase could potentially regulate this process because its phosphorylation of Mon1 reduces the strength of the in vitro interaction with Rab5-GTP. They perform some in vivo experiments showing that certain double or triple-mutant yeast strains are defective in trafficking to the vacuole or mislocalize Ypt7.</p><p>Overall, I find the in vitro experiments to be a compelling demonstration of this Rab cascade. However, I think the in vivo experiments as presented do not currently provide sufficient information needed to properly assess the true physiological relevance of the Ypt10 interaction.</p><p>1) The authors find that Ypt10 is the best physical interactor with Mon1/Ccz1, yet they have not thoroughly tested its importance in vivo. As shown in Figure 1F, Ypt10 does not appear to be required for Ypt7 activation in cells, but this could be due to redundancy with the other Rab5 paralogs. The authors should determine whether double mutants of ypt10 and vps21 (and perhaps other double-mutant combinations) perturb Ypt7 activation in cells.</p><p>2) I'm also surprised the authors did not examine localization of Mon1/Ccz1 in various Rab5 mutants. Shouldn't there be a Mon1/Ccz1 mislocalization phenotype in some combination of Rab5 homolog (double, triple, etc). mutant cells, especially involving ypt10?</p><p>3) Furthermore, how do the authors explain the punctate localization of Ypt7 in vps21-ypt52 double mutant cells? The punctate localization suggests Ypt7 is still being activated in these mutants, and is activated at an endosomal structure rather than on the vacuole. In fact, one interpretation of this observation is that Mon1/Ccz1 localization and function is unperturbed in the vps21-ypt52 double mutants, and instead the maturation process is perturbed.</p><p>4) The authors switch which Rab homolog they are examining in different experiments. The authors state that they would use Ypt10 in &quot;further assays&quot;, yet in Figure 2 they use Vps21 to test liposome-binding of Mon1/Ccz1. Why wasn't Ypt10 also tested in Figure 2?</p><p>5) Similarly, as I was reading the manuscript, in Figure 2 I was expecting a direct comparison of liposome binding of Mon1/Ccz1 for all of the yeast Rab5 paralogs, as well as at least one negative control (i.e. Ypt6 or Ypt31). The experiments shown in Figure 3, in which the specificity of several different Rabs in stimulating Mon1/Ccz1 GEF activity is tested, could potentially obviate the need for such an experiment. However, in the second paragraph of the subsection “Control of Mon1-Ccz1 GEF activity by Rab5 is evolutionarily conserved” the authors claim that the GEF activity correlates with the affinity of the effector interaction between the Rab and Mon1/Ccz1 – I think in order to make this claim they would need to compare the relative strengths of the different Rabs in recruiting Mon1/Ccz1 to membranes through liposome binding experiments similar to those shown in Figure 2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56090.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] One intriguing conclusion is &quot;Importantly, only in the presence of a Rab5-recruiter, Mon1-Ccz1 can exert sufficient GEF-activity to drive Ypt7 activation, and thereby HOPS recruitment and fusion.&quot; If one thinks more broadly (including considering mammalian cells), it follows that Mon1-Ccz1 could not activate Rab7 once Rab5 has been removed by conversion. Ypt10 and Rab5 are quite different (primary sequence), can Ypt10 really be considered equivalent to Rab5? The authors should clarify how this would work in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that Ypt10 like all other Rab5 homologs in yeast stimulates Mon1-Ccz1 GEF function (Figure 2) and co-localizes with FM4-64 (as an endocytic tracer) and Mon1-Ccz1 itself (Figure 1). We showed before that Vps21 and Ypt52 are most critical for Mon1-Ccz1 and CORVET localization to endosomes (Nordmann et al., 2010; Cabrera et al., 2013). The copy number of Ypt10 (1790 per cell, see <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genome database) is about 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the much more abundant Vps21 (8700) and Ypt52 (9750) together, and Ypt53 (1170) is a stress induced isoform (Schmidt et al., 2017; Nickerson et al., 2012). Likewise, Ypt10 could be a stress-induced Rab5 isoform in yeast, and its function thus remains to be clarified. Importantly, we use Ypt10 here as an example to show the effect of Rab5-like proteins in our in vitro assay, yet find similar stimulation of Mon1-Ccz1 with Vps21 (Figure 3) and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog Rab5 (Figure 4).</p><p>Therefore, we also consider our findings also to be relevant regarding mammalian cells.

The authors cite &quot;Dehnen et al., submitted&quot; for a description of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system.

We nevertheless consider the question if soluble Ypt10 can stimulate Mon1-Ccz1 activity an important control. We therefore now included a new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, where we addressed this. Soluble Ypt10 was not able to trigger Mon1-Ccz1 GEF-activity, even in a 10-fold excess compared to membrane bound prenylated Ypt10 (and therefore a 150x molar excess compared to Mon1-Ccz1).

We would like to stress that our point is not so much the organization of the endosomal pathway, but an understanding of the transition from Rab5 to Rab7. We included the colocalization of Mon1-Ccz1 with Ypt10 (Figure 1), since the interaction of Ypt10 with Mon1-Ccz1 was a surprising finding in the GST-pulldown experiments, and we had to verify that both proteins indeed colocalize in vivo. We agree that a detailed systematic characterization of the function and the crosstalk of the four yeast Rab5 homologs with Mon1-Ccz1, and their influence on Rab7 activation in vivo is important and will be topic of further investigations in our lab.

However, Mon1-Ccz1 interact via a hydrophobic interface that was described in detail in Kiontke et al., 2017. This complex has never dissociated in our hands, and is purified as a 1:1 complex from yeast (Figure 3C). Therefore, decorating for one subunit surely informs on the other being present. As for the Rab interactions – the only tight interaction is seen with Ypt10, where we showed here already two reproducible pull-downs (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2), and have of course repeated the experiment as described. The other interactions of Mon1-Ccz1 with Rab5s by GST-pull down are rather disappointing. However, their functional role becomes clear during the remaining manuscript.

It otherwise behaves like all Rab5-like proteins in yeast and colocalizes with Mon1-Ccz1 to dots proximal to the vacuole (see also response to reviewer #1), yet Ypt10 seems to be of low abundance.

Any yeast mutant along the endocytic pathway that interferes with endosomal biogenesis (we call them Class D mutants) interferes with Mon1Ccz1 localization (Nordmann et al., 2010). It is thus not so simple as redundancy interferes with function (see Cabrera et al., 2013). Moreover, Ypt10 is of low abundance, consistent with the idea that the protein seems to be regulated by cellular stress. For the reviewer’s request, we now included the different combinations of Rab5 deletions and monitor the morphology of vacuoles (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The effect on Mon1-Ccz1 mislocalization was already seen in the <italic>vps21 ypt52</italic> mutant, but we believe that we learn more about the in vivo function once we have a mutant in Mon1-Ccz1 that blocks the Rab5 interaction and therefore decided to reserve this issue for a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Furthermore, how do the authors explain the punctate localization of Ypt7 in vps21-ypt52 double mutant cells? The punctate localization suggests Ypt7 is still being activated in these mutants, and is activated at an endosomal structure rather than on the vacuole. In fact, one interpretation of this observation is that Mon1/Ccz1 localization and function is unperturbed in the vps21-ypt52 double mutants, and instead the maturation process is perturbed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on this interpretation with the reviewer, but this is a general problem with the analysis of mutants that interfere with the endosomal system in yeast (see earlier work of the Emr group, and also Cabrera et al., 2013). For instance, we are not even sure if the dot localization is due to a very small vacuole and a large endosome or a specific mislocalization of Ypt7.</p><p>As pointed out to reviewer 1 and 2, our focus was not on the function of Rab5 and the general organization of endosomes in vivo but on the role of Rab5 in Mon1-Ccz1 recruitment and activation.
