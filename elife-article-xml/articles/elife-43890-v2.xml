We use <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts to study the nucleation and dynamics of MTs in branched networks, a process that is critical for spindle assembly. Surprisingly, new branched MTs preferentially originate near the minus-ends of pre-existing MTs. A sequential reaction model, consisting of deposition of nucleation sites on an existing MT, followed by rate-limiting nucleation of branches, reproduces the measured spatial profile of nucleation, the distribution of MT plus-ends and tubulin intensity. By regulating the availability of the branching effectors TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC, combined with single-molecule observations, we show that first TPX2 is deposited on pre-existing MTs, followed by binding of augmin/γ-TuRC to result in the nucleation of branched MTs. In sum, regulating the localization and kinetics of nucleation effectors governs the architecture of branched MT networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>branching microtubule nucleation</kwd><kwd>Xenopus</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>augmin</kwd><kwd>TPX2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17PRE33660328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thawani</surname><given-names>Akanksha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2GM123493-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petry</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00027340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petry</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-40376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petry</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1734030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaevitz</surname><given-names>Joshua W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A sequential reaction pathway involving TPX2, augmin and γ-TuRC governs the assembly and architecture of branched microtubule networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle is a complex and dynamic macromolecular machine that is responsible for segregating chromosomes during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McIntosh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosser and Pelletier, 2017</xref>). It is currently thought that the microtubule (MT) architecture in the spindle is governed by the spatiotemporal profile of MT nucleation and the action of molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Needleman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oriola et al., 2018</xref>). Spindle MTs originate from spindle poles, chromosomes, and from the lateral surface of pre-existing spindle MTs in a process termed branching MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinarina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duncan and Wakefield, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maresca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meunier and Vernos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piehl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosser and Pelletier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tulu et al., 2006</xref>). Because of the high density of MTs resulting from these nucleation pathways, resolving MT nucleation events in the spindle is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burbank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaye et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Needleman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosser and Pelletier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Redemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tulu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Common to all MT nucleation pathways is the universal nucleator, gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tovey and Conduit, 2018</xref>), together with XMAP215/chTOG/Stu2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flor-Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gunzelmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>). γ-TuRC has been proposed to be positioned and turned on at specific sites and times respectively, for each pathway during spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>) and a number of factors that perform these functions have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tovey and Conduit, 2018</xref>). Yet, how the localization or activation of the nucleators results in the spatiotemporal arrangement of MTs in the mitotic spindle remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>We sought to explore the nucleation profile and the role of localization and activation of nucleators in branching MT nucleation. Branching MT nucleation is an important spindle assembly pathway that nucleates new daughter MTs from the surface of pre-existing ones in a narrow range of angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petry et al., 2013</xref>) and, in isolation, creates dense, wedge-shaped networks with uniform polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of branching components causes reduced MT mass within the spindle body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petry et al., 2011</xref>), instability of kinetochore fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucciarelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>), insufficient tension during chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uehara et al., 2009</xref>), and chromosome misalignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goshima et al., 2008</xref>). Most importantly, branching is the major nucleation pathway in spindles that form either without centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petry et al., 2011</xref>) or in larger spindles (e.g. in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts), where it generates most of the MT mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2018</xref>). Nucleation of branched MTs requires several key molecules. The multisubunit complex augmin has been characterized as a targeting factor that binds to the nucleator γ-TuRC and recruits it to existing MTs in several model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakaoka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sánchez-Huertas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2018</xref>). The protein TPX2 is necessary for branching MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petry et al., 2013</xref>) and was recently proposed to activate γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017</xref>). Although the necessary molecules have been identified, it remains unclear how they establish a spatial pattern of branching that results in the characteristic tree-shaped networks, particularly when these proteins are thought to be homogeneously distributed in solution or along MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Most importantly, the exact hierarchy and role of TPX2 and augmin in the branching pathway remains to be determined. Uncovering the building plan for branched MT networks will not only provide insights into the molecular mechanism of this pathway, but also identify how MT nucleation is regulated to construct the mitotic spindle.</p><p>In this study, we use <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts to study branched MT networks at single MT resolution. By measuring the spatiotemporal profile of branching MT nucleation and the shape of mature networks, we demonstrate a bias in the nucleation profile from older MT regions near the minus-ends, which is consistent with a two-step, sequential kinetic model involving rate-limiting nucleation from deposited nucleation sites. We establish that first TPX2 participates in depositing nucleation sites on individual MTs, followed by augmin/γ-TuRC binding to nucleate branched MTs, which explains the architecture of branched MT networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-resolution analysis of branched microtubule networks</title><p>We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to study the evolution of branched MT networks in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). Addition of the constitutively-active small GTPase RanQ69L to egg extract induces the nucleation of new MT branches from pre-existing MTs. To determine the effect of nucleation on network architecture without the complication of active MT transport by molecular motors, we further added the ATPase inhibitor vanadate. Nucleation events and MT growth were resolved by time-lapse imaging of fluorescently-labeled tubulin and end-binding protein 1 (EB1), which labels the growing MT plus-ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

The net plus-end speed over the entire MT trajectory, including growth, catastrophe, and pause phases, was <italic>v</italic><sub>pe</sub> = 5.3 ± 1.4 μm min<sup>−1</sup> (n = 115 MT tracks). The number of MTs in the network, counted via the number of EB1 comets where each EB1 comet marks a single MT, increased exponentially over time with an effective autocatalytic nucleation rate of 0.54 ± 0.06 min<sup>−1</sup> (n = 11 branched networks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). An important measure for the network architecture is the MT length distribution. MT lengths were exponentially distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>) with an average length that approached a steady value over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, red curve).

Lastly, we assigned each new daughter MT to its most probable mother MT and obtained the distribution of branching angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In this ‘sequential reaction model’, the first reaction step involves binding of one of the branching proteins to MTs which marks the nucleation sites, followed by a subsequent reaction step where a second branching protein generates the daughter MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similar to the single-step model, we input the growth speed and the branching angle distribution, and fit two model parameters: the binding constant for the first step, <italic>k</italic><sub>bind</sub> = 0.1 molecules μm<sup>−1</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>, and the branching rate, <italic>k</italic><sub>branch</sub> = 2.5×10<sup>−4</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>.

We first generated MTs in the absence of augmin where TPX2 and γ-TuRC are available, and then exchanged the solution to extract where no γ-TuRC is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Here, no branching occurred and MTs only elongated from their plus-ends at early time points. This demonstrates that γ-TuRC is essential together with augmin in the branching pathway after TPX2 binding. We note that rare branches were observed at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, rightmost panel) due to residual γ-TuRC molecules after immunodepletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, inset). In summary, our results establish that branching MT nucleation occurs via a sequence of events, namely first TPX2’s binding to de novo MTs, followed by the binding of augmin/γ-TuRC prior to nucleation of branch MT from the mother MT.</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-43890-video7.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43890.021</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Sequence of γ-TuRC, TPX2 and augmin in branching microtubule nucleation by two-color solution exchange experiments.</title><p>De novo MTs (blue) were generated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts containing TPX2 and γ-TuRC but no augmin first, followed by exchange to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts containing TPX2 and augmin but no γ-TuRC.

We hypothesized that TPX2 binds to the MT lattice significantly below lattice saturation resulting in preference towards the older regions of the MT lattice near the minus-ends, analogous to the spatial profile of the first branching effector in our sequential model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To directly measure the binding rate of TPX2, we adapted our assay to form branches on passivated coverslips to reduce fluorescent background, and replaced the endogenous TPX2 with an equivalent concentration of GFP-labelled TPX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). First, we observed that TPX2-GFP associated with individual MTs, including the first de novo MT prior to the formation of the first branched MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>), supporting the molecular sequence during branch formation. The binding of TPX2 to MTs was slow, such that the plus-ends were mostly devoid of TPX2 signal, and a decreasing profile of TPX2 from minus- to plus-ends was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To quantify the binding rate of TPX2, we measured the rate of increase in TPX2 intensity at individual pixels on the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of single TPX2-GFP molecules was obtained from fluorescence photobleaching traces and used for normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). We calculated the binding rate of TPX2 to the MT lattice to be 0.4 ± 0.2 molecules μm<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (n = 32 traces). This value lies within the same order of magnitude of our model parameter <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> = 0.1 molecules μm<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for deposition of nucleation sites. Notably, TPX2’s measured binding rate is too slow to saturate the newly formed MT lattice, which presents approximately 250 inter-protofilament dimer sites per micron per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the slow binding kinetics of TPX2 results in its localization on the older lattice regions near the MT minus-ends, corresponding to its role in marking the nucleation sites in our sequential kinetic model.</p><media id="video8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-43890-video8.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43890.022</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Binding of TPX2 to branched microtubule networks in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts.</title><p>Endogenous TPX2 was immunodepleted from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and replaced with 20–30 nM recombinant GFP-TPX2.

This qualitatively supports the participation of augmin/γ-TuRC in the branch generation step. However, due to lower activity of recombinant augmin compared to the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2018</xref>), and indirect visualization of γ-TuRC, the quantitative measurement of this association rate may underestimate the kinetics of endogenous proteins. Thus, we cannot yet directly measure the association rate of endogenous augmin and γ-TuRC to branched networks. Altogether, our results demonstrate that branched MT networks are formed by a sequential reaction involving slow association of TPX2 to individual MTs, followed by binding of augmin/γ-TuRC molecules to generate a branched MT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The pattern of MT nucleation that gives rise to the mitotic spindle in vivo remains to be determined because individual MTs cannot be resolved due to their high density in many regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burbank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Needleman et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we study the formation of branched MT networks in purified cytoplasm as a model process that is essential for the assembly and maintenance of the spindle. Specifically, we investigated how key branching effectors build the MT nucleation profile and generate the branched network architecture. By combining precise experimental perturbations with image analysis tools, mathematical modeling, and detailed measurements, we show that nucleation in branched networks is spatially biased towards the older lattice regions near the MT minus-ends. We demonstrate that branching MT nucleation is a sequential process involving deposition of nucleation sites by TPX2 and delayed branching by the augmin/γ-TuRC complex. This sequential model comprehensively describes the branched network architecture. In sum, our study establishes how the dynamics of branching effectors generates the architecture of branched networks.</p><p>Our results provide new insights that rule out many alternative mechanisms of branching MT nucleation. In particular, mechanisms involving either only the direct localization of nucleators augmin/γ-TuRC to MTs, or the localization followed by the rate-limiting activation of augmin/γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>) do not result in branch formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Instead, TPX2’s localization on individual MTs is necessary before augmin/γ-TuRC to nucleate a branch. Second, we show that branching MT nucleation is not a result of independent binding of TPX2 and augmin to the MT lattice, an activity that has been shown for both proteins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roostalu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>), we speculate that localization of augmin to MTs in the cytoplasm is mediated by other proteins, as suggested recently for human augmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), and potentially by TPX2. Third, we find that the nucleator γ-TuRC cannot be recruited by TPX2 independently, but requires augmin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which could not be ruled out based on previous work. Finally, we note that our work does not rule out the participation of other, yet unknown effectors in branching MT nucleation. The minor differences between our experimental nucleation profiles and the sequential model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) may indicate the involvement of undiscovered effectors, or time-dependent regulation of known effectors. In the future, it will be important to identify new branching effectors and elucidate the detailed mechanism of branching with bottom-up in vitro reconstitution.</p><p>The nucleation and dynamics of branched MT networks recapitulate the key properties of the mitotic spindle measured previously. The length distribution of MTs in branched networks displays a bounded growth regime, as reported for centrosomes in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verde et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, branched networks are sustained through new MT nucleation events. This is similar to recent models for spindle assembly and reflects the measured length distributions of spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Needleman et al., 2010</xref>). The net branching nucleation rate we directly measured (0.5 min<sup>−1</sup>) agrees with previous estimates from monopolar spindles (3 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2018</xref>) and RanGTP asters (1.2 min<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clausen and Ribbeck, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Building on previous work, our study advances the current understanding of how MT nucleation builds the mitotic spindle. First, because of challenges associated with studying MT nucleation in the spindle due to its high MT density, many assumptions regarding autocatalytic nucleation needed to be made in previous works, such as autocatalytic nucleation occurs via a single MT binding event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clausen and Ribbeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loughlin et al., 2010</xref>), which is encompassed by our single-step model and does not explain our measurements that show preferential nucleation from older MT regions. Second, because most measurements in the spindle are performed at metaphase after the spindle has assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burbank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Needleman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), they lack the dynamic information needed to capture the multiple rate-limiting steps for branching MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oriola et al., 2018</xref>), and thus distinguish between the single-step model (where branching rate is not limiting) and the sequential model (where branching rate limits the net reaction). Here, by directly probing the temporal dynamics of network assembly and time-resolved experiments, we show that the MT networks are organized by rate-limited deposition of nucleation sites and followed by branch emergence through binding of MT nucleators. We demonstrate that the localization of the nucleator γ-TuRC to spindle MTs regulates nucleation in the mitotic spindle. Third, and most importantly, the preferential nucleation from older MT lattice regions could allow for precise control over where branching occurs in the spindle. We propose that TPX2, which is released in the vicinity of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalab et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2016</xref>), accumulates on the older MT lattice regions near chromosomes such as on MTs captured and stabilized by the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cimini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeLuca et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lampson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Umbreit et al., 2012</xref>) and older lattice regions such as minus-ends near the spindle center. Branching MT nucleation by augmin/γ-TuRC from deposited TPX2 sites will selectively amplify older MTs generating dense kinetochore fibers near chromosomes.</p><p>The mitotic spindle is organized by regulating nucleation of MTs and their further sorting by molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brugués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oriola et al., 2018</xref>). With the new understanding of how the dynamics of molecular effectors organize autocatalytic MT nucleation in space and time, we can now begin to understand how the spindle architecture is constructed by spatially-regulated MT generation and motor-based active transport.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of proteins</title><p>His-RanQ69L plasmid was a gift from J.

Due to the size of EB1 comets (length ≈ 10 pixels, width ≈ 4 pixels), the band-pass filter with the high-pass Gaussian standard deviation (s.d.) of 14 pixels and the low-pass Gaussian s.d. of 1 pixel were applied. For watershed segmentation, the parameters used were varied so that most of the EB1 comets were detected, while the background noise and false-positive detections were minimized. A threshold of 12–18 s.d. in intensity and a step-size of 1–6 s.d. was chosen. The parameters were held constant, for analyzing an entire dataset of branched networks imaged with one <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract preparation as much as possible, and identical image acquisition settings for used for the entire dataset.

The greedy optimization described below was obtained empirically based on the nature of EB1 track breaks observed in our experimental data. We note that the global optimization for merging as implemented in <italic>uTrack</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Applegate et al., 2011</xref>) was attempted and found to be unfit for our dataset. This is because branching yields many EB1 tracks that are roughly in the same direction and location as a result of shallow branch angle and positional bias respectively, and global optimization produced many false merges. Therefore, a temporally greedy optimization with custom criteria was found to be a more successful approach. For this study, the below described procedure successfully reconstructs entire trajectories of up to 40 MTs over the duration of tens of minutes with few errors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2-2"><title>Microtubule intensity calculation</title><p>MT intensity in the gaps was also used to ensure the correct gap merging. For this, the line integral of tubulin intensity <italic>I<sub>MT</sub>(i,j)</italic> was calculated for every candidate the gap between EB1 tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> as follows. The tubulin channel imaged was first processed in ImageJ to correct for background illumination and bleaching. Background illumination was corrected by filtering out large variations using Bandpass filter under Process, FFT. Large structures of 60 pixels were filtered out. Bleaching was corrected by first selecting a background region where MTs do not emerge. Z-axis profile of this ROI was plotted and these values were fit to an exponential curve with offset using curve-fitting. The intercept value ‘c’ was recorded. Simple ratio bleach correction was selected and ‘c’ value was used as background. Finally, the first frame of the output, where no MTs have appeared yet, was subtracted from the rest of stack. This normalizes the tubulin intensity for varying background level between imaging conditions and makes the following code robust.</p><p>Tubulin line integral <italic>I<sub>MT</sub>(i,j)</italic> was calculated between end position of track <italic>i</italic> (<italic>p<sub>end,i</sub></italic>) and start position of track <italic>j</italic> (<italic>p<sub>start,j</sub></italic>). The cartesian distance between <italic>p<sub>end,i</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>start,j</sub></italic> was divided into points spaced by individual pixel length. Image intensity was interpolated at each of these points and summed to obtain the line integral.

For one of our experimental datasets, we made the merge assignments manually and found the median gap length to be 8.8 pixels. <italic>I<sub>cutoff</sub></italic> was set to 20 x mean intensity from the processed tubulin channel/median gap length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2-3"><title>Specific conditions</title><p>First, short, spurious EB1 tracks detected were filtered out based on their length and net displacement. Tracks smaller than 2–4 frames with net displacement smaller than two pixels or net speed lower than one pixel per frame were discarded. The rest of the EB1 tracks were considered for the following merge procedure.</p><p>A maximum time frame interval (Δt<sub>max</sub> = 30–40 frames) was defined for any possible merge between the end of track <italic>i</italic> and start of candidate track <italic>j</italic>. For each track pair to be merged, we record five quantities in a matrix form: number of gap frames between the two tracks, <italic>t<sub>gap</sub>(i,j)</italic>; the perpendicular distance between the two tracks, <italic>D<sub>perp</sub></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>); the dot product between the two track orientations, <italic>N<sub>dot</sub>(i,j)</italic>; the minimum distance recorded between the two tracks, <italic>D<sub>min</sub>(i,j)</italic>; and the line integral of tubulin intensity in the gap <italic>I<sub>MT</sub>(i,j)</italic> (calculation described above). Fluctuation radius, <italic>r<sub>fluc</sub></italic> = 2–3 pixels, was defined as the Brownian diffusion causing fluctuations in plus-end position. For all track candidates <italic>j</italic> that appear after track <italic>i</italic> and was considered to be merged with track <italic>i</italic>, the distance between last recorded position of track <italic>i</italic> and first recorded position of track <italic>j</italic> [<italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic>] was calculated.</p><p>Some specific scenarios were considered for a merge and candidates not meeting these were not considered further during optimization. (1) If the frame gap between tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> was zero, <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic> was required to be within a specified maximum distance, usually similar to <italic>r<sub>fluc</sub></italic>, and was set to three pixels in most cases. The occurrence of such gaps was likely in our experimental data and <italic>D<sub>perp</sub></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) was set to <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic> and <italic>N<sub>dot</sub>(i,j)</italic> was assigned to one for these cases. (2) If the tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are long (&gt;3 x <italic>r<sub>fluc</sub></italic> each), it was ensured that the end point of track <italic>i</italic> is closest to first position recorded in track <italic>j</italic>. If this condition is not met, the two tracks are not the correct pairs to merge. (3) We calculate the orientation of track <italic>i</italic> (<italic>dir<sub>i</sub></italic>), track <italic>j</italic> (<italic>dir<sub>j</sub></italic>) as well as the orientation of track that would be merged between tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> (<italic>dir<sub>i-j</sub></italic>). The candidate track <italic>j</italic> was rejected if the resulting dot products of orientation vectors are not large enough. Specifically, if the tracks to be merged are small and therefore, their direction estimates carry more error, a maximum angle of 40° is allowed between all pairs: <italic>dir<sub>i</sub></italic>, <italic>dir<sub>j</sub></italic> and <italic>dir<sub>i-j</sub></italic>, otherwise a stricter forward angle of ~20° was enforced for a candidate merge. If these criteria are not met, candidate <italic>j</italic> was no longer considered for a merge with track <italic>i</italic>. However, these similar criteria cannot be applied to catastrophes because an obtuse angle must be allowed between two tracks flanked by a catastrophe event. (4) For catastrophe cases, a special set of criteria was enforced: tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> should have direction within ~30° of each other. If the distance <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic> is significantly above <italic>r<sub>fluc</sub></italic>, then the to-be-merged region between tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> should also follow a similar angle criteria with tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>’s directions and if not, a loose angle criteria of within 90° was enforced.</p><p>During gaps, MT plus-ends in our experiments were found to often be in slower growing states, where EB1 comet was not distinctly seen. We refer to these events as pauses. To merge the candidate pauses, <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic> was ensured to be roughly around <italic>r<sub>fluc</sub></italic>, usually set to three pixels while the number of frames that the pause state lasts less than a specified frame length - 15 frames. For these candidate merges, <italic>D<sub>perp</sub></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) and <italic>D<sub>min</sub>(i,j)</italic> were set to <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic>, directional overlap <italic>N<sub>dot</sub>(i,j)</italic> to 1 (maximum value). Greedy merge of pauses was performed by ensuring <italic>I<sub>MT</sub>(i,j)</italic> to be greater than <italic>I<sub>cutoff</sub></italic>/4 or <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j)</italic> less than ~1 pixel. If these conditions were met, track <italic>j</italic> was merged with track <italic>i</italic>. If the gap between tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> did not classify as a pause, two classes of forward gaps were observed in the data: long frame gaps with net displacement limited by (maximum net plus-end speed, set to ~2 pixels per frame) x (number of gap frames, <italic>t<sub>gap</sub>(i,j)</italic>), or short frame gaps (maximum value of 6 frames allowed) with larger displacement given by (maximum plus-end speed for short frame gap, set to ~5 pixels per frame) x (number of gap frames). Similarly, for catastrophes, a maximum distance condition was imposed (10 pixels). For such candidate merges (forward gap and catastrophes), <italic>D<sub>perp</sub></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) was calculated from cross product between tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> and if found greater than a maximum value of 10 pixels, the candidate merge was rejected. <italic>D<sub>min</sub>(i,j)</italic> was set to <italic>d<sub>ends</sub>(i,j). N<sub>dot</sub>(i,j)</italic> was calculated as the dot product of the orientation of track <italic>i</italic> and the gap between tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> for forward gap, and product of orientation of tracks <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> for catastrophes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2-4"><title>Greedy optimization</title><p>We note that the tracks to be merged were considered in the order of their appearance that is tracks that emerge sooner were assigned first to the possible partners that emerged after, resulting in a temporally greedy assignment.

The individual parameters were set by characterizing how the spatial bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) varied with individual values of <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>branch</sub></italic>. The dimensionless ratio of the activation rate constant, <italic>k<sub>branch</sub></italic>, and effective binding rate constant, √(<italic>k<sub>bind</sub> v<sub>pe</sub></italic>) were varied and the rescaled bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) was plotted. The derivation of this dimensionless number is shown in Appendix 1. Individual parameter values were chosen where the branching rate was slower than the binding of sites and robust bias was produced for the first branching nucleation event along the mother MT. Final parameters used: <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> = 0.1 molecules μm<sup>−1</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup>, and <italic>k<sub>branch</sub></italic> = 2.5×10<sup>−4</sup> sec<sup>−1</sup> per molecule.</p><p>For all data reported in this study, 250–4000 independent of simulations of branched network from the single-step model or the sequential model were performed, all data was pooled and reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of first branching nucleation site</title><p>As a readout for branching architecture, the position of first branching nucleation event along the naked mother MT (<italic>de novo</italic> nucleation) was measured experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and compared with simulated models. Time-lapse movies of experimental branched MT network were recorded as described above. For each observed branched network, the location of minus-end of first (<italic>de novo</italic>) nucleated MT was recorded (m<sub>0</sub>).

These measurements were made for both experimental and simulated branched networks and their probability distribution were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). These positions were logged manually for experimental networks to ensure accuracy of the measured nucleation profile. For experimental data, n = 381 independent branched networks were observed with at least three independent extract preparations. n = 4000 simulations were made for single-step model and sequential model each. All data was pooled for both experiments and simulations and compared. 95% confidence interval on probability distributions was obtained by bootstrapping.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Distribution of minus-ends and plus-ends in dense branched networks</title><p>MT plus-end distribution was measured in the experimental branched network as follows. EB1 comets in branched networks were imaged as described above. Image stacks with growing branched networks were cropped and EB1 comets were detected with the procedure described above. Moving median filter of 20 frames was applied and comet detection parameters input to <italic>uTrack</italic> were set so that false positive EB1 detections were minimized. Specifically, threshold of 12 s.d. and step size of 2 s.d. was chosen and all comets in the time sequence were detected. For each branched network, the origin point was manually found and recorded. The cartesian distances of all comets were measured from the origin and rescaled by the longest distance, a proxy for length of branched network, at each time point. Data from multiple networks generated was pooled for a specified number of comets in each network (between 10–55 comets for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and compared to simulated networks.</p><p>For simulated networks obtained from the single-step and sequential model, analogous measurements were made. The cartesian distance of all MT plus-ends from the origin of the network was calculated and rescaled by the longest distance (length of branched network). Similarly, the cartesian distances of all MT minus-ends from the network origin were calculated and normalized by the length of branched network. Data from 250 simulated networks for each model was pooled for a specified number of MTs (between 10–60 MTs reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and compared with experimental measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Distribution of tubulin intensity in dense branched networks</title><p>To obtain the tubulin intensity distribution in experimental branched networks, snapshots of a large number of branched networks were obtained at a specified time point. Here, time-lapse of networks was avoided so that the tubulin signal on pre-existing MTs does not bleach over the course of recording. The script for measuring tubulin intensity in experimental networks is <italic>tubulinIntensity.m</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. First, the background illumination of the MT channel was corrected for the entire field of view using <italic>illumCorrect.m</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The image was filtered with a Gaussian filter of size 110 pixels and sigma 30 pixels. Additionally, a blank image with no MTs in the field of view was recorded with identical imaging settings and also filtered with same Gaussian filter. Because in our imaging setup, uneven illumination is caused by the intensity decay of the gaussian beam near the edges of the image acquired with a large sCMOS chip, intensity was homogenized by dividing the filtered image with the filtered blank image. Individual branched networks in the field of view were isolated after intensity correction, their boundary was manually drawn in ImageJ, the coordinates were saved and read using MATLAB scripts. First, a convex hull was generated in MATLAB after using Delaunay triangulation and intensity of each pixel inside the hull was recorded alongside the cartesian distance of that pixel from the branch network origin. Background tubulin intensity was calculated from the mean intensity of all pixels in the image that lie outside of the convex hull, subtracted from all pixel intensities inside the hull, which were then normalized by the mean intensity inside the hull. Normalized tubulin intensity in the branched network versus distance was then plotted and compared with simulated networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To obtain an analogous measurement of tubulin intensity in simulated networks, an equivalent ‘image’ of simulated network was generated at a specified time point and blurred with a gaussian function of size 30 pixel and sigma 1.5 pixels, representing the point spread function of our microscope. Convex hull on the MT signal was produced exactly as described above. Tubulin intensity inside the hull was calculated and the corresponding cartesian distance from the network origin recorded. The tubulin intensities were then normalized by their mean and compared to the experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Christiane Wiese for generously providing XenC antibodies.

They find a bias of nucleation sites being positioned closer to microtubule minus ends and explain this bias using a 2-step kinetic model assuming delayed activation of nucleation sites after their deposition. The quantitative image analysis of the data is novel and seems quite advanced allowing the authors to quantitatively compare their data with their preferred model and an alternative simpler 1-step kinetic model. To provide additional experimental support for the preferred model the authors change the concentration of augmin (partial depletion) and of TPX2 (partial depletion and addition) in an attempt to influence the first and second kinetic step, respectively, of their 2-step model. Overall, this study is technically interesting and could provide insight into the mechanism of branched microtubule nucleation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract if predictions of the model could be tested more directly.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) Validation of the model: The model which has more free parameters produces a better fit to the data. How strong is the evidence that this model uniquely describes the data best? For example, one may wonder if a cooperative (autocatalytic) 1-step binding model could also explain the experimental data. The two models examined here make different predictions for the kinetics of binding and the resulting distributions of the 'nucleator' and, in the 2-step model, of the 'activator'. The rationale of the experiments in Figure 4 is based on assuming that augmin is the 'nucleator' and TPX2 is the 'activator'. However, that is not demonstrated. The distributions of these molecules along microtubules using fluorescent constructs could easily be measured and compared to the model predictions. Ideally also the predicted rather slow binding kinetics could be measured. These experiments could lend solid experimental support for the assumptions made about the roles of these two molecules in the context of the kinetic model, and hence validate the model. Otherwise the study remains rather technical and speculative.</p><p>2) Significance and agreement with literature: as the authors discuss, in spindles, particularly in large <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract spindles, there is a RanGTP gradient which should result in the highest TPX2 activities being present in the spindle center which could remove the nucleation bias towards minus ends that the authors observe in their assay where there is no RanGTP gradient. A bias of nucleation toward spindle poles seems to contradict the findings of at least some previous literature, e.g. Brugues et al., 2012, that concludes that most nucleation takes place in the spindle center. Therefore, the question arises how much the particular assay conditions (uniform distributions of constitutively RanQ69L and the non-specific ATPase inhibitor vanadate) reflect the distribution of nucleation sites in spindles. In other words, why does the study advance our understanding of spindle assembly?</p><p>3) Technical question: how can the authors know that their image analysis procedure correctly connects several EB1 tracks and assigns branching points to the correct microtubule in what seems to be a crowded microtubule bundle imaged with standard light microscopy resolution?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript the role of Augmin-mediated microtubule nucleation of the side of existing microtubules in vitro using a <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract system to determine what factors control the shape of the branched network that forms. The authors have worked hard to rigorously quantify the structure and dynamics of the networks that form in their system and have compared them to simulations, in which the probability of branching depends solely on the binding of the Augmin/ γ-TuRC complex or also requires a second activation step. Their data best fit the simulations with an activation step, leading them to conclude that branching is a two-step process that requires binding of Augmin/γ-TuRC followed by activation by TPX-2.</p><p>The authors have developed a very nice assay for the growth of branched microtubule networks, but I was disappointed that they did not do more with it, for example by testing different models in their simulations or by investigating the nature of the activation step in microtubule nucleation. As it is, they describe a very nice assay and analysis pipeline but their results represent only a small step forward. I am not sure whether this is enough for <italic>eLife</italic>, given that the Petry group have already shown that TPX2 is an activator of the Augmin/γ-TuRC.</p><p>1) They describe their results as explaining why branching is biased towards the minus ends of the microtubules, which is correct, but misleading. The probability of branching is proportional to the age of each region of the microtubule, which is related to proximity to the minus ends, as these are the oldest regions. Nevertheless, the pattern would be different if the microtubules were growing more slowly.</p><p>2) The experiments in Figure 4 are important, but seem incomplete as they do not clearly distinguish between the roles of Augmin (part of the nucleator) and TPX2 (the presumed activator).</p><p>3) Why was the <italic>k<sub>act</sub></italic> chosen to be 0.07 in the simulation in Figure 4B rather than 0.2? This has the effect of flattening the orange line in the simulation to more closely resemble the results from TPX2 depletion in Figure 4C, but this is not a convincing demonstration of anything as reducing the <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic>to 0.07 might have a very similar effect.</p><p>4) The simulations use a <italic>k<sub>binding</sub></italic> for the nucleator complex, but do not include a <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>, implying that the nucleator binds irreversibly to the side of the microtubule. Having the nucleator also disassociate at a certain rate does not make much difference to the nucleator only model, where the branching microtubule starts growing immediately, but will affect the pattern of branching if the nucleator needs a second activation step, as this will reduce the bias towards the old sections of the microtubule.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43890.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) Validation of the model: The model which has more free parameters produces a better fit to the data.

The development of our model was partly data-driven. We found that branched MTs originated from the older MT lattice near the minus-end of the mother MTs, even though there is a lot of MT lattice available near the plus-ends where the effectors could bind to generate a new branch. This is most clearly evident with the site of the first branching event from a naked mother MT (Figure 2B). Hence, we proposed that branching sites are being “marked”, due to more binding events to older MT regions, and a new branch is nucleated with another Poisson process. Thus, any 1-step model where there is no time delay between the deposition of nucleation site and the generation of daughter, even if autocatalytic, will always result in a flat probability distribution for Figure 2B. Hence, the single-step model, which we define as binding and branching being concurrent, does not capture our measured distributions. In contrast, the sequential model, consisting of nucleation site deposition followed by branch formation, describes the data best, as depicted in Figures 1 and 2. This is not simply because of more available parameters, but rather a consequence of the molecular steps involved. In fact, the two models are related: when the second rate of branch formation is sped up, the sequential model essentially becomes again the 1-step model that no longer captures the branching network architecture (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). To ensure that this is also understood by a wide audience, we incorporated this link between the models in the subsection “Measuring the first branching events in branched microtubule networks”, and made an effort to better explain the models in the revised Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The two models examined here make different predictions for the kinetics of binding and the resulting distributions of the 'nucleator' and, in the 2-step model, of the 'activator'.

In our revised manuscript, we address this comment with the sequential experiments and direct measurement of binding rate of TPX2 to microtubules, as described in detail in the common response above. In the process, we made measurements such as direct, single-molecule observations of microtubule-associated proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, which we believed not to be possible. This has now opened a way of accessing the kinetics of proteins in their cytoplasmic environment, which had not been accessible previously. We believe this will be an important breakthrough for our and many other labs that work between in vivo and in vitro MT systems. Most importantly, these experiments resulted in a whole new figure (Figure 4), which we believe is now the highlight of this manuscript. The big surprise is that these experiments established a molecular order which could not have been predicted: our new results altogether show that branching is a sequential pathway that involves TPX2’s binding to individual MTs followed by the presence of augmin/γ-TuRC prior to branch nucleation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Significance and agreement with literature: as the authors discuss, in spindles, particularly in large <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract spindles, there is a RanGTP gradient which should result in the highest TPX2 activities being present in the spindle center which could remove the nucleation bias towards minus ends that the authors observe in their assay where there is no RanGTP gradient.

Therefore, the question arises how much the particular assay conditions (uniform distributions of constitutively RanQ69L and the non-specific ATPase inhibitor vanadate) reflect the distribution of nucleation sites in spindles.</p></disp-quote><p>These points by the reviewer are excellent, which we address below in multiple paragraphs including clarification and reasoning behind our assay setup.</p><p>a) Clarity: Based on the reviewer’s excellent points above, we realized that our description of the results needed improvement. First, we note that the described minus-end bias is in essence due to the longer lifetime of those regions of the MT lattice compared to the newly formed lattice near the plus-ends. This was also pointed out by reviewer 2 in their comments and thereby addressed. In our sequential model, new region of lattice near the plus-end is formed while the older lattice near the minus-end collects larger number of molecules of branching factor 1 (TPX2), making it more likely to generate a branch from the subsequent presence of augmin/γ-TuRC. In multiple places throughout the manuscript, we have clarified this point by stating, “older lattice near the minus-ends”.</p><p>b) RanGTP: We agree with the reviewer that the spindle assembly factor TPX2 will be released near chromosomes. However, the length scale and profile of RanGTP gradient have been shown to not bear any importance for the spindle structure (Oh et al., 2016). Here, the authors showed that the MT binding of spindle assembly factors such as TPX2, not their concentration profile, drives spindle assembly. Therefore, the homogeneous presence of RanGTP as in our assay still provides useful information on how the spindle is organized as summarized below. In fact, we believe that not having a spatial cue (e.g. a Ran gradient) was necessary for us to study how molecular effectors regulate MT nucleation in space and time and organize the MT networks, which is a first step towards obtaining a more advanced understanding of how the spindle is assembled.</p><p>c) Molecular motors: To address how underlying molecules result in self-organized structures such as the branched networks, it was necessary to decouple nucleation of new MTs from their sorting by molecular motors, as detailed below. In this work, we used the sodium orthovanadate to inhibit all motor activity, instead of using a cocktail of drugs to inhibit the dominant motor activities such as Eg5 and dynein, which had been done in previous works (Brugues et al., 2012). In our previous work (Supplementary Figure 1 in Petry et al., 2013), we showed that the concentration of sodium orthovanadate used resulted in structures that look identical to when only dynein is inhibited with p150-CC1. Inhibition of active transport in this work was necessary to make accurate measurements so that net translation of microtubules does not induce systematic errors in our measurements of nucleation. In the case of net translation of microtubules, the tracking of microtubules by following the motion of EB1 comets at the plus-ends does not provide us the information on growth of microtubules, which was necessary for our analysis. Therefore, to study the nucleation and growth of microtubules in branched networks, it was important to ensure that motor-based microtubule transport was abolished and we used sodium orthovanadate to achieve this.</p><p>Additionally, we note that our measurements recapitulate the measurements that have been made for microtubules in the spindle, such as the growth speed, predictions of nucleation rate, and microtubule length distribution. Therefore, the branched networks reflect the properties of the entire spindle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A bias of nucleation toward spindle poles seems to contradict the findings of at least some previous literature, e.g. Brugues et al., 2012, that concludes that most nucleation takes place in the spindle center.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this. As described in paragraph (a) above, our measurements reflect bias in nucleation from older MT regions near the minus-ends, and not from spindle poles per se. Notably, many excellent studies including ones from Needleman and Brugues labs have shown that minus-ends (or older lattices) do not just exist near the spindle poles, but throughout the spindle. Based on our work, older lattice regions near these minus-ends near the spindle center could serve as preferential sites for branching nucleation. Additionally, our mechanism could result in specific amplification of MTs that stably attached to kinetochores (longest-lived MTs) near the spindle center and hence generate denser k-fibers. We now include this in the Discussion “[…] the preferential nucleation from older MT lattice regions could allow for precise control over where branching occurs in the spindle. We propose that TPX2, which is released in the vicinity of chromosomes (Kalab et al., 2002; Oh et al., 2016), accumulates on the older MT lattice regions near chromosomes such as on MTs captured and stabilized by the kinetochores (Cimini et al., 2003; DeLuca et al., 2011; Lampson et al., 2004; Umbreit et al., 2012) and older lattice regions such as minus-ends near the spindle center. Branching MT nucleation by augmin/γ-TuRC from deposited TPX2 sites will selectively amplify older MTs generating dense kinetochore fibers near chromosomes.”</p><p>Thus, our work is congruent with previous studies that suggested MT nucleation, potentially by branching, mostly taking place in the spindle center. Further sorting of these MTs by motor activity may generate the spindle architecture, as we now discuss in the last paragraph of the Discussion. More generally, we note that how spatial and temporal hierarchy the MT nucleation pathways are related to one another, and how MT transport fuses these pathways to create a uniform MT nucleation profile that maintains the spindle, is the next big open question in the field.</p><p>In summary, based on our results and previous literature, we hypothesize that even with the presence of a Ran gradient and motor activity, the preference of MT nucleation from the older lattice will still persist. As such, we do not think that our results contradict the previous work, and rather advance the understanding of how MT generation is regulated within the spindle. We now discuss this comprehensively in our revised Discussion, fourth paragraph (Ran gradient) and last paragraph (motor activity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In other words, why does the study advance our understanding of spindle assembly?</p></disp-quote><p>Impact: We note that the few existing studies on nucleation within the spindle measure profiles at a single snapshot during metaphase when the entire spindle has been assembled and a lot of microtubule mass already exists and has been sorted by the motors. Here, the MT nucleation pathways are no longer distinguishable and intersect, driven by molecular motors, to yield the uniform MT nucleation profile that characterizes the spindle. Therefore we have a limited understanding of how a single MT nucleation pathway is formed and regulated.</p><p>Our work describes such an individual MT nucleation pathway for the first time, which corresponds to the dynamic process of generating the microtubule mass within the spindle and is therefore is essential for how the spindle is made. Our study demonstrates how the age of the MT lattice has a more significant role than previously anticipated for autocatalytic nucleation as a result of our experimentally demonstrated sequential kinetic scheme, and therefore advances our understanding of how MT nucleation within the spindle supports spindle assembly.</p><p>Most importantly, with the experiments performed during the review process, our study now establishes how the kinetics and molecular sequence of the branching effectors result in the geometry and network-wide architecture of branched networks. This had been a major missing area in this field, with very few previous examples that have only recently emerged (Roostalu et al., Cell 2019), and will therefore advance the spindle assembly field. Additionally, we believe that the new insights about the branching mechanism produced in this work informs bottom-up in vitro reconstitution of this pathway.</p><p>In light of this comment by the reviewer, we have thoroughly edited and expanded our discussion of this subject in the manuscript to cover three points: the mechanism of branching (Discussion, second paragraph), comparison of our measurements to previous work (Discussion, third paragraph), implications for spindle assembly (Discussion, fourth paragraph). We hope that our manuscript now addresses this point and is more impactful for the broad readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Technical question: how can the authors know that their image analysis procedure correctly connects several EB1 tracks and assigns branching points to the correct microtubule in what seems to be a crowded microtubule bundle imaged with standard light microscopy resolution?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We ensured that the analysis procedure was reliable as follows. First, we imaged branched networks from their initiation at a high frame rate imaging of 0.5 frames per second, while imaging both the EB1 and tubulin channels at every frame and limited our analysis to branched networks at early time points when the density of microtubules is not very high. Our analysis pipeline was benchmarked by manually tracking a few branched networks and comparing it with the analysis. Most importantly, for all measurements displayed in our work using the analysis pipeline (Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2), the analysis was conducted only for branched networks which had on average 20 microtubules. Therefore, we stopped our analysis before the network became too crowded, and analyzing multiple networks at low microtubule density and high frame rate was sufficient to provide the parameters we needed. For all networks tracked and used to obtain measurements, we visually inspected for inaccuracies in all networks we analyzed with the pipeline, and found that the analysis scheme had robust performance for low density of tens of microtubules per network. With this, we measured the reliable, bulk parameters that were then used to set up the model simulations – growth speed and branch angles.</p><p>Lastly, to conclusively accept or reject our kinetic models (new Figure 2), only the most reliable experimental measurements were used, where there was no ambiguity in locating the branch point manually. Specifically, Figure 2A-B report the location of the very first branching event on a previously unbranched (de novo) mother microtubule. See Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for two representative examples. Because crowding by other microtubules is not a concern for this measurement, dual-channel time lapses at high frame rate were sufficient to ensure accuracy. For the plots in Figure 2C-E at high microtubule density, branch points were not extracted, hence the minus-ends plot in Figure 2C does not show an experimental curve. For large networks, we measured the profile of plus-ends (Figure 2D), which can be unambiguously obtained by isolating EB1 particles, or tubulin intensity profile (Figure 2E), which was again measured over background; both are described in Materials and methods and illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The authors have developed a very nice assay for the growth of branched microtubule networks, but I was disappointed that they did not do more with it, for example by testing different models in their simulations or by investigating the nature of the activation step in microtubule nucleation. As it is, they describe a very nice assay and analysis pipeline but their results represent only a small step forward. I am not sure whether this is enough for eLife, given that the Petry group have already shown that TPX2 is an activator of the Augmin/γ-TuRC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for seeing the potential in our work and for suggesting avenues for improvement, which prompted us to further investigate our model and the mechanism we propose. Our revised work now comprehensively establishes how the kinetics and molecular sequence of branching effectors generate the architecture of branched networks, and additionally provides insights into the role of augmin, TPX2 and γ-TuRC in the branching pathway. As such, we believe that the revised work is of higher significance to the mitotic spindle and cytoskeleton fields.</p><p>We note that the focus of our work is to understand how the reaction kinetics of branching effectors establishes branched networks. Explaining how the regulation of MT nucleation can lead to specific architectures is also relevant for other MT nucleation pathways and the cytoskeleton as a whole.</p><p>Because our readouts are limited to measurement of kinetics, distinguishing between the molecular mechanisms of activation is not a possibility with this work. To investigate the molecular mechanism of branched formation or the activation as the reviewer suggested, a reconstituted system built from purified components is needed, and required live studies via single molecule microscopy, as well as atomic structures of these molecules in various combinations and in various states. At this point, we also note that we had previously identified that TPX2 had specific sequence signatures that suggested similarity with the γ-TuRC activator sequence (Alfaro-Aco et al., 2017). We proposed TPX2’s role in γ-TuRC activation based on mutations in those sequences disrupting the branching activity of TPX2. This proposition does not establish TPX2 as a direct activator of γ-TuRC, and what the function of TPX2 is in the branching pathway is unknown as of yet, as we describe in the last paragraph of our Introduction. Our new experiments (Figure 4) provide insight into the role of TPX2 in branching, but more work is needed to fully understand this including an in vitro reconstitution of branching and directed mutations in TPX2 that disrupt specific functions. While we are interested in pursuing this in the future, such a study is beyond the scope of our current work and will require pursuit by many labs throughout the next decade.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) They describe their results as explaining why branching is biased towards the minus ends of the microtubules, which is correct, but misleading.

As the reviewer correctly pointed out, our model and new accompanying experiments show preference due to age of the lattice. In our architecture measurements, the minus-ends served as the direct reference and a way of normalizing our nucleation profiles, therefore, we used that as the metric for our measurements. In multiple places throughout the manuscript, we have now clarified the reviewer’s point by stating, “older lattice near the minus-ends”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, the pattern would be different if the microtubules were growing more slowly.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that our model results in two classes of patterns: one where the bias towards the older lattice (minus-ends) is distinct and predicts the pattern we observe in experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, blue, green, orange and red curves), and the other extreme where branching rate is fast compared to the binding (magenta and purple curves, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). The latter regime effectively is the single-step model. Further, our sequential model is robust such that changing the parameters by a few fold does not change the effective pattern (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Therefore, decreasing the plus-end growth speed by a few fold does not change the regime of our model to result in a different pattern: the length scale of the pattern will expand proportionally to the absolute growth speed, but the shape of the pattern, especially our rescaled measurements (Figure 2B, C-E), will remain the same. Furthermore, we directly measured the growth speed of microtubules in our <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract system (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). We used these direct measurements as model parameters, and making the MTs grow slower did not correctly represent our experimental system that we aimed to describe in our model.</p><p>We have highlighted this point in the manuscript. In the subsection “Measuring the first branching events in branched microtubule networks”, we describe these results and end with, “Thus, our model results in two regimes of network architectures and is not sensitive to the chosen parameters.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments in Figure 4 are important, but seem incomplete as they do not clearly distinguish between the roles of Augmin (part of the nucleator) and TPX2 (the presumed activator).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In the revised manuscript, we performed new experiments summarized in the common response above and described in the new Figure 4. These sequential experiments in conjunction with direct visualization of TPX2, augmin/γ-TuRC establish the molecular sequence of proteins during branching. In summary, our new experiments altogether prove the sequential model where TPX2’s binding to de novo MTs deposits nucleation sites and branches emerge due to available augmin/γ-TuRC complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why was the k<sub>act</sub> chosen to be 0.07 in the simulation in Figure 4B rather than 0.2? This has the effect of flattening the orange line in the simulation to more closely resemble the results from TPX2 depletion in Figure 4C, but this is not a convincing demonstration of anything as reducing the k<sub>bind</sub> to 0.07 might have a very similar effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. The revised Figure 3 (previously Figure 4) now quantitatively compares the effect of changing TPX2 and augmin concentration to an equivalent change in <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> or <italic>k<sub>branch</sub></italic>. We use this data to conclude that the concentrations of augmin and TPX2 determine the net rate of nucleation, and therefore their unimolecular binding rates are involved in the branching pathway. The revised Figure 4 now addresses the molecular pathway through sequence experiments and single molecule measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The simulations use a k<sub>binding</sub> for the nucleator complex, but do not include a k<sub>off</sub>, implying that the nucleator binds irreversibly to the side of the microtubule. Having the nucleator also disassociate at a certain rate does not make much difference to the nucleator only model, where the branching microtubule starts growing immediately, but will affect the pattern of branching if the nucleator needs a second activation step, as this will reduce the bias towards the old sections of the microtubule.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point raised by the reviewer. We agree that our current model assumes a net rate of binding of the first protein that deposits the branching sites and does not include unbinding kinetics. This choice was made in our work to minimize the number of parameters that had to be fit when the identity of the molecules or their kinetics was unknown in the previous version. With the new experiments, we have directly measured TPX2’s binding to the branched networks. We find the net rate of deposition of TPX2 of 0.4 molecules/μm/s, which corresponds to the irreversible binding rate we assume in the model.</p><p>At the same time, the dissociation of the first branching effector at high rates will decrease the effective bias as the reviewer suggested. Based on this, we performed simulations that include the unbinding of branching effector 1 in our sequential model in the following manner. We kept the branching rate constant for the second step, which was chosen from our model where no unbinding of the first protein occurs (<italic>k<sub>branch</sub></italic> = 2.5x10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), and added an unbinding rate for the molecules of branching effector 1. As before, we matched the average length of mother microtubule when the first branching event occurred in our model to experimental data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In order to do that, when a higher unbinding rate was assumed, a higher binding rate of effector 1 was also necessary. Therefore, we explored the parameter space while satisfying our model constraints and present 3 parameter sets where <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>was included. Parameter set 1 represents the irreversible binding with <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> = 0.1 molecule μm<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (black curve). Parameter set 2 shows the model with <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>= 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup> with <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> = 0.14 μm<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (green curve). Parameter set 3 shows the model with <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>= 0.023 s<sup>-1</sup> with <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> = 0.2 μm<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (blue curve) and set 4 shows the model with highest <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>= 0.07 s<sup>-1</sup> with <italic>k<sub>bind</sub></italic> = 0.4 μm<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (red curve). In agreement with the reviewer’s comment (see Figure A), the spatial bias is reduced for higher <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>. We first attempted to estimate <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>for TPX2 in branched microtubules from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts to understand whether the unbinding of TPX2 is important to consider in our model. We spiked 2.5nM GFP-TPX2 in the presence of unlabelled, endogenous TPX2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and observed the association of single TPX2 molecules to the microtubules in branched networks. A few representative kymographs are displayed in Figure A. Visual inspection of this data already shows that TPX2 has long residence times on the microtubule lattice with some traces extending upto 300 seconds or longer. These long residence times prohibit precise measurements of <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>because the photobleaching timescale under these conditions is between 60100 seconds. Nevertheless, we measured the timescale for molecules that “dissociated” clearly during the imaged timelapse. n=34 measurements are plotted as a histogram. This value results in <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>= 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is likely an overestimate of the unbinding rate because of photobleaching rate being very similar. We note that low <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>for TPX2 is in agreement with previous reports in vitro (Supplementary Figure 3 in Roostalu et al., 2015). Comparing this to our simulations, <italic>k<sub>off</sub> </italic>= 0.01 s<sup>-1</sup> gives similar degree of bias to when irreversible binding was assumed, which makes us conclude that the unbinding of TPX2 could be ignored in our model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
