We recently developed a series of bioactive lipids that inhibit the human glycine transporter GlyT2 (SLC6A5) and provide analgesia in animal models of pain. Here, we have used functional analysis of mutant transporters combined with molecular dynamics simulations of lipid-transporter interactions to understand how these bioactive lipids interact with GlyT2. This study identifies a novel extracellular allosteric modulator site formed by a crevice between transmembrane domains 5, 7, and 8, and extracellular loop 4 of GlyT2. Knowledge of this site could be exploited further in the development of drugs to treat pain, and to identify other allosteric modulators of the SLC6 family of transporters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glycine transporter</kwd><kwd>bioactive lipid</kwd><kwd>analgesic</kwd><kwd>allosteric inhibitor</kwd><kwd>lipid binding site</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1144429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawling</surname><given-names>Tristan</given-names></name><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Renae M</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Mara</surname><given-names>Megan L</given-names></name><name><surname>Vandenberg</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000937</institution-id><institution>Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Australian Postgraduate Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mostyn</surname><given-names>Shannon N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013787</institution-id><institution>Westpac Bicentennial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Westpac Scholars Trust Future Leaders Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schumann-Gillett</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000937</institution-id><institution>Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Training Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frangos</surname><given-names>Zachary J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of how bioactive lipids bind and inhibit glycine transporters has the potential to be exploited in the development of a new class of analgesics for chronic pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission plays an important role in the spinal cord dorsal horn, regulating excitatory tone in the ascending pain pathway to prevent excess nociceptive signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Todd, 2010</xref>). Concentrations of glycine within the synapse are tightly controlled by two subtypes of secondary active glycine transporters, GlyT1 (SLC6A9) and GlyT2 (SLC6A5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eulenburg et al., 2005</xref>). GlyT1 is expressed throughout the central nervous system, while the expression of GlyT2 is localised to presynaptic inhibitory neurons and allows for rapid removal of glycine from inhibitory synapses and for recycling glycine into synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roux and Supplisson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zafra et al., 1995</xref>). The unique role of GlyT2 in pain processing has driven the development of a number of GlyT2 inhibitors for the treatment of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caulfield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vandenberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Inhibition of GlyT2 in this region should increase glycine concentrations within the synapse, allow prolonged activation of glycine receptors, and reduce the firing of excitatory pain-projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cioffi, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We have previously developed a new class of GlyT2 inhibitors based on the structure of the endogenous analgesic bioactive lipid, N-arachidonyl glycine (NAGly) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for representative structures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mostyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al., 2019</xref>). NAGly has a relatively low potency (IC<sub>50</sub>9 ÂµM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wiles et al., 2006</xref>), and using a medicinal chemistry approach we prepared a number of synthetic acyl amino acids that inhibit GlyT2 at concentrations in the low nanomolar range. Bioactive lipid inhibitors containing positively charged amino acid head groups are the most potent followed by aromatic, aliphatic, polar, and negatively charged amino acid head groups. One of these lipids, oleoyl <sc>d</sc>-lysine (ODLys), is potent, metabolically stable, blood brain barrier permeable, and produces analgesia in a rat model of neuropathic pain with minimal side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we have investigated how bioactive lipids bind and inhibit GlyT2, which will provide a structural framework for further design of allosteric inhibitors of GlyT2 that could form part of long term treatment options for patients with chronic pain.</p><p>Glycine transporters are members of the neurotransmitter sodium symporter (NSS) or SLC6 family of transporters which are secondary active transporters that exploit the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient to drive transport of amino acids and amino acid derivatives across cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>). Structures of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dopamine transporter (dDAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penmatsa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>), and the bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), suggest a common transport mechanism for the SLC6 family. Substrate and co-transported ions enter the extracellular facing vestibule, followed by movements of extracellular loop 4 (EL4) to close the extracellular gate. Unwound regions approximately half way across the transmembrane helices TM1, TM5, TM6, and TM7 form twisting hinges to rearrange around bound substrate and allow TM1a to swing open and release substrate into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kazmier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitor bound structures of dDAT and hSERT are in outward-open conformations with core TM helices preventing occlusion of the binding site and provide insight into transport-unfavourable conformations. In the nortriptyline bound dDAT structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>), there is a 10 Ã opening compared to the occluded substrate bound structure of LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests that typical inhibitors of this family bind in the central cavity to stop transport by preventing the closure of the extracellular gate. Bioactive lipid inhibitors are structurally dissimilar from typical inhibitors and the question arises as to how they inhibit GlyT2. We recently showed, using molecular dynamics (MD), that the bioactive lipids NAGly and oleoyl-<sc>l</sc>-Carnitine (OLCarn) embedded in membranes containing GlyT2 do not perturb the biophysical properties of the bilayer, or alter the structure of GlyT2, despite being present at a concentration an order of magnitude higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> for OLCarn inhibition of GlyT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schumann-Gillett and O'Mara, 2019</xref>). We have also demonstrated that, while the compounds have a high apparent affinity for GlyT2, the closely related glycine transporter GlyT1 is insensitive to the acyl amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mostyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that the compounds do not cause a general disruption of the membrane, but rather their inhibitory effects are mediated by binding to a specific site on GlyT2.</p><p>The mechanism of inhibition has been investigated for NAGly and oleoyl-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (<sc>OL</sc>Lys) and in both cases the lipids are not competitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wiles et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting the compounds bind to a separate site to that of the substrate glycine, however this site remains elusive. We have demonstrated that chimeric GlyT2 transporters containing EL4 from GlyT1 are insensitive to inhibition by NAGly and OLCarn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edington et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a single conservative point mutation in EL4 of GlyT2, I545L, results in transporters with reduced sensitivity to lipid inhibitors. Bioactive lipids may therefore inhibit GlyT2 by binding at a site that influences the substantial conformational changes of EL4 required for transport.</p><p>In this study, we used a mutagenesis approach in combination with ligand docking and MD simulations of a GlyT2 homology model to understand how acyl amino acid inhibitors interact with GlyT2. Our results resolve differences in structure activity for inhibitors with varying amino acid head groups, and we show that bioactive lipids bind to a novel extracellular allosteric site on the transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening GlyT2 point mutations</title><p>The binding site for the allosteric serotonin reuptake inhibitor, (<italic>S</italic>)-citalopram, lies in the extracellular facing vestibule of SERT, formed by residues from TM1b, TM6a, TM10, and TM11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>). To determine if bioactive lipids inhibit GlyT2 by binding to this âvestibule allosteric site,â corresponding residues in GlyT2 were mutated to remove potential interactions. OLCarn contains a bulky, zwitterionic head group conjugated to an oleoyl lipid tail, and was used as a screen to test mutant transporters for sensitivity to inhibition. None of the transporters containing mutations in the vestibule allosteric site display any change in inhibition compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To investigate alternate sites on GlyT2 we used the observation that EL4 of GlyT2 has been shown to influence sensitivity to OLCarn and NAGly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edington et al., 2009</xref>). A selection of mutations were made to residues in close proximity to EL4 that met one or a number of other criteria: residues should be accessible in the outward-facing conformation; residues which are not conserved between GlyT1 and GlyT2, and could account for differential selectivity of the inhibitors; aromatic residues, that could explain the structure activity from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al. (2019)</xref>, where the most potent acyl amino acids contained positively charged or aromatic head groups; and residues that are in regions of GlyT2 that have important conformational roles in the transport cycle (residues shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Mutations to GlyT2 residues were made either to resemble GlyT1, or to remove potential interactions with bioactive lipids but not disrupt the overall transport activity, often using substitutions present in the bacterial homologue, LeuT.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47150.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Defining the bioactive lipid binding site.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Inhibition of GlyT2 by 1 ÂµM oleoyl L-carnitine.Â Transporters were WT or with mutations to the vestibule allosteric site (VAS) or adjacent to EL4.

The location for docking was selected based on the mutagenesis results. Specifically, OLLys, oleoyl <sc>l</sc>-Leucine (OLLeu), oleoyl <sc>l</sc>-Tryptophan (O<sc>L</sc>Trp), and oleoyl <sc>l</sc>-Serine (O<sc>L</sc>Ser) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâc</xref>) were each docked into an area that encompassed the extracellular and upper-leaflet embedded regions of TM5, TM8, and EL4 of GlyT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>), as this region includes the cluster of differentially sensitive residues identified using mutagenesis, thatÂ is F428 (TM5), V432 (TM5), I545 (EL4), Y550 (EL4), P561 (TM8),W563 (TM8), and L569 (TM8). The stabilities of the binding locations were assessed using unrestrained MD simulations (performed in triplicate) of the inhibitor/protein complexes, embedded in a bilayer containing POPC and 20 mol % cholesterol. As the head of the inhibitor docked in a similar location for each class of inhibitor, the positions of the inhibitors can be classified into three general poses based on the orientation of the tail: 1) head inserted into extracellular pocket, with the tail exposed to water; 2) tail inserted into extracellular pocket and the double-bond in close proximity to I545 of EL4; and 3) tail inserted into extracellular pocket, with the double-bond in close proximity to TM5 and the protein-lipid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Regardless of the docked position, the backbone RMSD of GlyT2 remained below 3.8 Ã, indicating that GlyT2 did not display any large-scale conformational changes when OLLys, <sc>OL</sc>Trp, <sc>OL</sc>Leu, or <sc>OL</sc>Ser are bound, compared to when each inhibitor was absent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplements 6</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, regardless of the initial position of the inhibitor, the initial docked interaction is not maintained. In all simulations of OLLys, <sc>OL</sc>Trp, <sc>OL</sc>Leu, or <sc>OL</sc>Ser which were initiated from docked poses, the inhibitor moved out of the pocket, or reoriented so that the lipid tail was directed towards TM5. Overall, MD simulations of the docked poses with the lipid inhibitor oriented head-first in the extracellular pocket, with the tail exposed to water, or with the tail orientated so the double bond was in close proximity to I545 of EL4, indicates that neither orientation reflects stable inhibitor binding.</p><p>When the inhibitors docked with the tail directed towards TM5, the lipid inhibitors move from their initial docked pose and burrow into a novel extracellular allosteric site, with their tail wedged in a hydrophobic cavity between TM5, TM7, and TM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1dâe</xref>) and remained in that conformation for the remainder of the simulation. This was observed in all replicate simulations of OLLeu, OLLys and OLTrp, and in 2 of the three replica simulations of OLSer. It should be noted that the initial docked position of OLSer in the extracellular pocket is notably shallower than the other lipid inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In each case when the lipid inhibitor binds in the extracellular allosteric site, the amino acid head groups of the bioactive lipids remain close to the bilayer/water interface and interact with the extracellular edges of TM5, TM7, TM8, and EL4. As the lipid inhibitors preferentially bind in this pocket, further discussion herein will focus on these simulations.</p><p>Analysis of the MD simulations shows that the binding of each lipid inhibitor to GlyT2 is mediated by several key amino acids (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The lipids adopt a kinked structure with the head group interacting with a number of aromatic amino acids, as well as the side chain of R531 and backbone of V523, while the acyl tail is stabilised by aliphatic residues lining the TM5/7/8 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1fâg</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>I545 on EL4 facilitates binding into the extracellular allosteric site</title><p>Access of lipids to the TM5/7/8 cavity is influenced by I545 in EL4 where I545 appears to sterically restrict the volume of the acyl chain binding pocket for OLLys, OLTrp, and OLSer. In all MD simulations, the side chain of I545 remains pointed inward (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâb</xref>) to interact with the acyl chain of each acyl amino acid. In this way, I545 appears to stabilise the acyl amino acid in the hydrophobic TM5/7/8 cavity, preventing the lipid from inserting into the centre of GlyT2. The beta-branched structure of I545 also facilitates the tail insertion into the TM5/7/8 cavity, with substantial curvature of the acyl chain occurring proximal to I545 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>). For OLSer, the initial docked pose of the lipid is located at the opening to the extracellular allosteric site. OLSer burrows deeper into the binding site throughout the 100 ns simulation, facilitated by I545, which suggests insertion is an important step mediated by interactions with the acyl tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47150.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>I545 facilitates lipid inhibitor binding to the extracellular allosteric site.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>)Â Docked position of OLLys (magenta spheres) where the acyl tail is folded at the double bond, and neighbours EL4.

If this residue is essential to facilitate acyl amino acid burrowing into an inhibitory conformation, then its presence should be required for all bioactive lipids. To confirm this, a selection of synthetic acyl amino acids were applied to oocytes expressing the I545L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2gâh</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

While the lipids initially docked in similar poses to that seen for WT GlyT2, they adopt different positions upon MD simulation. In particular, the initial docked pose of OLSer positions the lipid at the opening to the extracellular allosteric site, however steric hindrance from I545L blocks OLSer from burrowing deeper into the binding site in 2 of the three replica simulations for the I545L mutation, and instead, OLSer moves away from the extracellular allosteric site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In the single simulation where OLSer did not dissociate from the allosteric pocket of the I545L mutant, the acyl tail only partially entered the hydrophobic TM5/7/8 cavity, while the head group did not interact with the surrounding amino acids, but was partially inserted into the surrounding membrane. Conversely, OLLys is able to bind in the extracellular allosteric site of the I545L mutant GlyT2, and maintains head group interactions with residues in EL4 and TM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2dâe</xref>). However, the presence of the I545L mutation prevents full insertion of the OLLys tail into the lipid binding pocket, which instead adopts a hairpin conformation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2bâ2e</xref>). This is consistent with the ability of OLLys to retain inhibition of the I545L mutant, albeit with reduced potency, and may explain how more potent inhibition can be achieved with a deeper penetrating acyl amino acid.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-47150-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47150.015</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>OLSer binding to I545L GlyT2.</title></caption></media><p>To further investigate selectivity between GlyT2 and GlyT1, we created the corresponding reverse GlyT1 mutation, L425I.

In control simulations without the acyl amino acid inhibitors, the side chain of W563 associates with the R439 side chain through a cation-Ï interaction, forming a physical barrier, or âgateâ, which limits the volume and accessibility of the cavity between TM5 and TM8. When lipid inhibitors are present, the distance between W563 and R439 remains between 7.0Â Â±Â 0.3 Ã and 9.7Â Â±Â 1.2 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), however the precise nature of the interaction between W563 and R439 is dependent upon the amino acid head group of the bioactive lipid. OLLys binding changes the interaction between TM5 and TM8, where the indole group of W563 instead prefers to interact with the OLLys side chain for 71% of the total simulation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). For OLSer, the polar hydroxymethyl group in the side chain also inserts between the R439 and W563 side chains as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and interacts with these residues forÂ &gt;50% of the total simulation time. The hydrophobic OLLeu side chain is within 4 Ã of W563 and R439 forÂ &gt;90% of the total simulation time. However OLLeu does not directly interact with these residues and instead faces towards the centre of GlyT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In the case of OLTrp however, the aromatic side chain forms a cation-Ï planar stacking arrangement, where the guanadinium group of R439 is sandwiched between <sc>OL</sc>Trp and the aromatic ring of W563 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Notably, the interaction between R439 and OLTrp persists for the total simulation time. While the potency of OLTrp is greatly affected by the W563L mutation, inhibition of the R439L mutant is unchanged compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that W563 is more important for governing head group interactions, or that there are compensatory interactions when the postive charge of R439 is lost.</p><p>For the P561S mutant transporter, inhibition by NOGly and OLVal is comparable to WT GlyT2, whereas lipids with larger or more sterically restricted head groups (OLCarn, OLTrp, and ODLys) have reduced apparent affinities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). P561 is the first residue at the top of TM8, where the helix breaks into a small unwound region before EL4 begins. Mutation of P561 may therefore alter the connection between TM8 and EL4, extending the helix and changing the shape of the gap between the two domains.

Importantly, F428 (TM5) and L569 (TM8) contact each other to mediate the TM5/TM8 helix-helix interaction. Upon insertion of the lipid inhibitors into the extracellular allosteric site, the extracellular regions of TM5 and TM8 shift apart, movingÂ ~4 Ã after 100 ns simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5dâe</xref>). F428 and L569 however, remain tightly associated to maintain contacts at the mid-point between these helices, and create a snug binding cavity for the acyl tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Indeed, the terminal carbon of the lipid inhibitor tail remains within 15 Ã of V432 throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Mutation of these inter-helical contact residues may therefore select for certain tails through changes in the volume, shape and acyl chain accessibility of the binding pocket.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Acyl amino acids are a new class of glycine transport inhibitors that have analgesic effects in rodent models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain with minimal overt side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Succar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vuong et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we have explored how these compounds bind to, and inhibit, the glycine transporter, GlyT2. The acyl amino acids consist of two distinct elements: an unsaturated acyl tail and the amino acid head group. Both elements are essential for inhibition, with the length of the tail, the position of the double bond, and the chemical nature of the amino acid all influencing potency and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mostyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mostyn et al., 2019</xref>). By studying the effects of a series of mutant transporters in TM5, TM8, and EL4, in combination with docking studies and MD, we have been able to identify structural elements in the transporter that determine head group and acyl tail specificity.</p><p>Mutations of I545 and Y550 reduce the inhibitory action of all inhibitors, suggesting that these residues interact with common features of the bioactive lipids. MD simulations suggest that I545 plays a role in steering the acyl tail into the TM5/7/8 pocket, and that a conservative mutation of this residue can cause a striking restriction of binding. Additionally, Y550 can coordinate the amino acid backbone of the bioactive lipid head group. In MD simulations, the head groups of the lipid inhibitors are stabilised by an aromatic cage formed by residues W563 (TM8), F526 (TM7), and Y550 (EL4) as well as the positively charged R439 (TM5), and R531 (EL4) which has previously been shown to be important for inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edington et al., 2009</xref>). Mutation of W563 has the greatest effects on inhibitors with positively charged or aromatic amino acid head groups whilst producing no effect on the efficacy of lipids containing aliphatic or uncharged polar head groups; this suggests the indole ring of W563 provides additional contacts for the side chains of the most potent inhibitors.</p><p>The stability of the extracellular allosteric site relies on inter-helical connections between EL4-TM8 and TM5-TM8. The size and configuration of the amino acid head group accommodated in this pocket could be altered with mutation to P561, an important helix breaking residue at the top of TM8. Similarly, F428 (TM5) and L569 (TM8) lie just outside the base of the cavity and form inter-helical contacts. We predict that mutation of these inter-helical contact residues may change the shape and volume of the acyl binding pocket, resulting in mutant transporters with altered head-specific and tail-specific sensitivity.</p><p>In each of the MD simulations,Â the bioactive lipids were docked into the region identified in the mutagenesis studies, and then allowed to find their optimal binding location following 100 ns of simulation. OLLys, OLTrp, and OLLeu were docked into the extracellular allosteric site and remained bound in the cavity for the full 100 ns of simulation. However, for OLSer, the lipid initially binds with the acyl tail partially buried within the cavity with the head group poking out to explore both the membrane and extracellular space. After 100 ns of simulation, OLSer migrates into GlyT2 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) to form a more stable interaction where the serine head group interacts with TM5, TM8, and EL4, as seen with other acyl amino acids. In each case, the acyl tails of bioactive lipids penetrate the transporter to forge a deeper cavity, driving apart TM5 and TM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5dâe</xref>). For the I545L transporter, bioactive lipids either did not bind in the extracellular allosteric site, or remained loosely associated in a shallow pocket with the acyl tails in a hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2eâf</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the formation of this deep binding pocket is unique to GlyT2, and may explain the selectivity of inhibition over GlyT1.</p><p>The identification of the acyl amino acid binding site by mutagenesis and MD of lipid docking raises questions about the mechanism of inhibition, and whether such a cavity exists in other closely related neurotransmitter transporters. In the transition from the outward-occluded state to the inward-open state in the bacterial homologue of the SLC6 family (LeuT), TM5 and TM7 undergo substantial conformational changes causing these helices to bend, and EL4 to pack into the central vestibule to close off the extracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in both LeuT and the multi-hydrophobic amino acid transporter, MhsT, the intracellular half of TM5 unwinds via a conserved Gly-X<sub>9</sub>-Pro motif during the transition to the inward open state to allow release of Na<sup>+</sup> ions and substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malinauskaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeppelin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stolzenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Binding of a bioactive lipid to the extracellular allosteric binding site formed by TM5, TM7, TM8, and EL4 may therefore restrict the movements of EL4 and/or the unwinding of TM5 to inhibit the transport mechanism. Perturbation of this region via lipid binding may alter the dynamics of GlyT2, and could be a potential mechanism of inhibition that would slow, but not completely block, transport as in the case of a partial inhibitor.</p><p>Cholesterol has also been demonstrated to modulate DAT and SERT. A crystal structure of dDAT revealed a cholesterol molecule coordinated in an inner-leaflet, membrane exposed, cleft between TM1a, TM5, and TM7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Penmatsa et al., 2013</xref>). Superimposition of the dDAT structure with the inward-open structure of LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>) reveals a potential regulatory mechanism for cholesterol, where cholesterol may be an endogenous modulator of the dopamine transporter by inhibiting the transition to an inward-facing conformation, which has since been supported using molecular dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeppelin et al., 2018</xref>). The allosteric site for cholesterol is an inner leaflet, membrane exposed site on the surface of dDAT, whereas the bioactive lipid site identified in this study is buried between helices. The lipid binding site on GlyT2 is also distinct from the central substrate binding or vestibule allosteric sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and represents a novel extracellular allosteric site for the SLC6 family of transporters.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47150.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Bioactive lipid inhibitors bind to GlyT2 at an extracellular allosteric site, separate from the âclassicalâ central substrate and vestibule allosteric binding sites.</title><p>OLLys (orange spheres) is bound to GlyT2 (100 ns).

It is striking that the reverse L425I mutation in GlyT1 is sufficient to impart sensitivity of some of the inhibitors, which suggests the binding site must be mostly pre-formed in GlyT1, and that subtle conformational differences may accommodate different bioactive lipids. This also suggests that it may be possible to exploit these subtle differences in the structure of the extracellular allosteric site between other SLC6 members to design novel compounds that inhibit neurotransmitter transporters in a fundamentally different manner to the classical transport inhibitors such as citalopram, cocaine, or nortriptyline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td>GlyT2a WT</td><td>UniProtKB - Q9Y345 SLC6A5</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morrow et al., 1998</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td>GlyT21b WT</td><td>UniProtKB - P48067 SLC6A9</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (female <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>)</td><td>Oocytes</td><td>Nasco, Wisconsin, USA</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/XEP_Xla100">XEP_Xla100</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pOTV</td><td>Krieg PA, Melton DA (1984) Functional messenger RNAs are produced by SP6 in vitro transcription of cloned cDNAs.

The systems were then equilibrated by performing a series of five one ns simulations, where the backbone atoms of GlyT2 were restrained using sequentially descending force constants of 1000 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> nm<sup>â1</sup>, 500 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> nm<sup>â1</sup>, 100 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> nm<sup>â1</sup>, 50 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> nm<sup>â1</sup> and 10 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> nm<sup>â1</sup>. The coordinates from the final frame of each 10 kJ mol<sup>â1</sup> nm<sup>â1</sup> restrained simulation were used as the starting conformation for unrestrained simulations. New velocities were assigned and unrestrained MD simulations lasting 100 ns performed in triplicate for each system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Simulation details</title><p>The simulation conditions were the same as used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schumann-Gillett and O'Mara (2019)</xref>. Briefly, the NPT ensemble was employed and the solute (acyl-amino acid-bound GlyT2 in a bilayer) and solvent were separately coupled to an external temperature bath at 300 K. The Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello velocity rescale thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) was used and the coupling constant was Ï<sub>T</sub> = 0.1 ps. The system was weakly coupled to an external pressure bath using the Berendsen thermostat, which was set to 1 bar. Semi-isotropic pressure coupling was employed, isotropic in the plane of the bilayer (x-y). The coupling constant was Ï<sub>T</sub> = 0.5 ps, with an isothermal compressibility of 4.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â5</sup> bar. The LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hess et al., 1997</xref>) was used to constrain the covalent bond lengths of the solute and the SETTLE algorithm was used to constrain the geometry of the water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>). The electrostatic and non-bonded interactions were updated every time step. Particle mesh Ewald summation was used to calculate the electrostatic interactions. The Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated using a 1.0 nm cut-off. Images of the docked and simulation systems were produced using the Visual Molecular Dynamics software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>), or PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, SchrÃ¶dinger, LLC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis</title><p>All data were calculated using 1000 frames, corresponding to 100 ns of simulation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Baruch Kanner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Mostyn et al., describes the characterization of a novel allosteric binding site in a glycine transporter, GlyT2, targeted by bioactive lipid analgesics, using biochemistry, electrophysiology, homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Previous studies had identified a region of the protein, extracellular loop 4, that was responsible for specificity of endogeonous lipid to GlyT2 compared to GlyT1, and had developed a class of bioactive lipid inhibitors based thereon. This study uses this information as a starting-point for docking and simulations to a homology model of GlyT2 (based on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dopamine transporter, dDAT), and tests those predictions experimentally. The results provide opportunities for the synthesis of novel drugs for pain treatment. Furthermore, this work could be exploited to modulate the activity of other related neurotransmitter transporters in related allosteric sites.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key conclusion of this study is that the inhibitors do not bind the known allosteric site used by citalopram. However, the authors did not perform any site-directed mutagenesis analysis on the citalopram binding site similar to that performed on the newly discovered site. Such analysis would help rule out binding to the other allosteric site.</p><p>2) An additional concern relates to the conformational changes of the ligands, which are elongated lipids with several rotatable bonds, posing a significant challenge to docking. These ligands move deeper into the pocket during molecular dynamics simulations, raising the possibility that the docking was not sufficiently robust. For example, the results might differ if a larger box were included. Therefore, important details regarding the docking analysis and careful analysis of the predicted mode of binding must be provided to support the conclusions. How were the binding site boundary identified? How were the ligands prepared for docking? How was the docking pose selected (i.e. was it the top scoring pose)? Were the top-scoring docking poses similar to each other? Using another docking method (such as a flexible docking algorithm) is an optional additional strategy that would provide alternative solutions and further support the relevance of these results.</p><p>3) The authors performed MD simulations on a single ligand-docked model. How much would the ligand insertions observed during the simulations depend on the initial conformation of the predicted complex? As described in point (2), there should have been several possible docking solutions, and each may have resulted in a different conformation after the MD simulations. Therefore, similar analysis should be carried out for more than one docking solution to see whether the final poses converge. Repeats of the MD simulations (n&gt;=3) would also establish robustness and reproducibility. In particular, interpretations of differences between compounds should not be based on the outcome of a single trajectory (e.g. Figure 3).</p><p>4) Another concern is the potential unreliability of calculations based on a homology model in an apo conformation, i.e. without ions or a ligand in the central pocket, which is potentially unstable during MD. Completely ligand-free structures of e.g. LeuT have been shown to adopt a similar overall occluded conformation, but only after Leu99 has rotated and inserted into the central pocket. Please provide further evidence for the robustness of this choice with more detailed analysis of the stability of the system (such as RMSDs during MD) and provide some discussion of the choice. The simulation repeats mentioned in (3) should help.</p><p>5) To further establish the confidence of each predicted simulation result, please provide better quantitation of computed docking interactions, and/or visualizations that indicate the variability/spread of the results during a trajectory (e.g., using density/occupancy maps).</p><p>6) The phrase &quot;experimentally validated&quot;, used to describe the homology model, is too vague. Some description of how the homology model was validated or why the model is accurate enough for this work is required. This should include the sequence identity of the model to the template and the corresponding expected accuracy, as well as the overall level of conservation in EL4 between the target and template.</p><p>7) The first item of the Results section (Figure 1A) shows the inhibition of glycine transport by OLCarn (the name of this compound should be given also in the Legend) in several mutants. The rationale for selecting these mutants is not clear. Several of the residues chosen are identical in GlyT2 and GlyT1, which is not sensitive to the biolipids. Moreover, it is not explained what the reason is for selecting the substitutions. For example, why is Pro-561 mutated to Ser out of 19 possible substitutions? To help clarify the choice of mutations, it might make more sense to show simulation data first and base the selection of mutations on this information. Alternatively, the authors could first analyze those residues which differ between the two GlyT's, such as the important GlyT2-I545L mutant.</p><p>8) The authors mention they identified a binding pocket unique to GlyT2 vs GlyT1, but the description is vague. A figure with explanation would help. In addition, Ile-545 of GlyT2 is a major determinant for the selectivity of the biolipids and there are steric implications when it is replaced by Leu, as in GlyT1. It would be important to put Figure 2A and B side-by side with Supplmentary Figure 8A and B and enhance visualization using, for example, stick representations.</p><p>9) The authors deduce a mechanism of OLSer binding from the docking and MD simulations (Discussion section), speculating that the &quot;Bioactive lipids may therefore navigate the aqueous solution or interact with the cell membrane before inserting into the allosteric site, tail first&quot;. This proposed mechanism is too speculative to be included in the Discussion section, as these movements likely resulted from initial incorrect docking poses. Please revise or remove.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Identification of an allosteric binding site on the human Glycine Transporter, GlyT2, for bioactive lipid analgesics&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Autodock vina implements a flexible Monte Carlo sampling optimisation with a new knowledge-based scoring function, significantly improving the quality of the prediction results compared to other flexible docking programs (Pagadala et al., 2017). While we agree with the reviewer that taking protein motion into account via a fully flexible docking algorithm would provide an alternative solution, the size of the system makes this an unrealistic choice. Instead, we specifically chose to use MD to account for the flexibility of the substrate and protein after docking. This not only allows both protein and ligand dynamics, but also recovers the local minimum energy conformation for the protein/ligand complex in an explicit solvated membrane environment, rather than simply using a scoring function.</p><p>As this was not clear in our original manuscript, we have expanded the Materials and methods section to explicitly address the reviewerâs comments by including a description of the docking region, preparation of ligands for docking and sorting of poses for subsequent MD simulation. Specifically, we state that the ligands were treated as flexible during docking and modelled with a united-atom connectivity. The box location was carefully chosen based on the mutagenesis results to position the ligand in close proximity to residues that affect the activity of GlyT2. In our revised paper we have classified our ligand binding poses into categories based on overall orientation and performed simulations on one pose from each category for each ligand, as shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 5. We believe due to the subsequent MD step, the variability within each category will be accounted for during dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors performed MD simulations on a single ligand-docked model.

All simulations presented in the paper are now performed in triplicate. Data on the persistence of contacting residues throughout the simulation time is presented as Supplementary file 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another concern is the potential unreliability of calculations based on a homology model in an apo conformation, i.e. without ions or a ligand in the central pocket, which is potentially unstable during MD.

The stability of the protein has been clarified through the addition of RMSDs for each set of triplicate simulations for the control and for each docked pose of each inhibitor.</p><p>(Figure 1âfigure supplement 7, Figure 1âfigure supplement 8 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 9), which complement the RMSFs (Figure 1âfigure supplement 10) that were presented in the original manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To further establish the confidence of each predicted simulation result, please provide better quantitation of computed docking interactions, and/or visualizations that indicate the variability/spread of the results during a trajectory (e.g., using density/occupancy maps).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added information of the percentage time for contact residues throughout the simulation (Supplementary file 4) and added the dynamic information for the TM8-TM5 separation distance (Figure 5).
