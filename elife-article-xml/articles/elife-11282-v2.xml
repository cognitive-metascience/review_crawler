To quantify such complex evolutionary dynamics in vivo, time resolved and genome wide data including rare variants are essential. We performed whole-genome deep sequencing of HIV-1 populations in 9 untreated patients, with 6-12 longitudinal samples per patient spanning 5-8 years of infection. The data can be accessed and explored via an interactive web application. We show that patterns of minor diversity are reproducible between patients and mirror global HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a universal landscape of fitness costs that control diversity. Reversions towards the ancestral HIV-1 sequence are observed throughout infection and account for almost one third of all sequence changes. Reversion rates depend strongly on conservation. Frequent recombination limits linkage disequilibrium to about 100bp in most of the genome, but strong hitch-hiking due to short range linkage limits diversity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11282.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11282.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11282.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>HIV was transmitted from apes to humans multiple times before the virus began to spread among humans some time in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. The virus is now found around the globe and has evolved into several different subtypes. Also, HIV continues to evolve inside each infected individual so that different variations of the virus are often present in the same person at any given time.</p><p>When a person initially becomes infected, immune cells called killer T-cells seek out and destroy infected cells. However, HIV quickly acquires genetic mutations that allow it to escape the immune system and multiply in the body. There is a cost to this evasion strategy: the mutant forms of the virus often don’t multiply as rapidly as the variant that first infected the individual. This may explain why the virus often mutates back to its previous form in newly infected people. But many questions remain about how these pressures influence the evolution of the virus in individuals and in populations over time.</p><p>Now, Zanini et al. have sequenced the genomes of HIV samples collected from nine people with HIV in Sweden over the course of five to eight years. These individuals were diagnosed between 1990 and 2003 – when HIV medications were not as widely used as they are now – and did not receive any treatment during the course of the study. Therefore, the study provides a rare opportunity to look at how HIV evolves in the absence of drugs that target the virus.</p><p>Zanini et al. sequenced the entire genetic code of each form of the virus identified in the samples. The data show that HIV follows predictable patterns of evolution within individuals as well as across human populations. Mutations happen frequently all over the HIV genome. However, the mutant viruses often revert to a common or “optimal” form of the virus throughout the course of infection. This suggests that there is a tradeoff between the benefits of acquiring new mutations and maintaining a set of traits that have enabled the virus to spread so successfully in humans.</p><p>To make it easier for other researchers to explore the data, Zanini et al. created a web application that allows others to access and create visual representations of viral evolution.</p><p>Together these findings suggest that it will be possible to achieve a fuller understanding of RNA virus evolution that integrates the molecular biology of the virus and the immune response of the host with the evolutionary changes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11282.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11282.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>deep sequencing</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>reversion</kwd><kwd>fitness landscapes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>260686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Neher</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole genome deep sequencing of many longitudinally sampled HIV-1 populations reveals that reversions towards ancestral HIV-1 genome sequences occur throughout the course of infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a paradigmatic example of a rapidly adapting population characterized by high diversity, strong selection, and recombination. HIV-1 has originated from multiple zoonotic transmissions from apes in the early part of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>), one of which gave rise to the worldwide pandemic. This lineage is called group M and has diversified into different subtypes at a rate of about 1 in 1000 substitutions per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Tens of thousand of HIV-1 group M variants are available in the Los Alamos National Laboratories HIV database (LANL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foley et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of HIV-1 ultimately takes place within infected individuals and can be observed directly in longitudinal samples of virus populations from the same individual. The detailed knowledge of HIV-1 biology paired with historical samples makes HIV-1 an ideal system to study general features of evolution at high mutation rates and strong selection that are otherwise only accessible in evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elena and Lenski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miralles et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>During the first few months of an HIV-1 infection, the viral population typically acquires several mutations that mediate escape from cytotoxic T-cells (CTL). The properties and dynamics of these mutations and their effect on epitope presentation and virus control have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goonetilleke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kearney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Such escape variants often compromise virus replication and have been shown to revert upon transmission of the virus to a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leslie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2007</xref>). However, the quantitative contribution of escape and reversion to HIV-1 evolution and the degree to which costly mutations are compensated by additional mutations is less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schneidewind et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to CTL escape mutations, drug resistance mutations can spread through the viral population within weeks and longitudinal sequence data has been used to study emergence and fitness cost of resistance mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedskog et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Little et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paredes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Longitudinal sequence data has also been used to track evolution driven by the humoral immune response against HIV-1 which occurs throughout infection and results in high rates of evolution in the variable loops of HIV-1 surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shankarappa et al., 1999</xref>). In a pioneering study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shankarappa et al. (1999)</xref> characterized HIV-1 evolution of parts of the gp120 envelope protein over approximately 6–12 years in 11 patients, demonstrating consistent patterns of diversity and divergence. While this early study was limited to about 10 sequences per sample, next-generation sequencing technology today allows deep characterization of intrapatient HIV-1 variability including rare mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedskog et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsibris et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The earlier studies discussed above have either focused on early infection or particular regions of the HIV-1 genome. However, most virus evolution happens during chronic infection simultaneously at many locations in the genome. To develop a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the evolution and diversification of HIV-1 populations, we generated a whole-genome, deep-sequencing data set covering nine patients over 5–8 years with 6–12 time points per patient. Importantly, the data set covers the entire genome such that no substitution is missed and includes early samples defining the initial population. To our knowledge, this is the only whole-genome deep sequencing data set with long follow-up of multiple patients. We provide interactive and intuitive web-based access to the data set and hope it will become a resource for many future studies, like the data set by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shankarappa et al. (1999)</xref> has been in the last years.</p><p>Below, we first describe the methodology we developed to sequence the entire HIV-1 genome at great depth. We then analyze the intrapatient evolution of HIV-1 and show that the minor variants in the virus population explore sequence space in predictable fashion at the single site level. At the same time, we observe a strong tendency for reversion towards the global HIV-1 consensus that is not limited to early infection but occurs at an approximately constant rate throughout chronic infection. Reversion is more frequent at sites that are more conserved at the global level, suggesting a direct relationship between intrapatient fitness cost and global conservation. Together with reproducible patterns of intrapatient variation, this link explains why HIV-1 fitness landscapes can be inferred from cross-sectional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahirel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferguson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mann et al., 2014</xref>). We further find frequent recombination, which allows the viral population to evolve independently in different regions of the genome. Nevertheless, recombination is not frequent enough to decouple mutations closer than 100 base pairs and we observe signatures of hitch-hiking at short distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Maynard Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The study included nine HIV-1-infected patients who were diagnosed in Sweden between 1990 and 2003. Data from two additional patients (p4 and p7) were excluded from analysis because of suspected superinfection and failure to amplify early samples with low virus levels, respectively. The patients were selected to have a relatively well-defined time of infection and to have been treatment-naive for a minimum of 5 years. Patients diagnosed in recent years rarely fulfill these inclusion criteria because therapy is almost universally recommended, but this was not the case when the study patients were diagnosed. Basic characteristics of the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Additional data on the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. All patients progressed to moderate-to-severe immunosuppression during the study period. The final CD4 count within the study period for patients 1–3, 5–6 and 8–11 were 340, 369, 140, 228, 287, 378, 158, 200 and 251, respectively. Of the nine patients, eight were males, seven were men who have sex with men (MSM), two were heterosexually infected (HET), and eight were infected in Sweden. The method to estimate the date of infection (EDI) is described in Materials and methods. We retrieved longitudinal biobank plasma samples covering the time period from early infection (time since EDI 33–209 days) until end of study follow-up, which usually coincided with start of antiretroviral therapy (time since EDI 5.5–8.3 years). The number of samples per patient ranged between 6 and 12 and, in total, we investigated 73 samples. The median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 12,000 copies/ml for the samples with available data on RNA levels. Some samples had low RNA levels, which partly is explained by the study design that required that the patients were treatment-naive for at least 5 years.

Comparison with routine plasma HIV-1 RNA level measurements performed at time of sampling showed that the median template complementary DNA (cDNA) recovery efficiency was 30%.</p><p>We estimated the error rate of the PCR and sequencing pipeline by amplifying and sequencing a plasmid clone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> compares the SNP frequencies observed in a clone to those observed in a patient sample. After quality filtering, PCR and sequencing errors never exceeded 0.3% of reads covering a particular position. To detect and control for variation in PCR efficiency among fragments and skewed amplification of different variants, we compared frequencies of variants in overlaps between the six amplicons. A SNP in the overlap is amplified and sequenced twice independently and the concordance of the two measurements of variant frequencies was used to estimate the fragment specific depth, which is limited both by template input and PCR efficiency, see Materials and methods. Frequency estimates were often reproducible to within a few percent. Sometimes, however, variant recovery was poor (mostly in fragment 5) and frequency estimates less accurate. Those fragments are flagged on the website and can be excluded from analyses requiring large depth.</p><p>We minimized PCR recombination by reducing the number of PCR cycles and optimizing the reaction protocol (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Giallonardo et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mild et al. (2011)</xref>). Control experiments using mixtures of two cultured virus populations showed that less than 10% of reads had experienced RT-PCR recombination.</p><p>Taken together, our control experiments show that depending on the sample and fragment, we could estimate frequencies of SNPs down to 1% accuracy (corresponding to several hundred effective templates). In some cases, however, the template number was low or template recovery poor such that only presence or absence of a variant could be called. Furthermore, SNPs remained linked through cDNA synthesis, PCR and sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Website</title><p>Deep sequencing data sets like the one presented here require substantial filtering, mapping, and processing before they can be used to address specific biological questions. Hence depositing the raw data (while important) is of limited use for follow-up analyses. To facilitate reuse of our data, we developed a web application to explore the data set interactively and visualize the patterns of HIV-1 evolution in the study patients. In addition, the website provides easy access to processed data. These include phylogenetic trees, viral loads and CD4+ T cell counts, consensus sequences, major and minor haplotypes in different regions of the genome, frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms, and clean sequencing reads. The application allows browsing the data either by patient or by genomic region and provides composite interactive plots to explore how the virus population has changed over time.

Our first sample is estimated to be between 1 and 7 months into infection and a few mutations (likely CTL escape mutations) had probably spread through the viral population by that time. Thus, the initial consensus sequence probably will differ slightly from the true founder virus. The number of differences, however, will be small compared to the sequence divergence in the 5 or more years of follow-up such that this initial consensus sequence is a useful approximation of the founder virus(es).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows an example of the dynamics of frequencies of SNP relative to the founder sequence over time, where each dot (top) or line (bottom) represents the frequency of a nucleotide different from the founder sequence.

We classified nucleotide positions in the genome into four categories ranging from highly conserved positions to less conserved positions within group M (Q1–Q4) using the same alignment as above. Next we asked what fraction of sites within these categories show intrapatient variation at a level of at least 1%. For the least conserved positions, this fraction increased steadily to about 20% after 8 years, while less than 1% of the most conserved sites shows variation above the 1% level. This latter fraction rapidly saturates and does not increase over time. Since variant amplification, sequencing and variant calling does not use any information on cross-sectional conservations, the absence of variation above 1% at conserved sites is further evidence that our amplification and sequencing pipeline does not generate spurious variation. Other thresholds yield similar results.</p><p>Taken together, the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that variation is not limited by the mutational input, but that HIV-1 populations accumulate diversity wherever mutations do not severely compromise virus replication. At the single nucleotide level, the spectrum of mutational possibilities is explored reproducibly and the level of within-host diversity is predicted by time since infection and cross-sectional diversity. Conserved positions are typically monomorphic even in deeply sequenced samples with high RNA template input.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The majority of nonsynonymous substitutions are positively selected</title><p>In addition to the reproducible patterns of minor diversity, virus evolution is characterized by adaptations that are specific to the host.

Such mutations tend to be nonsynonymous, i.e., change the viral proteins, while evolution at synonymous sites is expected to be conservative.

Diversity at nonsynonymous sites (solid lines) saturates after about 2–4 years, suggesting that nonsynonymous SNPs either stay at low frequency because they are deleterious or rapidly increase in frequency and fix without contributing much to diversity. Synonymous diversity increases steadily in the 5’ part of the genome (structural and enzymes), while it saturates in the 3’ half of the genome after a few years – the exact opposite of nonsynonymous divergence.</p><p>Indeed, we observe a strong anti-correlation between synonymous diversity and nonsynonymous divergence, which is further quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. This suggests that frequent non-synonymous substitutions limit synonymous diversity because they drive linked synonymous mutations to fixation or to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Maynard Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>). We will quantify linkage and recombination below, but the differences in diversity accumulation already suggest that linkage is restricted to short distances.</p><p>The contrasting behavior of synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs is also seen in the SNP frequency spectrum – the histogram of SNP abundance – shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>. While the spectra agree for frequencies below 20%, synonymous mutations are strongly underrepresented at higher frequencies (Fisher’s exact test at frequency 0.5, p-value &lt;10<sup>-10</sup>). This corroborates the interpretation that, due to substantial recombination, sweeping nonsynonymous mutations only occasionally ‘drag’ adjacent synonymous mutations to fixation. Synonymous mutations rarely rise in frequency because of their own effect on fitness, since they usually have small or deleterious phenotypic effects and do not contribute directly in immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zanini and Neher, 2013</xref>). The about five-fold excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous SNPs at high frequencies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) shows that the majority of common nonsynonymous mutations spread due to positive selection.</p><p>Next, we sought to quantify what fraction of nonsynonymous divergence is driven by escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Four-digit HLA types were determined for all patients and a set of putatively targeted HIV-1 epitopes were determined using the epitope binding prediction tool MHCi (tools.immuneepitope.org/mhci). We then asked whether we observed more nonsynonymous substitutions in epitopes predicted to be targeted than expected by chance (excluding the variable loops of gp120 and the external part of gp41, see Materials and methods). We found a significant enrichment by a factor 1.9 in the putatively targeted region (p-value &lt;3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), corresponding to 5.5 excess nonsynonymous substitutions, whereby the total number of nonsynonymous substitutions per patient is on average 43 (median, quartiles 36–64). The set of predicted epitopes will contain false positives and lack true epitopes, hence the actual number of CTL driven substitutions could be higher as for example suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al.

Similar results are found when comparing with the subtype consensus of each patient virus (24 ± 2.5%). Reversions are between 4 and 5 times more frequent than expected in the absence of a reversion bias (7.8 and 4.5%, respectively). These findings agree with results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al.

To control for conservation, we carried out the same analysis after stratifying sites by overall level of conservation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows the result of this analysis, focusing on samples after 5–6 years for the sake of clarity. We find that the rate of reversion is highest at the most conserved sites. Almost 50% of all non-consensus positions at highly conserved sites had reverted to consensus after about 5 years – an almost 1000-fold excess. Even at the least conserved sites, divergence towards group M consensus exceeded divergence away from group M consensus by a factor of 3. These results suggest that the global HIV-1 group M consensus sequence represents an ‘optimal’ HIV-1 sequence, which acts as an attractor for the evolutionary dynamics within hosts.

Our reasoning proceeds as follows. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> indicates that diversity accumulates over a time frame of 2–4 years, i.e., about 1000 days. Recombination at a rate of 10<sup>−5</sup>/<italic>bp</italic>/<italic>day</italic> hits a genome on average every 100 bps in 1000 days. Mutations further apart than 100 bps are hence often separated by recombination and retain little linkage consistent with the observed decay length in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The longer linkage in fragment 5 (env) might have several reasons that extend beyond our simple argument: (i) homologous recombination might be suppressed in the most variable regions, (ii) the accuracy of SNP frequency estimates is lower in F5 due to poorer amplification, and (iii) the rapid evolution of env due frequent substitutions and sweeps gives less time to break up linkage. In particular, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, frequent and strong selective sweeps affect synonymous diversity in physical proximity along the genome, confirming the presence of linkage at short distances.</p><p>For phylogenetic analysis, we can extract haplotypes from the sequencing reads up to 500 bp in length. Only in the more diverse regions are 500 bp sufficient for well-resolved phylogenies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we find that linkage does not extend beyond 100–200 bp. Hence the read length is not a limiting factor. Only during rapid population shifts such as drug resistance evolution, long read technologies such as PacBio would be necessary to capture the evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nijhuis et al., 1998</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11282.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic trees of minor genetic variants.</title><p>In rapidly evolving genomic regions, trees that include minor genetic variants (haplotypes) approximate the true phylogeny.

We find that, during the infection, HIV-1 explores the sequence space surrounding the founder virus systematically; similar mutational patterns are observed within different, unrelated patients. Linkage between mutations is limited to approximately 100 bp, so the virus population can accumulate substitutions independently in different regions of the genome as suggested by theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mostowy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rouzine and Coffin, 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, local dynamics of SNPs is often dominated by hitch-hiking between neighboring mutations, resulting in an anticorrelation between nonsynonymous divergence and synonymous diversity. A large fraction of all substitutions are reversions towards the global HIV-1 consensus sequence, and these reversions steadily accumulate throughout infection.</p><p>The evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 populations is the result of stochastic forces like mutation and frequent bottlenecks, deterministic fixation of favorable mutations, and recombination. The relative importance of these forces remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frost et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kouyos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maldarelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pennings et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rouzine and Coffin, 1999</xref>). Our observation that intrapatient diversity recapitulates diversity seen across HIV-1 group M and the strong tendency to revert towards consensus suggest that, in chronic infection, selection determines diversity. The reproducible exploration of sequence space can coexist with frequent adaptation only in frequently recombining large populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neher et al., 2013</xref>). We observe that mutations further apart than 100 bp are effectively shuffled by recombination in most parts of genome, consistent with previous estimates of the HIV-1 recombination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batorsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Neher and Leitner, 2010</xref>). Linkage and stochastic effects become stronger with increasing frequency of strength of selection, consistent with lower synonymous diversity and more LD in env.</p><p>While rapid CTL escape at 5–10 sites over the first 2 years of infection has been documented in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goonetilleke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) and population level associations between specific HLA types and escape variants suggest widespread CTL escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawashima et al., 2009</xref>), the effect of escape and reversion on long-term evolutionary trends is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>). We find a strong tendency for viral populations to revert towards the global HIV-1 consensus. At sites where the founder sequence differs from the subtype consensus, substitutions are almost five-fold overrepresented: Instead of ≈5% reversions expected based on the fraction of sequence at which the founder virus differs from consensus of the HIV-1 subtype, almost 25% of substitutions are reversions, in agreement with earlier reports on reversion of CTL escapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2007</xref>). This tendency to revert increases with the level of conservation of the site, suggesting a quantitative relationship between fitness cost and conservation. While reversion is particularly prevalent in acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2007</xref>), we show that reversion is not limited to early infection but happens throughout chronic infection.</p><p>The bias towards reversion results in a two- to three-fold reduction of the long-term evolutionary rate of HIV, a trend that is reinforced by selection during transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sagar et al., 2009</xref>). Inter-individual evolutionary rates of HIV-1 are two to six times lower than intra-individual rates, and a number of possible mechanisms have been suggested to explain this discrepancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012</xref>). Our results strongly indicate that most of this mismatch can be explained by steady reversion during infection; other factors such as retrieval of ‘stored’ latent variants or stage-specific selection might also contribute to the rate mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Immonen and Leitner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The high rate of reversion has implications for phylogenetic dating. Given the five-fold excess of reverting minor variation, reversion would balance divergence once the typical distance from the consensus sequence equals 17%, corresponding to a nucleotide diversity of about 30%; this is remarkably close to the actual divergence between HIV-1 groups M, N and O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2015</xref>). On longer distances, this simple argument will have to be modified due to compensatory mutations resulting in gradual shift of the preferred state at some positions; nonetheless, it indicates a dramatic slowing down of divergence at a scale of the HIV-1-SIVcpz divergence. This apparent deceleration of evolution could explain the contradictory findings of attempts to date the age of HIV-1 and SIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Worobey et al., 2010</xref>). The strong and lasting preference for specific nucleotides needs to be accounted for in phylogenetic analysis, as has recently been shown using experimentally determined fitness landscapes of influenza virus proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our observations are consistent with results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashenberg et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doud et al. (2015),</xref> who showed that amino acid preferences are mostly conserved between related influenza strains. Similarly, divergence between HIV-1 subtypes is small enough that epistatic interactions have not yet changed the majority of the preferred states. With increasing evolutionary distance between strains, the molecular context and preferred amino acid at a particular position is more and more likely to differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pollock et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, a subset of amino acids preferences are conserved almost universally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Risso et al., 2015</xref>) and enable sequence based homology search.</p><p>The concordance between intrahost variation and patterns of conservation across HIV-1 group M hints at universal fitness costs of mutations. Recently, cross-sectional conservation has been used as a proxy for fitness costs in models of HIV-1 fitness landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahirel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferguson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mann et al., 2014</xref>). Since reproducible intrapatient diversity likely reflects fitness costs of mutations in vivo, our results provide a direct justification for this approach. However, nine patients are insufficient to extend this analysis to fitness interactions between mutations.</p><p>One limitation of this study was the availability of samples from patients with sufficiently long follow-up without therapy after a well-defined time of infection. The majority of patients were MSM infected with subtype B virus. Thus, we cannot exclude that the aspects of HIV-1 evolution that we have investigated may differ between transmission routes or HIV-1 subtypes. While substitution and recombination errors of our optimized protocol for HIV-1 RNA extraction and an RT-PCR are low, the other main limitation was that the number of available template molecules was small in some samples (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>). In principle, the Primer ID method, which labels and resequences each individual template, allows quantification of templates and almost complete elimination of experimental substitution and recombination errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jabara et al., 2011</xref>). However, we are not aware of a Primer ID protocol for genome-wide sequencing, which was essential to our study.</p><p>The analysis and means of data sharing of next-generation sequencing data from viral populations is still in its infancy. Raw reads require substantial post-processing before the data can be used to answer biological questions and technology is changing rapidly such that no standardized pipelines exist. To facilitate the exploration and further analysis of our data, we have developed a web server that allows to browse characteristics of individual patients, e.g., graph the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphism through time, and download different aspects of the data in convenient format. It is, for example, possible to select an arbitrary region of the genome with length &lt;500 bp, such as the frequently investigated V3 region, and extract an alignment of haplotypes covering this region along with their frequency from all time points belonging to one patient. We hope that the convenient access to processed data will facilitate follow-up studies on other aspects of viral evolution.</p><p>HIV-1 and other microbial populations evolve in a constant struggle between adaptation to a changing environment and maintenance of functionality. Large mutation rates and population sizes generate standing genetic diversity that is limited by the fitness costs rather than mutation rates. Hence the limiting factor for adaptation is not generating the useful mutations, but combining multiple mutations necessary to survive – e.g. escape mutations and reversions – and pruning deleterious mutations. In HIV-1, this process is facilitated by frequent recombination. We expect that the systematic exploration of sequence space, the reproducible patterns of minor variation, and frequent reversion will be characteristic of other RNA viruses. Properties of linkage between mutation will differ since mechanisms of recombination are diverse. But even though selective forces, recombination, and time scales will vary among different microbial populations, theoretical models of rapid adaptation population have shown that many features of the evolutionary dynamics are independent of the specific system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neher, 2013</xref>). Intrapatient evolution of HIV-1 is a unique opportunity to study this evolutionary dynamics directly in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient selection and samples</title><p>The inclusion criteria for the study patients were: a) a relatively well-defined time of infection based on a negative HIV antibody test less than 2 years before a first positive test or a laboratory documented primary HIV infection; b) no antiretroviral therapy (ART) for a minimum of approximately 5 years following diagnosis; and c) availability of biobank plasma samples covering this time period.

We favored this pipeline over existing programs because HIV-1 is a diverse species and both coverage and genetic diversity typically fluctuate by many orders of magnitude across the genome. The pipeline works as follows: (i) reads were mapped onto the HIV-1 reference HxB2, using the probabilistic mapper Stampy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lunter and Goodson, 2011</xref>); (ii) mapped reads were classified into one of the six overlapping fragments used for RT-PCR (ambiguous and chimeric reads were discarded), and trimmed for PHRED quality above or equal 30 except for one isolated position per read; RT-PCR primers were also trimmed at this step; (iii) a consensus sequence was computed for each fragment in each sample from a subset of the reads, using a chain of overlapping local multiple sequence alignments (each covering around 150 bp); (iv) the reads were re-mapped, this time against their own consensus; (vii) genetic distance from the consensus were computed, and reads with a distance higher than a sample- and fragment-specific threshold were discarded. Each threshold, calculated to exclude even traces of cross-contamination that might have happened during RNA extraction, PCR amplification, or library preparation, was established by plotting the distribution of Hamming distances of reads from the sample consensus, and excluding reads that are further away than the tail of the main peak. Contaminations appeared as a second peak at higher distances, recombinants as a fat tail: both were excluded. Reads were also trimmed for mapping errors at the edges (small indels); (viii) filtered reads were mapped a third time against a patient-specific reference that was as similar as possible to the consensus sequence from the earliest time point; (ix) reads were re-filtered and checked again for cross-contamination.

Templates numbers were estimated based on the assumption of Poisson sampling. Thus, for each sample, this dilution series provides an estimate of the number of templates that make it into the sequencing library. The results from the limiting dilution experiments correlated well (rank correlation p = 0.7) with routine plasma HIV-1 RNA level measurements that had been performed at time of sampling, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>. These comparisons showed that the median template cDN recovery efficiency was 30% (quartiles 17–60%), which should be regarded as satisfactory since the amplicons were relatively long and the samples had been stored for up to 24 years and sometimes also freeze-thawed prior to this study.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11282.025</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Template quantification and accuracy of SNP frequency estimates.</title><p>The left panel shows actual template numbers as experimentally determined by end point dilution (<italic>y</italic>-axis) vs. the maximum theoretical template input as estimated based on plasma virus levels.

The center panel show the correlation of fragment-specific effective template numbers estimated from the concordance of SNPs in fragment overlaps. Again, the correlation is generally good, but fragment F5 often has estimates lower than those from the dilution series consistent with problems faced in amplification of this fragment.

The right panel plots SNP frequencies in overlaps measured in the leading fragment against the trailing fragment. Deviations from the diagonal are due PCR bias and random sampling from limited template molecules.

Furthermore, the agreement of SNP frequencies in the overlaps indicate that the primers were well-designed and did not induce significant primer-related PCR amplification biases. These fragment-specific estimates are only available for samples and fragments with sufficient diversity in the overlap regions and are often lacking for early samples and fragment F6. The latter is due to the very conserved overlap with fragment F5.</p><p>Taken together, these controls show that, depending on the sample and fragment, we can estimate frequencies of SNPs down to 1% accuracy (corresponding to several thousand effective templates). In some cases, however, the template number was low or recovery poor such that no more than presence absence of a variant could be called. All available fragment specific estimates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. In addition to lack of concordance of SNP frequencies in overlaps, problematic fragments lack diversity or have a granular distribution of SNP frequencies such that they can be flagged and removed from specific analysis. The fact that PCR efficiency can vary within one sample is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> that compares SNP frequencies estimated in samples 4 and 5 of patient 1 that are only 30 days apart: While SNP frequencies agree to within expectation for five out of six fragments; fragment F5 shows strong deviations linked to suboptimal PCR efficiency. However, even in problematic samples, our amplification and sequencing approach does not generate spurious variation, as shown by the absence of diversity in early samples or conserved sites (see below).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro recombination and linkage</title><p>The paired-end reads obtained correspond to inserts of up to 700bp in length and therefore provide information on linkage of mutations up to that distance. However, cDNA synthesis and PCR have both the potential to generate in vitro recombination, and true biological linkage is preserved only if the frequency of in vitro recombination is low. To estimate the in vitro recombination in our experimental setup, virions from two subtype B HIV isolates, LAI III and 38304 (the latter obtained from a Swedish HIV-1 patient infected in Brazil), were mixed in equal concentrations. Aliquots of this mix (approximately 1250 RNA molecules per PCR fragment) were amplified with the six overlapping one-step RT-PCRs as described above in both single and nested PCR mode and then sequenced.</p><p>PCR recombination is known to occur predominantly at high amplicon concentrations due to heteroduplex formation of incompletely extended molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Giallonardo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mild et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, we observe no PCR recombination within the first PCR (which starting at low template input does not saturate), while we observe substantial PCR recombination during a second nested PCR. Since our library preparation protocol requires very low input DNA, we do not need nested PCR, avoiding this source of PCR recombination. The fact that PCR recombination occurs during a second PCR shows that the two viruses used for this control (both subtype B) are similar enough that divergence does not interfere with heteroduplex formation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> includes the linkage disequilibrium observed in the control experiment as a function of distance, showing that linkage is high and not lost with distance during the first PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis</title><p>Python scripts that generate each figure shown in the manuscript are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/neherlab/HIVEVO_figures">github.com/neherlab/HIVEVO_figures</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, you use deep sequencing to track the genotypic evolution of HIV in individuals over multiple years. You observe patterns in the virus's evolution over time, and note a surprising amount of parallelism in the fate of specific mutations in the few patients you study. Although others have conducted similar studies, your study is more comprehensive than past efforts. Another major strength is that you develop a web-based visualization platform that enables both expert and non-expert users to inspect the results in detail. However, the current manuscript does not properly describe past efforts adequately, and this is the primary criticism that will need to be addressed before we can justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>For example, in the Introduction, you may want to discuss the work described in the following references as part of the background and then make clear what is novel about your studies: Bernardin J Virol 2005; Bar KJ Plos Path 2012; Brockman J Virol 2010; Schneidewind A JVirol 2010. Also, Salazer-Gonzalez 2009, did not examine T cell escape in acute HIV infection; escape was examined Goonetilleke et al. 2009 (published in the same issue of JEM as Salazar-Gonalez) followed by Liu et al. JCI 2013. Key papers from the lab of P Borrow should also be recognized. Iyer S Plos One 2015 (lab of J Mullins) is a recent cross-sectional study in HIV-1 using deep sequencing techniques that is also relevant. Finally, the point made in the Discussion about how your results provide direct justification for past efforts to extract universal fitness landscapes of HIV from cross-sectional data might be considered for inclusion in the introduction as well (e.g., Dahirel, PNAS (2011); Fergusson, Immunity (2013); Mann PLOS CB (2014)).</p><p>In addition, it is important that you address the following comments in order to improve the paper:</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> that the major limitation for low-frequency SNPs is low template abundance, rather than sequencing errors. SNP frequencies are not expected to be accurate below 1/N where N is the number of template molecules, and N appears to be about 10 to 50. This would suggest that the SNP frequencies are not very accurate below about 2-10%. This idea seems to be consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, which show a very strong correlation between frequencies called from different fragments at moderate frequencies, but little correlation below about 1-5%. Although you do discuss this point to some degree, we think this point should be noted more emphatically. There is a great deal of interest in more accurate techniques for sequencing viruses, but as the results here make clear, there isn't really much benefit in improving sequencing accuracy if the accuracy is already &gt; 1/N.</p><p>2) A major finding of the paper is the evidence for parallel evolution in the sense of similar positions accumulating similar divergence among patients, and of strong tendency of reversion to the same consensus identities in all strains. However, it is often unclear if this trend is occurring primarily on the protein level, primarily on the nucleotide level, or both. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> it is unclear if the trends are for nucleotide or amino-acid mutations – this should be clarified, and ideally results for both nucleotides and amino acids could be shown. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> might also benefit from showing similar data for both nucleotides and amino acids. In the Discussion you note, &quot;The strong and lasting preference for specific nucleotides needs to be accounted for…&quot;. In fact, the cited reference discusses strong and lasting preferences for specific amino acids, not specific nucleotides.</p><p>3) How does the consistency of evolution between patients correlate with distance between those patients' founder viruses? A central claim in this study is that: &quot;At a single nucleotide level, the spectrum of mutational possibilities is explored reproducibly.&quot; The evidence supporting this claim includes the correlation between the site-specific entropy of patient samples and natural sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, something that is unclear from this comparison is whether variation is increasing at the same or different sites for different samples within this study. Can you make similar comparisons to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> across samples within the study? Are the correlations stronger between samples from individuals infected with genetically similar viruses?</p><p>4) More discussion is needed on the clinical characteristics of patients (viral load and CD4 count over time). Of note, participants had to be ARV naïve for at least 5 years, and thus some had a low viral load. How might factors leading to low viral load affect evolution? You note that some patients received ART during the study, and were included in an ongoing sub-study.

You observe patterns in the virus's evolution over time, and note a surprising amount of parallelism in the fate of specific mutations in the few patients you study. Although others have conducted similar studies, your study is more comprehensive than past efforts. Another major strength is that you develop a web-based visualization platform that enables both expert and non-expert users to inspect the results in detail. However, the current manuscript does not properly describe past efforts adequately, and this is the primary criticism that will need to be addressed before we can justify publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p>Thank you very much for the constructive and helpful criticism, which has helped us to connect our findings better to existing literature and articulate more clearly the novel insights that can be obtained from longitudinal whole genome deep sequencing. While evolution during early infection or in specific regions of the HIV-1 genome have been extensively studied, we present for the first time a deep whole genome data set that allows quantification of the evolutionary dynamics throughout infection.</p><p><italic>For example, in the Introduction, you may want to discuss the work described in the following references as part of the background and then make clear what is novel about your studies: Bernardin J Virol 2005; Bar KJ Plos Path 2012; Brockman J Virol 2010; Schneidewind A JVirol 2010.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded the part of the Introduction discussing prior studies of HIV evolution. Specifically, we have included the suggested references when discussion early CTL escapes, Nab escapes, fitness costs, and stability of compensated transmitted variants. All these references focus on patterns of evolution during the first few month after infection, while we study genome wide patterns of evolution from early to chronic infection.</p><p><italic>Also, Salazer-Gonzalez 2009, did not examine T cell escape in acute HIV infection; escape was examined Goonetilleke et al. 2009 (published in the same issue of JEM as Salazar-Gonalez) followed by Liu et al. JCI 2013.</italic> </p><p>Our apologies, we mixed up these back-to-back papers. We now cite Goonetilleke et al. 2009 and Liu et al. 2013 when discussing early escape. We included the reference to Salazar-Gonzales et al. 2009 when discussing founder sequences.</p><p><italic>Key papers from the lab of P Borrow should also be recognized. Iyer S Plos One 2015 (lab of J Mullins) is a recent cross-sectional study in HIV-1 using deep sequencing techniques that is also relevant. Finally, the point made in the Discussion about how your results provide direct justification for past efforts to extract universal fitness landscapes of HIV from cross-sectional data might be considered for inclusion in the introduction as well (e.g., Dahirel, PNAS (2011); Fergusson, Immunity (2013); Mann PLOS CB (2014)).</italic> </p><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We included a reference to work by the lab of P Borrow (Jones et al., 2004) when discussing previous work on CTL escapes in early infection. We further included a reference to Iyer et al. when discussing the necessity of quantifying templates and the limitations of next generation sequencing of diverse viral populations. We have added a brief discussion about the link between reversion, reproducible intrapatient diversity and inference of fitness landscapes from cross-sectional data. We also included the additional references as suggested.</p><p><italic>In addition, it is important that you address the following comments in order to improve the paper:</italic> </p><p><italic>Specific comments: 1) It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> that the major limitation for low-frequency SNPs is low template abundance, rather than sequencing errors. SNP frequencies are not expected to be accurate below 1/N where N is the number of template molecules, and N appears to be about 10 to 50. This would suggest that the SNP frequencies are not very accurate below about 2-10%. This idea seems to be consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, which show a very strong correlation between frequencies called from different fragments at moderate frequencies, but little correlation below about 1-5%. Although you do discuss this point to some degree, we think this point should be noted more emphatically. There is a great deal of interest in more accurate techniques for sequencing viruses, but as the results here make clear, there isn't really much benefit in improving sequencing accuracy if the accuracy is already &gt; 1/N.</italic> </p><p>The number of input templates varies greatly from sample to sample. We now discuss the distribution of template input at greater length. The median template input per fragment is 120 with an interquartile range of 50-500. In most cases we have therefore more templates than indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and we can give meaningful SNP frequencies down to 1%. In some cases, template input limits accuracy more drastically.</p><p>The deviations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> were largely due to fragment 5. We included an additional supplementary figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, that shows the correlation of SNP frequencies for individuals fragment overlaps. In overlaps that don't include fragment 5, SNP frequencies correlate well down to a few percent.</p><p><italic>2) A major finding of the paper is the evidence for parallel evolution in the sense of similar positions accumulating similar divergence among patients, and of strong tendency of reversion to the same consensus identities in all strains. However, it is often unclear if this trend is occurring primarily on the protein level, primarily on the nucleotide level, or both. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> it is unclear if the trends are for nucleotide or amino-acid mutations – this should be clarified, and ideally results for both nucleotides and amino acids could be shown. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> might also benefit from showing similar data for both nucleotides and amino acids. In the Discussion you note, &quot;The strong and lasting preference for specific nucleotides needs to be accounted for…&quot;. In fact, the cited reference discusses strong and lasting preferences for specific amino acids, not specific nucleotides.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this analysis, which we also find to be an interesting point. We now provide <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> which show the results of the same analyses as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and 6 but at the amino acid level. Overall, we find that divergence along the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), correlation with cross-sectional diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and patterns of reversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) all show similar dynamics at the amino acid and nucleotide levels. By comparing panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, it is evident that the overall scale of divergence is of course different for amino acids, but the relative dynamics at sites where the founder agrees or disagrees with cross-sectional consensus are the same as for nucleotides.</p><p><italic>3) How does the consistency of evolution between patients correlate with distance between those patients' founder viruses? A central claim in this study is that: &quot;At a single nucleotide level, the spectrum of mutational possibilities is explored reproducibly.&quot; The evidence supporting this claim includes the correlation between the site-specific entropy of patient samples and natural sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, something that is unclear from this comparison is whether variation is increasing at the same or different sites for different samples within this study. Can you make similar comparisons to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> across samples within the study? Are the correlations stronger between samples from individuals infected with genetically similar viruses?</italic> </p><p>We added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> which shows that the correlation in nucleotide variation between between pairs of patients as a function of the genetic distance between the founder viruses of the patient pair. The genetic distance between founder viruses does not seem to have a big impact, but this conclusion is based essentially on two non-subtype B patients only, p1 and p6. More data is necessary for a quantitative study of the dependence of the similarity of intrapatient diversity on genetic distance.</p><p><italic>4) More discussion is needed on the clinical characteristics of patients (viral load and CD4 count over time). Of note, participants had to be ARV naïve for at least 5 years, and thus some had a low viral load. How might factors leading to low viral load affect evolution? You note that some patients received ART during the study, and were included in an ongoing sub-study. However, it is not clear if the time points after ART initiation were included in the present study. If they were included, are there any interesting differences in evolutionary patterns between patients that received ART and patients that did not?</italic> </p><p>We have added more information about the samples, viral load, and CD4 count in the Results section. We have also included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows viral load and CD4 counts over time. Previously these data were only shown on the website. It is true that the fact that patients were selected to have been treatment-naive for at least 5 years may have selected against rapid progressors. However, most patients were diagnosed in the 1990s, i.e. before the adoption of early start of ART. Thus, the last study CD4 count (before start of therapy) was relatively low for all patients; 340, 369, 140, 228, 287, 378, 158, 200, 251 for patients 1-3, 5-6 and 8-11, respectively. Information about this has been added to the Results section. We cannot exclude that rapid progressors might have somewhat different rate and pattern of HIV evolution.</p><p>All samples in this study were obtained before any start of ART. To avoid misunderstanding we have removed the mentioning of the substudy, which is not relevant to this manuscript (beginning of Results).</p><p><italic>5) Five of nine subjects in the cohort were identified in either Fiebig V or VI. This staging precludes confident determination of the transmitted/founder viruses in these subjects and therefore the statement that “initial consensus sequence approximates the sequence of the founder virus(es)” is not supported. You may want to revise the terminology to reflect that, in these subjects, you deduced a consensus sequence of an early virus sequence.</italic></p><p><italic>Regarding the Fiebig staging and virus loads: These data are very confusingly described and presented.

Going through the supplementary file, the VL of the first sample available for sequencing is clearly outside the acute window for several of the patients described as detected in Fiebig II-IV. As above, how can you justify describing the first sequence as the founder? As shown by multiple groups, significant immune selection and recombination occurs within the first months of HIV infection.</italic></p><p>It is true that our earliest sample is between one and seven month after infection and some mutations have likely spread through the population by that time. Hence we can only approximate, rather than exactly identify the founder sequence. However, the difference between the true founder and our approximation will be small compared to the evolution in the many years of follow-up after the first sample. All observation that we make in the manuscript should become even stronger if we knew the exact founder sequence. We added a discussion of the approximate nature of the inferred founder sequence to the manuscript in the subsection “Consistent evolution across the entire genome”.</p><p>We agree that the presentation of the Fiebig staging, virus loads and estimation of date of infection (EDI) was unclear. This includes the dates for sampling for the different tests (VL, Fiebig staging, BED and first sequence) which sometimes differed. For this reason we provide a new supplement table with comprehensive data, dates and comments, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Please also note that the scheme for estimating date of infection has been revised to first consider information on date for a laboratory confirmed primary HIV infection. We have also run additional Western blots and BED tests. For these reasons the EDIs have changed for some patients. All analyses and graphs have been redone accordingly, but this has in no way changed the main results and conclusions.</p><p><italic>6) You provide a convincing demonstration of reversal to global consensus and provide a discussion of the how this observation can be reconciled with the observed intra-patient and global HIV diversity. It might help the reader to have the discussion of the balance of divergence and reversal (presently in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion) sooner, e.g. in the subsection &quot;Extensive reversion toward consensus&quot;.

How do your results bear on this issue?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting discussion and our results certainly suggest largely conserved amino acid preferences at the level of divergence observed between HIV-1 subtypes. This does not exclude that the preference at some sites have changed, but the majority is conserved. We have added a discussion of this issue.</p><p><italic>7) In the tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, near the yellow for patient 9 there is a black line that doesn't connect to any colored lines in the tree.

Can the authors comment? Are these subjects in any way linked?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the overrepresentation of A*32 is surprising. Dr Bratt has carefully checked if there could exist some relatedness or similar ethnic background of patients 8-11, but no such factors could be identified. Patients 4 and 7, who were sampled but excluded from the current analyses because of poor PCR performance or suspected superinfection, did not have the A*32 allele. Some reports (Geczy, Hum Immunol 2000;61:172-6; Lazaryan, Hum Immunol 2011;72:312-318) have indicated that A*32 is associated with long-term survival. Our patients had relatively slow disease progression and we cannot exclude that our inclusion criteria resulted in overrepresentation of certain HLA types among our patients. We have refrained from discussing this in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
