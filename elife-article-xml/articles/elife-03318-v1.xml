the difficulty to assemble full genomes of individual species. Consequently, the chromosome organization of microorganisms has been investigated in a few model species, but the extent to which the features described can be generalized to other taxa remains unknown. Using controlled mixes of bacterial and yeast species, we developed meta3C, a metagenomic chromosome conformation capture approach that allows characterizing individual genomes and their average organization within a mix of organisms. Not only can meta3C be applied to species already sequenced, but a single meta3C library can be used for assembling, scaffolding and characterizing the tridimensional organization of unknown genomes. By applying meta3C to a semi-complex environmental sample, we confirmed its promising potential. Overall, this first meta3C study highlights the remarkable diversity of microorganisms chromosome organization, while providing an elegant and integrated approach to metagenomic analysis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03318.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03318.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microbial communities play vital roles in the environment and sustain animal and plant life. Marine microbes are part of the ocean's food chain; soil microbes support the turnover of major nutrients and facilitate plant growth; and the microbial communities residing in the human gut support digestion and the immune system, among other roles. These communities are very complex systems, often containing 1000s of different species engaged in co-dependent relationships, and are therefore very difficult to study.</p><p>The entire DNA sequence of an organism constitutes its genome, and much of this genetic information is stored in large structures called chromosomes. Examining the genome of a species can provide important clues about its lifestyle and how it evolved. To do this, DNA is extracted from cells and is then usually cut into smaller fragments, amplified, and sequenced. The small stretches of sequence obtained, called reads, are finally assembled, yielding ideally the complete genome of the organism under study.</p><p>Metagenomics attempts to interpret the combined genome of all the different species in a microbial community and has been instrumental in deciphering how the different species interact with each other. Metagenomics involves sequencing stretches of the community's DNA and matching these pieces to individual species to ultimately assemble whole genomes. While this may be a relatively straightforward task for communities that contain only a handful of members, the metagenomes derived from complex microbial communities are huge, fragmented, and incomplete. This often makes it very difficult or even nearly impossible to match the inferred DNA stretches to individual species.</p><p>A method called chromosome conformation capture (or ‘3C’ for short) can reveal the physical contacts between different regions of a chromosome and between the different chromosomes of a cell. How often each of these chromosomal contacts occurs provides a kind of physical signature to each genome and each individual chromosome within it.</p><p>Marbouty et al. took advantage of these interactions to develop a technique that combines metagenomics and chromosome conformation capture—called meta3C—that can analyze the DNA of many different species mixed together. Testing meta3C on artificial mixtures of a few species of yeast or bacteria showed that meta3C can separate the genomes of the different species without any prior knowledge of the composition of the mix. In a single experiment, meta3C can identify individual chromosomes, match each of them to its species of origin, and reveal the three-dimensional structure of each genome in the mix. Further tests showed that meta3C can also interpret more complex communities where the number and types of the species present are not known.</p><p>Meta3C holds great promise for understanding how microbial communities work and how the genomes of the species within a community are organized. However, further developments of the technique will be required to investigate communities as diverse as those present in most natural environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03318.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03318.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Hi-C</kwd><kwd>meta3C</kwd><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>plasmid F</kwd><kwd>meta Hi-C</kwd><kwd>genome assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>260822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koszul</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20100600373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marbouty</surname><given-names>Martial</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A technique called meta3C provides an elegant and integrated approach to metagenomic analysis by allowing the de novo assembly, scaffolding and 3D characterization of unknown genomes from a complex mix of species</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial species have for a long time been studied individually, leading to the development of applications in fields as diverse as agronomy, environment, or medicine. Sequencing and analyzing the genetic material of microbial communities directly collected from various natural environments such as skin, gut, soil, and water have dramatically improved our knowledge and understanding of their diversity and interrelations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handelsman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guermazi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">The Human Microbiome Jumpstart Reference Strains Consortium, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mackelprang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Le Chatelier et al., 2013</xref>). A number of techniques have been developed to improve the resolution and accuracy of individual genome assembly in mixed populations, for instance by separating the species prior to sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzsimons et al., 2013</xref>) or by refining the clustering and scaffolding procedures used to process sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertsen et al., 2013</xref>). However, these approaches remain generally limited by the use of complex technologies and/or by the need to construct multiple libraries. In parallel, an interesting development in the field of genome assembly has recently arisen from the realization that the physical properties of chromosomes contain information regarding their linear structure. The frequency with which two chromosomal segments come in contact, as measured in genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>), obeys to some extent the laws of polymer physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rippe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Contact frequencies can be used to identify synteny between DNA segments up to a few 100s kilobases (kb) apart, and two studies recently applied this concept to refining the human genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaplan and Dekker, 2013</xref>). Such approach therefore shows great promise as a general method for improving genome assemblies. Using chromosomal contacts data in order to generate the precise scaffold of a given genome is however a difficult task: hence, we developed GRAAL, a robust and explicit statistical method to tackle this issue at the highest resolution possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since this approach enables the identification of individual chromosomes within the same nuclei, we hypothesized that tridimensional (3D) organization holds enough specific information to distinguish as well DNA segments of chromosomes present within different organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In other words, if the interactions between chromosomes contained within a human or a fungal nucleus can be resolved, then it may be possible to resolve the chromosomes of various species mixed together. In the present work, we show that this is indeed the case: a single meta3C experiment, performed on a mix of species, allows the de novo assembly and scaffolding of the various genomes present in the mixture without prior knowledge of their genome sequences. We also show that the method allows deciphering the average 3D organization of these genomes in space, unveiling a remarkable diversity of chromosome organization in microorganisms. Therefore, meta3C paves the way to the integrated characterization and analysis of metagenomes in complex populations.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>meta3C experiment on a controlled mix of bacterial species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the principle of a meta3C experiment.

The reads were aligned on the three reference genome sequences to generate a chromosome contact map of the whole population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To construct this map, each genome was divided into bins of 30 kb, and the contact frequencies were normalized so that their sum equaled one for each bin (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cournac et al., 2012</xref>). As in a typical 3C experiment squares appeared on the diagonal of the matrix, revealing individual chromosomes: the circular chromosomes of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were recovered as separate entities, whereas the two chromosomes of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> yielded two squares exhibiting higher contact frequencies with each other than with the chromosomes of the other species—as expected since these chromosomes share the same cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The background generated by cross-species interactions was low (0.37% of the total interactions), indicating that few chimeric pairs of reads (in which one read came from the genome of one species and the other read from the genome of another species) had been generated during the construction of the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The meta3C contact matrix was subsequently converted into a 3D structure (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Animation 1</xref>). In this representation, bins are shown as beads and the distance between each pair of beads is optimized in proportion to the inverse of their measured contact frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesne et al., 2014</xref>). Using this approach, we recovered three populations of bins that corresponded to the three bacterial genomes, with the two chromosomes of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> being visualized in close vicinity to each other. The continuity and circularity of each genome was clearly apparent in the reconstructed structures.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03318-media1.gif"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.007</object-id><label>Animation 1.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction of the bacterial meta3C contact matrix.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03318.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03318.007</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>A sequence corresponding to a F plasmid (the fertility factor of <italic>E. coli</italic>) was characterized in the reads and appeared to interact with the genome of the <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 strain used in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, black arrow). The 3D data provided us with the opportunity to carefully investigate the structure and spatial positioning of this plasmid with respect to the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. We first noticed that a large (∼140 kb) region of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome exhibited a two fold increase of the read coverage, indicating a segmental duplication. This region was also enriched in contacts with the F plasmid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), prompting us to hypothesize that one of the two copy was actually carried by a F’ plasmid (i.e., a F plasmid carrying bacterial sequences). A correlation analysis of the contacts between these two regions of interest (a chromosome region encompassing the duplication and the plasmid) revealed clearly that, on the one hand, a copy of the duplication is in close contact with the plasmid (with an IS2 at one the boundaries [coord. 390,063] and an IS3 within), and that on the other hand the plasmid contacts with the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome drop sharply past the duplication boundaries, in agreement with an integration of one copy of the duplication within a F’ plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally by a Southern blot of a pulsed-field gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Having deciphered the linear structure of the F’ plasmid within this strain, we investigated its 3D organization with respect to the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The frequent contacts each copy of the duplication makes with both the chromosome and the F’ plasmid resulted in an artifactual co-localization of the plasmid with the chromosome, since the contacts within each of the copies cannot be discriminated and are all positioned along the genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>, i and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Animation 2</xref>). To alleviate this artifact, we generated a contact map were all the contacts involving the duplicated region were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>, ii and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Animation 3</xref>). In the corresponding 3D structure, the bin representing the plasmid appeared now well isolated from the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a supplementary control, we verified that removing from the genome a region of a size similar to the duplication did not impair the 3D positioning of a DNA segment of a size similar to the F’ plasmid, positioned within this deleted region (blue dot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>, iii). Interestingly, besides this duplication, two regions along the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome appeared enriched in contacts with the F’ plasmid: the replication origin (<italic>Ori</italic>) and, to a lower extent, the termination (<italic>Ter</italic>) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This indicates that the F’ plasmid is positioned preferentially in the vicinity of these regions in fast growing cells, as expected given the preferred location of the F plasmid in mid, 1/4, and 3/4 positions in the cell, which are also preferred positions for <italic>Ori</italic>/<italic>Ter</italic> regions during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gordon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niki and Hiraga, 1997</xref>). These results illustrate the high specificity of the meta3C approach, which allows the identification of genomic regions belonging to each species, and the power of using DNA physical contacts to decipher complex structures in individual genomes.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03318-media2.gif"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.008</object-id><label>Animation 2.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome with a plasmid F’ carrying a 140 kb segmental duplication.</title><p>The contacts made by the duplicated region are taken into account.

Interestingly, this diversity appeared rooted in shared principles. One structural feature shared by these bacterial genomes was the global symmetry of the replichores, that is, the two chromosomal arms between the <italic>Ori</italic> and <italic>Ter</italic>. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> this symmetry was made clearly visible, in the growth conditions used in this experiment, by the presence of a counter-diagonal in the map (running opposite to the continuous and strong signal that accounts for the contact between adjacent DNA segments; see also the correlation version of the contact map on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The 3D reconstruction of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome revealed a relatively compact domain at the <italic>Ori</italic> region that overlapped with the region of the genome containing the centromere-like <italic>parS</italic> sites, in agreement with the structural role described for the ParS/Spo0J/Smc complex in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome presented a strong <italic>Ter</italic> domain that was clearly identifiable in the contact map and exhibited fewer contacts with the rest of the genome, reflecting most likely the structuring role of the MatP/<italic>matS</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mercier et al., 2008</xref>). For <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the <italic>Ter</italic> regions of chromosomes 1 and 2 were in closer proximity than the two <italic>Ori</italic> regions, reflecting the controlled segregation mechanisms of these two unequal-sized chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Val et al., 2008</xref>). Interchromosomal contacts did not span the entire length of chromosome 1 but started between the <italic>Ori</italic> macrodomain of chromosome 2 and positions located at about one-third of chromosome 1 arms (black dotted squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In order to visualize the interplay between replication and genomic organization, we applied a color code to represent the read coverage of the genome (reflecting the average progression of the replication fork and thus the relative timing of replication) atop the genome structure of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Animation 6</xref>). Whereas the two <italic>Ter</italic> regions appeared of the same color, consistent with the fact that both chromosomes I and II achieve replication synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rasmussen et al., 2007</xref>), the <italic>Ori</italic> regions presented, as expected, different coverages: chromosome I initiates replication first whereas chromosome II starts only to replicate later. This analysis provides a glimpse on the spatial and temporal articulation of the replication program of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, which would be an interesting example of organization-dependent function. Overall, the chromosome organizations of the three bacteria analyzed (under the exponential, rich-medium growth conditions used in the experiment) appeared remarkably different but shared similar principles, such as the presence of well-defined domains. In order to see if those shared features are conserved across bacteria species, it will be interesting to use a similar high-resolution 3C approach to investigate the organization of bacterial linear chromosomes.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media6" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03318-media6.gif"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.012</object-id><label>Animation 6.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome.</title><p>The color scale now represents the read coverage along the genome, hence displaying the differential replication timing of the two chromosomes, from early (over-covered) replicated regions (in blue) to terminal regions (in red).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03318.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03318.012</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>The low amount of ‘background interaction’, that is, chimeric religation events between restriction fragments belonging to different species, in the experiment incited us to test whether the genomes of these three bacterial species could be directly assembled de novo from the meta3C data by taking advantage of the presence of ∼80% ‘regular’ paired-end reads in the library. This relatively high percentage results from the fact that, unlike the Hi-C protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>), meta3C does not involve an enrichment step for religated fragments (‘Materials and methods’). Using the assembly program IDBA-UD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peng et al., 2012</xref>), a set of 2,436 contigs was generated from the 3C read pairs (N50 = 55 kb, total length 12.5 Mb). The quality of these contigs was assessed by comparing them with published reference genomes, which showed that the assembled contigs covered respectively 96%, 98%, and 93% of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> reference genomes and that only 0.7% of the contigs (52,373 bp total) were chimeric. The meta3C reads were then realigned on the de novo contigs and the contact information was used to pool the contigs into communities sharing similar contact behavior (hence likely belonging to the same genome) using the Louvain algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>). Three communities of contigs were generated, each corresponding to a different species and covering respectively 96, 98, and 92% of the genomes of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This shows that meta3C does not only allow convenient high-throughput analysis of the 3D organization of a mix of bacterial species but also provides an efficient way to assemble de novo the genomes of these species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Meta3C unveils the conservation of chromosome organization in a mix of 11 yeast species</title><p>To see if this approach could be applied to a more complex mix of eukaryotic species, we pooled 11 yeast species and performed a meta3C experiment directly on this mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The meta3C contact matrix of the 11 reference genomes put side by side presented discrete squares on the diagonal, each corresponding to a species from the mix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 3D representation of this contact map revealed, again, a very low level of background interactions in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Animation 7</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In each of the squares, the co-localization of centromeres resulting from the Rabl configuration was clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue arrowheads; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014b</xref>). In contrast to the diversity of structures observed for the bacterial species analyzed above, the Rabl configuration appeared as the primary driver of yeast genome organization, as illustrated by the individual 3D structures of the genomes of <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> and <italic>Naumovozyma castellii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8 media9">Animation 8,9</xref>). To test the potential of using meta3C reads for assembling de novo such a complex mix of yeast genomes, we assembled them using IDBA-UD (N50 = 6,914 bp, total length 138 Mb). The breadth of coverage of the 11 genomes by the resulting contigs ranged from 89.8% (<italic>Candida albicans</italic>) to 98.3% (<italic>N. castellii</italic>), with chimeric contigs (misassemblies) representing ∼20% of the total (37 Mb). This high percentage of chimera contrasted with the very low level of misassemblies observed previously for the mix of three bacterial genomes. To monitor the influence of chimeric pairs of reads (originating from intergenomic 3D contacts) on the generation of chimeric contigs, we performed an assembly on the same library using the Velvet software that considers all reads as independents (i.e., without pairing them; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zerbino and Birney, 2008</xref>). This assembly exhibited a dramatic increase (73%, 69 Mb) in chimeric contigs, demonstrating that these misassemblies were not caused by intergenomic 3C paired-end reads but rather by the frequent occurrence of identical or near-identical genome regions (such as transposable elements) in those eukaryotic genomes. The presence of chimeric contigs in the IDBA_UD assembly did not impede the clustering of the most contigs based on their contact frequencies as determined using the Louvain algorithm. The clustering procedure resulted in 13 sub-groups: one for each of the 11 yeast species, one corresponding to an <italic>E. coli</italic> contaminant, and one comprising various misassembled fragments of mitochondrial genomes. In total, only 1% of the assembly (2% of the contigs) could not be attributed to a given species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A de novo assembly followed by scaffolding using our dedicated program GRAAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014a</xref>) was then applied to the pool of contigs identified as belonging to the genome of <italic>N. castellii,</italic> for which a high-quality reference sequence was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>). Since this algorithm involves a splitting procedure of the contigs into restriction fragments, chimeric contigs were broken into non-chimeric parts thereby correcting the assembly errors mentioned above. After processing, 11 superscaffolds were recovered, with the reordered contact map presenting the typical co-localized centromeres regions expected from the Rabl configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Animation 10</xref>). Overall these 11 scaffolds covered 94.5% of the reference sequence of the 10 chromosomes (chromosome 3 was split into two scaffolds because of the presence of the large, unassembled rDNA array on this chromosome), illustrating the ability of this de novo analysis to correctly assemble and scaffold unknown genomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The same approach was applied to other species in the mixture, such as <italic>Saccharomyces bayanus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliften et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scannell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our de novo assembly of the genome of <italic>S. bayanus</italic> was more fragmented than the one of <italic>N. castellii</italic>, probably as a result of the lower sequencing depth for this species in the mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Animation 11</xref>). Interestingly, not only did de novo assembly and scaffolding from meta3C reads allow genome assembly from a mixed population, but the 3D organization of the assembled genomes was also apparent in the resulting contact maps. For instance, interchromosomal signals corresponding to centromere clustering were clearly visible in the matrix, emphasizing that 3D signals could also be used to annotate the centromeres of unknown species isolated from meta3C data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014b</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>meta3C experiment on a controlled mix of yeasts species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) meta3C contact map of the mix of eleven species.

For this purpose, sediments were collected from an affluent of the Seine river near Paris. Because environmental genomes usually contain a tremendous diversity of species, including many eukaryotes of large genome sizes, we decided to enrich our sample for prokaryotic organisms by cultivating it for 14 hr in Luria broth and filtrating it prior to meta3C library construction and sequencing. As an internal control of the assembly process, reads from a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> 3C library were added to the meta3C sequences before running IDBA-UD (N50 = 1.2 kb).

The largest 11 ones were included in a contact matrix, revealing again squares along the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Each community was analyzed using MG-RAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glass et al., 2010</xref>), showing relatively homogeneous taxonomic compositions in most communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each community, more than 80% of the genes identified by MG-RAST within the contigs were attributed to the same taxonomic class. Going down to family level, 8 out of the 11 largest communities were &gt;80% homogeneous, with the remaining three presenting more complex patterns that will require further investigation and development. One community was composed of contigs covering 95% of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome control (for a total amount of 3.9 Mb congruent with the expected size of the genome; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, i), confirming the ability of this approach to pool DNA regions according to their genome of origin. Other communities contained contigs belonging to other discrete species, related for instance to the ubiquitous bacteria <italic>Aeromonas veronii</italic> or <italic>Exiguobacterium</italic> sp. (for total amounts of 4 Mb and 3.1 Mb, aligning to 72% and 36% of the reference genomes of 4.5 Mb and 3 Mb total sizes, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, i). Several species belonging to the classes Bacilli and Enterobacteria were also present in the mix (probably favored by the LB enrichment step). In some instances, weak interactions between communities from these clades suggested that a genome had been split into more than one community or that two communities contained mixtures of closely related species (see dotted square on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In spite of this problem the approach seemed to perform relatively well, as reflected by the analysis of the contacts with plasmids. Whether integrated in a genome or under circular forms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), plasmids are expected to present mostly contacts with their host genome since they share the same cellular compartment (see also the contacts of plasmid F with the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In this study, plasmids annotated as belonging to <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> were retrieved almost entirely within a single Bacilli community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, ii), suggesting that this community presented indeed a relatively homogeneous content and therefore validating our approach. Although the limited sequencing depth of our experiment restrained our ability to scaffold optimally the contigs of the communities using GRAAL, mapping the reads present in the community related to <italic>A. veronii</italic> against the reference genome of this species revealed a 3D structure reminiscent of those of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Animation 12</xref>). Hence, the 3D information contained within the chromosome of this species was efficiently captured during the meta3C experiment, suggesting that increasing the sequencing depth of a meta3C library will likely make it possible to generate de novo scaffolds and 3D clusters for genomes entirely unknown or underrepresented, shedding light at the same time onto their overall organization.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.023</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>meta3C analysis of a complex environmental sample.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) meta3C contact map of the largest 11 communities of contigs in the matrix before (bottom left) and after (upper right) clustering.

Ultimately, the contact information can be used to reorder the DNA segments within each community and thus generate the 3D contact map of the corresponding species. In this process contigs can be reassembled by software such as GRAAL, thereby decreasing the percentage of chimeric fragments in the assembly and improving its continuity.

Most of the organization in Saccharomycetes appears driven by the clustering of the centromeres at the spindle pole body; this clustering remains the prominent structural feature throughout most of the cell cycle (i.e., G1 + S phase + G2) during exponential growth, with mitosis representing only a fraction of the cycle. In bacteria, in contrary, the strong overall organizational features are the activation of a unique replication origin per chromosome, the ability to initiate multiple replication forks, and the fast division cycle. In addition, important topological constraints are exerted on bacterial circular chromosomes around the <italic>Ter</italic> regions, and our observation of significant contacts at these positions was probably linked to these phenomena. More imaging and 3C-like analyses will be required to understand the precise choreography of chromosome segregation in these different microorganisms.</p><p>Taking advantage of chromatin conformation capture data to address genomic questions is a dynamic field: while this paper was under review, two studies were released that also aimed at exploiting the physical contacts between DNA molecules to deconvolve genomes from controlled mixes of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beitel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al., 2014</xref>). Although these analyses open interesting perspectives, the meta3C approach presented in this work differs in several aspects. First, both studies used HiC to scafold genomes from contigs obtained either from simulated assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beitel et al., 2014</xref>) or from independent experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al., 2014</xref>). Our approach conveniently uses a single meta3C library and a blind analysis for generating contigs, binning them, scaffolding them, and revealing the 3D structure of the corresponding species. Such approach based on a single experiment may require more sequencing depth than an approach combining multiple libraries (HiC + shotgun + mate pair, for instance), but the exact trade-off remains to be determined and depends on the specifics of the experiment, the sequencing technology, and on the amount of starting material available.</p><p>Besides, our blind analysis allowed us to delineate communities without prior knowledge of the number of species present in the mix; this contrasts with the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al. (2014)</xref>, which apparently requires such prior knowledge. Similarly, we generate de novo chromosome scaffolds without any assumptions regarding the number of chromosomes present in the mixture, a realistic approach when it comes to exploring environmental samples or complete the assembly of complex genomes.</p><p>Furthermore, our experience with the analysis of chromosome organization in both bacteria and yeast species emphasized the importance of the initial steps for the success of such experiment. The adequacy between the cross-linking step, which depends on the incubation time and the concentration of the fixating agent, and the restriction step and choice of the restriction enzyme, is essential for the recovery of long-distance <italic>cis</italic> contacts that improve de novo genome scaffolding and, importantly, reveal the 3D structure. Optimizing the cross-linking conditions allows new insights into the diversity of 3D chromosome organization of several species.</p><p>Last but not least, the meta3C approach remains to be applied on a truly natural (not enriched) sample, such as a gut or wine microbiome. Based on our experience, we envision that, this experiment should include several (two at least) enzymes recognizing sites with various GC percentages, in order for both GC-rich and GC-poor genomes to be appropriately represented in the meta3C library. Doing the experiment with multiple enzymes would also allow taking into account GC content (in addition to average coverage) to improve the binning of contigs into communities. Identifying contigs presenting largely divergent characteristics compared to their neighbors and redistributing them to their most likely communities would also lead to improved assemblies for each species (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertsen et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, quantifying physical contacts between chromosomes provides an objective and convenient principle to segregate the genomes of sympatric species and, from there, to explore the biological diversity of complex ecosystems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of a bacteria meta3C library</title><p>Meta3C protocols were adapted from 3C protocols (notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oza et al., 2009</xref>).

In contrast to the previous results on the bacterial meta3C assembly, there were 9,599 chimeric contigs in the yeast case, representing 27.1% of the total number of contigs. This shows that chimeric contigs arise when dealing with mixtures of repeat-rich genomes, likely because near-identical repeats (such as transposable elements) are found in different genomes in the mixture. Such assembly mistakes will be probably avoided if using longer reads (since repeats longer than the read length pose problem during assembly) or, alternatively, can be resolved a posteriori using GRAAL. Despite the high percentage of chimeric contigs, we were able to assemble ∼95% of the <italic>N. castellii</italic> genome from the meta3C reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>River sediment meta3C assembly</title><p>67,920,671 pairs of reads (91 bp useful) were used to assemble the raw culture from the river sediment.

Among several community-detection algorithms, we found that the Louvain method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>) generated the best reconstructions of the controlled mixes of bacteria and yeast species. Before applying the algorithm, contigs longer than 2.5 kb were divided into equal-sized chunks corresponding to several nodes in the graph (since large contigs exhibit more contact than smaller ones, they are more prone to clustering when running the Louvain algorithm). We used the Louvain method with default parameters, except for the mix of three bacteria (r=10 for three communities). For bacterial mix, 10% of the contigs of the smallest size were not attributed to a community with these parameters (representing ∼15% of the total reads). For yeast, few contigs were left aside, representing in total ∼2% of the number of reads. For the river sediment experiment, ∼15% of the contigs were left aside at the binning step. The contigs in each bin resulting from the 3D binning were characterized using BLAST to determine the dominant species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>GRAAL scaffolding of the <italic>N. castellii</italic> and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> genomes</title><p>The program GRAAL (for Genome (Re)-Assembly Assessing Likelihood from 3D) aims at improving incomplete genome assemblies through the probabilistic exploitation of the physical contacts endured by chromosomes within a cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014a</xref>). The program only needs two datasets for initialization: a set of contigs and a 3C/HiC dataset. Upon initialization and depending on the depth of the HiC dataset, the software splits the contigs into smaller pieces/bins encompassing at least 2 restriction fragments. It then iteratively (over 1000s of steps) searches through a broad range of structures generated from reordering these small bins for genome structures more likely to be true given the 3D data. Importantly, at each step, a bin is tested for a variety of ‘structural variations’ with respect to its most likely neighbors, including duplications, deletions, fusions, inversion, etc. The likelihood of each of these new genome structures is then computed in light of the contact data, and one of those structures is sampled for the next iteration (during which the position of a new bin is tested). Each bin is tested several times throughout the entire process, and step by step the genome structure originally made of thousands of small independent bins converges towards a structure reflecting the best solution given the 3D contact data.</p><p>The entire program and full source code are freely available online here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/koszullab/GRAAL">https://github.com/koszullab/GRAAL</ext-link> as well as on the website of RK laboratory.

The resulting scaffolding showed a large improvement for all assembly parameters. The N50 length now reached 190,514 bp, and 77% of the total length of the assembly was assembled into regions larger than 50 kb (as compared to 3% before running the software). The result was even more spectacular for <italic>N. castellii</italic> (probably due to its higher coverage in the meta3C library): after running GRAAL on the 999 contigs (N50 = 27,452 bp) in the community delineated by the Louvain algorithm, N50 length reached 792,652 bp, and 96% of the assembled data was in scaffolds larger than 50 kb (with 11 scaffolds covering 95% of the 10 chromosomes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data visualization</title><p>For general visualization of the meta3C assembly data we used force-directed graph-drawing algorithms. This class of algorithms positions the nodes of a graph by assigning forces among the set of edges according to weighted interactions between the nodes. In our case, the 3C contacts dictated the strength of interactions between nodes. These layouts allowed us to visualize conveniently large clusters of nodes that were subsequently confirmed by the use of the Louvain algorithm. All graphs were visualized using the network software Gephi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Contigs longer than 2.5 kbp were divided into equal-sized chunks corresponding to several nodes in the graph (to ‘normalize’ the appearance of the clusters, since otherwise every contig, whatever its size, would be represented by a single point). For visualizing the meta3C bacterial assembly we used the Force Atlas 2 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacomy et al., 2014</xref>). This algorithm assigns spring-like attractive forces and repulsive forces (like those between electrically charged particles) to the set of edges and the set of nodes: in the equilibrium state, discrete clusters are obtained. The entire set of bins was then color-labeled, with each color corresponding to a community detected by the Louvain algorithm (revealing a strong correlation with the clusters obtained using the visualization approach).</p><p>For the circular representation and comparison of the sequences present in the communities against known bacterial genomes, we used the CGView server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Stothard, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jean-Yves Coppée, Caroline Proux, and Laurence Ma from the Génopole at Institut Pasteur for technical assistance with Illumina sequencing.

Through a series of experimental manipulations the authors investigate the potential of the method for mixtures of bacterial and yeast species. An application to a cultured environmental sample shows that the method can recover structure within real samples. As indicated by the title, the authors also use the results to characterise diversity in certain aspects of chromosome organisation among microbes.</p><p>This work goes beyond previous work (Burton et al. G3, Beitel et al PeerJ) on the use of Hi-C in metagenomics, adding a wider series of trial experiments and application to an (albeit cultured) environmental sample. All reviewers feel that the work shows promise, but the reality of using the technique on true environmental samples is still some way off. Nevertheless, this is a valuable addition to this new field and will be of wide interest.</p><p>In revising the manuscript, there are a few key areas to address:</p><p>1) The hypothesis of integration of the plasmid into the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome needs to be validated using an independent experiment. This is a potentially important demonstration of the technique's ability to identify structure and needs to be validated.</p><p>2) We would like to see a deeper and more quantitative evaluation of the similarities/differences between the method presented here and the Beitel/Burton methods.</p><p>3) We strongly encourage the authors to either evaluate a truly environmental sample without culturing, or discuss the steps needed to get to this position. This is a major limitation of the method as it stands.</p><p>Further detail is provided below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) I think the hypothesis of F plasmid integration within the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome should be validated experimentally.</p><p>2) I would like to see some discussion of whether temporal structuring arising from replication could lead to the contacts observed. Specifically, I wondered whether this might explain the X pattern seen between <italic>V. cholera</italic> chromosomes I and II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p><p>3) It is not clear what is meant by longitudinal organisation.</p><p>4) Reference should be to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, not D.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> – it's not clear what is meant by invisible reads.</p><p>6) I feel that the analysis of the <italic>S. banyans</italic> assembly is rather superficial as there is no truth data to compare it to. I would like to see side by side an analysis of how well the approach can identify and assemble de novo the genome of a species where the genome is known well. This seems to me to be the right test for the method.</p><p>7) What is meant by background interactions between communities?</p><p>8) The <italic>A. veronii</italic> analysis (rather like most of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) relies very heavily on mapping back to a reference genome. I feel this is a rather weak ending to the paper; you really want to be able to show that the metaC approach doesn't rely on existing external knowledge to this degree.</p><p>9) It's not clear to me why contigs &gt; 2.5kb have to be broken up? This seems bizarre.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>1) How was taxonomy assigned in the test environmental metagenomic communities? Did all contigs end up being of the same consensus taxonomy? What proportion shared a consensus taxonomy?</p><p>2) What fraction of reads go to unmapped/unresolved/not used in the assembly?</p><p>3) In albeit simple communities; this method seems to require super deep sequencing to get both HiC reads and enough reads for normal assembly.</p><p>4) Are there unique challenges or advantages to performing HiC on enucleated cells?</p><p>5) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, I would suggest a standardization of colors. 2C, 2D uses blue for <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> but 2E uses green for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. For 2B should consider which bacteria are rods versus spherical and use appropriately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) Can the authors discuss why they think <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is so different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>? Is it because the genomes of yeast are bigger? Because more species are included? Because yeast genomes are more complex?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> showing that authors can capture the chromosome conformation in a natural environment would be better served as one of those “space-filling dot plots” used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the chromosome conformations of the three organisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03318.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The hypothesis of integration of the plasmid into the E. coli genome needs to be validated using an independent experiment. This is a potentially important demonstration of the technique's ability to identify structure and needs to be validated</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for encouraging us to have a second look at this structure. We have performed an in-depth analysis of the behavior of the plasmid F and revised our interpretation. Since the plasmid exhibited frequent contacts with a discrete region of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, we initially concluded that the plasmid had become integrated. However, upon closer examination of the sequence coverage we realized that the large (170kb) region of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome that was in contact with the plasmid appeared duplicated in that strain. This raised the possibility that the duplicated chromosomal region showing high contact frequency was actually carried by the F plasmid. Analyzing the contacts between the plasmid F specific sequence and the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome we could identify a high contact correlation between the plasmid and the duplication. Such similarity of behavior with such sharp drops at the boundaries clearly indicated that the duplication was carried by the plasmid, which we confirmed using PFGE and Southern hybridization of specific probes.</p><p>This observation emphasizes the difficulty to handle DNA duplications when describing genomic structures through those approaches. Even with the power of HiC-based techniques to resolve genome assemblies, such events can introduce misleading signals that needs to be carefully deconvolved. But, importantly, the 3D signal also really helps interpreting those datasets.</p><p>In addition, we observed a significant increase in contacts between the F plasmid and the <italic>Ori</italic> and, to a lower extent, the <italic>Ter</italic> regions of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome, suggesting an average preferential position of this plasmid near these chromosomal regions. This analysis is the first that characterize the average disposition of an episome in a cell through a genome-wide 3C approach. The result is in agreement with previously published data obtained from cell imagining, as we now describe in the manuscript.</p><p>We have written a new paragraph describing this analysis and added a new figure to illustrate the results.</p><p>“The <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 strain used in the analysis carries a plasmid F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, black arrow). The 3D data provided us with the opportunity to carefully investigate the structure and spatial positioning of this plasmid with respect to the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. We first noticed that a large (∼140kb) region of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome exhibited a two-fold increase of the read coverage, indicating a segmental duplication. This region was also enriched in contacts with the F plasmid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), prompting us to hypothesize that one of the two copy was carried by the plasmid. A correlation analysis of the contacts between these two regions of interest (a chromosome region encompassing the duplication, and the plasmid) revealed clearly that, on the one hand, a copy of the duplication is in close contact with the F plasmid (with an IS2 at one the boundaries [coord. 390,063] and an IS3 within), and that on the other hand the plasmid contacts with the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome drop sharply past the duplication boundaries, in agreement with an integration of one copy of the duplication within the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2C</xref>). This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally by a Southern blot of a pulsed-field gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2D</xref>). Having deciphered the linear structure of the F plasmid within this strain, we investigated its 3D organization with respect to the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>). The frequent contacts each copy of the duplication makes with either the chromosome and the F plasmid resulted in an artifactual colocalization of the plasmid with the chromosome, since the contacts within each of the copies cannot be discriminated and are all positioned along the genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>, i and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Animation 3</xref>). To solve this bias, the contacts involving the duplicated region were removed and the 3D structure of the resulting was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>, ii and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Animation 2</xref>). In the resulting structure, the bin representing the plasmid appeared now well isolated from the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a supplementary control, we verified that removing from the genome a region of a size similar to the duplication did not impair the 3D positioning a DNA segment of a size similar to the F plasmid, positioned within this deleted region (blue dot; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2E</xref>, iii). Interestingly, besides this duplication, two regions along the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome appeared enriched in contacts with the F plasmid: the replication origin (<italic>Ori</italic>) and, to a lower extent, the termination (<italic>Ter</italic>) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>). This that the F plasmid is positioned preferentially in the vicinity of these regions in fast growing cells, as expected given the preferred location of the F plasmid in mid, 1/4 and 3/4 positions in the cell, which are also preferred positions for <italic>Ori</italic>/<italic>Ter</italic> regions during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gordon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niki and Hiraga, 1997</xref>). These results illustrate the high specificity of the meta3C approach, which allows the identification of genomic regions belonging to each species, and the power of using DNA physical contacts to decipher complex structures in individual genomes.</p><p><italic>2) We would like to see a deeper and more quantitative evaluation of the similarities/differences between the method presented here and the Beitel/Burton methods</italic>.</p><p>We have added a discussion regarding the similarities/differences of our study compare to those from Beitel/Burton. The Burton approach involves prior knowledge of the content of the tested mix as well as of the number of chromosomes of the species analyzed. The ability of our approach to successfully characterize, through a blind analysis, communities of contigs generated directly from the reads is now emphasized in the Discussion. In addition, we identified and described limitations in our analysis that both studies are probably facing but did not mention, such as the complications introduced by chimeric contigs.</p><p>Another important difference is the specificity of the experimental protocol developed in our analysis. We believe that we have characterized good conditions to perform HiC in microorganisms as evidence by our results that can be used for 3D reconstruction.</p><p>“Taking advantage of chromatin conformation capture data to address genomic questions is a dynamic field: while this paper was under review, two studies were released that also aimed at exploiting the physical contacts between DNA molecules to deconvolve genomes from controlled mixes of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beitel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al., 2014</xref>). Although these analyses open interesting perspectives, the meta3C approach presented in this work differs in several aspects. First, both studies used HiC to scafold genomes from contigs obtained either from simulated assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beitel et al., 2014</xref>) or from independent experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al., 2014</xref>). Our approach conveniently uses a single meta3C library and a blind analysis for generating contigs, binning them, scaffolding them and revealing the 3D structure of the corresponding species. Such approach based on a single experiment may require more sequencing depth than an approach combining multiple libraries (HiC + shotgun + mate pair, for instance), but the exact trade-off remains to be determined and depends on the specifics of the experiment, the sequencing technology, and on the amount of starting material available.</p><p>Besides, our blind analysis allowed us to delineate communities without prior knowledge of the number of species present in the mix; this contrasts with the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al. (2014)</xref>, which apparently requires such prior knowledge. Similarly, we generate de novo chromosome scaffolds without any assumptions regarding the number of chromosomes present in the mixture, a realistic approach when it comes to exploring environmental samples or complete the assembly of complex genomes.</p><p>Furthermore, our experience with the analysis of chromosome organization in both bacteria and yeast species emphasized the importance of the initial cross-linking step for the success of such experiment. The adequacy between the cross-linking step, which depends on the incubation time and the concentration of the fixating agent, and the restriction step and choice of the restriction enzyme, is essential for the recovery of long-distance <italic>cis</italic> contacts that improve de novo genome scaffolding and, importantly, reveal the 3D structure. Optimizing the cross-linking conditions allows new insights into the diversity of 3D chromosome organization of several species.”</p><p><italic>3). We strongly encourage the authors to either evaluate a truly environmental sample without culturing, or discuss the steps needed to get to this position. This is a major limitation of the method as it stands</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point that we are planning to address in the near future, in the continuity of the current analysis. We have added a paragraph in our article to discuss how we envision that such experiments should be conducted.</p><p>“Last but not least, the meta3C approach remains to be applied on a truly natural (not enriched) sample, such as a gut or wine microbiome. Based on our experience, we envision that, this experiment should include several (two at least) enzymes recognizing sites with various GC percentages, in order for both GC-rich and GC-poor genomes to be appropriately represented in the meta3C library. Doing the experiment with multiple enzymes would also allow taking into account GC content (in addition to average coverage) to improve the binning of contigs into communities. Identifying contigs presenting largely divergent characteristics compared to their neighbors, and redistributing them to their most likely communities would also lead to improve assemblies for each species (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertsen et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, quantifying physical contacts between chromosomes provides an objective and convenient principle to segregate the genomes of sympatric species and, from there, to explore the biological diversity of complex ecosystems.”</p><p><italic>Further detail is provided below</italic>:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) I think the hypothesis of F plasmid integration within the</italic> E. coli <italic>genome should be validated experimentally.</italic></p><p>See above.</p><p><italic>2) I would like to see some discussion of whether temporal structuring arising from replication could lead to the contacts observed. Specifically, I wondered whether this might explain the X pattern seen between V. cholera chromosomes I and II in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref>.</p><p>This is indeed an interesting discussion. In order to solve this intriguing structure, we have initiated an in-depth analysis of the links between the organization of the chromosomes of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and the cell cycle of this organism, which goes beyond the scope of the meta3C analysis presented here. However, we have added a new representation of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genome 3D reconstruction that clearly illustrates the link between replication and structure. In this figure, the read coverage of the genome, which reflects the average progression of the replication fork and thus the timing of replication, is shown using a color code. Whereas the two <italic>Ter</italic> regions appear of the same color, consistent with the fact that both chromosomes I and II achieve replication synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rasmussen et al., 2007</xref>; Stoke et al., 2011), the <italic>Ori</italic> regions present different colors, with chromosome I initiating replication first whereas chromosome II fires only once the fork has progressed along chromosome I. This analysis illustrates the spatial and temporal control of the replication program of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. We have added a discussion about this feature in the main text.</p><p>“For <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the <italic>Ter</italic> regions of chromosomes 1 and 2 were in closer proximity than the two <italic>Ori</italic> regions, reflecting the controlled segregation mechanisms of these two unequal-sized chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Val <italic>et al</italic>., PLoS Genetics, 2008</xref>). Interchromosomal contacts did not span the entire length of chromosome 1 but started between the <italic>Ori</italic> macrodomain of chromosome 2 and positions located at about one-third of chromosome 1 arms (black dotted squares, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In order to visualize the interplay between replication and genomic organization, we applied a color code to represent the read coverage of the genome (reflecting the average progression of the replication fork and thus the relative timing of replication) atop the genome structure of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Animation 6</xref>). Whereas the two <italic>Ter</italic> regions appeared of the same color, consistent with the fact that both chromosomes I and II achieve replication synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rasmussen et al., 2007</xref>), the <italic>Ori</italic> regions presented, as expected, different coverages: chromosome I initiating replication first whereas chromosome II starting only to replicate later. This analysis provides a glimpse on the spatial and temporal articulation of the replication program of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, which would be an interesting example of organization-dependent function.”</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear what is meant by longitudinal organisation</italic>.</p><p>We have described what we mean by that more clearly in the text (i.e., that the two replichores extend along parallel axes within the cell).</p><p><italic>4) Reference should be to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>, not D</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, thanks.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref> <italic>– it's not clear what is meant by invisible reads</italic>.</p><p>We mean by that DNA regions that cannot be disambiguated during the mapping process (i.e. present repeated regions). We have replaced “invisible reads” by the more explicit “remaining contigs”).</p><p><italic>6) I feel that the analysis of the S. banyans assembly is rather superficial as there is no truth data to compare it to. I would like to see side by side an analysis of how well the approach can identify and assemble</italic> de novo <italic>the genome of a species where the genome is known well. This seems to me to be the right test for the method</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the referee that this is the best way to assess the performance of our method and have replaced the <italic>S. bayanus</italic> analysis with the <italic>N. castellii</italic> one as a proof of concept. The blind analysis of the reads generated by the meta3C experiment on the mixture of yeast species revealed a community likely to correspond to the genome of <italic>N. castellii</italic>. The GRAAL scaffolding reordered these contigs so that 11 superscaffolds were generated covering 94.5% of the reference genome of <italic>N. castellii</italic>. The results are now described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, 2F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>. The same analysis performed on the <italic>S. bayanus</italic> community is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) What is meant by background interactions between communities</italic>?</p><p>We have detailed what we mean by this term in the sentence:</p><p>or because of “background interactions”, which correspond to chimeric religation between restriction fragments belonging to different species resulting from the experimental protocol.</p><p><italic>8) The</italic> A. veronii <italic>analysis (rather like most of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>) relies very heavily on mapping back to a reference genome. I feel this is a rather weak ending to the paper; you really want to be able to show that the metaC approach doesn't rely on existing external knowledge to this degree.</italic></p><p>Ideally, we agree that it would have been better to scaffold the <italic>A. veronii</italic> genome assembly generated de novo from our meta3C library and convert it into a genomic contact map directly, without using the reference genome. However, our coverage of this genome in the meta3C reads was insufficient, which precluded such blind analysis. Nevertheless, mapping the reads on the reference genome allowed us to show that the 3D information needed to perform the scaffolding step is indeed there, albeit in insufficient amount, and that increasing the sequencing depth will alleviate this limitation in future experiments. We now provide a more detailed interpretation of this limitation of our present dataset.</p><p><italic>9) It's not clear to me why contigs &gt; 2.5kb have to be broken up? This seems bizarre</italic>.</p><p>We clarified this point by adding in the Methods section the following:</p><p>“Before applying the algorithm, contigs longer than 2.5 kb were divided into equal-sized chunks corresponding to several nodes in the graph (since large contigs exhibit more contact than smaller ones, they are therefore more prone to clustering when running the Louvain algorithm).”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) How was taxonomy assigned in the test environmental metagenomic communities? Did all contigs end up being of the same consensus taxonomy? What proportion shared a consensus taxonomy</italic>?</p><p>The taxonomy annotation was done by analyzing the sequences present in each community of contigs with the software MGRast, which classifies the sequences according to their similarities with known genomes. We have added the MGRast data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) to illustrate the homogeneity obtained for the largest pools of contigs, and described it in the following text:</p><p>“Each community was analyzed using MG-RAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glass et al., 2010</xref>), showing relatively homogeneous taxonomic compositions in most communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). For each community, more than 80% of the genes identified by MG-RAST within the contigs were attributed to the same taxonomic class. Going down to family level, 8 out of the 11 largest communities were &gt;80% homogeneous, with the remaining 3 presenting more complex patterns that will require further investigation and development.”</p><p><italic>2) What fraction of reads go to unmapped/unresolved/not used in the assembly</italic>?</p><p>We have added more precisions regarding these numbers in the Material and Methods section. Since we used a De Bruijn assembly approach, the proportion of unmapped reads is not immediately accessible, and we remapped the reads on the contigs to find out which reads were unaccounted for.</p><p>Notably, for the bacterial mixture:</p><p>4,040,422 reads were used for assembling the mixture of three bacterial genomes, yielding 2,436 contigs (303&gt;5kb, N50 = 55kb, total length 12.5Mb). More than 95% (∼3,880,000) of the initial reads mapped on the contigs.</p><p>For bacterial mix, 10% of the contigs of the smallest size were not attributed to a community with these parameters (representing ∼15% of the total reads).</p><p>For the yeast mixture:</p><p>47,614 contigs were generated by assembling the ∼60M yeast reads (7,212&gt;5kb, N50 = 6.9kb, total length 138.7Mb). When mapped against the newly generated contigs, 47M reads (∼78%) did align that had been used in the assembly.</p><p>For yeast, few contigs were left apart, representing in total ∼2% of the number of reads.</p><p>For the river sample:</p><p>The assembly generated 130,713 contigs (2,250&gt;5kb, N50 = 1,274kb, total length = 111Mb). After realignment of the initial reads along the generated contig, 42,705,64 PE reads could be mapped against the assembled contigs (∼62%). For the river sediment experiment, 15% of the contigs were left apart during the binning step.</p><p><italic>3) In albeit simple communities; this method seems to require super deep sequencing to get both HiC reads and enough reads for normal assembly</italic>.</p><p>These experiments have been made possible thanks to the drop in the cost of sequencing, but the important number of genomes present in natural microbiomes necessitate such large amounts of sequencing to be solved. We have added in the discussion the following comments, in light of the approach chosen by Beitel et al. and Burton et al. (see above).</p><p>“Although these analyses open interesting perspectives, the meta3C approach presented in this work differs in several aspects.

This step depends on the enzyme used (4 or 6-cutters), the incubation time and the concentration. We have identified good conditions regarding these constraints. This is now clearly stated in the Discussion.</p><p>“Furthermore, our experience with the analysis of chromosome organization in both bacteria and yeast species emphasized the importance of the initial cross-linking step for the success of such experiment.

Most of the organization in Saccharomycetes appeared driven by the clustering of the centromeres at the spindle-pole bod; this clustering remains the prominent structural feature throughout most of the cell cycle (i.e., G1 + S phase + G2) during exponential growth, with mitosis representing only a fraction of the cycle. In bacterial, in contrary, the strong overall organizational features are the activation of a unique replication origin per chromosome, the ability to initiate multiple replication forks, and the fast division cycle. In addition, important topological constraints are exerted on bacterial circular chromosomes around the <italic>Ter</italic> regions, and our observation of significant contacts at these positions was probably linked to these phenomena.
