TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 were important in early stages of the viral lifecycle, and genetic epistasis analysis demonstrated that the three genes function in a common pathway. Mechanistically, reduced internalization of EMCV was observed in TNK2 deficient cells demonstrating that TNK2 functions in EMCV entry.

Although vaccines exist for poliovirus and hepatitis A virus, there are currently no FDA approved antivirals against picornaviruses in the United States. As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses are dependent on the host cellular machinery to complete their lifecycle. The early stages of the virus lifecycle, including receptor binding, entry, uncoating, and initiation of replication, are the ideal targets for preventing virus infection since the virus has not yet multiplied.</p><p>Despite extensive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamauchi and Helenius, 2013</xref>), there remain significant gaps in our understanding of virus entry. As the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> encompasses a wide range of viruses, it is not surprising that there is diversity in the known entry mechanisms of different species. Among the picornaviruses, poliovirus entry has been the most extensively studied. While some reports suggest that poliovirus enters the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that its genome release depends on endosome acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madshus et al., 1984a</xref>), more recent studies report that poliovirus enters cells by a clathrin-, caveolin-, flotillin-, and microtubule-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, poliovirus entry is sensitive to inhibitors of both tyrosine kinases and actin-polymerization, although it is not known which specific tyrosine kinase(s) is/are important for poliovirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) entry has also been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergelson and Coyne, 2013</xref>). In polarized epithelial cells, CVB3 binding to the co-receptor decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) leads to entry by caveolin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coyne and Bergelson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyne et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to CVB3 and poliovirus, there have been few studies of EMCV entry. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and the disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) are reported to be entry factors for EMCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baggen et al., 2019</xref>). Interaction of the EMCV virion with VCAM-1 is believed to induce a conformational change that then releases the viral RNA genome; entry into the cytosol is reported to be independent of acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Madshus et al., 1984b</xref>).</p><p>Using a novel virus infection system comprised of the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> and Orsay virus, the only known natural virus of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we previously identified several genes that are essential for virus infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). The genes <italic>sid-3</italic>, <italic>viro-2</italic> and <italic>nck-1</italic> were found to be essential for an early, pre-replication step of the Orsay virus lifecycle. <italic>sid-3</italic> encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase orthologous to human Tyrosine Kinase Non-Receptor 2 (TNK2), <italic>viro-2</italic> encodes an orthologue of human Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein Like protein (WASL), and <italic>nck-1</italic> encodes an orthologue of Non-Catalytic Region of Tyrosine Kinase (NCK1), an adaptor protein that binds to both TNK2 and WASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galisteo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>). Since Orsay virus is a non-enveloped, positive strand RNA virus that is evolutionarily related to the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, we reasoned that the human orthologues of these genes may have a conserved role in infection by picornaviruses.</p><p>Human TNK2 is linked to cancers, has been reported to be activated by multiple extracellular stimuli, and is involved in many different pathways, such as clathrin/receptor mediated endocytosis, regulation of EGFR degradation, transduction of signals into the nucleus, and regulation of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galisteo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of TNK2 induces interferon and leads to reduced replication of a Hepatitis C virus replicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2011</xref>). To date, there are no publications demonstrating a positive role for TNK2 in virus infection; several siRNA-based screens suggest that TNK2 is important for influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">KÃ¶nig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lupberger et al., 2011</xref>), but no validation of these screening results have been reported. Humans encode two orthologues of <italic>viro-2</italic>, WASP and WASL (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteinÂ /-like) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Massaad et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, biochemical assays have demonstrated that WASL is a substrate for the kinase activity of TNK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that the two function in a pathway. NCK1 is an adaptor protein reported to co-localize with TNK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galisteo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teo et al., 2001</xref>) and interact with WASL. There are only limited studies linking WASL and NCK1 to virus infection. A clear role has been established for WASL in spread of vaccinia virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischknecht et al., 1999</xref>) that involves NCK1 as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodding and Way, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, sensitivity of Lassa virus infection to Wiskostatin, a small molecule inhibitor of WASL, suggests a role of WASL in virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oppliger et al., 2016</xref>). However, there are no studies implicating NCK1 in any aspect of picornavirus infection or in entry of any virus.</p><p>Here, we determined whether these three human orthologues of the genes found in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> forward genetic screen function in an evolutionarily conserved manner to facilitate virus infection in human cell culture. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was used to generate knockout cells for each gene, and their impact on infection by a panel of viruses from different families was then tested. Significant reductions in infection by multiple picornaviruses were observed in each of the cell lines. Consistent with these in vitro data, we observed increased survival of mice lacking murine TNK2 after EMCV challenge in vivo. We further demonstrated that TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 function in a pathway to support EMCV virus infection with WASL and NCK1 lying downstream of TNK2. Mechanistically, loss of TNK2 led to reduced EMCV virus internalization, while both TNK2 and WASL were required for proper endocytic trafficking of EMCV. These data support a model wherein TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 comprise a pathway that is important for entry by multiple picornaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-receptor tyrosine kinase TNK2 is important for infection by multiple picornaviruses</title><p>To investigate the function of TNK2 in virus infection, human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cells deficient in TNK2 were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In addition, reduced infectivity in <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 was also observed with both recombinant GFP-EMCV and GFP-CVB3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A B</xref>). Furthermore, we examined virus replication complex formation by double stranded RNA immunostaining with the commercial J2 antibody and direct electron microscopy (EM) on EMCV-infected cells. We observed fewer cells positive for double-stranded RNA and smaller size of the virus replication complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C D</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we analyzed EMCV and CVB3 infection in commercial Hap1 cells (a haploid hematopoietic-derived lymphoma cell line) deficient in TNK2. Reductions in infected cells by 24% for EMCV and 30% for CVB3 were observed (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A B</xref>). Statistically significant reductions in poliovirus infection in both Hap1 and A549 <italic>TNK2</italic> knockout cells and reduction in enterovirus D68 infection in A549 cells were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C, E F</xref>).

Lentivirus expression of each of the three major TNK2 isoforms (which yielded expression levels of TNK2 much higher than the endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4D</xref>)) in control A549 cells led to statistically significant reductions in EMCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A, B C</xref>).

For NCK1, based on its reported binding to WASL and TNK2, we hypothesized that its function is to recruit WASL to TNK2, which could then activate WASL via phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rohatgi et al., 2001</xref>).

Fluorescent protein tagged forms of TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 were individually expressed in 293 T cells. WASL and NCK1 both distributed homogenously throughout the cytoplasm, while TNK2 formed puncta in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which agreed with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). To examine potential co-localization, we co-expressed either mCerulean tagged TNK2 or mCerulean tagged WASL with mVenus tagged NCK1 in 293 T cells, respectively. Since NCK1 is an adaptor protein, we reasoned that its interactions with binding partners would likely be relatively stable and therefore more readily detectable. Co-expression of mCerulean tagged TNK2 with mVenus tagged NCK1 re-localized NCK1 into the puncta observed by TNK2 expression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref>,Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4A</xref>).

To further check other general virus entry pathways, we also examined whether macropinocytosis was affected in these cells. FITC conjugated Dextran (7 KDa) is reported to be uptaken by macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oppliger et al., 2016</xref>).

In contrast, the <italic>WASL</italic> KO cells had a 75% reduction in Dextran uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3C D</xref>), which is consistent with the known dependency of macropinocytosis on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Innocenti et al., 2005</xref>). The Dextran macropinocytosis defect in the <italic>WASL</italic> KO appears to be unrelated to EMCV infection though since no reduction in either binding or internalization of EMCV was observed.</p><p>A step that is closely linked to internalization for picornaviruses is virus-induced pore formation, which is required for genome release into the cytoplasm. To assess pore formation, cells were treated with the membrane impermeable translation inhibitor, Î±-sarcin. Virus-induced pore formation will lead to translation inhibition and reduction of <sup>35</sup>S methionine and <sup>35</sup>S cysteine incorporation whereas in the absence of pore formation, translation will proceed at wild type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FernÃ¡ndez-Puentes and Carrasco, 1980</xref>). <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 and <italic>WASL</italic> KO cells showed no defect in virus pore formation during EMCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Although a clear defect in EMCV internalization exists in the <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), no defect in pore formation was observed. Since the internalization defect in <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 cells is not absolute, pore formation may still occur with sufficient frequency to inhibit translation. Alternatively, pore formation may not necessarily require prior internalization; for example binding of parainfluenza virus alone is sufficient to initiate pore formation at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porotto et al., 2012</xref>). For WASL, no defect in binding, internalization or pore formation was observed in the knockout cells, suggesting that the defect is downstream of these steps. Similarly, a recent report suggests that the human gene PLA2G16 acts at a step of the picornavirus lifecycle that is subsequent to pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staring et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether TNK2 or WASL plays any role in downstream viral RNA genome translocation after pore formation, we examined virus-induced host protein cleavage after its entry. For some picornaviruses, immediately after translocation of its genome, translation of the incoming positive strand RNA leads to proteolytic cleavage of the host protein eIF4G to shut down host translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glaser and Skern, 2000</xref>). Since this activity has not been described for EMCV, we used CVB3 which is known to have this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carthy et al., 1998</xref>). eIF4G cleavage in presence or absence of a virus genome replication inhibitor guanidine hydrochloride showed no difference in the <italic>WASL</italic> KO cells as compared to the control cells, demonstrating that WASL does not impact this step of the viral lifecycle. In contrast, we observed a decrease of eIF4G cleavage in <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 cells, suggesting that TNK2 might play a role in this process. Alternatively, the reduced eIF4G cleavage level might simply reflect the reduced level of virus internalization in <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>TNK2 was found in proximity to labeled EMCV particles during infection</title><p>TNK2 is present in endocytic vesicles and colocalizes with the early endosome marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">GrÃ¸vdal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2014</xref>).Â To visualize TNK2 subcellular localization, we expressed N-terminally GFP tagged TNK2 in the <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 cells.

Different domains of WASL are critical for interaction with other proteins that can modulate WASL stability, activation, or function.

The basic region that binds with PIP2, the proline rich region that binds with SH3 domain containing proteins, the GTPase binding domain that interacts with CDC-42 kinase, and the acidic domain that is involved in actin binding and polymerization were all required for EMCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

In this study, we further asked whether their respective human orthologues <italic>TNK2</italic>, <italic>WASL</italic>, and <italic>NCK1</italic> play any roles in mammalian virus infection. After screening a panel of mammalian viruses, we found that multiple picornaviruses, including EMCV, CVB3, enterovirus D68, and poliovirus, rely on TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 for infection in different cell lines. For TNK2, this represents the first evidence that it has any pro-viral function. Interestingly, poliovirus entry was previously shown to be dependent on an unknown kinase based on the use of a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandenburg et al., 2007</xref>). One possibility is that TNK2 might be the kinase targeted in that study.</p><p>Our data represent the first demonstration that WASL and NCK1 are important for infection by picornaviruses such as EMCV, CVB3, enterovirus D68, and poliovirus. RNA transfection of EMCV into <italic>TNK2</italic>, <italic>WASL,</italic> and <italic>NCK1</italic> knockouts each yielded the same level of virus as the control demonstrating their role in an early stage of the EMCV lifecycle. For WASL, this is in contrast to its well-defined role in facilitating spread and transmission of vaccinia virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischknecht et al., 1999</xref>) suggesting that WASL is important for different lifecycle stages for different viruses. In addition to the known interactions between NCK1 and WASL, TNK2 has been reported to phosphorylate WASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with these data, our genetic epistasis analysis and ectopic trans-complementation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD</xref>) demonstrated that these three genes function in a pathway in the context of picornavirus infection. Furthermore, biochemical and biophysical data demonstrated direct interaction of NCK1 with both TNK2 and WASL. Previous studies have established a clear role for CDC42 in regulation of TNK2 and WASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohatgi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prieto-EchagÃ¼e and Miller, 2011</xref>), and inhibition of CDC42 resulted in reduced EMCV infection.</p><p>We explored the mechanism by which TNK2 and WASL act regarding picornavirus infection. <italic>TNK2</italic> KO1 cells were partially defective in EMCV internalization. In contrast, internalization was not affected in <italic>WASL</italic> KO cells, suggesting WASL functions in one or more steps downstream of virus internalization. In the absence of either TNK2 or WASL, EMCV particles continued to accumulate in early endosomes at 30 min post infection in contrast to control cells, demonstrating a role for both genes in endosomal trafficking. Notably, <italic>sid-3</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of TNK2, is important for endosomal trafficking of RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jose et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that the delay in release from the early endosomes contributes to the reduction in EMCV infection in both <italic>TNK2</italic> and <italic>WASL</italic> KO cells. However, it is uncertain whether this observed accumulation in early endosomes is directly related to the reduced levels of infection in these cells. In detailed studies of poliovirus, most of the RNA genome is released from the virus particles by 20 min post internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, additional studies are necessary to determine whether the accumulated particles in the early endosomes still contain genomic RNA.</p><p>These data led us to the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). TNK2 is in a pathway upstream of WASL and NCK1. Because <italic>TNK2</italic> deletion has a greater magnitude of impact than <italic>WASL</italic> or <italic>NCK1</italic> deletion, TNK2 must act on one or more additional step of the viral lifecycle than WASL and NCK1. Consistent with this model, we demonstrated that TNK2 (but not WASL) is needed for virus internalization. In addition, we propose that TNK2 activates WASL (presumably, but not necessarily, by phosphorylation and in a fashion mediated by NCK1 binding), which then affects a subsequent early step of the EMCV lifecycle. Our data suggest that this step is linked to proper endocytic trafficking of the incoming viral particles, which accumulated in early endosomes in both TNK2 and WASL deficient cells to a greater extent than in control cells. The requirement for the WASL acidic domain, which is responsible for actin binding and nucleation, along with the sensitivity to the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-869, demonstrates that this process is actin dependent. One possibility is that regulated actin polymerization may be necessary to deliver endocytic vesicles to specific subcellular locations necessary for productive infection.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of TNK2, WASL, and NCK1 function in picornavirus infection.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50276-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Actin is critical for many cellular processes and due to its essentiality, is not a druggable target. In this study, we identified a TNK2 and actin-dependent pathway necessary to promote virus infection but does not appear to alter normal endocytosis. As cells lacking TNK2 and NCK1 are clearly viable, as are mice lacking TNK2 and NCK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bladt et al., 2003</xref>). These genes are potential antiviral targets that could be disrupted by small molecules without compromising overall actin biology and survival of the host.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that there are additional, poorly defined stages of the picornavirus lifecycle. A recent genetic screen identified PLA2G16 as an essential gene required for an early stage of multiple picornaviruses at a step post binding, internalization, and pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staring et al., 2017</xref>). Our study similarly suggests that WASL also acts after these stages. Further study is needed to determine whether WASL acts at the same stage as PLA2G16 or at a distinct step.</p><p>All four picornaviruses we tested were dependent on TNK2 and WASL. In contrast, viruses in other families such as influenza A virus, parainfluenza 5 and adenovirus A5 were not affected by absence of these genes, suggesting that picornaviruses may specifically depend on these host factors. PIV5 is known to enter cells by direct fusion at the cellular membrane and is not believed to utilize endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Porotto et al., 2012</xref>). The observed lack of dependence of PIV5 on TNK2 or WASL is consistent with a potential role of TNK2 and WASL in modulating endocytic vesicle trafficking. In contrast, picornaviruses such as poliovirus, CVB3, and EMCV are generally thought to utilize clathrin independent endocytic vesicles for entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergelson and Coyne, 2013</xref>), while influenza A virus and adenovirus mostly rely on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for their entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamauchi and Helenius, 2013</xref>). The magnitude of the phenotypes did vary significantly among the tested picornaviruses, which is not surprising given the significant degree of divergence between these virus genomes and differences in their entry requirements. Nonetheless, all four tested picornaviruses displayed different degree of dependence on this pathway. It will be important to test a wider range of picornaviruses to determine exactly which taxa within the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> are most reliant on these genes. It will also be of great interest to test additional viruses from other families. The data suggesting a role of WASL in Lassa virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oppliger et al., 2016</xref>) supports the notion that at least some viruses in other virus families may also depend on one or more of these genes for infection.</p><p>In recent years, multiple studies of host factors critical for picornavirus infection have utilized haploid gene-trap screening or CRISPR screening in mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staring et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). These studies have identified multiple host genes required broadly for picornaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staring et al., 2017</xref>), as well as examples of genes required for specific picornaviruses. For instance, ADAM9 was discovered as a potential receptor for EMCV by CRISPR and gene trap screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baggen et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the genes that we identified by starting with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Orsay virus genetic screen, <italic>TNK2</italic>, <italic>WASL</italic>, and <italic>NCK1</italic>, were not identified as hits in any of the direct mammalian screens undertaken by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staring et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, these approaches provide complementary experimental strategies that, ideally in the long run, will lead to comprehensive understanding of host factors necessary for virus infection.</p><p>Our study of <italic>TNK2</italic> was driven by our identification in <italic>C. elegans</italic> of <italic>sid-3</italic> as a host factor required for Orsay virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>sid-3</italic> was originally identified in a genetic screen for mutants defective in systemic spread of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jose et al., 2012</xref>). That screening strategy also identified another <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene, <italic>sid-1</italic>, that is reported to transport dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winston, 2002</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that the mammalian orthologue of <italic>sid-1</italic>, SIDT2, has an evolutionarily conserved function in transporting dsRNA that serves as a means of activating innate antiviral immunity in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Those studies provide an example of the value of using the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system to guide insights into conserved functions with mammals. Here we demonstrated that TNK2, the human orthologue of <italic>sid-3</italic>, has an evolutionarily conserved function to facilitate virus infection in mammals. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Orsay virus infection is presumed to occur by fecal-oral transmission, as evidenced by its exclusive intestinal cell tropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franz et al., 2014</xref>). Deletion of <italic>sid-3</italic> reduces Orsay virus infection byÂ &gt;5 logs in vivo in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, infection of mice lacking TNK2 by oral gavage, the analogous route of infection as for Orsay virus infection of <italic>C elegans</italic>, led to increased survival of animals deficient in TNK2. These results clearly demonstrate the functional parallels between <italic>sid-3</italic> and <italic>TNK2</italic> in their respective hosts in vivo. Thus, our study has identified another example wherein novel insight in mammalian biology emerge from initial discoveries in model organism studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human)</td><td>TNK2 isoform1</td><td>GenBank</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/NM_005781.4">NM_005781.4</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human)</td><td>TNK2 isoform2</td><td>GenBank</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genscript.com/gene/homo-sapiens/10188/tnk2.html#nm_001010938.1">BC028164.1</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human)</td><td>TNK2 isoform3</td><td>GenBank</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genscript.com/gene/homo-sapiens/10188/tnk2.html#nm_001308046.1">NM_001308046.1</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human)</td><td>WASL</td><td>GenBank</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/NM_003941.3">NM_003941.3</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human)</td><td>NCK1</td><td>GenBank</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genscript.com/gene/homo-sapiens/4690/NCK1.html#nm_006153.5">NM_006153.5</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain <break/>background (Mouse)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The <break/>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain <break/>background (Mouse)</td><td>C57BL/6J TNK2 KO</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Generated at the Genome Engineering and iPSC Center (GEiC) at Washington University.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Entry by multiple picornaviruses is dependent on a pathway that includes TNK2, WASL and NCK1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Karla Kirkegaard as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor have invited you to prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work describes the detailed characterization of the role of three mammalian homologues (TNK2, WASL and NCK1) of genes previously found by the authors in a genetic screen for viral susceptibility factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Knockout of these genes leads to reduced levels of infection by diverse picornaviruses. The authors pinpoint the defect in the viral entry phase after binding and pore formation. Finally, in a mouse of EMCV infection, reduced mortality was found in TNK2 knockout mice. The manuscript is well-written, the experimental approach is technically sound and the data generally support the conclusions. Understanding cellular components that support infection by the important picornavirus family is of high interest to a broad field of biologists. We would like the authors to address several major areas that could be improved:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Animal studies: The effects of knockout of the three genes ranges from a moderate effect to a very small effect (albeit statistically significant). This effect can vary depending on the percentage infected cells at different MOI's. For example at higher infection ratio's the effect of WASL-KO for CV-B3 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B) is negligible, while there might be an effect at lower MOIs. By plotting the data as relative infection compared to WT control (as is done throughout the manuscript), important information is lost regarding the absolute infection levels of (WT and KO) cells. It would be beneficial to plot the data as absolute infection percentages.</p><p>In addition, the authors state that expression of TNK2 induced IFNs, which would suggest that this factor plays an important role in antiviral signaling. Therefore, changes in survival may be related to alterations in some aspect of immune activation/signaling. This should be addressed.</p><p>Further, in the mouse model the experiment was stopped at day 10, while there was still a mouse dying at day 9 in the KO group. There is a concern that KO results in a delay in mortality but, if taken out longer, not in significantly reduced overall mortality.</p><p>For Figure 7 to be more impactful, the authors should provide titer information from various tissues isolated from infected animals (two reviewers suggested this).</p><p>2) The impact of deletion of TNK2 and WASL is quite modest. It would therefore seem to be an overstatement to suggest that these factors regulate the internalization of all picornaviruses when the most striking data seems to be with EMCV. Growth curves for infectious viral titers for the other viruses included in the manuscript would bolster the authors' conclusions. Moreover, I think it is an overstatement to call the genes &quot;critical&quot; for infection, especially in the Abstract. There is no doubt that they are &quot;important&quot; and of interest but some of the more modest effects do not justify the word &quot;critical&quot;.</p><p>3) The internalization assay shown in Figure 4D is lacking controls. As this assay relies on the removal of bound particles by trypsin, it would be important to show that this type of assay can be applied to picornaviruses, which are often quite resistant to this treatment.</p><p>4) It is surprising that the reduction of infection is so modest in fibroblasts isolated from KO animals (Figure 7C). These data could be bolstered by inclusion of titer data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50276.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Animal studies: The effects of knockout of the three genes ranges from a moderate effect to a very small effect (albeit statistically significant).

This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Little is known about the link between TNK2 and interferon induction. To date, there is only one published study suggesting that TNK2 overexpression can induce interferon stimulated genes and can restrict HCV replication (Fujimoto et al., 2011), which we cited to provide relevant background information. As our EMCV phenotypes are reduced lethality and reduced viral titers in TNK2 KO, at the simplest level, these observations are not consistent with an antiviral signaling mechanism. While we are quite interested in investigating a potential antiviral function of TNK2, we believe that rigorous study of the impact on immune activation and signaling, such as crossing of TNK2 KO animals into IFN deficient mice, are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, in the mouse model the experiment was stopped at day 10, while there was still a mouse dying at day 9 in the KO group. There is a concern that KO results in a delay in mortality but, if taken out longer, not in significantly reduced overall mortality.</p></disp-quote><p>In the mouse experiment, we monitored the infected mice for 21 days and no additional deaths occurred after day 9. We have extended the survival curve in Figure 7E to day 21 to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 7 to be more impactful, the authors should provide titer information from various tissues isolated from infected animals (two reviewers suggested this).</p></disp-quote><p>The EMCV titers of infected mouse heart and brain, the tissues most commonly analyzed in EMCV infection, have been added as Figure 7F and 7G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The impact of deletion of TNK2 and WASL is quite modest. It would therefore seem to be an overstatement to suggest that these factors regulate the internalization of all picornaviruses when the most striking data seems to be with EMCV. Growth curves for infectious viral titers for the other viruses included in the manuscript would bolster the authors' conclusions. Moreover, I think it is an overstatement to call the genes &quot;critical&quot; for infection, especially in the Abstract. There is no doubt that they are &quot;important&quot; and of interest but some of the more modest effects do not justify the word &quot;critical&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added multi-step growth curves for CVB3 in TNK2, WASL and NCK1 knockout A549 cells (Figures 1E, 2E, 2K). We have replaced all instances of âcriticalâ with âimportantâ in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The internalization assay shown in Figure 4D is lacking controls. As this assay relies on the removal of bound particles by trypsin, it would be important to show that this type of assay can be applied to picornaviruses, which are often quite resistant to this treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added controls (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C-E) demonstrating that Trypsin treatment consistently removes the same fraction of bound EMCV in control, TNK2 KO1 and WASL KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is surprising that the reduction of infection is so modest in fibroblasts isolated from KO animals (Figure 7C). These data could be bolstered by inclusion of titer data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a multi-step growth curve and EMCV titers are consistently lower in TNK2 KO lung fibroblast than WT.</p></body></sub-article></article>
