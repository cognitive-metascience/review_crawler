We showed that, during the initial stages of axon outgrowth, microtubules display mixed polarity and minus-end-out microtubules push the tip of the axon, consistent with kinesin-1 driving outgrowth by sliding antiparallel microtubules. At later stages, the microtubule orientation in the axon switches from mixed to uniform polarity with plus-end-out. Dynein knockdown prevents this rearrangement and results in microtubules of mixed orientation in axons and accumulation of microtubule minus-ends at axon tips. Microtubule reorganization requires recruitment of dynein to the actin cortex, as actin depolymerization phenocopies dynein depletion, and direct recruitment of dynein to the membrane bypasses the actin requirement. Our results show that cortical dynein slides ‘minus-end-out’ microtubules from the axon, generating uniform microtubule arrays. We speculate that differences in microtubule orientation between axons and dendrites could be dictated by differential activity of cortical dynein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10140.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10140.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10140.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Motor proteins can move along filaments called microtubules to transport proteins and other materials to different parts of the cell. Microtubules are “polar” filaments, meaning that they have two distinct ends that have different chemical properties. Motor proteins can only move along these filaments in one direction, for example, the kinesin motor proteins generally move toward the so-called “plus-end”, while dynein motors move in the opposite direction.</p><p>A typical nerve cell (or neuron) is composed of a cell body, a long projection called an axon and many small branch-like structures called dendrites. Within the axon, the microtubules are arranged so that their plus-ends point outwards, but the microtubules in dendrites are arranged differently so that many minus-ends point outwards instead. This polarity is important for the neuron in deciding which proteins should be transported to axons, and which should go to the dendrites. However, it is not clear how these different microtubule arrangements are established.</p><p>Here, del Castillo et al. used microscopy to study microtubules in the axons of fruit fly neurons. The experiments show that in the very early stages of neuron development, the axons contained microtubules of mixed polarity. However, by the later stages, the microtubules had become uniform with all the plus-ends directed outwards.</p><p>Further experiments show that dynein is responsible for this organization as it pushes the minus-end-out microtubules out of the axons. Dynein uses a scaffold made of a protein called actin to attach to the inner surface of the cell and move the minus-end microtubules to the cell body of the neuron. Thus, del Castillo et al.’s findings reveal that these dynein motors are responsible for the polarity of microtubules in mature axons. The next challenge is to understand how dynein is attached to the actin scaffold and why it rearranges microtubules in axons, but not in dendrites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10140.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10140.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>axons</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 052111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Vladimir I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cortical dynein organizes unipolar microtubule arrays in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons by expelling minus-end-out microtubules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal development involves the dramatic morphologic reorganization of spherical morphologically undifferentiated cells to highly polarized mature neurons. Developing neurons grow long microtubule-based axons and dendrites. Over the last decades, the origin of the mechanical forces that drive process formation in neurons has been the subject of numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suter and Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). Recently, our lab demonstrated that kinesin-1, a major microtubule motor, slides microtubules against each other in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barlan et al., 2013</xref>), including neurons, and this sliding plays an important role in neuronal polarization. We have shown that microtubule-microtubule sliding is required for initial axon formation and regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2015</xref>). This process is likely required for neurodevelopment in many organisms besides <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as kinesin-driven microtubule sliding has been implicated in generating the minus-end-out microtubule pattern observed in dendrites of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The main well-established function of kinesin-1 (also known as conventional kinesin) is the transport of cargoes along microtubules in the cytoplasm. Each kinesin-1 molecule is a heterotetramer that consists of two heavy chains (KHC) and two light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuznetsov et al., 1988</xref>). Each KHC polypeptide contains two microtubule-binding domains: one ATP-dependent site in the motor domain and a second ATP-independent site at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hackney and Stock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). Kinesin-1 is thought to slide microtubules against each other with these two heavy chain domains; one microtubule is used as a track, while the other is transported as a cargo; kinesin light chains are not required for sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Axons contain microtubule arrays of uniform orientation with plus-ends facing the axon tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stone et al., 2008</xref>). However, kinesin-1 is a plus-end motor, and therefore can only slide microtubules with their minus-ends leading and plus-ends trailing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is inconsistent with the final orientation of microtubules in mature axons. To address this apparent contradiction, we asked two questions: First, are microtubules indeed pushed with their minus-ends out at the initial stages of axon outgrowth, as would be expected if they are pushed by kinesin-1? Second, if this is the case, how are microtubules with the ‘wrong’ orientation replaced by microtubules with normal (plus-end-out) orientation in mature axons? To address these questions, we imaged and tracked markers of microtubule plus-ends and minus-ends in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons and S2 cells at different stages of process growth. Our results showed that, at the initial stages of neurite formation, microtubules have mixed polarity with minus-ends being pushed against the plasma membrane; later, cytoplasmic dynein, attached to the actin cortex, removes minus-end-out microtubules to the cell body, creating microtubule arrays with uniform plus-end-out orientation. We speculate that regulation of dynein’s microtubule sorting activity could explain the differences in microtubule orientation between axons and dendrites.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10140.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microtubule minus-ends push the plasma membrane during the initial stages of neurite outgrowth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of microtubule-microtubule sliding driven by kinesin-1.

S2 cells provide a good model system to explore the mechanism of process formation because they canbe induced to form cellular processes when the integrity of the actin filament network is impaired by treatment with either Cytochalasin D or Latrunculin B (LatB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2013a</xref>). In addition, this system enables us to efficiently study the mechanisms of process formation by knocking down candidate proteins with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogers and Rogers, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To study microtubule minus-end distribution in live cells, we ectopically expressed a fluorescently tagged microtubule minus-end binding protein called calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein (CAMSAP), also known as Patronin or Nezha. CAMSAP proteins bind to microtubule minus-ends and stabilize them against depolymerization, making them the perfect candidate to label microtubule minus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). We initially performed experiments with GFP-tagged Patronin, the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> member of CAMSAP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), but its expression level in S2 cells was very low and GFP signal was not robustly found on microtubules (data no shown). On the other hand, its mammalian ortholog CAMSAP3 tagged with GFP expressed at consistently higher levels and reliably decorated microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>First, we wanted to test whether GFP-CAMSAP3 decorates only one end of microtubules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. Because the microtubule network is normally too dense to identify both ends of microtubules, we induced the formation of short microtubules in cells by partial depolymerization with 25 µM Vinblastine for 1 hr. Examination of these short microtubule fragments demonstrated that only one end of each microtubule contained a GFP-CAMSAP3 patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In untreated S2 cells, spontaneous growth and shrinkage events associated with the dynamic instability of microtubule plus-ends were not seen in microtubule ends decorated by GFP-CAMSAP3, suggesting that GFP-CAMSAP3 labels microtubule minus-ends in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Furthermore, EB1-GFP and mCherry-CAMSAP3 never colocalized when expressed in the same cell, further confirming the minus-end localization of CAMSAP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

We found that, like in S2 cells, the growing neurites contained GFP-CAMSAP3 dots at the tips of neurites, and localization of the dots to the tips precisely correlated with neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). All together, these data show that at least a fraction of microtubules in growing neurites have the ‘wrong’ orientation (minus-end-out). Localization of microtubule minus-end(s) at the neurite tip correlates with neurite outgrowth, consistent with kinesin-1 pushing the minus-ends of microtubules against the plasma membrane driving the initial outgrowth.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10140-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10140.009</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Microtubule minus-ends push the plasma membrane in growing neurites of young cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons.</title><p>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>.

For these experiments, we used a dynein recruitment tool developed by the Akhmanova and Hoogenraad labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>), which contains the dynein activator Bicaudal D (BicD) fused to a FRB domain (FRB-GFP-BicD). The FRB-BicD-dynein complex can then be recruited to any region of interest by coexpression of a targeting protein coupled to a FKBP domain. This FKBP domain chemically dimerizes with the FRB domain in the presence of rapalog (a cell-permeable small molecule analog of rapamycin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clackson et al., 1998</xref>). To confirm that the FRB-FKBP dimerization system for dynein recruitment works in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, we first coexpressed a GFP construct fused to FRB (FRB-GFP) and the peroxisome membrane-targeting signal peptide coupled to the red fluorescent protein (PEX3-RFP-FKBP). In the absence of rapalog, the GFP signal appeared soluble in the cytoplasm. The addition of rapalog recruited FRB-GFP to peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next used this system to directly recruit dynein to the plasma membrane. For membrane targeting, we fused the transmembrane domain of GAP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heim and Griesbeck, 2004</xref>) with FKBP and coexpressed this construct with FRB-GFP-BicD in S2 cells. To visualize the recruitment of BicD to the membrane in these cells, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to image the GFP signal before and after addition of rapalog. Quantification showed that addition of rapalog significantly increased the intensity of the GFP fluorescence due to recruitment of cytoplasmic BicD to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next tested if direct recruitment of dynein to the membrane using rapalog could drive microtubule sorting in the absence of cortical actin. To test this hypothesis, mCherry-CAMSAP3 was used to track the localization of microtubule minus-ends. In the absence of rapalog, CAMSAP3 accumulated in the processes of S2 cells treated with 10 µM LatB. Time-lapse imaging before addition of the drug revealed that these CAMSAP3 clusters, marking positions of minus-ends, were either static or pushing against the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). However, when the BicD-dynein complex was recruited to the membrane by addition of rapalog, CAMSAP3-labeled microtubule minus-ends robustly moved away from the tip, toward the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, top panels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>).

Here, we tracked both plus-ends and minus-ends of microtubules in the axons of cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons at different stages of development. Our data showed that the axonal microtubule network undergoes dramatic reorganization during development. At early stages of neurite formation, the minus-ends of sliding microtubules are pushed against the plasma membrane, generating the forces that drive initial neurite outgrowth. At this stage, growing neurites contain microtubule arrays of mixed orientation. However, later in development, axonal microtubule arrays are reorganized from mixed to uniform (plus-end-out) orientation, consistent with the well established microtubule organization described in mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 1988</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stone et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that cortical dynein drives this transition by sliding and expelling minus-end-out microtubules from the axon toward the cell body.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kinesin-1 pushes the minus-ends of microtubules against the plasma membrane to initiate neurite formation</title><p>We previously demonstrated that initial neurite formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons requires microtubule-microtubule sliding driven by kinesin-1. Knockdown of kinesin-1 in primary neurons impairs the motility of interphase microtubules and causes neurons to fail to develop axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2013b</xref>). This was surprising because kinesin-1 is a plus-end microtubule motor and thus can only slide microtubules with minus-ends leading and plus-ends trailing. Furthermore, symmetry considerations dictate that kinesin slides antiparallel microtubules against each other; if microtubules are oriented parallel to each other kinesin would bundle rather than slide them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both of these considerations appear to contradict established literature about microtubule polarity in axons.</p><p>In this work, we performed two experiments that further support the idea that kinesin-1’s sliding activity drives the initial stages of neurite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2013b</xref>). First, nascent growing neurites contain microtubule arrays with mixed polarity. As mentioned above, this antiparallel orientation is required for microtubule sliding by kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, microtubule minus-ends are pushed against the plasma membrane at the tips of processes, generating the force for neurite outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of other kinesins in axon formation</title><p>Recent experimental data revealed that ‘mitotic’ kinesins, such as kinesin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadar et al., 2012</xref>) and kinesin-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">del Castillo et al., 2015</xref>), play an important role in the regulation of axon outgrowth. The well established function of these mitotic motors is to reorganize and stabilize the mitotic spindle to facilitate chromosome segregation. These motors accumulate in the spindle midzone where antiparallel microtubules coming from opposite poles overlap. Our work shows that developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons, like the spindle midzone, are filled with antiparallel microtubule arrays. This microtubule configuration suggests that the same mechanisms controlling the mitotic spindle could be used to regulate axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baas, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, ‘mitotic kinesins’ control neurite outgrowth both in mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> systems, which supports the idea that the molecular players that drive axon initiation and outgrowth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be conserved across species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cortical dynein sorts microtubules in developing axons</title><p>Our data show that minus-end-out microtubules are consistently observed at the early stages of neurite formation, while at later stages the vast majority of microtubules in axons have their plus-ends out, as have been reported in multiple published papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stone et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, neurons must activate an additional sorting mechanism that eliminates these ‘wrong’ polarity microtubules from axons. Previous studies reported that dynein and dynein-associated proteins are required for correct microtubule orientation in axons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> da sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>). Our results using cultured neurons are in full agreement with these studies, as dynein knockdown caused mixed microtubule polarity in axons. Interestingly, several studies have linked dynein-mediated microtubule reorganization to actin, both in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mazel et al., 2014</xref>) and in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>). In this study, we showed that depolymerization of actin filaments (including cortical actin) using high concentrations of LatB causes the same defects in microtubule orientation as dynein knockdown. Recovery of cortical actin after drug washout results in efficient dynein-driven removal of minus-end-out microtubules from the tips of processes. Furthermore, the requirement for actin can be efficiently bypassed by direct recruitment of the dynein machinery directly to the plasma membrane. Therefore, we propose that microtubule sorting depends on the activity of cytoplasmic dynein attached to the cortical actin filament meshwork. However, as we did not get complete recovery of the wild type distribution of microtubules in our LatB washout or dynein-membrane recruitment experiments, it is likely that additional proteins that link actin and microtubule pathways in the neuron are involved in microtubule organization; one good candidate is the well characterized actin-microtubule crosslinking protein Short stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional roles of cortical dynein for microtubule organization in axons</title><p>In addition to the sorting activity described in this work, other groups have observed that dynein activity is required for axon elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Baas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grabham et al., 2007</xref>). A more recent study by Miller et al. has reported that dynein generates forces that push the cytoskeletal meshwork forward during axonal elongation in cultured chick sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roossien et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with their data, we predict that cortical dynein can promote axon outgrowth after the initial stages of neurite outgrowth, when microtubules are sorted into a plus-end-out orientation. Because the direction of dynein-powered forces is dictated by the intrinsic orientation of microtubules, microtubules with minus-end-out are redirected toward the cell body, whereas plus-end-out microtubules are transported toward the tip of the axon. Therefore, dynein-driven microtubule transport can not only remove microtubules with the wrong orientation (minus-end-out) but also push microtubules of the right orientation (plus-end-out) toward the axon tip.</p><p>In addition to the role of dynein in developing neurons, dynein may play an important role in axonal microtubule maintenance. Microtubule polymers, like other protein structures, require subunit turnover to maintain their integrity. It has been proposed that several microtubule severing proteins are able to fragment microtubules into short pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNally and Vale, 1993</xref>). In this scenario, short microtubule seeds are generated which may be reoriented by diffusion forces in either direction (plus-end-in or plus-end-out) with equal probability. Indeed, active bidirectional transport of short microtubule fragments in the axons has been described in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The authors proposed that the transport of these short microtubule fragments is driven by dynein. Our prediction is that microtubule fragments transported in the retrograde direction should be oriented with plus-ends toward the cell body while anterogradely transported fragments should have the opposite orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A unified model of microtubule sliding and axon formation</title><p>It has been shown in many different model systems that kinesin-1 and dynein are the two major motors involved in reorganizing cytoplasmic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Straube et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mazel et al., 2014</xref>). Both motors play an important role in axon formation. However, the contribution of each motor likely differs at different developing stages (see model described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In spherically shaped undifferentiated cells, kinesin-1 motors slide antiparallel microtubules perpendicularly to the plasma membrane with their minus-end-leading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This sliding generates the force that breaks the symmetry of the cell and induces a deformation of the plasma membrane to initiate neurite outgrowth. During this stage, the role of cortical dynein is probably limited by steric restrictions. Cortical dynein can only slide microtubules tangential to the plasma membrane, and therefore dynein-mediated movement cannot deform the membrane and initiate outgrowth. At the next stage, nascent neurites contain antiparallel microtubule arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This configuration allows kinesin-1 to continue to drive antiparallel microtubule sliding. Once the processes start to form, the new geometry will allow cortical dynein to contribute to both microtubule organization and neurite outgrowth. Cortical dynein in the neurite cortex can only slide microtubules parallel to the axis of the process. This contribution of cortical dynein likely increases as the processes grow longer (engaging more cortical dynein molecules) and thinner (allowing dynein to reach a larger fraction of microtubules in the processes).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10140.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model of microtubule sliding and axon formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kinesin-1 induced sliding of antiparallel microtubules initiates formation of processes.

Microtubules with minus-end-out (microtubule of the ‘wrong’ polarity) will be moved by dynein toward the cell body, therefore eliminating them from the processes. At the same time, dynein can interact with and push plus-end-out microtubules moving them toward axon tips, and thus contributing to the forces that drive axonal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As a result of this continuous sorting activity of dynein, developed axons contain uniform microtubule arrays with their plus-end distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Under this new microtubule configuration, kinesin-1 contributes little to microtubule sliding (as antiparallel microtubule arrays are needed for kinesin to engage in sliding), but instead favors its bundling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). In addition to its contribution to neurite outgrowth, cortical dynein may have an important role in axon maintenance, removing nascent microtubules of wrong orientation that may appear in the axon either due to new microtubule polymerization or due to the severing of pre-existing microtubules. Because axons and dendrites are common morphologic features observed in neurons from ancestral metazoans to mammals, we postulate that the same molecular mechanism presented here for axon formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons is conserved in other organisms. Of course, this ‘microtubule-centric’ model does not describe all the mechanisms involved in axon formation, and clearly leaves out the critical question of axon guidance, but it provides clear roles for multiple microtubule motors involved in axon formation and microtubule organization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Cortical dynein may dictate neurite identity</title><p>Microtubule orientation differs between axons and dendrites. While axons are filled with uniformly oriented microtubules with plus-end-out, dendrites contain either microtubules of mixed orientation (mammalian neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baas et al., 1988</xref>) or a majority of microtubules minus-end-out (<italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that neurons selectively employ cortical dynein to dictate which of the nascent neurites will become the future axon. It is likely that the microtubule sliding activity or efficiency of dynein recruitment may be downregulated in dendrites. This hypothesis is in agreement with a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> da sensory neurons showing that disruption of NudE, a dynein cofactor, impairs microtubule orientation in axons, without affecting the orientation of dendritic microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2015</xref>).

Those observations support the idea that the activity of cortical dynein is downregulated in dendrites, thus preserving the initial minus-end-out orientation of microtubules created by kinesin. Future experiments are required to unravel how dynein interacts with cortical actin and how dynein’s microtubule-sorting activity is regulated in neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>To visualize microtubule minus-ends in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell system, a cDNA encoding mouse CAMSAP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>) was cloned into the pMT-GFP and pMT-mCherry backbones by NotI-AgeI restriction enzyme sites to generate GFP-CAMSAP3 and mCherry-CAMSAP3.

Statistical significance for CAMSAP3 populations was determined using two-tailed Fischer’s test with a confidence interval of 95%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of EB1 comets</title><p>The orientations of EB1 comets both in cultured neurons and S2 cells were quantified using MATLAB and ImageJ. EB1 comets were tracked using the plus-end tracking algorithm in u-track 2.0, developed by Gaudenz Danuser’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matov et al., 2010</xref>). The x-y positions of EB1 comets were extracted and loaded into a custom ImageJ plugin. This semi-automated plugin defined the center of cells and determined the angle of each comet’s trajectory as compared with the cell center. For curved and serpentine axons, trajectories were subdivided into linear segments before ImageJ analysis to ensure that comet orientation was correctly identified. Comet trajectories with an angle &gt;290° or &lt;70° compared with the cell center were defined as plus-end-out. Comet trajectories with an angle &gt;110 and &lt;250 degrees were defined as plus-end-in. Only comets contained in processes were included in the analysis. To create kymographs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and Figure 2A</xref> the Reslice plugin developed in FIJI was used. Statistical significance for EB1 comets was determined using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test with a confidence interval of 95%. This test analysis compares the distributions of two unmatched groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Antibodies for Western blot</title><p>For Western blot analysis of S2 cell extracts, the following primary antibodies were used: anti-DHC monoclonal antibody 2C11-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharp et al., 2000</xref>) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against KHC head domain provided by A. Minin (Institute of Protein Research, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Recruitment experiments</title><p>The formation of the FRB-FKBP complex in all recruitment experiments was induced by addition of 1 µM rapalog (final concentration) (A/C Heterodimerizer, Clontech) to the culture medium. To test the efficiency of recruitment experiments, <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were transiently cotransfected either with plasmids encoding FRB-GFP and PEX3-mRFP-FKBP or FRB-GFP-BicD and GAP43-FKBP. Cells were imaged before and 30 min after addition of rapalog to the medium. To directly recruit endogenous dynein to the membrane, S2 cells were cotransfected with plasmids codifying GAP43-FKBP, FRB-GFP-BicD and mCherry-CAMSAP3 in the following ratio (3:1:1). Cells were plated with 10 µM LatB for 2 hr to allow the accumulation of microtubule minus-ends at process tips. Distribution of mCherry-CAMSAP3 was tracked by time-lapse imaging before and after addition of the drug (to the final concentration of 1 µM).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Bloomington Stock Center (NIH P40OD018537) for fly stocks, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Research Center (NIH 2P40OD010949-10A1), S Rogers (UNC Chapel Hill), A Akhmanova and C Hoogenraad (both from Department of Biology, Utrecht University) for plasmids.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a guest Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find that this interesting study provides direct support for sequential roles of kinesin-1 and dynein in extending axons with the typical plus-ends-out microtubule orientation.</p><p>Principal conclusions:</p><p>1) Kinesin-1 drives neurite/process extension by pushing minus-end-out microtubules against the cell membrane. This is supported by live cell imaging using a GFP-CAMSAP3 as a marker for microtubule minus ends in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons and S2 cells.</p><p>2) After the initial extension phase, dynein at the cell cortex then removes the minus-end-out microtubules by sliding them back into the cell body, while the plus-end-out microtubules remain.</p><p>3) An interaction with the actin network recruits dynein to the cell cortex.</p><p>Although previous work has suggested a role for dynein in generating microtubule orientation in neurons, this study tests that hypothesis directly, as well as expanding on the mechanism by which kinesin-1 drives process extension.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. Some of the required revisions will require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques.</p><p>1) The study rests on the use of GFP-CAMSAP3 as a marker for microtubule minus ends, but the evidence for this conclusion needs to be strengthened substantially. Imaging EB1-GFP during the early stages of process extension would be a simple assay to test whether CAMSAP3 is indeed present only on minus ends. The use of EB1-GFP would also demonstrate that plus-end-out microtubules do not drive process extension: a claim in the manuscript for which there is no direct proof at the moment. Scoring of microtubule orientation versus process growth is also needed, rather than showing a single example.</p><p>2) Related to point 1, some of the data seems to directly contradict the conclusions of the paper, and this needs to be clarified. For example, quantitation of EB1 orientation reveals that cells depleted of DHC have a 50:50 mix of microtubule polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,B</xref>), and yet CAMSAP3 is strongly accumulated at process tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C,D</xref>).

Some of the required revisions will require further experimentation within the framework of the presented studies and techniques. 1) The study rests on the use of GFP-CAMSAP3 as a marker for microtubule minus ends, but the evidence for this conclusion needs to be strengthened substantially. Imaging EB1-GFP during the early stages of process extension would be a simple assay to test whether CAMSAP3 is indeed present only on minus ends. The use of EB1-GFP would also demonstrate that plus-end-out microtubules do not drive process extension: a claim in the manuscript for which there is no direct proof at the moment. Scoring of microtubule orientation versus process growth is also needed, rather than showing a single example.</italic> </p><p>The location of proteins of the CAMSAP family on microtubules has been extensively characterized in the last few years in several systems (Tanaka et al., 2012; Hendershott and Vale, 2014; Jiang et al., 2014; Yau et al., 2014). These publications have demonstrated that CAMSAPs label minus-ends of microtubules exclusively and play an important physiological role in minus-end stabilization. Our data show that ectopically expressed mammalian CAMSAP3 tagged with GFP labeled only one end of microtubules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, and live imaging of these cells demonstrated that labeled ends were stable, in agreement with the published data.</p><p>To further validate our conclusion that CAMSAP3 labels only minus-ends in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as requested by the reviewers, we performed an additional experiment in S2 cells. We coexpressed EB1-GFP and mCherry-CAMSAP3 (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref> and new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Colocalization of EB1 comets and CAMSAP3 signal was never observed, and as can be seen in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>, EB1 and CAMSAP3 label opposite ends of the same microtubule. This further validates the use of CAMSAP3 as a minus-end marker.</p><p>The reviewers pointed out the potential role of microtubule plus-ends in process formation. This is an important question that we did not fully address in our original manuscript. To explore this possibility, we performed new experiments to test whether EB1 comets localize at the tips of growing processes in S2 cells. Briefly, in actively growing processes of S2 cells, we simultaneously imaged microtubule plus-ends with EB1-GFP and process tips outlined with a plasma membrane dye. We have shown a representative example of this experiment in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Note that during the initial outgrowth of processes, EB1 does not colocalize with process tips. Furthermore, as the reviewers requested, we quantified the colocalization of plus- or minus-end markers with the tips of growing processes seen with a membrane dye (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We found that minus-ends colocalized with process tips during 94% of outgrowth events (n=55 processes). However, plus-ends only localized to the tips of processes during 33% of outgrowth events (n=51 processes). Based on this data, we believe that microtubule minus-ends play the critical role in the early stages of outgrowth, but it is possible that plus ends have some contribution to the growth, especially at the later stages (subsection “Microtubule minus-ends push neurite tips at the initial stages of process formation”, fifth paragraph and subsection “Additional roles of cortical dynein for microtubule organization in axons“, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Related to point 1, some of the data seems to directly contradict the conclusions of the paper, and this needs to be clarified. For example, quantitation of EB1 orientation reveals that cells depleted of DHC have a 50:50 mix of microtubule polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,B</xref>), and yet CAMSAP3 is strongly accumulated at process tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C,D</xref>). Is this because of timing?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers pointed out an apparent contradiction between data obtained with EB1 and CAMSAP3 markers in DHC RNAi processes: EB1 comets demonstrate a mixed polarity of microtubules in processes, while process tips have an accumulation of minus ends. In fact, we see no contradiction here, as the cartoon (left) and the confocal image (right) (S2 cell/GFP-CAMSAP3) below help to explain. Accumulation of minus ends at process tips only means that the most distal microtubules have their minus-end at the tips; these microtubules are deposited to the tip by kinesin-driven sliding. However, microtubules located closer to the cell body can (and do) have mixed polarity. The location of minus ends in the shafts of the processes may not be obvious in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 2H and 3E</xref> because the signal from individual GFP-CAMSAP3 minus ends within these regions is much dimmer that of the many clustered minus-ends at the tip. In fact, adjustment of contrast of the boxed area in the right panel clearly shows multiple GFP-CAMSAP3 speckles in the shaft (bottom right panel), as predicted by the cartoon on the left. To avoid readers’ confusion, we have clarified this point in the text (subsection “Dynein sorts microtubules in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons“, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows all microtubules growing +ends out, but 2G (control) shows minus ends at the process tips.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) was confusing for the reader. This confusion might have arisen because the original figure depicted the orientation of comets from the first frame; we did not show the direction of new comets that originated later in the sequence. Quantification of all EB1 comets throughout a time series for each cell revealed that processes in S2 cells contained around 80% plus-end-out and 20% plus-end-in comets (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Based on these results, it is expected that a small fraction of microtubule minus-ends might be present at the tips of processes. We modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> by adding new arrows to show directions of comets initiated later in the sequence. All comets from this specific example can be easily seen and tracked in our <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) A major conclusion of the work is that cortical dynein drives sliding of the 'wrong' orientation microtubules out of older processes, but currently there is limited direct evidence for that. For example, although we see accumulation of GFP-CAMSAP3 in S2 cells depleted of DHC, only EB1-GFP orientation (not CAMSAP3) in older neurons is shown. Is the same striking phenotype observed there? Movies showing dynein-driven sliding in older axons should be provided.</italic> </p><p>We took this reviewer’s comment very seriously and generated a fly expressing GFP-CAMSAP3 and DHC shRNA driven by the GAL4 promoter. These flies were crossed with elav&gt;Gal4 to induce expression of both transgenes in neurons. The third instar larvae (<italic>elav&gt;GFP-CAMSAP3 + DHCi</italic>) developed the same survival and locomotion defects than were observed in elav&gt;DHC RNAi alone, indicating that the DHC shRNA efficiently depleted DHC even when Gal4 drove GFP-CAMSAP3 and DHC shRNA simultaneously. We incorporated a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> to show the localization of GFP-CAMSAP3 in <italic>elav&gt;GFP-CAMSAP3 and elav&gt;GFP-CAMSAP3 + DHCi</italic>. Note that depletion of DHC induced accumulation of GFP-CAMSAP3 in the tips of neurites, just as it did after DHC depletion in S2 cell processes, directly answering the reviewer’s question.</p><p>To show dynein-driven sliding in axons, we first treated neurons with a high concentration of LatB (10 µM) for 48 hr. This induced accumulation of GFP-CAMSAP3 in neurite tips (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel). To activate microtubule-microtubule sorting, we washed out LatB and followed the localization of the CAMSAP3 signal and membrane tip. As we show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (right panels) LatB washout caused the removal of minus-ends from neurite tips without affecting the length of the axon. We have to point out, however, that the minus-end clusters do not get expelled all the way to the cell body, most likely because at this stage, axons contain highly bundled minus-end-out microtubules. See the new data in subsection “Dynein must be recruited to the actin cortex to sort microtubules”, second paragraph.</p><p><italic>In addition, the data showing that rapalog-stimulated recruitment of dynein to the membrane drives reorientation of microtubules needs strengthening, since the cell process shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref> appears to be retracting. Can better proof of sliding be shown? Would photoactivation of CAMSAP3 be helpful? Furthermore, this important experiment needs to be quantitated.</italic> </p><p>To address this important point, we repeated and improved these experiments (see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). The new data show a better example of dynein sorting activity after addition of rapalog and no process retraction. Furthermore, we added a new experimental condition (DHC RNAi), which demonstrates that dynein depletion prevents the removal of minus-end-out microtubules after addition of rapalog. As reviewers requested, we quantified the removal of minus-end clusters from the tips after the addition of rapalog. The quantification shows that, in control cells, minus-end clusters were removed from about 70% of tips after addition of rapalog, while in DHC RNAi-treated cells, removal was observed in only 3% (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Based on the effects of actin depolymerization, the authors conclude that dynein is recruited to the cell membrane/cortex via interaction with actin. This is quite different to the previously reported mechanisms of dynein association with the plasma membrane. It also ignores possible contributions of proteins that might link actin and microtubules, such as Shot. In the absence of any direct proof, this claim should be toned down.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer’s comment. Our results experimentally demonstrate that cortical dynein is involved in sorting microtubules of <italic>Drosophila</italic> processes. Our experiments place dynein activity downstream of actin in the microtubule organization pathway. However, at this moment it is unknown whether dynein interacts with actin directly or through adaptors (as, for example, has been extensively demonstrated in case of spindle orientation in dividing cells). Furthermore, as correctly pointed out by the reviewer, actin can be involved in microtubule organization via additional mechanisms (such as actin-microtubule cross-linker short stop). Therefore, we have toned down the direct interaction hypothesis in the manuscript. In addition, we mentioned in the Discussion section, the potential contribution of proteins known to link microtubules (subsection “Cortical dynein sorts microtubules in developing axons”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
