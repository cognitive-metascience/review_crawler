characterized by striking heterogeneity across individuals. Hippocampal pattern completion is a fundamental process supporting episodic memory. Yet, the degree to which this mechanism is impaired with age, and contributes to variability in episodic memory, remains unclear. We combine univariate and multivariate analyses of fMRI data from a large cohort of cognitively normal older adults (N=100) to measure hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement during retrieval of trial-unique associations. Trial-wise analyses revealed that (a) hippocampal activity scaled with reinstatement strength, (b) cortical reinstatement partially mediated the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative retrieval, (c) older age weakened cortical reinstatement and its relationship to memory behaviour. Moreover, individual differences in the strength of hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement explained unique variance in performance across multiple assays of episodic memory. These results indicate that fMRI indices of hippocampal pattern completion explain within- and across-individual memory variability in older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>episodic memory</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>cortical reinstatement</kwd><kwd>pattern completion</kwd><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG048076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Anthony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG058111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Anthony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG058859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mormino</surname><given-names>Elizabeth C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Center for Precision Health and Integrated Diagnostics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHIND</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutt</surname><given-names>Brian K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mormino</surname><given-names>Elizabeth C</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Anthony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Wu Tsai Neuroscience Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mormino</surname><given-names>Elizabeth C</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Anthony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The strength of pattern completion during memory retrieval, indexed by hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement, explains within- and across-individual variability in episodic memory in older adults.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Episodic memory – in particular the ability to form and retrieve associations between multiple event elements that comprise past experiences – declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spencer and Raz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rönnlund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Old and Naveh-Benjamin, 2008</xref>). Retrieval of an episodic memory relies critically on hippocampal-dependent pattern completion, which entails reactivation of a stored memory trace by the hippocampus in response to a partial cue, leading to replay of cortical activity patterns that were present at the time of memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Staresina et al., 2019</xref>). Given observed links between in vivo measures of pattern completion and episodic remembering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>), and evidence of altered hippocampal function with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lister and Barnes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leal and Yassa, 2013</xref>), changes in hippocampal pattern completion may play an important role in explaining age-related impairments in episodic memory. While a leading hypothesis, the degree to which the integrity of pattern completion can explain (a) trial-to-trial differences in episodic remembering within older adults and (b) differences in memory performance between older individuals remain underspecified.</p><p>Functional MRI (fMRI) studies in younger adults suggest that hippocampal pattern completion is associated with at least two key neural markers: (a) an increase in hippocampal univariate activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eldridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobbins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yonelinas et al., 2005</xref>) and (b) cortical reinstatement of content-specific activity patterns present during encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nyberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wheeler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kahn et al., 2004</xref>). Multivariate pattern analyses — machine learning classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norman et al., 2006</xref>) and pattern similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>) — reveal evidence for cortical reinstatement of categorical event features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Polyn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson and Rugg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>) and event-specific details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Staresina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ritchey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</xref>) during successful recollection. Moreover, hippocampal and cortical metrics of pattern completion covary, such that trial-wise fluctuations in hippocampal univariate retrieval activity are related to the strength of cortical reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Staresina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ritchey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>), and both hippocampal activity and reinstatement strength are related to associative retrieval performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gagnon et al., 2019</xref>). These findings support models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>) positing that cortical reinstatement depends, in part, on hippocampal processes, and contributes to remembering.</p><p>Initial data bearing on age-related changes in hippocampal pattern completion are mixed. Studies comparing hippocampal activity during episodic retrieval in older and younger adults have revealed age-related reductions in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabeza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennis et al., 2008</xref>) and age-invariant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trelle et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, while some have identified reduced category-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonough et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulrahman et al., 2017</xref>) and event-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">St-Laurent et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Folville et al., 2020</xref>) cortical reinstatement in older relative to younger adults, others observed age-invariant category-level reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) or that age-related differences in reinstatement strength are eliminated after accounting for the strength of category representations during encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Although extant studies have yielded important initial insights, the absence of trial-wise analyses relating hippocampal activity to cortical reinstatement, or relating each of these neural measures to memory behaviour, prevents clear conclusions regarding the degree to which hippocampal pattern completion processes are impacted with age. Aging may affect one or both of these neural measures, and/or may disrupt the predicted relationships between these neural variables and behaviour (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>). The first aim of the present study is to quantify trial-wise fluctuations in hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement in older adults, and examine how these measures relate to one another, as well as how these measures relate to episodic remembering of trial-unique associative content.</p><p>Critically, in addition to varying within individuals, the degree to which pattern completion processes are disrupted among older adults may vary across individuals. Indeed, age-related memory decline is characterized by striking heterogeneity, with some individuals performing as well as younger adults and others demonstrating marked impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Chastelaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henson et al., 2016</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nyberg et al., 2012</xref> for review). Identifying the neural factors driving this variability is a clear emerging aim of cognitive aging research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nyberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>). However, due to modest sample sizes, extant studies typically lack sufficient power to examine individual differences in retrieval mechanisms among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dennis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDonough et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">St-Laurent et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulrahman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trelle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Folville et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, while recent work examining variability in hippocampal function has demonstrated relationships between hippocampal retrieval activity and associative memory performance in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Chastelaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr et al., 2017</xref>), the direction of this relationship differed across studies; to date, the relationship between individual differences in cortical reinstatement and memory performance remains unexplored. As such, the second aim of the present study is to examine whether hippocampal and cortical indices of pattern completion vary with age, and to assess the degree to which these measures explain individual differences in episodic memory performance — both as a function of age and independent of age.</p><p>To address these two aims, a large sample (N = 100) of cognitively normal older participants (60–82 years) from the Stanford Aging and Memory Study (SAMS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; Materials and methods) performed an associative memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) concurrent with high-resolution fMRI. Participants intentionally studied trial-unique word-picture pairs (concrete nouns paired with famous faces and famous places), and then had their memory for the word-picture associations probed. During retrieval scans, participants viewed a studied or novel word on each trial and indicated whether they (a) recollected the associate paired with the word, responding ‘face’ or ‘place’ accordingly (providing an index of associative memory), (b) recognized the word as ‘old’ but were unable to recall the associate (providing an index of item memory — putatively reflecting familiarity, non-criterial recollection, or a mix of the two), or (c) thought the word was ‘new’. Following scanning, participants were shown the studied words again and asked to recall the specific associate paired with each word, this time explicitly providing details of the specific image (providing an index of exemplar-specific recall).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental paradigm.</title><p>Concurrent with fMRI, participants intentionally encoded word-picture pairs and completed an associative cued recall test.

In addition, we measured activity in three subfields within the body of the hippocampus — dentate gyrus/CA3 (DG/CA3), CA1, and subiculum (SUB) — given prior work suggesting that aging may differentially affect individual hippocampal subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yassa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reagh et al., 2018</xref>) and models predicting differential subfield involvement in pattern completion, including a key role for subfield CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grande et al., 2019</xref>).

We provide novel evidence for unique contributions of hippocampal and cortical indices of pattern completion to a) trial-by-trial differences in episodic remembering in older adults, as well as b) age-related and age-independent individual differences in episodic memory performance. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory, as well as those driving variability in remembering across older adults.</p><p>The present analyses of trial-level brain-behaviour relationships significantly build on work in younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gagnon et al., 2019</xref>), demonstrating that trial-wise relationships (a) between hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement and (b) between each of these neural measures and memory behaviour are present later in the lifespan. While directionality is difficult to establish with fMRI, these results are consistent with models of episodic retrieval wherein hippocampal pattern completion, triggered by partial cues, drives reinstatement of event representations in the cortex, which supports episodic remembering and memory-guided decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). Further bolstering this interpretation, we demonstrate that (a) category-level cortical reinstatement partially mediates the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative retrieval success, and (b) the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative retrieval success was qualitatively strongest in DG/CA3, consistent with a key role of CA3 in initiating pattern-completion dependent retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Staresina et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the present results provide novel evidence for stability in the trial-wise relationship between hippocampal activity and (a) cortical reinstatement and (b) associative retrieval success, as neither relationship varied as a function of age.</p><p>Consistent with the observed trial-level relationship between hippocampal activity and associative retrieval success, we also demonstrate a positive relationship between the magnitude of hippocampal activity during associative hits and associative memory performance. Our findings complement and build on prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Chastelaine et al., 2016</xref>), as we demonstrate that this effect was observed across hippocampal subfields, including DG/CA3, and did not vary significantly as a function of age. These results are compatible with proposals that the relationship between hippocampal ‘recollection success’ effects and memory performance remains stable across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Chastelaine et al., 2016</xref>), as well as more broadly with proposals that preservation of hippocampal function is important for the maintenance of episodic memory in older adults over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Persson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pudas et al., 2013</xref>). We note, however, that a negative relationship between hippocampal retrieval activity and memory performance has also been observed in older adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reagh et al., 2018</xref>). Differences across studies may be related to (a) the paradigms and/or contrasts employed (e.g., associative recollection vs. lure discrimination), (b) image resolution (e.g., individual subfields vs. the whole hippocampus), or (c) the make-up of the study population (e.g., cognitively normal or cognitively impaired; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dickerson and Sperling, 2008</xref>). Additional well-powered studies of hippocampal retrieval dynamics in older adults are needed to assess the degree to which these variables alter the relationship between hippocampal activity and memory behaviour.</p><p>The present results also provide novel insights into the basis of mnemonic decisions in older adults. Specifically, we demonstrate that trial-wise indices of reinstatement strength — indexed using classifier-derived evidence and encoding-retrieval pattern similarity — were tightly linked to memory behaviour, including response accuracy and speed. This finding suggests that retrieval was not ‘all or none’, but likely graded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mickes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuhl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harlow and Yonelinas, 2016</xref>). Indeed, while participants were instructed during scanning to recollect the specific associate, correct category judgments (agnostic to correct exemplar-specific recall) could nonetheless be supported by retrieval of generic category information (e.g., a place), prototypical details (e.g., a bridge), specific exemplar details (e.g., the Golden Gate Bridge), or even retrieval of erroneous, but category consistent details (e.g., Niagara Falls). The category-level reinstatement effects observed here likely reflect some combination of these retrieval outcomes, as suggested by the strong correlation between post-scan exemplar-specific recall and within-scan associative <italic>d’</italic>, along with the observation that the proportion of specific exemplars recalled post-scan was generally lower than correct categorical judgements during scanning (though the former undoubtedly declined due to the longer retention interval and interference effects).</p><p>Beyond the strength of reinstatement, the present results cannot adjudicate the nature of the details recalled. For example, both category- and exemplar-specific associative hits could be supported by retrieval of semantic details (e.g., the Golden Gate Bridge), perceptual details (e.g., the bridge was red), or some combination (e.g., vividly recalling the image of the Golden Gate Bridge). One possibility, though speculative, is that VTC and ANG support representations of distinct types of event features (e.g., perceptual features in VTC and semantic and/or multimodal features in ANG). This possibility is in line with existing evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnici et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Favila et al., 2018</xref>) and also with the present observation that reinstatement strength in VTC and ANG made complementary contributions to retrieval success. Regardless of the precise nature of the details recalled, we demonstrate that, as in younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuhl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuhl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>), recovery of stronger mnemonic evidence was associated with greater accuracy and faster responses, and this was true for representations supported by VTC and ANG alike. This relationship may reflect reduced demands on post-retrieval monitoring and selection processes and/or greater confidence in the face of stronger mnemonic evidence. Interestingly, the strength of the trial-level relationship between VTC reinstatement strength and behaviour weakened with increased age. This could be related to age-related changes in decision criteria, retrieval monitoring ability, response strategies, or some combination of these factors. Future work is needed to explore the specific neurocognitive basis of this intriguing effect, which likely involves interactions between the medial temporal lobe and frontoparietal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Waskom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gagnon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although we observed robust group-level cortical reinstatement effects during associative hits, category-level reinstatement strength declined with age, and individual differences in category-level reinstatement strength explained significant variance in episodic memory. Importantly, the effect of age on reinstatement strength, and the relationship between reinstatement strength and memory performance, was observed after accounting for variance in encoding classifier performance, a putative assay of cortical differentiation (i.e., the ability to establish distinct neural patterns associated with different visual stimulus categories) during memory encoding. Prior work has demonstrated reductions in cortical differentiation in older relative to young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trelle et al., 2019</xref>), and evidence from both older and young adults suggests that cortical differentiation at encoding can impact reinstatement strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>) and memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koen et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we found that encoding classifier strength was a strong predictor of category-level reinstatement strength in the present sample. Critically, by controlling for encoding strength in the current analyses, the present results indicate that the observed variance in reinstatement strength, and its relation to memory performance, does not simply reflect downstream effects of cortical differentiation. Instead, variance in reinstatement strength likely also provides information about the precision with which event representations are retrieved in older adults. These data therefore provide neuroimaging evidence in support of existing proposals that age-related episodic memory decline is driven, in part, by a loss of specificity or precision in mnemonic representations, a possibility that has been well-supported by behavioural evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo and Craik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Trelle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Korkki et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, while cortical reinstatement is a putative read-out of pattern completion, and therefore relies critically on the hippocampus – a possibility supported by the present data – the hippocampal and cortical measures of pattern completion defined here explained unique variance in memory performance, both at the trial level and across individuals. Indeed, these measures together explained nearly three times as much variance in exemplar-specific associative recall as age alone. One possibility is that hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement strength index distinct aspects of recollection: retrieval success vs. retrieval precision, respectively (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harlow and Yonelinas, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richter et al., 2016</xref>). That is, whereas increases in hippocampal activity may signal recollection of some event details, this signal alone may not indicate the fidelity or precision with which the event is recollected. Conversely, reinstatement strength may provide more information about the contents of recollection, including the specificity or precision of mnemonic representations (e.g., recall of generic as opposed to exemplar-specific details), and perhaps even the nature of the details recollected (i.e., perceptual vs semantic). An alternative, but not mutually exclusive possibility, is that representations reinstated in cortex may be differentially affected by top-down goal states, post-retrieval monitoring, selection and/or decision processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuhl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Favila et al., 2018</xref>), which may contribute unique variance in memory performance beyond that explained by hippocampal-initiated event replay. Future work is needed to examine whether the unique variance explained by cortical reinstatement relates to frontoparietal control and decision processes in older adults.</p><p>Indeed, it is important to note that variability in episodic remembering, and indeed variability in the strength of the present pattern completion metrics, is likely influenced by a number of variables, only some of which are measured here. For example, aging may affect other processes at retrieval, including elaboration of retrieval cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morcom and Rugg, 2004</xref>) and post-retrieval monitoring and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trelle et al., 2019</xref>), as well as factors at encoding, including the differentiation of stimulus representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trelle et al., 2019</xref>), goal-directed or sustained attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hultsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geerligs et al., 2014</xref>), and elaborative or ‘strategic’ encoding processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trelle et al., 2015</xref>). These variables could vary both within individuals (i.e., across trials), as well as between individuals (e.g., trait level differences). The manner in which these variables impact pattern completion processes at retrieval, or make independent contributions to episodic remembering in older adults, is an important direction for future work. Nevertheless, the present results provide compelling initial evidence that (a) hippocampal and cortical indices of pattern completion play a central role in determining whether individual events will be remembered or forgotten, (b) that predicted relationships between hippocampal activity, reinstatement strength, and associative memory retrieval can be observed even late in the lifespan, and (c) and that these neural metrics explain unique variance in memory performance across individuals.</p><p>Hippocampal and cortical indices of pattern completion not only explained variance in our primary associative memory measures, but also in delayed recall performance on standardized neuropsychological tests — among the most widely used assays of episodic memory in the study of aging and disease. The relationship between these measures, collected during separate testing sessions, suggests that the neural indices derived from task-based fMRI are tapping into stable individual differences, and may represent a sensitive biomarker of hippocampal and cortical function. Critically, we also demonstrate that these neural and neuropsychological test measures explained unique variance in associative memory, together accounting for 50% of the variance in exemplar-specific recall across individuals. This not only indicates that the present neural indices provide information that cannot be garnered from paper and pencil tests alone, but also suggests that we can combine these neural metrics with existing measurement tools to build more accurate models to explain individual differences in memory performance in older adults. An important direction for future work is to assess whether combining task-related neural measures, such as those identified here, with other known biomarkers of brain health and disease risk (e.g., in vivo measures of amyloid and tau accumulation, hippocampal volume, white matter integrity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jack et al., 2018</xref>) can further increase sensitivity for explaining individual differences in memory performance, as well as predicting future disease risk and memory decline prior to the emergence of clinical impairment.</p><p>Taken together, the present results significantly advance our understanding of fundamental retrieval processes supporting episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults. By exploring how neural indices of pattern completion vary — both across trials and across individuals — these findings demonstrate that hippocampal activity and cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval provide a partial account for why and when older adults remember, and they predict which older adults will perform better than others across multiple widely adopted assays of episodic memory. They also suggest that some neural indices of pattern completion may be affected by age to a greater degree than others, though we note that both the presence and absence of age effects must be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design, and should be confirmed in the context of longitudinal studies. Moreover, we note that because the current sample is cognitively healthy, future work is needed to determine if similar patterns of results are observed across qualitatively different cohorts of older adults, particularly those in which subjective or mild cognitive decline is already apparent. Nevertheless, our findings underscore the striking heterogeneity in brain and behaviour, even among cognitively normal older adults, and lend support to the hypothesis that this high within-group variance likely contributes to the wealth of mixed findings in the literature, particularly for traditional group-level comparisons in the context of small-to-moderate sample sizes. Collectively, our findings illustrate how an individual differences approach can advance understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying variability in episodic memory in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred and five cognitively healthy older adults (aged 60–82 years; 65 female) participated as part of the Stanford Aging and Memory Study.

To ensure attention to the pairs, participants were instructed to indicate via button press whether they were able to successfully form an association between items in the pair. Following each encoding block, participants performed a retrieval task that probed item recognition and associative recollection. In each block, 24 target words were interspersed with 6 novel (foil) words; participants made a 4-way memory decision for each word. Specifically, if they recognized the word and recollected the associated image, they responded either ‘Face’ or ‘Place’ to indicate the category of the remembered image; if they recognized the word but could not recollect sufficient details to categorize the associated image, they responded ‘Old’; if they did not recognize the word as studied, they responded ‘New’. Responses were made via right-handed button presses, with four different finger assignments to the response options counterbalanced across participants.

After the MR scan session, a final overt cued-recall test was conducted outside the scanner to evaluate the degree to which participants were able to recollect the specific face or place associated with each target word. On this post-test, participants were presented with studied words, in random order, and asked to provide the name of the associate or, if not possible, a description of the associate in as much detail as they could remember. The post-test was self-paced, with responses typed out on a keyboard; participants were instructed to provide no response if no details of the associate could be remembered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Memory response classification</title><p>The fMRI retrieval trials were classified into six conditions: associative hits (studied words for which the participant indicated the correct associate category), associative misses (studied words for which the participant indicated the incorrect associate category), item hits (studied words correctly identified as ‘old’), item misses (studied words incorrectly identified as ‘new’), item false alarms (foils incorrectly called ‘old’), associative false alarms (foils incorrectly indicated as associated with a ‘face’ or a ‘place’), and correct rejections (CR; foils correctly identified as ‘new’). Because the number of false alarms was low (M = 5.1, SD = 4.7), these trials were not submitted to fMRI analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a summary of trial counts and retrieval reaction time by memory outcome).</p><p>In-scanner associative memory performance was estimated using a discrimination index, associative <italic>d’</italic>. Hit rate was defined as the rate of correct category responses to studied words (associative hits) and the false alarm rate was defined as the rate of incorrect associative responses to novel words (associative false alarms). Thus, associative <italic>d’ </italic>= Z('Correct Associate Category' | Old) – Z('Associate Category' | New). We additionally calculated an old/new discrimination index to assess basic understanding of and ability to perform the task. Here, hit rate was defined as the rate of correct old responses to studied words, irrespective of associative memory (associative hits, associative misses, item hits), and the false alarm rate was defined as the rate of incorrect old responses to novel words (item false alarms, associative false alarms). Thus, old/new <italic>d’ </italic>= Z(‘Old’ + ‘Face’ + ‘Place’ | Old) – Z(‘Old’ + ‘Face’ + 'Place' | New).</p><p>The post-test data were analysed using a semi-automated method. Participants’ typed responses were first processed with in house R code to identify exact matches to the name of the studied image. Responses that did not include exact matches were flagged, and subsequently assessed by a human rater, who determined the correspondence between the description provided by the participant and the correct associate. We computed the proportion of studied words for which the associate was correctly recalled (Exemplar Correct/All Old). One participant did not complete the post-test, leaving 99 participants in all analyses of the post-test data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>MRI data acquisition</title><p>Data were acquired on a 3T GE Discovery MR750 MRI scanner (GE Healthcare) using a 32-channel radiofrequency receive-only head coil (Nova Medical). Functional data were acquired using a multiband EPI sequence (acceleration factor = 3) consisting of 63 oblique axial slices parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus (TR = 2 s, TE = 30 ms, FoV = 215 mm x 215 mm, flip angle = 74, voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 × 2 mm). To correct for B0 field distortions, we collected two B0 field maps before every functional run, one in each phase encoding direction. Two structural scans were acquired: a whole-brain high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical volume (TR = 7.26 ms, FoV = 230 mm × 230 mm, voxel size = 0.9 × 0.9 x 0.9 mm, slices = 186), and a T2-weighted high-resolution anatomical volume perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus (TR = 4.2 s, TE = 65 ms, FOV = 220 mm, voxel size = 0.43 × 0.43×2 mm; slices = 29). The latter was used for manual segmentation of hippocampal subfields and surrounding cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Olsen et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>fMRI preprocessing</title><p>Data were processed using a workflow of FSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2004</xref>) and Freesurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dale et al., 1999</xref>) tools implemented in Nipype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorgolewski et al., 2011</xref>). Each timeseries was first realigned to its middle volume using normalized correlation optimization and cubic spline interpolation. To correct for differences in slice acquisition times, data were temporally resampled to the TR midpoint using sinc interpolation. Finally, the timeseries data were high-pass filtered with a Gaussian running-line filter using a cutoff of 128 s. The hemodynamic response for each trial was estimated by first removing the effects of motion, trial artifacts, and session from the timeseries using a general linear model. The residualized timeseries was then reduced to a single volume for each trial by averaging across TRs 3–5 (representing 4–10 s post-stimulus onset), corresponding to the peak of the hemodynamic response function. To preserve the high resolution of the acquired data, the data were left unsmoothed.</p><p>Images with motion or intensity artifacts were automatically identified as those TRs in which total displacement relative to the previous frame exceeded 0.5 mm or in which the average intensity across the whole brain deviated from the run mean by greater than five standard deviations. Runs in which the number of artifacts identified exceeded 25% of timepoints, as well as runs in which framewise displacement exceeded 2 mm, were excluded. These criteria led to exclusion of data from five participants who exhibited excess head motion across runs, as well as exclusion of one study and test run from an additional participant. Across all included runs from 100 participants, an average of 2.4 (SD = 3.7) encoding phase volumes (1.7% of volumes) and 2.6 (SD = 4.2) retrieval phase volumes (1.5% of volumes) were identified as containing an artifact. Trials containing fMRI artifacts were excluded from all analyses. To control for potential residual effects of head motion on our primary variables of interest, we adjusted each variable of interest by mean framewise displacement using linear regression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a summary of motion effects).</p><p>Using Freesurfer, we segmented the T1-weighted anatomical volume at the gray-white matter boundary and constructed tessellated meshes representing the cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dale et al., 1999</xref>). Functional data from each run were registered to the anatomical volume with a six degrees-of-freedom rigid alignment optimizing a boundary-based cost function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>). Finally, runs 2–4 were resampled into the space of run 1 using cubic spline interpolation to bring the data into a common alignment. All analyses were thus performed in participant native space, avoiding normalization to a group template.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Regions of interest</title><p>Our analyses focus specifically on hippocampal pattern completion processes — via hippocampal univariate activity and multivariate cortical reinstatement metrics — in the aging brain. Thus, analyses were conducted in three a priori regions of interest (ROIs), selected based on existing theoretical and empirical work to optimize the measurement of this process. Analyses of task-evoked univariate activity were focused on the hippocampus, whereas multivoxel pattern analyses were conducted in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) and angular gyrus (ANG), two cortical areas that have been reliably linked to cortical reinstatement in healthy younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuhl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Favila et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). All ROIs were bilateral and defined in participants’ native space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The hippocampal mask was defined manually using each participant’s high-resolution T2-weighted structural image using established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Olsen et al., 2009</xref>), and comprised the whole hippocampus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref> for analysis of hippocampal subfields). The VTC mask was composed of three anatomical regions: parahippocampal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and inferior temporal cortex. The fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal cortex masks were generated from each participant’s Freesurfer autosegmentation volume using bilateral inferior temporal cortex and fusiform gyrus labels. These were combined with a manually defined bilateral parahippocampal cortex ROI, defined using established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Olsen et al., 2009</xref>), to form the VTC mask. The ANG ROI was defined by the intersection of the Freesurfer inferior parietal lobe label and the Default Network of the Yeo 7 network atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), defined on the Freesurfer average (fsaverage) cortical surface mesh. This intersection was used to confine the ROI to the inferior parietal nodes of the Default Mode Network, which predominantly encompasses ANG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Favila et al., 2018</xref>). To generate ROIs in participants’ native space from the fsaverage space label, we used the approach detailed in Waskom and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voss et al., 2008</xref>), which uses the spherical registration parameters to reverse-normalize the labels, and then converts the vertex coordinates of labels on the native surface into the space of each participant’s first run using the inverse of the functional to anatomical registration. Participant-specific ROIs were then defined as all voxels intersecting the midpoint between the gray-white and gray-pial boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Multivoxel pattern classification</title><p>Our primary measure of category-level cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval was derived from multivoxel classification analysis. Classification was implemented using Scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>), nilearn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>), nibabel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brett et al., 2016</xref>), and in house Python scripts, and performed using L2-penalized logistic regression models as instantiated in the LIBLINEAR classification library (regularization parameter C = 1). These models were fit to preprocessed BOLD data from VTC and ANG that were reduced to a single volume for each trial by averaging across TRs 3–5. Prior to classification, the sample by voxel matrices for each region were scaled across samples within each run, such that each voxel had zero mean and unit variance. A feature selection step was also conducted, in which a subject-specific univariate contrast was used to identify the top 250 voxels that were most sensitive to each category (face, place) during encoding, yielding a set of 500 voxels over which classification analyses were performed. Prior to each of 10 iterations of classifier training, the data were subsampled to ensure an equal number of face and scene trials following exclusion of trials with artifacts.</p><p>To first validate that classification of stimulus category (face/place) during encoding was above chance for each ROI, we used a leave-one-run-out-n-fold cross-validation procedure on the encoding data. This yielded a value of probabilistic classifier output for each trial, representing the degree to which the encoding pattern for a trial resembled the pattern associated with a face or place trial. This output was converted to binary classification accuracy indicating whether or not a given test trial was correctly classified according to the category of the studied picture. Here we report the average classifier accuracy across folds for each participant in each ROI.</p><p>To measure category-level cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval, we trained a new classifier on all encoding phase data, and then tested on all retrieval phase data. For each retrieval trial, the value of probabilistic classifier output represented a continuous measure of the probability (range 0–1) that the classifier assigned to the relevant category for each trial (0 = certain place classification, 1 = certain face classification). For assessment of classifier performance across conditions (associative hits, associative misses, item only hits, and item misses) and ROI (VTC, ANG), we converted this continuous measure of classifier evidence to binary classification accuracy, indicating whether or not a given retrieval trial was correctly classified according to the category of the studied picture.</p><p>The significance of classifier performance for each condition and ROI was assessed using permutation testing. We generated a null distribution for each participant by shuffling the trial labels over 1000 iterations for each of the 10 subsampling iterations, calculating mean classifier accuracy for each iteration. We then calculated the mean number of times the permuted classifier accuracy met or exceeded observed classifier accuracy to derive a <italic>p</italic> value indicating the probability that the observed classifier accuracy could arise by chance.</p><p>For trial-wise analyses relating cortical reinstatement strength to memory behaviour (e.g., associative retrieval accuracy and reaction time) and other neural variables (e.g., hippocampal BOLD), a continuous measure of reinstatement strength was derived by calculating the logits (log odds) of the probabilistic classifier output on each trial. Reinstatement strength was signed in the direction of the correct associate for a given trial, such that, regardless of whether the trial was a face or place trial, the evidence was positive when the classifier guessed correctly, and negative when the classifier guessed incorrectly. The magnitude of reinstatement strength was thus neutral with respect to which associate category (face or place) was retrieved. For individual-differences analyses relating cortical reinstatement strength to age and memory behaviour (e.g., associative <italic>d’</italic>, exemplar-specific recall), we computed the mean category-level reinstatement strength (i.e., logits) across associative hit trials for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pattern similarity analysis</title><p>To complement the classification analyses, we used pattern similarity analyses to measure event-level cortical reinstatement. This approach involved computing the similarity (Pearson correlation) between trial-wise activity patterns extracted from ROIs during encoding and retrieval (i.e., encoding-retrieval similarity; ERS). This analysis approach affords the opportunity to not only examine reinstatement at the categorical level (i.e., within-category ERS – between-category ERS) but also at the trial-unique item level (i.e., within-event ERS – within-category ERS). For this analysis, we again used the voxelwise activity patterns for each ROI (this time with no feature selection step), computing the correlation between encoding and retrieval patterns separately for successful (i.e., associative hits) and unsuccessful (i.e., associative misses, item only hits, item misses) retrieval trials, such that the events being compared (within-event, within-category, between-category) were matched on associative retrieval success. Within-category ERS was computed after values on the diagonal of the correlation matrices (i.e. within-event correlations) were removed, ensuring that event-level ERS does not contribute to the within-category ERS estimate. All correlations were Fisher transformed before computing the mean correlation between different events of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were implemented in the R environment (version 3.4.4). Trial-wise analyses were conducted using mixed effects models (linear and logistic) using the lmer4 statistical package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). Each model contained fixed effects of interest, a random intercept modeling the mean subject-specific outcome value, and a random slope term modeling the subject-specific effect of the independent variable of interest (e.g., hippocampal activity, reinstatement strength). Models also contained nuisance regressors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a full list of regressors in each model), including stimulus category, age, ROI encoding classifier strength (when reinstatement strength —logits— was the independent or dependent variable), ROI univariate activity in category-selective voxels (when reinstatement strength – logits – was the independent variable, controlling for activity in voxels identified during feature selection, over which classification was performed), overall ROI univariate activity (when ERS was the independent variable, controlling for activity in the whole ROI, as no feature selection step was conducted for pattern similarity analyses), and category-level ERS (when event-level ERS was the independent or dependent variable, to mitigate the possibility that effects of event-level ERS can be attributed to category-level reinstatement). Models were conducted over all test trials in which a studied item was presented, except where indicated that only associative hit trials were included (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a summary of results when item miss trials are excluded from analyses). Random slopes were uncorrelated from random intercepts to facilitate model convergence. The significance of effects within mixed-model regressions was obtained using log-likelihood ratio tests, resulting in χ<sup>2</sup> values and corresponding <italic>p</italic>-values. A Wald <italic>z</italic>-statistic was additionally computed for model parameters to determine simultaneous significance of coefficients within a given model. All continuous variables were z-scored within participant across all trials prior to analysis. For trial-wise mediation analyses, the coefficient of the indirect path was computed as the product of the direct effects, <italic>a</italic> × <italic>b</italic>. The significance of the indirect effect was calculated with bootstrap resampling with 5000 iterations of data sampled with replacement, and was considered significant if zero does not fall within the 95% confidence interval of the bootstrapped estimate of the indirect effect; 95% confidence intervals are reported.</p><p>Individual-differences analyses were conducted using multiple linear regression. In all regression models, each neural variable was computed by taking the mean value over associative hit trials. For hippocampal BOLD, mean activity during associative hits was corrected by subtracting mean activity during correct rejections. Before entry into regression models, each neural variable was further adjusted by head motion (mean framewise displacement) and, in the cases of reinstatement strength, ROI-specific encoding classifier strength (mean logits) to account for individual differences in category differentiation during encoding. Age-independent models adjusted memory scores by age. Main text figures depict raw values for interpretability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for partial plots). Hierarchical regression was used to assess the relative contributions of each independent variable to memory performance. F ratio statistics were used to determine change in explained variance (R<sup>2</sup>) at each step compared to the previous step. The explanatory power of each regression model was evaluated descriptively using the explained variance (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>). All continuous variables were z-scored across participants prior to analysis, producing standardized coefficients. All analyses used a two-tailed level of 0.05 for defining statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Stanford Aging and Memory Study (SAMS) is supported by the National Institute on Aging (R01AG048076, R21AG058111, and R21AG058859), Stanford’s Center for Precision Health and Integrated Diagnostics (PHIND), and Stanford’s Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute.

combines an elegant cognitive task with sophisticated brain imaging approaches (functional MRI pattern analysis) to characterize the neural mechanisms that support memory retrieval in healthy older adults. While it is well known that memory declines with aging, our understanding of how neural variability – both across individuals and within an individual, on a moment-to-moment basis – might explain memory success or failure remains limited. Armed with a large sample size well-suited to address just these sorts of questions, the present study provides clear empirical evidence for unique hippocampal and cortical contributions to remembering in healthy older adults.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Hippocampal and cortical mechanisms at retrieval explain variability in episodic remembering in older adults&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lars Nyberg (Reviewer #2); Josh Koen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this interesting and well-written study, the authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to ask whether hippocampal pattern completion can account for some of the marked heterogeneity in episodic memory decline in healthy aging. Pattern completion was indexed with multivariate measures of cortical reinstatement (category- and event-level) and univariate hippocampal activity. Importantly, trial-by-trial measures of pattern completion in the ANG and VTC we related to successful associative memory retrieval and also account for some of the age-related declines in memory performance. Reviewers appreciated the sizeable sample of older adult participants, and highlighted the consideration of within-participant, trial-by-trial neural effects was a notable methodological advance. This paper will be an important contribution to the field for these reasons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While reviewers are overall enthusiastic about this paper, there are a number of concerns identified that must be adequately addressed in a revision.</p><p>1) The reporting of the linear mixed effects models needs to be clearer in the paper. It was quite challenging to keep track of what predictors were included in each model when they were reported in the text. For example, please clarify what the &quot;relevant nuisance variables&quot; are and why they were deemed &quot;relevant&quot; for each model. One way to help this is to predictors in each model and their associated model coefficients in supplementary materials (including the random effects components). This has the added benefits of providing more information to readers to better evaluate the results. The reviewers acknowledge that this may be redundant with information on the GitHub repository (which was appreciated!), but note that not all readers will access that resource.</p><p>2) Reviewers were confused by reporting what are essentially the same models twice, with one set having age moderate the effect. This is particularly problematic as some of the effects in the first part of the results are actually moderated by age (for example, there was an Age Reinstatement interaction predicting AH success). Significant interactions with age make the earlier results from models that did not have an age interaction term more difficult to interpret. Reviewers request that the authors consider including only the larger models with the age-by-predictor of interest terms in the main paper, reporting whether the age-by-fixed effect interaction terms were significant or not. Additional models might be better put into the supplementary material if the authors deem them necessary to report. Reviewers believe this will improve the overall clarify of the statistical approach.</p><p>3) There are many known issues with interpreting mediation from cross-sectional samples (see Raz and Lindenburger, 2011, Psychological Bulletin; Maxwell and Cole, 2007, Psychological Methods), and thus the conclusions one can draw from them here are limited. Here, we note that the mediation analyses were not critical to the paper's main conclusions. As such, the reviewers recommend removing the mediation analyses to improve the flow of the paper and reduce the already large number of analyses. However, we acknowledge that this issue might still be debated in the field and that mediation analyses are regularly reported in cross-sectional studies. For this reason, reviewers believe it is the authors' right to decide the best course of action for their paper. If the authors elect to keep the mediation analysis, please add more details about it to the Materials and methods and discuss its limitations in a cross-sectional study.</p><p>4) There is growing appreciate in the literature about how fidelity of representation at encoding might explain some of the observed age differences in retrieval (at the behavioral or neural levels; for recent reviews, see Koen and Rugg, 2019, TICs; Koen et al., 2020, Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences). As such, it would be appropriate to include more about the simple relationships between encoding strength and the various retrieval measures. The authors state that encoding strength is correlated with reinstatement strength and subsequently include it as a covariate of no interest in their statistical models. I understand that this demonstrates that action at retrieval is an additional and important contributor. However, it seems as though more information on encoding strength on its own is warranted. Please report whether there are age effects on the encoding classification data. As I understand it, encoding strength does not &quot;explain away&quot; the age effects observed here – is that correct? At the conceptual level, I believe the relationship among hippocampal activity, reinstatement, and memory success should be intact even when encoding strength is weak, but perhaps this has a larger effect on the reinstatement piece (i.e., less on hippocampal activity)? While we understand the encoding classification data is not central to the aims of this paper, it deserves some mention to show that this task can replicate prior findings showing reductions in multivariate measures of neural selectivity (see Carp et al., 2011; Park et al., 2010; 2012; Koen et al., 2019). These papers also warrant citing in the relevant spots when discussing neural dedifferentiation.</p><p>5) As a methodological point (somewhat related to the possibility of dedifferentiation), how might encoding strength influence reinstatement at the level of activation patterns and correlations? In other words, if there is additional noise in the patterns at encoding, one might expect that to show up in subsequent analyses that also depend on these patterns (this would be true both for a classifier trained on the encoding data or the ERS analysis). This seems worth consideration in the paper, even if the authors do not believe it to be a relevant issue.</p><p>6) It is stated (Introduction) that aging may affect HPC, cortical reinstatement, and/or the brain-behavior link. While reviewers agree in principle, in view of the canonical model outlined in the 1st paragraph of the Introduction (cue =&gt; HC activation =&gt; cortical replay), it is unclear whether intact cortical reinstatement in principle could occur in the presence of dysfunctional HPC. The authors may want to elaborate on this. It is unclear whether the regression findings reported in the subsection “Unique Hippocampal and Cortical Contributions to Associative Retrieval” offer conclusive support that VTC and ANG can support successful associative retrieval <italic>independently</italic> of hippocampal activity (i.e. that they would be predictive in the absence of HC activity). This topic is also critical for the conclusion that age particularly affected the translation of cortical evidence to memory behavior (subsection “Effects of Age on Hippocampal and Cortical Indices of Pattern Completion”). The finding that HPC may be preserved but cortical reinstatement impaired in ageing is quite surprising in view of findings of preserved retrieval of detail semantic memories in older age, along with impairment on hippocampus-based episodic memory tasks. Please address this, perhaps in the Discussion.</p><p>7) Given the ideas that hippocampal activity should drive cortical reinstatement, one might expect the authors would test whether reinstatement (perhaps separately in VTC and ANG) mediates the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative memory success. Instead, the authors asked whether both explained some variance in performance when included in the same model. This seems to make a slightly different statistical point. It would be helpful for the authors to include some rationale for their decision of statistical test in light of the mechanism.</p><p>8) The analyses of cortical reinstatement focused on VTC and ANG, with the motivation that these areas support content-rich representations during retrieval and that their representations may be related to memory-guided behaviour. The VTC prediction was easy to follow, given face/place selectivity in this area. However, reviewers wanted more information on the role of ANG as an a priori region of interest. What type of processing is this region thought to perform? For example, would ANG involvement be expected if auditory information is studied rather than visual objects? That is, is this a region related to stimulus specificity or more generally related to successful retrieval (&quot;memory guided behaviour&quot;)? If the latter, is it really to be expected to see &quot;reactivation&quot;/reinstatement of encoding activity in this region?</p><p>9) More justification is needed for grouping AM, IH, and IM into a single unsuccessful bin logistic mixed effects regression model. Doing so makes it difficult to know if the models are predicting associative memory success or simply item memory success. The more appropriate comparison might be to drop IM trials from this bin such that the AH vs. AM + IH controls for successful item memory. It would be important for the authors to somehow demonstrate that the results do not hinge on item miss trials being included in the &quot;unsuccessful&quot; bin. This analysis could be reported in the supplementary material. Also, it would be helpful to report the proportions of trials in each bin in supplementary material for readers to appreciate the relative mixture of trial types.</p><p>10) Some of the effects appear to depend on image category (according to Supplementary file 1E). This seems rather important to touch on in the main text. There is some inconsistency in the literature concerning if age-related neural dedifferentiation is ubiquitous or not across different visual stimuli (Voss et al., 2008; Koen et al., 2019; Payer et al., 2006; reviewed in Koen and Rugg, 2019; Koen et al., 2020). Thus, these category moderations deserve some mention in the main text. Please also address whether there are behavioral (memory) differences between faces and places, since substantial differences in performance across these trial types could influence the classification, as memory success/failure is confounded with face/place.</p><p>11) Please clarify how the fMRI measures were summarized for the individual difference analyses. Were they simply averaged across all trials, AH trials, or some other mixture? Also, why were age interactions excluded from the model? While the models suggest that the effects are independent of age, they do not imply that they are age invariant (Rugg, 2015). I appreciate that there might not be enough variability in this sample (which is only older adults) but demonstrating age invariance here seems important given the conclusions that are drawn.</p><p>12) The degree of variability in any given sample/study will in part be driven by the recruitment procedure. It is our impression that this sample was very healthy and cognitively intact (see Table 1) – and there was no relation between level of education and memory performance! This is at odds with findings in many published longitudinal studies. Comments on the sample in relation to the topic of heterogeneity would be informative.</p><p>13) Effects now attributed to influences of ageing in this cross-sectional study could be driven by other factors, and strong conclusions on the effects go ageing will have to await longitudinal follow-up studies. Please address this limitation in the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hippocampal and cortical mechanisms at retrieval explain variability in episodic remembering in older adults&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It was quite challenging to keep track of what predictors were included in each model when they were reported in the text. For example, please clarify what the &quot;relevant nuisance variables&quot; are and why they were deemed &quot;relevant&quot; for each model. One way to help this is to predictors in each model and their associated model coefficients in supplementary materials (including the random effects components). This has the added benefits of providing more information to readers to better evaluate the results. The reviewers acknowledge that this may be redundant with information on the GitHub repository (which was appreciated!), but note that not all readers will access that resource.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the importance of enhanced clarity and transparency in reporting of the linear mixed effects models. Following the reviewer’s guidance, we added a table that lists all predictors, including both fixed and random effects, for all linear and logistic mixed effect models (Supplementary file 1C). We also revised the language within the manuscript (Materials and methods subsection “Statistical Analysis”) to increase clarity regarding nuisance variables and point readers to Supplementary file 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers were confused by reporting what are essentially the same models twice, with one set having age moderate the effect. This is particularly problematic as some of the effects in the first part of the results are actually moderated by age (for example, there was an Age Reinstatement interaction predicting AH success). Significant interactions with age make the earlier results from models that did not have an age interaction term more difficult to interpret. Reviewers request that the authors consider including only the larger models with the age-by-predictor of interest terms in the main paper, reporting whether the age-by-fixed effect interaction terms were significant or not. Additional models might be better put into the supplementary material if the authors deem them necessary to report. Reviewers believe this will improve the overall clarify of the statistical approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potentially confusing and redundant description of models. Following their guidance, we revised the Results section to describe only the larger models that include the age-by-predictor of interest effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are many known issues with interpreting mediation from cross-sectional samples (see Raz and Lindenburger, 2011, Psychological Bulletin; Maxwell and Cole, 2007, Psychological Methods), and thus the conclusions one can draw from them here are limited. Here, we note that the mediation analyses were not critical to the paper's main conclusions. As such, the reviewers recommend removing the mediation analyses to improve the flow of the paper and reduce the already large number of analyses. However, we acknowledge that this issue might still be debated in the field and that mediation analyses are regularly reported in cross-sectional studies. For this reason, reviewers believe it is the authors' right to decide the best course of action for their paper. If the authors elect to keep the mediation analysis, please add more details about it to the Materials and methods and discuss its limitations in a cross-sectional study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to these conceptual discussions regarding mediation analyses in cross-sectional designs. We appreciate and agree with the challenges inherent to interpreting mediation in this context. As the reviewers note, the mediation analysis is not central to the study’s aims or results; following their guidance, we removed this analysis from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is growing appreciate in the literature about how fidelity of representation at encoding might explain some of the observed age differences in retrieval (at the behavioral or neural levels; for recent reviews, see Koen and Rugg, 2019, TICs; Koen et al., 2020, Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences). As such, it would be appropriate to include more about the simple relationships between encoding strength and the various retrieval measures. The authors state that encoding strength is correlated with reinstatement strength and subsequently include it as a covariate of no interest in their statistical models. I understand that this demonstrates that action at retrieval is an additional and important contributor. However, it seems as though more information on encoding strength on its own is warranted. Please report whether there are age effects on the encoding classification data. As I understand it, encoding strength does not &quot;explain away&quot; the age effects observed here – is that correct? At the conceptual level, I believe the relationship among hippocampal activity, reinstatement, and memory success should be intact even when encoding strength is weak, but perhaps this has a larger effect on the reinstatement piece (i.e., less on hippocampal activity)? While we understand the encoding classification data is not central to the aims of this paper, it deserves some mention to show that this task can replicate prior findings showing reductions in multivariate measures of neural selectivity (see Carp et al., 2011; Park et al., 2010; 2012; Koen et al., 2019). These papers also warrant citing in the relevant spots when discussing neural dedifferentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising these points. As summarized by the reviewers, we reiterate here that a) the focus of this paper is on processes at retrieval, b) our analytic approach of controlling for encoding effects demonstrates that action at retrieval is an additional and important contributor, and c) controlling for encoding strength does not explain away the age effects we observe on cortical reinstatement strength. Importantly, we agree that effects at retrieval (especially reinstatement strength) will in part reflect effects at encoding (as noted in Results subsection “fMRI Encoding Classifier Accuracy”), and this motivated our analytic approach to control for encoding strength in all analyses.</p><p>The above said, given the reviewers’ guidance to further highlight relevant findings at encoding that are helpful for interpreting the effects at retrieval that are the focus of this paper, we implemented the following additional edits:</p><p>a) We moved the statistics describing the relationship (both trial-wise, within-subject and individual differences, across-subject) between encoding strength and reinstatement strength to the main text (Results subsection “fMRI Encoding Classifier Accuracy”). These relationships are also depicted in Figure 5—figure supplement 3.</p><p>b) We added statistics describing the effect of age on encoding strength to the main text (Results subsection “fMRI Encoding Classifier Accuracy”).</p><p>c) We added a table listing all predictors for each model (Supplementary file 1C), making it easier to keep track of which models control for encoding strength. We also described this analytic approach in greater detail in the main manuscript (Results subsection “fMRI Encoding Classifier Accuracy”; Materials and methods- subsection “Statistical Analysis”). To reiterate here, encoding strength is included in all models in which a) reinstatement strength is a dependent variable, and b) reinstatement strength is the primary predictor of interest.</p><p>d) We discuss variance in differentiation/selectivity at encoding as it relates to processes at retrieval and memory performance (Discussion, sixth and seventh paragraphs), and added additional citations of relevant work per the reviewers’ guidance.</p><p>We note that the effect of age on encoding strength was not significant in VTC (<italic>β</italic> = -0.13, <italic>p</italic> = .133) or ANG (<italic>β</italic> = -0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .544). However, we do not believe this to be inconsistent with prior literature regarding neural dedifferentiation, nor does this result offer conclusive evidence regarding age effects at encoding. First, evidence for neural dedifferentiation with age comes from work contrasting effects between older and younger adults (e.g., Carp et al., 2011, Trelle et al., 2019, Koen et al., 2019) and when examining individual differences in differentiation across the lifespan (e.g., Park et al., 2012). Given the present manuscript’s focus on within- and between-subject variance using a cross-sectional design selectively focused on older adults, our study does not permit assessment of encoding differences between older and young adults. Second, our reported measure of encoding strength –– classifier evidence –– may be less sensitive to dedifferentiation than other methods, such as pattern similarity analysis, which was used in prior work examining this question (e.g., Carp et al., 2011, Trelle et al., 2019, Koen et al., 2019). We plan to report on the encoding data in this cohort in an independent manuscript, which will more thoroughly address these and related questions (addressing issues that are beyond the present manuscript’s focus on retrieval effects).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As a methodological point (somewhat related to the possibility of dedifferentiation), how might encoding strength influence reinstatement at the level of activation patterns and correlations? In other words, if there is additional noise in the patterns at encoding, one might expect that to show up in subsequent analyses that also depend on these patterns (this would be true both for a classifier trained on the encoding data or the ERS analysis). This seems worth consideration in the paper, even if the authors do not believe it to be a relevant issue.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in response to Point 4, our analytic approach is specifically designed to control for the possibility that variability with respect to noise in BOLD activity patterns at encoding (both across individuals and across trials) impacts subsequent patterns at retrieval, which we agree is a relevant issue. To make this point and the steps taken to mitigate it more clear in the manuscript, we made changes to the manuscript that are described in Response 4 (and can be found in the Results subsection “fMRI Encoding Classifier Accuracy”, Discussion, sixth and seventh paragraphs and in the Materials and methods subsection “Statistical Analysis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is stated (Introduction) that aging may affect HPC, cortical reinstatement, and/or the brain-behavior link. While reviewers agree in principle, in view of the canonical model outlined in the 1st paragraph of the Introduction (cue =&gt; HC activation =&gt; cortical replay), it is unclear whether intact cortical reinstatement in principle could occur in the presence of dysfunctional HPC. The authors may want to elaborate on this. It is unclear whether the regression findings reported in the subsection “Unique Hippocampal and Cortical Contributions to Associative Retrieval” offer conclusive support that VTC and ANG can support successful associative retrieval independently of hippocampal activity (i.e. that they would be predictive in the absence of HC activity). This topic is also critical for the conclusion that age particularly affected the translation of cortical evidence to memory behavior (subsection “Effects of Age on Hippocampal and Cortical Indices of Pattern Completion”). The finding that HPC may be preserved but cortical reinstatement impaired in ageing is quite surprising in view of findings of preserved retrieval of detail semantic memories in older age, along with impairment on hippocampus-based episodic memory tasks. Please address this, perhaps in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important theoretical issue, and we appreciate the reviewers highlighting the need for further clarity surrounding this core hypothesis and interpretation of key results. First, we clarify that we do not believe that cortical reinstatement in ANG and VTC could occur independently of hippocampal activity, or in the absence of a functioning hippocampus. Indeed, much evidence from studies in nonhuman animals documents the critical role of the hippocampus in the initiation of cortical reinstatement (e.g., Nakazawa et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2014). Instead, we intended to communicate that hippocampal activity and reinstatement strength explain unique variance in the probability of associative retrieval (i.e., they are not redundant predictors of memory behaviour). We revised the language in the Results (subsection “Cortical Reinstatement Partially Mediates the Effect of Hippocampal Activity on Retrieval”) to better reflect this. That is, although reinstatement is initiated by hippocampal activity (consistent with the observed relationship between these measures in the present sample), multivoxel patterns reinstated in cortex appear to carry additional information relevant for behaviour that is not contained in the univariate magnitude of hippocampal activity alone. One possibility is that this includes information about the specificity or precision with which event features are recovered (e.g., vividly recalling an image of the golden gate bridge vs. recalling that the image was a landmark but unsure of which one). Were this the case, it would suggest that some variability in the precision of reinstatement stems from factors beyond hippocampal pattern completion. A second, not mutually exclusive possibility is that this information is influenced by top-down post-retrieval monitoring, selection, and/or decision processes at retrieval, which further alter the extent to which retrieval patterns (and perhaps their precision) resemble encoding patterns and with relevance to memory behaviour. Critically, even if hippocampal activity is fixed (and non-zero), each of these factors could impact the magnitude of cortical reinstatement strength and influence memory decisions. We elaborate on these ideas in the Discussion (seventh paragraph) to clarify these important theoretical points. Taken together, we believe the present findings are not only compatible with computational models of pattern completion, but also highlight that there are additional influences –– beyond hippocampal pattern completion –– on cortical reinstatement strength and the mapping of cortical patterns to memory behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the ideas that hippocampal activity should drive cortical reinstatement, one might expect the authors would test whether reinstatement (perhaps separately in VTC and ANG) mediates the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative memory success. Instead, the authors asked whether both explained some variance in performance when included in the same model. This seems to make a slightly different statistical point. It would be helpful for the authors to include some rationale for their decision of statistical test in light of the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers highlighting this important distinction, and agree that a formal test of whether cortical reinstatement strength mediates the relationship between hippocampal activity and associative memory success is more appropriate in this context. We ran this analysis, separately for VTC and ANG, and revised the Results (subsection “Cortical Reinstatement Partially Mediates the Effect of Hippocampal Activity on Retrieval”) accordingly. Briefly, the results indicate that the relationship between hippocampal activity and the probability of associative retrieval is partially mediated by reinstatement strength, and this is observed for both VTC and ANG. This finding further supports the interpretation that hippocampal activity and reinstatement strength each measure a component of hippocampal pattern completion processes, and also indicates that the information carried by each measure explains both common and unique variance in retrieval success. We thank the reviewers for this guidance, as this additional reporting strengthens the reported findings and clarifies their theoretical implications (as we now emphasize in the Discussion, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The analyses of cortical reinstatement focused on VTC and ANG, with the motivation that these areas support content-rich representations during retrieval and that their representations may be related to memory-guided behaviour. The VTC prediction was easy to follow, given face/place selectivity in this area. However, reviewers wanted more information on the role of ANG as an a priori region of interest. What type of processing is this region thought to perform? For example, would ANG involvement be expected if auditory information is studied rather than visual objects? That is, is this a region related to stimulus specificity or more generally related to successful retrieval (&quot;memory guided behaviour&quot;)? If the latter, is it really to be expected to see &quot;reactivation&quot;/reinstatement of encoding activity in this region?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question, as it surfaces that we did not sufficiently motivate predictions about cortical reinstatement in ANG. The inclusion of ANG as an a priori ROI is based on a rich and growing literature documenting evidence for cortical reinstatement of both category- and stimulus/event-specific features in this region during memory retrieval (Kuhl, Johnson and Chun, 2013; Kuhl and Chun, 2014; Lee and Kuhl, 2016; Favila et al., 2016; Thakral et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018). While the majority of these studies used visual stimuli, as is common in episodic memory research, there also is evidence for reinstatement of audio-visual stimuli in ANG (Bonnici et al., 2016). This body of work provides evidence that ANG not only signals retrieval success (independent of content), but supports representations of event features. The specific role of ANG during memory retrieval remains a topic of much interest in the literature (for reviews, see: Wagner et al., 2005; Cabeza et al., 2008; Hutchinson et al., 2009; Shimamura, 2011; Rugg and King, 2017; Ramanan et al., 2018). Theoretical interpretations of these data include a specific role in representing goal-relevant features during memory retrieval, and cross-modal integration or binding of episodic features. In the revision, we clarified how the extant literature motivates an analytic focus on ANG (Introduction, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) More justification is needed for grouping AM, IH, and IM into a single unsuccessful bin logistic mixed effects regression model. Doing so makes it difficult to know if the models are predicting associative memory success or simply item memory success. The more appropriate comparison might be to drop IM trials from this bin such that the AH vs. AM + IH controls for successful item memory. It would be important for the authors to somehow demonstrate that the results do not hinge on item miss trials being included in the &quot;unsuccessful&quot; bin. This analysis could be reported in the supplementary material. Also, it would be helpful to report the proportions of trials in each bin in supplementary material for readers to appreciate the relative mixture of trial types.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the current modelling approach could potentially be influenced by the inclusion of item misses, particularly if these trials comprised a large proportion of non-AH trials. To ensure that the item miss trials are not driving the observed effects, we reran all mixed effects models excluding IM trials and replicated the results. Following the reviewers’ guidance, we added Supplementary file 1D, that summarizes the results of these models. We also now report summary statistics describing the proportion of trials in each condition in Supplementary file 1B to increase transparency regarding the mixture of trial types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Some of the effects appear to depend on image category (according to Supplementary file 1E). This seems rather important to touch on in the main text. There is some inconsistency in the literature concerning if age-related neural dedifferentiation is ubiquitous or not across different visual stimuli (Voss et al., 2008; Koen et al., 2019; Payer et al., 2006; reviewed in Koen and Rugg, 2019; Koen et al., 2020). Thus, these category moderations deserve some mention in the main text. Please also address whether there are behavioral (memory) differences between faces and places, since substantial differences in performance across these trial types could influence the classification, as memory success/failure is confounded with face/place.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the potential moderating effect of image category on the present neural measures and behaviour, and believe it important to report any such effects for completeness and as a resource for future related work. Given the length and richness of the Results section, we believe it is best to report these findings in Supplementary file 1E in order to keep the main findings digestible and clear, as the effects of image category do not bear on the primary aims of the manuscript. Critically, category was included as a factor in all mixed effects models, and the moderating effects of image category, when observed, do not impact interpretability of any of the key findings. For example: (1) The relationship between hippocampal activity and retrieval success did not vary by image category, and this relationship was significant for both categories; (2) While the relationship between hippocampal activity and category reinstatement strength interacted with category, critically, this relationship was significant for both image categories; (3) Similarly, while the relationships between reinstatement strength and (a) retrieval success and (b) decision RT interacted with category, these effects were significant for both image categories. Thus, when interactions with image category are observed, the interactions reflect the relative strength of a given effect in each image category, rather than the presence of an effect within one category but not the other. There is one exception, the relationship between hippocampal activity and event-level reinstatement in VTC is significant on place trials but not face trials.</p><p>We implemented the following changes to increase awareness and accessibility of the effects of image category:</p><p>a) We now describe the effect of image category on memory performance in the Results subsection “Behavioural Results”. Specifically, associative <italic>d’</italic> for word-face pairs (<italic>M</italic> = 2.16, <italic>SD</italic> = .68) was significantly higher than for word-place pairs (<italic>M</italic> = 1.85, <italic>SD</italic> = .74; <italic>t</italic>(99) = 5.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-7</sup>). We note here that this behavioural difference did not have parallels in the neural data. In particular, mean reinstatement strength did not differ between face and place trials in ANG (place: M = 73.3%; face: M = 71.3%, <italic>t</italic>(99) = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = .094), and was actually greater on place trials in VTC (place: M = 71.5%; face: M = 65.1%; <italic>t</italic>(99) = 5.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-7</sup>). We now report on the effect of image category on reinstatement strength in ANG and VTC in the main manuscript (Results subsection “Memory Behaviour Scales with Trial-wise Category-level Reinstatement”).</p><p>b) Prior to each of 10 iterations of encoding classifier training, the data were subsampled to ensure an equal number of face and place study trials following exclusion of trials with artefacts (see Materials and methods subsection – “Multivoxel Pattern Classification”). This ensured that the classifier was unbiased with respect to image category, and therefore all classification outcomes cannot be confounded with image category.</p><p>c) We note that stimulus category was included as a regressor in all linear and logistic mixed effects models, which is now explicitly noted in the Results subsection “Memory Behaviour Scales with Trial-wise Category-level Reinstatement “ and made more evident by the listing of all predictors in mixed effects models in Supplementary file 1C. Importantly, by including category as a regressor, this further ensures that our key findings are not confounded with category, and instead generalize across category.</p><p>d) While the main text of the manuscript focuses on main effects, as these are central to our specific aims, we point readers to Supplementary file 1E-F within Results reporting (subsection “Memory Behaviour Scales with Trial-wise Category-level Reinstatement”) to obtain further details on the moderating effect of stimulus category on the key findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please clarify how the fMRI measures were summarized for the individual difference analyses. Were they simply averaged across all trials, AH trials, or some other mixture? Also, why were age interactions excluded from the model? While the models suggest that the effects are independent of age, they do not imply that they are age invariant (Rugg, 2015). I appreciate that there might not be enough variability in this sample (which is only older adults) but demonstrating age invariance here seems important given the conclusions that are drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify these points. To address the first point, fMRI measures for the individual difference analyses reflect the strength of each measure during associative hit trials. In particular, category reinstatement strength in VTC and ANG reflects mean classifier evidence (i.e., mean logits) across all associative hit trials, event-level reinstatement strength in VTC and ANG reflects mean ERS on associative hit trials, and hippocampal activity reflects the difference between mean activity during associative hit trials and mean activity during correct rejections. We revised the manuscript in multiple locations (Results subsection “Effects of Age on Hippocampal and Cortical Indices of Pattern Completion”; Materials and methods subsections “Multivoxel Pattern Classification” and “Statistical Analysis”) to enhance clarity regarding these measures.</p><p>To address the second point, we did not initially include interactions with age in these models because we were interested in the relationship between the neural variables and memory performance, independent of age. As advised by the reviewers, we conducted analyses examining the interaction between each of our neural variables and age. These models did not demonstrate significant interactions with age when associative d’ was the dependent variable (hippocampal activity: <italic>β</italic> = -0.14, <italic>p</italic> = .133; category reinstatement strength in VTC: <italic>β</italic> = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = .332; or ANG: <italic>β</italic> = -0.01, <italic>p</italic> = .951), nor when exemplar-specific recall was the dependent variable (hippocampal activity: <italic>β</italic> = -0.15, <italic>p</italic> = .088; category reinstatement strength in VTC: <italic>β</italic> = 0.003, <italic>p</italic> = .977 or ANG: <italic>β</italic> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .565), suggesting the present results are both independent of age and age-invariant. However, as the reviewers suggest, we interpret these results with caution given that the present sample is selective to older adults. We now report these outcomes in the manuscript, including this important caveat (Results subsection “Neural Indices of Pattern Completion Explain Individual Differences in Episodic Memory”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The degree of variability in any given sample/study will in part be driven by the recruitment procedure. It is our impression that this sample was very healthy and cognitively intact (see Table 1) – and there was no relation between level of education and memory performance! This is at odds with findings in many published longitudinal studies. Comments on the sample in relation to the topic of heterogeneity would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the present sample was healthy and cognitively intact. This was by design, as we sought to understand neural factors driving individual differences in memory performance within the normal range (i.e., excluding both subjective and mild cognitive impairment). Accordingly, inclusion criteria included CDR of 0 and performance within the normal range on a neuropsychological test battery, which necessarily restricted heterogeneity in memory performance. We recruited widely in the bay area through ads in newspapers, newsletters, and online (e.g., Facebook), with the following inclusion criteria: native English speaking, right-handed, and MRI compatible. We note that this convenience sample, together with the inclusion criteria and self-selection bias (characteristics of individuals who are able and motivated to come in for three study visits including two MRI scans and a lumbar puncture), mean that our sample is not representative of the wider population with respect to education, SES, and race/ethnicity. However, we note that despite these criteria, we still observe considerable heterogeneity in memory performance within this group, enabling us to address questions regarding individual differences in memory performance within the ‘cognitively normal’ range. The absence of a relationship between education and memory performance in our sample could be due to high educational attainment of participants on average, or the cross-sectional nature of the study design. We now comment on this in the revised manuscript (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Effects now attributed to influences of ageing in this cross-sectional study could be driven by other factors, and strong conclusions on the effects go ageing will have to await longitudinal follow-up studies. Please address this limitation in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the limitations of cross-sectional study designs in attributing observed age effects to chronological age per se. We have revised the manuscript to include consideration of this point (Discussion, last paragraph), including the necessity for longitudinal data in order to make strong claims regarding the effects of chronological age on the functional and behavioural measures reported here.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Please clarify throughout the paper, figures (i.e., axis labels), and legends when the term &quot;reinstatement strength&quot; refers to category-level versus event-level reinstatement.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the importance of distinguishing between which measure of cortical reinstatement we are referring to throughout the manuscript, figures, and tables. We have revised the manuscript text throughout the Results, Discussion and Materials and methods, as well as the figures axes and figure legends (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplements 1-6, Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplements 1-5), and tables and table captions (Table 2; Supplementary file 1C-H) to specify ‘event-level’ or ‘category-level’ reinstatement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify what is meant by &quot;univariate activity&quot; in Supplementary file 1C. Are all univariate measures derived from hippocampus, or was activity from other ROIs (VTC, ANG) also included in some models as a control? Furthermore, what is the reason for sometimes using category-selective voxels and other times using whole-ROI activity? These details could be noted in the paper or table caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for pointing out the need for enhanced clarity on this point. In Supplementary file 1C, ‘Univariate Activity’ refers to activity in the target ROIs (VTC, ANG), whereas only ‘Hippocampal Activity’ refers to univariate activity in the hippocampus. The rationale for using different univariate activity control variables for the models containing classification metrics as compared to those containing pattern similarity metrics stems from differences in the analytic approach. In particular, classification analyses were conducted over category-selective voxels identified in a feature selection step, as is conventional for MVPA. In contrast, pattern similarity analyses were conducted over all voxels in the ROI. Thus, we control for univariate activity in the voxels that were submitted to the analysis in each case.</p><p>We added further description of these control variables and the corresponding rationale in the main manuscript (Materials and methods subsection “Statistical Analysis”). We additionally revised the terminology in Supplementary file 1C to ‘ROI Univariate Activity’, and have added further description of this term and the rationale for different control variables in the table caption as follows:</p><p>“<sup>a</sup> = Univariate activity in top 500 category-selective voxels in VTC or ANG over which classification analyses were conducted; <sup>b</sup> = Univariate activity in whole ROI (VTC or ANG) over which pattern similarity analyses were conducted.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
