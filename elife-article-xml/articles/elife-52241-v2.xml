environmental tonicity can lead to inflammatory gene expression and pathogenesis. The Rel family of transcription factors TonEBP and NF-κB p65 play critical roles in the switch from osmoadaptive homeostasis to inflammation, respectively. Here we identified PACT-mediated PKR kinase activation as a marker of the termination of adaptation and initiation of inflammation in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> embryonic fibroblasts. We found that high stress-induced PACT-PKR activation inhibits the interaction between NF-κB c-Rel and TonEBP essential for the increased expression of TonEBP-dependent osmoprotective genes. This resulted in enhanced formation of TonEBP/NF-κB p65 complexes and enhanced proinflammatory gene expression. These data demonstrate a novel role of c-Rel in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress, which is inhibited via a PACT/PKR-dependent dimer redistribution of the Rel family transcription factors. Our results suggest that inhibiting PACT-PKR signaling may prove a novel target for alleviating stress-induced inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are sensitive to changes in their environment. For example, maintaining normal salt levels in the blood, also called tonicity, is essential for the health of individual cells and the organism as a whole. Tonicity controls the movement of water in and out of the cell: high levels of salt inside the cell draw water in, while high levels of salt outside the cell draw water out. If salt levels in the environment surrounding the cells become too high, too much water will be drawn out, causing the cells to shrink.</p><p>Changes in tonicity can cause the cell to become stressed. Initially, cells adapt to this stress by switching on sets of genes that help restore fluid balance and allow the cell to regain its normal shape and size. If the increase in tonicity exceeds tolerable stress levels and harms the cell, this initiates an inflammatory response which ultimately leads to cell death. However, it remained unclear how cells switch from adapting to responding with inflammation.</p><p>Now, Farabaugh et al. have used an experimental system which mimics high salt to identify the mechanism that allows cells to switch between these two responses. The experiments showed that when salt levels are too high, cells switch on a stress sensing protein called PACT, which activates another protein called PKR. When PACT was deleted from mouse cells, this led to a decrease in the activity of inflammatory genes, and prevented the cells from self-destructing.</p><p>Other proteins that are involved in the adaptive and inflammatory response are the NF-κB family of proteins and TonEBP. Farabaugh et al. found that under low intensity stress, when salt levels outside the cell are slightly too high, a family member of NF-κB works with TonEBP to switch on adaptive genes. But, if salt levels continue to rise, PACT activates and turns on PKR. This blocks the interaction between NF-κB and TonEBP, allowing another family member of NF-κB to interact with TonEBP instead. This switches the adaptive response off and the inflammatory response on.</p><p>There are many diseases that involve changes in tonicity, including diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and dry eye syndrome. Understanding the proteins involved in the adaptive and inflammatory response could lead to the development of drugs that help to protect cells from stress-induced damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hyperosmotic stress</kwd><kwd>TonEBP</kwd><kwd>NF-κB p65</kwd><kwd>NF-κB c-Rel</kwd><kwd>PACT</kwd><kwd>PKR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK53307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatzoglou</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI116730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Parameswaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018/30/E/NZ1/00605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krokowski</surname><given-names>Dawid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cleveland Digestive Disease Research Core Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK097948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatzoglou</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK060596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatzoglou</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK113196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatzoglou</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI144264</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Parameswaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Changes in the interactome of the Rel family of transcription factors control adaptation to the environmental stress of hyperosmolarity and determine cell fate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cellular response to increased extracellular osmolytes is a tightly regulated fundamental process that dictates the cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>). Multiple signaling pathways are involved in orchestrating the hyperosmotic stress response, with the ultimate goal of maintaining a constant cell volume. Although the initial sensor of hyperosmolarity is unknown in mammalian cells, adaptation to hyperosmotic stress has been shown to be dependent on induction of genes by the transcription factor Tonicity Enhancer Binding Protein (TonEBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>). TonEBP translocates to the nucleus in response to an increase in osmolarity to regulate transcription of target genes associated with osmoadaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miyakawa et al., 1999</xref>). These include chaperone proteins (heat shock protein 70 [HSP70, <italic>Hspa1a</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woo et al., 2002</xref>), enzymes involved in biosynthesis of neutral osmolytes (aldose reductase [AR, <italic>Akr1b1</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferraris et al., 1994</xref>), and membrane proteins that transport organic osmolytes such as amino acids proline and alanine across the plasma membrane (sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter [SNAT2, <italic>Slc38a2</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trama et al., 2002</xref>). The SNAT2-mediated arm of the adaptive response is also dependent on the membrane trafficking function of PP1/GADD34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krokowski et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>When the degree of hyperosmotic stress becomes too high to overcome, the adaptive response fails. The failure to adapt will lead to an increase in inflammatory signaling, followed by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brocker et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously determined in MEFs that extracellular osmolarities of 500 and 600 mOsm are representative of low stress intensity/adaptive response and high stress intensity/non-adaptive response, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). Inflammation is known to be regulated by many signaling pathways, including but not limited to NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). An increase in hyperosmolarity is associated with an increase in NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Németh et al., 2002</xref>) and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller et al., 2019</xref>), as well as production and release of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL8 (10), TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lang et al., 2002</xref>), IL1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ip and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>), and IL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>). Apoptosis occurs following exposure to hyperosmolarity beyond which adaptation is possible, the limit of which can vary between cell types but is sharply defined within each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>). Apoptosis following hyperosmotic stress is characterized by depolarization of mitochondria leading to an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Michea et al., 2002</xref>), as well as sometimes by clustering and internalization of TNFα receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosette and Karin, 1996</xref>). This potentially contributes to a number of human diseases, such as dry eye syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemp et al., 2011</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stookey et al., 2004</xref>), and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that NF-κB-dependent signaling is pro-apoptotic in high-intensity hyperosmotic stress, in part via induction of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). The NF-κB transcription factor family consists of five subunits, three of which have transactivation activity (RelA/p65, Rel/c-Rel, and RelB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb">www.bu.edu/nf-kb</ext-link>). These subunits are extensively post-translationally modified and can homodimerize or heterodimerize to form unique complexes that fine-tune different transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009</xref>). NF-κB p65 has been previously shown to play a role in both hyperosmotic stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Németh et al., 2002</xref>). NF-κB p65 is phosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus in hyperosmotic conditions, and induces the transcription of a number of proinflammatory target genes, such as <italic>Nos2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jia et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Il6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>Tnfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwata et al., 1999</xref>), as well as caspase 3/9 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisner et al., 2006</xref>).

PKR is activated under hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>), and it has also been shown previously to regulate NF-κB signaling in inflammatory conditions, via the direct phosphorylation of the inhibitor of κB (IκB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 1994</xref>) or interaction with the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishii et al., 2001</xref>). PKR activation and downstream NF-κB signaling were also evident after high intensity hyperosmotic treatment with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 10%) in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, we observed adaptation to low intensity hyperosmotic treatment (5% DSS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). PKR consists of two repeated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding motifs, DRBM I and DRBM II, and a C-terminal kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemens and Elia, 1997</xref>). PKR phosphorylates Ser-51 of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α subunit (eIF2α), contributing to inhibition of global mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saelens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bevilacqua et al., 2010</xref>). Although PKR is classically activated by the binding of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to the dsRNA-binding domain, we have shown that the binding of dsRNA is unnecessary for PKR activation and downstream eIF2α phosphorylation in hyperosmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another potential mechanism of PKR activation is via protein–protein binding of PKR and the PKR-activating protein (PACT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patel and Sen, 1998</xref>). PACT is a dsRNA-binding protein that can bind PKR at several domains including the two dsRNA-binding domains and the N-terminal portion of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). PACT interaction with the kinase domain of PKR, inhibits its closed conformation and promotes an open, active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to constitutive phosphorylations at Ser-18 and Ser-246, PACT can become additionally phosphorylated at Ser-287 in stress conditions such as arsenite treatment and oxidative stress, which leads to increased association with PKR and PKR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peters et al., 2006</xref>). The involvement of PACT in hyperosmotic stress conditions has not been previously investigated.</p><p>Here, we show that hyperosmotic stress induces PACT-mediated PKR activation, which disrupts the association of NF-κB c-Rel with other Rel homology domain (RHD)-containing binding partners NF-κB p65 and TonEBP. The loss of NF-κB c-Rel/NF-κB p65 and NF-κB c-Rel/TonEBP heterodimers in hyperosmotic conditions leads to a reduction in osmoadaptive and pro-survival gene transcription and enhances TonEBP/NF-κB p65-dependent proinflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also show that differential gene expression programs based on hyperosmotic stress intensity persist across multiple cell types and treatments with various osmolytes, the results of which equate to a universal switch from adaptation to increased inflammatory signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of PACT-PKR axis promotes proinflammatory gene expression in response to high-intensity hyperosmotic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) As stress intensity increases, signaling shifts from c-Rel-mediated adaptation to PACT/PKR-mediated inflammation.

We suppressed PACT expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by lentiviral delivery of an shRNA directed against PACT. In these stable knockdown shPACT MEFs, PACT protein levels were significantly reduced compared to MEFs infected with the control lentiviral vector (shCon) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Decrease in <italic>Prkra</italic> led to a substantial reduction in PKR activation at high-intensity hyperosmotic stress (600 mOsm) as measured by PKR phosphorylation at Serine-451 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This reduction in PKR activation correlated with the reduction of phosphorylation of PKR substrate eIF2α at serine-51. This suggests that PACT is necessary for PKR activation and downstream signaling in high intensity hyperosmotic stress conditions.</p><p>It has previously been shown that PKR and PACT interact at three distinct protein domains with varying degrees of specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). To verify that PACT interacts with PKR in response to hyperosmotic conditions, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in PKR KO MEFs that had been reconstituted with FLAG-tagged human PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Youssef et al., 2015</xref>). In unstressed or low-intensity stress conditions (500 mOsm sucrose or 5% w/v DSS), we found no PACT-PKR interaction; however, in high-intensity stress conditions (600 mOsm sucrose or 10% w/v DSS), PACT-PKR existed in a complex, suggesting stress intensity-induced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Several phosphorylation sites of PACT have been proposed as being necessary for PACT-mediated activation of PKR. Phosphorylation of Ser-287 occurs in response to various cellular stresses, and depends upon prior phosphorylation of Ser-246 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peters et al., 2006</xref>). To address the importance of these phosphorylation sites in high intensity hyperosmotic stress conditions, we reconstituted PACT KO MEFs with FLAG-tagged PACT constructs. When PACT KO MEFs were reconstituted with PACT bearing a mutated phosphosite at residue 287 (S287A), or at its prerequisite phosphosite residue 246 (S246A), interaction with PKR was diminished compared to the wild type (WT) PACT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Lacking these phosphorylation sites, and the interaction with PKR that depends on the modification of these residues, PKR was unable to be activated as measured by its autophosphorylation at Thr-451 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data indicate that in response to high-intensity hyperosmotic stress, PACT phosphorylation at residues Ser-246 and Ser-287 promote its interaction with PKR to activate its kinase activity.</p><p>To gain functional insight into the interaction of PACT with PKR, we examined cell fate in MEFs depleted of PACT. We hypothesized that if PACT was necessary to activate PKR in high stress intensity, a loss of PACT protein would demonstrate a corresponding decrease in high stress-induced apoptotic activity. We found that shPACT cells showed significantly reduced caspase-3 activity, suggesting that PACT has a pro-apoptotic role in high-intensity hyperosmotic stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), similar to PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). Combined with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, these data demonstrate that at low intensity stress conditions, there is neither any increase in caspase-3 activity nor interaction between PACT and PKR; PACT-PKR interaction and increased apoptosis only occur in high-intensity hyperosmotic stress. This result suggests that PACT-PKR interaction promoted PKR activation leading to apoptosis.</p><p>We have previously shown that expression of proinflammatory genes such as iNOS and IL6 are induced in high-intensity hyperosmotic conditions, and are in part dependent on signaling downstream of PKR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that if PACT played a role in PKR activation in hyperosmotic stress, the result of PACT knockdown would be a decrease in proinflammatory gene expression similar to the decrease observed in PKR-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). We found that loss of PACT led to a decrease in mRNA induction of several proinflammatory genes such as <italic>Nos2</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> under high intensity stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Further supporting the role of PACT-PKR signaling in high stress-induced inflammatory gene expression, we found that <italic>Nos2</italic> mRNA induction was also decreased in MEFs in which PACT phosphorylation at Ser-246 and Ser-287 was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and in which the kinase function of PKR was inactive by mutation of the catalytic lysine residue in the active site to arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The ability of PKR to bind to dsRNA did not affect <italic>Nos2</italic> mRNA levels in hyperosmotic stress conditions, as demonstrated by impairment of RNA binding via double mutation of key residues involved in this interaction, Lys-64 and Lys-154 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that functional PACT-PKR signaling is necessary for maximal expression of a subset of inflammatory genes. Finally, induction of osmoadaptive <italic>Slc38a2</italic> mRNA levels was unaffected after 3 hr of low-intensity stress treatment in cells depleted of PACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>); the decrease after 5 hr of low-intensity treatment may be a result of downstream PACT signaling on post-transcriptional mechanisms on <italic>Slc38a2</italic> mRNA accumulation. This decrease in osmoadaptive mRNA levels did not lead to caspase-3 activity or apoptosis under low intensity hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NF-κB c-Rel promotes the adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress</title><p>Given the crucial role of the TonEBP transcription program for osmoadaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>), we next examined the effects of PACT on the nuclear localization of TonEBP in high and low stress intensity. Although it is well established that TonEBP homodimers induce expression of osmoadaptive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>), it has also been reported that TonEBP can form complexes with NF-κB p65 via the shared Rel homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Since we have also shown that loss of PKR activation affects NF-κB nuclear accumulation in hyperosmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>), we speculated that the cellular context may influence TonEBP-mediated osmoadaptive gene expression. We therefore examined TonEBP expression and nuclear localization in shPACT MEFs treated with either high or low stress intensity. We found similar patterns in TonEBP nuclear localization upon PACT depletion either at low or at high stress intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This indicates that TonEBP alone may not be sufficient to induce maximum levels of expression of osmoadaptive genes in response to hyperosmotic conditions irrespective of stress intensity. We therefore speculated that additional Rel homology domain family members may play a role in osmoadaptation dependent on PACT-mediated PKR signaling. Interestingly, we found nuclear accumulation of the NF-κB family member c-Rel at lower intensity in the absence of PACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast to increased c-Rel, depletion of PACT decreases total NF-κB p65 and NF-κB p65-P(Ser-536) accumulation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which may result in a decrease in NF-κB p65-mediated activation of proinflammatory genes. Although PACT-mediated PKR activation appears to decrease cell survival during high intensity hyperosmotic stress, a deficiency in PACT did not affect cell survival at low intensity hyperosmotic conditions, and correlated with an increase in nuclear localization of NF-κB c-Rel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NF-κB c-Rel is a novel factor in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control and shPACT MEFs were treated with 500 or 600 mOsm.

To address this, we developed a stable knockdown MEF cell line deficient in NF-κB c-Rel. When treated with 500 mOsm medium, shc-Rel MEFs had higher levels of caspase-3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting a pro-survival role for NF-κB c-Rel. If NF-κB c-Rel plays a role in the adaptive signaling pathway at this low intensity of stress, we hypothesized that its absence would inhibit osmoadaptive gene expression, and perhaps simultaneously promote proinflammatory signaling. Indeed, when cells are depleted of NF-κB c-Rel, NF-κB p65-P(Ser-536) accumulates in the nucleus at low intensity hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a hallmark of the apoptotic signaling pathway previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). This increase in NF-κB p65-P(Ser-536) correlates with an increase in iNOS mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data suggest that NF-κB c-Rel is a novel factor in the transition from adaptation to proinflammatory gene expression programs with increasing stress intensity.</p><p>To further investigate the role of NF-κB c-Rel in low intensity stress, we examined in detail the adaptive program to hyperosmotic stress in the absence of NF-κB c-Rel. First we confirmed that the low stress-mediated induction of osmoadaptive gene targets SNAT2 and GADD34 are dependent on TonEBP in our experimental system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Next, we examined how loss of NF-κB c-Rel affects the low intensity stress-induced transcriptional induction of these adaptive mRNAs. We found that transcription of <italic>Slc38a2</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> is indeed diminished in NF-κB c-Rel-suppressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These data identify SNAT2 and GADD34 as gene targets not only of the TonEBP-mediated transcriptional response to hyperosmotic stress, but also of the NF-κB c-Rel-mediated adaptive response. To our knowledge, the dependence of osmoadaptation on NF-κB c-Rel is a new finding in the literature. The reduction in <italic>Slc38a2</italic> mRNA in shc-Rel MEFs led to reduced protein levels in both immature, unprocessed SNAT2 and the mature glycosylated form, as determined by western blot analysis of cytoplasmic membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). GADD34 protein levels were also reduced in shc-Rel MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). As expected, decreased protein levels of both SNAT2 and GADD34 resulted in decreased SNAT2 functionality, as measured via uptake of the amino acid proline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the roles of both NF-κB c-Rel and TonEBP in mediating <italic>Slc38a2</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic>transcription, we performed luciferase reporter gene assays using constructs bearing the endogenous SNAT2 promoter from base pairs −1159 to +59 respective to the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), or the endogenous GADD34 promoter from base pairs −1000 to +1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

To confirm that the observed shift in Rel-homology domain complex composition is dependent on PACT via its function in PKR activation, we first used a pharmacological inhibitor of the kinase activity of PKR (PKRi), which we have described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). While FLAG-tagged NF-κB c-Rel did not pull down TonEBP or NF-κB p65 in high-intensity hyperosmotic conditions in untreated cells, PKRi treatment promoted the maintenance of these complexes even at high intensity hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition, reconstitution of PACT KO MEFs with PACT bearing phosphosite mutations S246A or S287A demonstrated that loss of PACT functionality in PKR activation also shifted the makeup of Rel-homology domain complexes to resemble the composition in a low stress intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).

Upon loss of NF-κB c-Rel, the percentage of nuclear NF-κB p65 over total cellular NF-κB was basally higher (12%) than in control cells (1%) prior to low-intensity stress, and increased to a much higher percentage (43%) than in control cells (19%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, middle). Upon loss of PACT, accumulation of c-Rel in the nucleus were greater after low intensity-hyperosmotic treatment (29%) than in control cells (8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right). It is important to note that after high intensity hyperosmotic treatments, 86% of total cellular NF-κB c-Rel and over 75% of total NF-κB p65 are found in the cytoplasm. This suggests that NF-κB p65 and c-Rel species may not be the major transcription factors activated to translocate to the nucleus in response to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left). This response differs from other treatments such as LPS or TNFα treatment, in which the vast majority of cellular NF-κB species accumulate in the nucleus upon treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2017</xref>).

This correlates with a loss of TonEBP/NF-κB c-Rel and NF-κB p65/NF-κB c-Rel complexes, and instead an accumulation of TonEBP/NF-κB p65 complexes with potential to induce transcription of proinflammatory genes such as IL6 and Tnfrsf9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that PACT-PKR interaction is necessary for PKR activation and the expression of inflammatory genes and cell death under hyperosmotic conditions. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which PACT-PKR signaling promotes proinflammatory gene expression in a stress intensity-dependent manner, via the modulation of interactions among members of the Rel-homology-domain family of transcription factors. Specifically, we show that in low intensity hyperosmotic stress, NF-κB subunit c-Rel forms complexes with Rel-homology domain transcription factor TonEBP. This interaction preserves adaptive signaling at low-intensity stress via the induced transcription of a key factor in the adaptive response, SNAT2, and its positive regulator, GADD34. The loss of these complexes at high-intensity stress may lead to increased TonEBP interaction with NF-κB p65 and subsequent increased expression of proinflammatory genes such as IL6 and Tnfrsf9. The conservation of this loss of adaptive (<italic>Slc38a2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic>) gene expression indicates conserved expression programs in response to hyperosmotic stress.</p><p>The mechanism of PKR activation by PACT is only partially understood. PACT is known to bind to PKR via the N-terminal dsRNA binding domains and the C-terminal kinase domain, though only binding of the kinase domain is necessary for subsequent PKR phosphorylation at Thr-451 and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). Phosphorylation of PACT at Ser-246 and Ser-287 has been demonstrated to occur constitutively and in response to various cellular stresses such as thapsigargin, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium arsenite treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 1999</xref>). We show here that the same sites are likely phosphorylated under hyperosmotic conditions, and are necessary for the activation of PKR. PKR activation via PACT was previously reported in conditions of overexpression of PACT protein, treatment with actinomycin D, growth factor withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marques et al., 2008</xref>), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). This PACT-mediated activation of PKR in ER stress has been shown to be required for apoptosis after tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singh et al., 2009</xref>); similarly, PACT phosphorylation at Ser-287 was increased, and association with binding partner TRBP was decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chukwurah and Patel, 2018</xref>), hinting at an additional mechanism of regulation. To our knowledge this is the first report of PACT-mediated PKR activation in hyperosmotic stress conditions. It is shown here that signaling along the PACT-PKR axis has pro-apoptotic functions during high-intensity hyperosmotic stress. Our findings are in agreement with a human disease state of dystonia, in which an identified PACT mutation was shown to increase association with PKR, correlating with increased apoptosis in patient-derived lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vaughn et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We show here that PKR activation affects the nuclear accumulation of Rel homology domain transcription factors. The exact nature of this mechanism is still unknown. PKR has been shown to directly phosphorylate the inhibitor of κB protein IκBα in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 1994</xref>), although a loss of PKR does not affect hyperosmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the exact mechanism by which PKR signaling affects specific NF-κB dimers in response to hyperosmotic stress remains unclear. It is possible that a subset of NF-κB complexes in the cytoplasm are affected by PACT-PKR signaling via additional interacting or intermediary proteins, and that this subset translocates to the nucleus in response to hyperosmotic stress response. The identification of these complexes and intermediaries will remain for future studies.</p><p>PACT when not bound to PKR appears to have some effect on the TonEBP-dependent osmoadaptive gene expression program. Although SNAT2 mRNA is still induced at low stress intensity in PACT-deficient cells, it is induced to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that PACT may be important for osmoadaptation. The mechanisms of the osmoadaptive action of PACT independent of PKR are not known. Because other osmoadaptive mRNAs, such as <italic>Slc6a6</italic> and <italic>Akr1b1</italic> also show reduced induction in PACT-deficient MEFs compared to wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), it is suggested that PACT depletion may indirectly inhibit the TonEBP-dependent osmoadaptive program.

As both expression of SNAT2 and the NF-κB c-Rel/TonEBP complex are present at low-intensity stress and lost at high-intensity stress, it follows that <italic>Slc38a2</italic> transcription may result from binding of the NF-κB c-Rel/TonEBP complex to the <italic>Slc38a2</italic> promoter. Still outstanding is definitive proof that TonEBP/NF-κB c-Rel complex nuclear accumulation promotes DNA binding and increased transcription, as these aspects can be regulated separately via IκB degradation and re-synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Dea and Hoffmann, 2010</xref>). It is possible that localized DNA characteristics dictate the binding of NF-κB c-Rel/TonEBP complexes to specific gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samee et al., 2019</xref>), or that activation of transcription of these genes is dependent on unique interacting transcription-enhancing proteins rather than DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In-depth analysis of the binding sites of Rel-homology domain transcription factor heterodimers will need to be performed on genes responsive to NF-κB c-Rel/TonEBP complexes to determine what differences may exist between these and classical tonicity-responsive enhancer sites (TonE sites) known to respond to TonEBP homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stroud et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>TonEBP target genes that have been described in the literature include those necessary for osmoadaptation, such as <italic>Slc38a2</italic>, <italic>Akr1b1</italic>, and <italic>Slc6a6</italic>, as well as several that are involved in inflammation, such as <italic>Nos2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Ccl2</italic> and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buxadé et al., 2012</xref>). The combination of TonEBP and NF-κB p65 has been shown to induce transcription of only these inflammatory genes, and not osmoadaptive TonEBP targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Nos2</italic> gene expression was shown to be dependent on the presence of NF-κB p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farabaugh et al., 2017</xref>), and hyperamplification of its expression correlated with increased levels of nuclear NF-κB p65, as both were increased upon loss of NF-κB c-Rel. This may indicate that controlling the availability of p65 is a critical factor in the amplification of proinflammatory signaling during hyperosmotic stress. Although iNOS was not regulated by TonEBP in response to hyperosmotic stress, other proinflammatory NF-κB targets were induced, including <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). It has been shown that while <italic>Nos2</italic> induction is dependent on STAT1 and IRF1 signaling in response to cytokine stimulation, IL6 secretion is independent of this signaling pathway in mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Samardzic et al., 2001</xref>); it is likely that elements in the promoters of these genes exist that lead to differential expression in unique cellular contexts dependent on cell type or stress stimulant.</p><p>In this report, we identified the existence of NF-κB c-Rel in complexes with either TonEBP or NF-κB p65 in MEFs. Fibroblasts in particular can be an appropriate model system because not only are they present in all tissues, but they can act as sentinels that can produce inflammatory factors such as Toll-like receptors and cytokines in response to environmental stresses, such as in defense against microbial invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bautista-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>). This study shows that subsets of genes that share functionality in osmoadaptation and proinflammatory signaling can be targets of specific Rel-homology domain complexes in MEFs, such as TonEBP/NF-κB c-Rel or TonEBP/NF-κB p65, respectively. These complexes were disrupted under high intensity stress conditions in a PACT/PKR-mediated manner. At this high intensity of stress, osmoadaptive genes were not induced, suggesting a duality of TonEBP function. Our data suggest that this duality of function is mediated via formation of complexes with partners, NF-κB p65 or NF-κB c-Rel. It seems plausible that in osmoadaptive conditions, competition between NF-κB c-Rel and NF-κB p65 binding to TonEBP can act as a rheostat between NF-κB c-Rel-mediated osmoadaptive signaling and NF-κB p65-mediated proinflammatory signaling. The existing literature shows anecdotal evidence of NF-κB subunits serving different functions in various cellular contexts: NF-κB c-Rel can have opposing functions to NF-κB p65 in neurons, where NF-κB c-Rel promotes neuronal survival while NF-κB p65 promotes neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pizzi et al., 2002</xref>); or c-Rel repressing p65-mediated expression of HIV protein LTR and IL-2Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doerre et al., 1993</xref>); or c-Rel-driven TRAIL-induced apoptosis rescued by overexpression of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). NF-κB subunits can also serve redundant functions; the loss of some individual NF-κB family members can be compensated for by other NF-κB family members, evidenced by deficiency of peripheral lymphoid cells as a result of loss of pro-survival proteins A1 and Bcl-2 in NF-κB p65/NF-κB c-Rel/TNF knockout mice, which is not present in either NF-κB p65/TNF or NF-κB c-Rel knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossmann et al., 2000</xref>). This is also consistent with genes being targets of specific NF-κB family members only in certain cell types, such as HEK cells having predominantly NF-κB p65/p50 dimers while NF-κB c-Rel is functionally negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Dea and Hoffmann, 2010</xref>), or B cells, in which NF-κB c-Rel/p50 is the predominant complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sen, 2006</xref>). The function of these NF-κB c-Rel/TonEBP complexes identified here need to be examined in specific cell types and conditions to be able to directly compare their function with that of other NF-κB complexes.</p><p>We have shown here that in high-intensity hyperosmotic stress conditions, osmoadaptation is terminated. However, KEGG pathway analysis of our RNA-seq data in high-intensity stress showed that the most significantly upregulated pathway at high-intensity stress is associated with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), specifically genes that encode ribosomal proteins. It is possible that this increase in transcription is an attempt to recover translation capacity from the sustained reduction in protein synthesis associated with continued stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bevilacqua et al., 2010</xref>). This trend is consistent with the hypothesis that mRNAs transcribed upon high-intensity hyperosmotic stress exposure will be translated upon recovery of cap-dependent protein synthesis upon recovery to iso-osmolarity. Future studies will determine if the cellular response to severe stress involves alternative adaptation mechanisms to return to iso-osmolar conditions.</p><p>The novel PACT-PKR signaling pathway expanded upon here will aid our understanding of potential mechanisms involved in hyperactivation of proinflammatory conditions. It is important to note that the influence of PACT-mediated PKR activation on proinflammatory gene expression is only observed in high-intensity stress. It remains to be determined whether drugs that inhibit PKR activation, including C16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), or compounds that disrupt PACT/PKR-mediated signaling, such as luteolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dabo et al., 2017</xref>), will be effective in treating diseases with inflammatory components, such as IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>), or diseases with a hyperosmotic component, such as dry eye syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemp et al., 2011</xref>). This signaling pathway may also be relevant in certain cancers, such as breast cancer and glioblastoma; inhibition of PKR has been proposed to sensitize Trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ breast cancer to increase efficacy of Trastuzumab in preventing tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darini et al., 2019</xref>), and inhibition of NF-κB signaling or iNOS inhibition have been demonstrated to slow growth of glioblastoma stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eyler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2016</xref>). Proliferation and function of other stem cells, such as hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells, are also regulated by PKR activation and inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), and may be relevant model systems to further the exploration of the PACT-PKR signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Cell lines used include MEF, HEK293T, RAW, and HLE12 maintained in the lab.

The mechanisms that link hypertonicity to inflammation in disease are poorly defined and this work has the potential to advance the fields of cellular stress and inflammation. While previous studies established that PKR was activated under hyperosmotic stress conditions, stimulating inflammation through NF-κB, these new data provide evidence that the RNA-binding protein, PACT, interacting with PKR, enhances transcriptional programming favoring pro-inflammatory signaling at the expense of osmoadaptation. The pro-inflammatory transcriptional response to hyperosmotic stress resulted from preferential formation of TonEBP/NF-κB p65 heterodimers promoted by the PACT-PKR complex, rather than TonEBP/NF-κB c-Rel. The studies also highlight the function of c-Rel in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic stress at low stress levels, and that higher stress levels cause a change in the subunit compositions of the transcription factors belonging to the Rel family. Collectively, these data support a model that connects hyper-osmotic stress to pro-inflammatory responses through the PACT-PKR complex, identifying this complex as a potential target in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or dry eye syndrome that involve osmotic imbalance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rigor of the study would be improved by ChIP analysis with c-Rel, TonEBP, and p65 RelA antibodies on endogenous promoters under conditions of low and high stress to demonstrate more directly the association of the relevant transcriptional regulators with target genes in high and low osmotic stress conditions. This is important because shifts in dimeric compositions of the Rel family transcription factors that occur from low stress to high stress conditions are demonstrated only under artificial overexpression conditions.</p><p>2) Substantial reorganization of the manuscript to include the following:</p><p>a) Addressing concerns about the claims based on data in Figure 1E.

Is SNAT2 mRNA regulated at mRNA stability level by PACT-PKR axis?</p><p>The key claim of the authors maintains that PACT/PKR signaling impairs osmoadaptation. In Figure 1E they show, however, that the levels of the osmoadaptive response gene SNAT2 are independent of PACT. This questions their key claim. In line with this, the authors state that Nos2 belongs to the group of inflammatory genes induced by high osmotic stress. However, in Figure 5 it is surprising that Nos2 does not any more belong to this group. This warrants an explanation.</p><p>b) Overall, it was felt that the assessment of c-Rel in the DSS in vivo model does not substantiate the in vitro findings on hyperosmotic stress but is a separate story. Therefore, consider removing the c-Rel in vivo data as it does not contribute strongly to the conclusions of the manuscript in its current form.</p><p>c) Revise the text with attention to the specific suggestions, but also with detailed attention to proofreading and a more concise structure.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PACT-PKR activation acts as a hyperosmotic stress intensity sensor weakening osmoadaptation and enhancing inflammation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewer argues that this is in contrast to the authors’ claim that PACT-PKR signaling only affects osmoadaptation at high stress intensity (600 mOsm) when PACT-PKR interaction is observed. To address the possibility that PACT affects the level of SNAT2 mRNA at the level of mRNA stability, we performed an RNA stability assay using Actinomycin D after 3 h treatment with 500 mOsm stress media. The results (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) actually showed that both SNAT2 and GADD34 mRNA stability was increased in PACT KO MEFs while AR mRNA stability was not, suggesting that PACT may contribute to increased degradation of the SNAT2 and GADD34 mRNAs during osmoadaptation, via direct or indirect mechanisms. In addition, we obtained similar data on the half-lives of these mRNAs from PKR KO cells treated with 500 mOsm. Both SNAT2 and GADD34 mRNA stability was increased in PKR KO MEFs (data not shown). This data is in agreement with the effects of PACT/PKR being inhibitory in the osmoadaptation program, which is the conclusion of this manuscript. It is possible that small amounts of PACT-mediated PKR activation that are not observed by co-IP contribute to this degradation. It is known that PACT can play a role in mRNA stability via interaction with RNA-binding protein TRBP. It will remain for future studies to determine whether this PACT/TRBP interaction plays a role in stability of osmoadaptive mRNAs in hyperosmotic stress conditions. The mechanism via which the PACT/PKR signaling controls mRNA stability during osmoadaptation will be the focus of our future studies.</p><p>As the stability of SNAT2 mRNA was not lessened by knockout of PACT, we hypothesized that PACT may instead affect transcription of the general TonEBP osmoadaptive program. RT-qPCR showed that levels of AR and TauT, also TonEBP targets, were similarly reduced at the low stress intensity in PACT KO MEFs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). We conclude that PACT likely has some effects on the adaptive TonEBP-dependent transcriptional program via unknown mechanisms.</p><p>We have shown that iNOS mRNA levels do rise with intensity of hyperosmotic stress by RT-qPCR. The RNA-Seq data also show a similar trend in iNOS mRNA induction; however, several factors prohibit this data from being included in the manuscript. The raw number of reads for iNOS mRNA was very low, such that the fpkm only increased from 0.003 to 0.017. In addition, the variability among the replicates results in very large error bars, and very high p values.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Induction of Nos2 mRNA was too variable and had too low FPKM to be statistically significant.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52241-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>b) We have removed the in vivodata in c-Rel-deficient mice.</p><p>c) The entire text has been proofread.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the revised manuscript provides compelling evidence for a PACT-PKR dependent mechanism that controls switching between an osmoadaptive and an inflammatory mechanism.
