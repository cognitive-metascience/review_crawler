We find that the synaptic ribbon serves a dual function as a conduit for diffusion of synaptic vesicles and a platform for vesicles to fuse distal to the plasma membrane itself, via compound fusion.

When a neuron is activated, it triggers the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters at the synapse, which bind to and activate neighbouring neurons. Neurons involved in vision, sound and balance contain “ribbon” synapses, which are able to release neurotransmitters steadily over longer periods of time than other types of synapse.</p><p>Neurotransmitters inside neurons are packaged into small structures called vesicles, which can then fuse with the cell’s surface membrane to release the neurotransmitters from the cell. Unlike other types of synapse, ribbon synapses are able to release these vesicles in a continuous fashion. How vesicles move around at the synapses remains poorly understood because monitoring the vesicles in living cells is technically difficult and previous studies were limited to tracking vesicles in a small part of the synapse. Now, Vaithianathan et al. overcome these technical hurdles to follow the movement of vesicles across whole ribbon synapses in zebrafish eyes.</p><p>The experiments use fluorescent proteins to track the movement of the vesicles under a microscope. Vaithianathan et al. find that vesicles at ribbon synapses move very little when the neurons are not active. However, when the neurons are activated, the vesicles that are near the cell membrane fuse with it and release their neurotransmitters. Other vesicles that are further away from the membrane then move to fill in the spaces vacated by the fusing vesicles.</p><p>Further experiments show that some of the vesicles that are further away from the membrane can fuse with vesicles that have already released their neurotransmitter but remain in place at the membrane. This process – known as compound fusion – allows neurotransmitters to be released over a longer period of time by providing a path for vesicles to release neurotransmitters without having to approach the membrane first. The next challenge is to develop a computational model using the data from this study to better understand how ribbon synapses work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13245.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13245.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>presynaptic mechanisms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY003821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of tethered diffusion of release-ready synaptic vesicles and vesicle-vesicle fusion supports neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic active zone of sensory synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons communicate at synapses, where chemical neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic terminal by fusion of transmitter-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. A macromolecular complex, the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Südhof, 2012</xref>) is thought to capture and organize synaptic vesicles to support neurotransmitter release by presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sigrist and Schmitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gundelfinger and Fijtova, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hallermann and Silver, 2013</xref>), but the dynamics of this process at living synapses remain largely elusive. In order to follow the trafficking of vesicles in real time at the CAZ, methods are needed to label and image both vesicles and the active zone at the same time in living synapses. To label the living active zone, we used fluorescent Ribeye-binding peptide (RBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zenisek et al., 2004</xref>), which marks the synaptic ribbon found at the active zones of retinal bipolar cells (BPCs) and other neurons that release neurotransmitter continuously in response to graded changes in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>). However, monitoring the trafficking of tiny synaptic vesicles (30–50 nm in diameter) is a technical challenge, which we were able to meet by targeting a photoactivatable fluorescent protein to synaptic vesicles and using super-resolution photoactivated localization microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>) to track movements of single vesicles in voltage-clamped synaptic terminals. We also targeted the exocytosis reporter pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>) to synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>) in order to detect vesicle fusion. These approaches then allowed us to analyze the trafficking and fusion of vesicles at the active zone of BPC ribbon synapses during ongoing neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Previously, studies of synaptic vesicle trafficking and fusion at ribbon synapses of BPCs have been carried out using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to image single vesicles labeled with FM dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zenisek et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Holt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Midorikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zenisek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Joselevitch and Zenisek, 2009</xref>). Some of the conclusions from this work are: 1) vesicles stably associate with ribbons in the absence of stimulation (‘residents’), 2) these resident vesicles rapidly undergo exocytosis in response to depolarization, and 3) new vesicles (‘newcomers’) appear, move toward the membrane, and fuse during sustained depolarization. Although TIRFM is a powerful approach to study membrane-associated phenomena, it is limited to imaging labeled vesicles within ~100 nm of the plasma membrane (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zenisek et al., 2000</xref>), which is insufficient to provide coverage of all the ribbon-associated vesicles. The method also requires tight adherence of the plasma membrane to a planar substrate, which restricts observations to a small part of the terminal and eliminates the natural membrane curvature in that observable region. Furthermore, to our knowledge, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Midorikawa et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zenisek (2008)</xref> have combined vesicle imaging with ribbon labeling, and then only in sequentially acquired images separated by some time, which were intended to test whether observed hotspots of fusion coincided with ribbons. Because of these limitations, we used two-color laser scanning methods that allowed single labeled vesicles to be observed throughout the full extent of the ribbon in voltage-clamped synaptic terminals, while the ribbon and cell border were imaged with a second fluorescent label. Since the positions of the ribbon and a labeled vesicle were known accurately, we were able to detect vesicle movements on the ribbon prior to fusion and determine where vesicles resided on the ribbon when they fused. Therefore, our experiments complement and significantly extend the previous studies based on TIRFM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To track single vesicles, we targeted the photoactivatable fluorescent protein paRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Subach et al., 2010</xref>) to synaptic vesicles by fusing it to the C-terminus of the vesicle membrane protein Vglut1 (vesicular glutamate transporter 1). The resulting fusion protein was then inducibly expressed in transgenic zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Synaptic vesicles bearing Vglut1-paRFP participated normally in the vesicle cycle, since they were labeled by activity-dependent uptake of FM dye. By photoactivating Vglut1-paRFP at low density, we ensured that a field of view contained only a single fluorescent synaptic vesicle, which we then localized using high-resolution confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both mobile and immobile vesicles were visible after photoactivation (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), but the immobile vesicles were closely associated with ribbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), which were labeled with green-fluorescent RBP introduced via a whole-cell patch pipette. Therefore, we conclude that the ribbon-associated vesicles are immobile because they are tethered to or near the ribbon itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These immobile vesicles likely correspond to the ‘resident’ vesicles observed at BPC active zones using TIRFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zenisek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Midorikawa et al., 2007</xref>), except that our laser-scanning method detected vesicles located everywhere on the ribbon instead of only in a region &lt;100 nm from the plasma membrane (the region marked with pink shading for illustrative purposes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13245.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptic vesicles labeled with Vglut1-paRFP stably associate with synaptic ribbons at the active zone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stereogram of a 3D reconstruction from a series of confocal optical sections through the synaptic terminal of a zebrafish BPC, showing photoactivated Vglut1-paRFP (red) near synaptic ribbons (green).

A series of x-y images was acquired while the synaptic terminal was voltage-clamped at -60 mV to prevent release, and after averaging over 4–10 frames to reduce noise, the positions of the paRFP spot and ribbon were determined by fitting 2D-Gaussians, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Vesicle position was then expressed relative to the center of the ribbon (i.e., the peak of the ribbon 2D-Gaussian) in order to control for small movements of the cell and/or ribbon during an experiment. The vesicle position estimated in this manner varied little during the 90-s imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), within ranges that averaged 27 nm on the x-axis and 17 nm on the y-axis. Assuming that vesicles actually did not move during the imaging, we attribute the observed variation in estimated position to imaging noise that limits the spatial resolution. Therefore, genuine stimulus-induced vesicle movements on the ribbon of approximately a vesicle diameter would be resolvable by comparing averaged x-y images before and after stimulation.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vesicle turnover and replenishment on ribbons</title><p>What happens to the immobile ribbon-associated vesicles during transmitter release?

This pattern revealed by single-vesicle imaging is consistent with selective fusion of membrane-proximal synaptic vesicles during brief depolarization, but preferential recruitment of new vesicles at the opposite pole of the ribbon to replace those lost, as suggested previously from population behavior of vesicles labeled with FM dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Vaithianathan and Matthews, 2014</xref>).

The great majority of such 'displacements' were less than a vesicle diameter and are therefore attributable to noise. However, after 10-ms stimulation, displacements were larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; p≈0, Wilcoxon rank test), which is consistent with the prediction that the loss of ribbon-associated vesicles allows movement of remaining vesicles.</p><p>We next examined the direction of motion by plotting the vesicle displacement as a vector from the starting position. Without stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), vector amplitudes were mostly within the range expected for imaging noise (93% were &lt;50 nm; see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> for an expanded view to better reveal the large number of small vectors), and the direction of the vector was equally likely to be toward or away from the membrane (positive and negative ΔΔx, respectively, indicated by green and red vectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The average vector amplitude was therefore zero (black dot at the center of vector clusters). Rare larger excursions were also observed, which may reflect a low rate of genuine vesicle movement occurring spontaneously on the ribbon at the holding potential of -60 mV. After 10-ms stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), vector amplitudes were significantly larger (77% were &gt;50 nm; p&lt;10<sup>-6</sup>, Wilcoxon rank test), and there was a significant tendency for movement toward the membrane, with 70% of vectors having a positive ΔΔx (p=0.0008 that + and – ΔΔx were equally likely, by sign test). Amplitudes of vectors both toward the membrane (green vectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and away from the membrane (red vectors) were significantly larger after stimulation than in the absence of stimulation (+ΔΔx: 89 ± 8 nm vs. 17 ± 1 nm, p≈0, Wilcoxon rank test; -ΔΔx: 59 ± 6 nm vs. 16 ± 1 nm, p&lt;10<sup>-12</sup>, Wilcoxon rank test). Overall, the average vector after stimulation (black arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) was a displacement by 33 nm toward the membrane, or approximately one vesicle diameter. Since movements both toward and away from the plasma membrane were enhanced by stimulation, the results suggest a mechanism of passive diffusion of tethered vesicles along the ribbon, such as the recently proposed 'crowd-surfing' model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Graydon et al., 2014</xref>), rather than a directed motor. In such a passive mechanism, the net movement toward the membrane that we observed after stimulation is due to preferential release of vesicles near the membrane by 10-ms depolarization, creating the opportunity for more distal vesicles to diffuse into the vacated positions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Vesicle dynamics during the sustained component of release</title><p>In addition to the rapid burst of release at the onset of depolarization, ribbon synapses also release neurotransmitter continuously during sustained depolarization. To examine vesicle trafficking during this sustained component of release evoked by depolarization from -60 mV to -10 mV for &gt;0.5 s, we measured fluorescence along a short scan-line perpendicular to the plasma membrane, which yielded x-t raster plots that were analyzed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to determine the x-axis position of paRFP spots relative to the synaptic ribbon and the plasma membrane (also see Image analysis section of Materials and methods).

To detect the fusion of ribbon-associated vesicles, we generated transgenic zebrafish that express the exocytosis reporter SypHy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>) (Synaptophysin-pHluorin fusion protein) or Vglut1-pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>) under control of heat-shock promoter. Since pHluorin-fusion proteins mixed with pre-existing native vesicle proteins, pHluorin events were sparse during depolarization, allowing detection and localization of single events with respect to the ribbon, in the same manner as paRFP-labeled vesicles. For 2-color imaging, ribbons were labeled with deep-red CF633-RBP, which did not interfere with pHluorin fluorescence. Under these conditions, unitary pHluorin events representing vesicle fusion were observed in x-t raster plots during sustained depolarizing voltage-clamp steps from -60 to -15 mV for 500–5000 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), but not in the absence of stimulation.

However, the majority of pHluorin events still arose at a substantial distance from the estimated membrane position, even after correcting for z-axis curvature (dashed arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Another source of uncertainty in localizing pHluorin events could be changes in ribbon position along the z-axis within the optical section, since we normalized x-axis positions of pHluorin events with respect to the center of the ribbon in constructing the histogram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Major errors seem unlikely to arise from such changes in ribbon position within the optical section, because light from the entire optical section contributes to the x-axis intensity profile used to localize the ribbon in a given focal position. To estimate the extent of error from this source, we measured the change in x-axis position of ribbons as the focal plane was varied within a z-axis range from appearance to disappearance of the ribbon. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, the center of the Gaussian component of the fit to the RBP profile varied somewhat with focal position, especially near the upper and lower z-axis bounds, where fluorescence intensity of the ribbon was lower (e.g., sample traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). However, the estimated x-axis position of the ribbon varied by less than ± 50 nm throughout the central part of the sampled z-axis range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore, the observed uncertainty in the x-axis position of ribbons within the optical section is insufficient to account for the wide range of pHluorin-event locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that pHluorin events associated with ribbons arose both near the membrane and at more distal locations, at a substantial distance from the membrane. A simple explanation is that the distal pHluorin events represent fusion of synaptic vesicles with other ribbon-attached vesicles, which have themselves already undergone exocytosis and provide a path to the extracellular space. This model is also consistent with previous work using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Matthews and Sterling, 2008</xref>), which suggested the existence of such vesicle-vesicle compound fusion at ribbon synapses of goldfish BPCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we exploited the special features of ribbon synapses of retinal BPCs to observe the trafficking of single synaptic vesicles associated with the CAZ during ongoing transmitter release. Prior studies of synaptic vesicle trafficking at BPC ribbon synapses using TIRFM focused on a narrow region extending ~100 nm from the plasma membrane and revealed vesicle movements within this region, as well as vesicle exocytosis at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zenisek et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Holt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Midorikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zenisek, 2008</xref>). By contrast, our imaging approaches allowed vesicle motion and fusion to be detected across the entire population of ribbon-associated vesicles, albeit at a spatial resolution insufficient for detection of small movements of less than a vesicle diameter, like those reported in TIRFM experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zenisek et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, our studies target a different set of questions and provide results that are complementary to the previous studies of synaptic vesicle dynamics at ribbon active zones.</p><p>Our results suggest a dual role for the synaptic ribbon in neurotransmitter release at the active zone, with the ribbon serving as both a conduit for diffusion of tethered synaptic vesicles and a platform for vesicles to fuse distal to the plasma membrane. A likely mechanism for such distal fusions is compound fusion of synaptic vesicles with other vesicles. Diffusion appeared to dominate for ribbon-associated vesicles farthest from the plasma membrane, which moved toward the center of the ribbon prior to loss during sustained depolarization. Synaptic vesicle fusion detected by pHluorin events occurred most frequently on the membrane-proximal half of the ribbon, perhaps because calcium levels are higher nearer the membrane during depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zenisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Francis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Vaithianathan and Matthews, 2014</xref>). These fusion events include some that likely occurred directly at the plasma membrane, which possibly correspond to the fusions seen in TIRFM experiments. However, many pHluorin events arose at distances &gt;100 nm from the estimated position of the plasma membrane, suggesting that compound fusion contributes significantly to ongoing transmitter release at ribbon synapses during sustained depolarization. Overall, our results set the stage for models of synaptic vesicle trafficking and fusion at the ribbon active zone that incorporate calcium signaling, the kinetics of tethered diffusion of vesicles, and vesicle-vesicle fusion at a distance from the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were in accord with NIH guidelines and followed protocol 247885 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Stony Brook University.

Although it was concentrated at ribbons, fluorescent RBP also filled the entire cell, allowing the border of the synaptic terminal to be visualized with fluorescence imaging (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Voltage-clamp data were acquired using a HEKA EPC-9 amplifier controlled by PatchMaster software (HEKA, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany).

Separate xy-scanners allowed simultaneous imaging and photoactivation. The focal plane was carefully adjusted to bring labeled ribbons into sharp focus, avoiding the region of high curvature near the top of the terminal and the plane of adherence of the membrane to the glass coverslip at the bottom of the terminal.

For analysis of changes elicited by brief stimuli, 4–10 paRFP images were collected, followed by 10-ms depolarization or no stimulation, and the sequence was repeated at 18-s intervals. Images of the ribbon marked with RBP were taken either just before the series of RFP images, or in sequential alternation with each RFP image of the series. Images were then averaged for each repeat, and the positions of paRFP spots and the ribbon were determined from the peak of a 2D Gaussian fitted using IGOR Pro. Positions of paRFP spots were then expressed as Δx and Δy relative to the center of the ribbon for each repeat. Changes in relative RFP position across repeats were then calculated as ΔΔx and ΔΔy. For analysis of changes during sustained stimuli, a line perpendicular to the membrane at a ribbon location was scanned at intervals of ~1.4 ms, with alternation between RBP and paRFP or pHluorin channels on successive lines, or on successive frames. The resulting x-t images were typically averaged in ImageJ over 2 pixels in the x-axis and 5–8 lines in the t-axis to reduce noise. Positions of the ribbon and paRFP spots along the scanned line were determined by fitting the x-axis intensity profile with the equation <italic>f(x) = s(x) + g(x)</italic>, where <italic>s(x)</italic> is a sigmoid describing the transition from intracellular to extracellular background fluorescence at the edge of the cell, given by <italic>s(x) = b-(c/(1-exp((x<sub>1/2</sub>-x)/d)))</italic>, and <italic>g(x)</italic> is a Gaussian representing the fluorescence of RBP, paRFP, or pHluorin, given by <italic>g(x) = a(exp(-(x-x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>/w<sup>2</sup>))</italic>. The parameters <italic>x<sub>1/2</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>0</sub></italic> were taken as the x-axis positions of the plasma membrane and the fluorescence emitter, respectively. The parameter <italic>b</italic> is intracellular background fluorescence, <italic>c</italic> is extracellular background fluorescence, <italic>d</italic> is the slope factor of the sigmoid, <italic>a</italic> is the peak amplitude of emitter fluorescence, and <italic>w</italic> is √2* the standard deviation of the Gaussian. In practice, the latter parameters were highly constrained by the data or by the measured PSF, essentially leaving only <italic>x<sub>1/2</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>0</sub></italic> as free parameters in the fitting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Nanoscale dynamics of synaptic vesicle trafficking and fusion at the presynaptic active zone&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers found that the approach taken is novel, clever and useful. They also found that your results provide a significant gain in a set of questions that has been debated for quite some time, and are therefore interesting to wider audience.</p><p>However, some of the conclusions require a better accounting of the apparent level of resolution obtained by the technique. In particular, the assessment of vesicle movement and localization of fusion events relative to the membrane are critically dependent upon knowing the true resolution limit of the technique. Since the resolution of single particle localization techniques is strictly a function of signal-to-noise, it is very likely different for each set of conditions and may even vary with protein expression level, degree to which out-of-focus fluorescent molecules are activated, other fluorophores in the cell and the imaging rate, among other things.
