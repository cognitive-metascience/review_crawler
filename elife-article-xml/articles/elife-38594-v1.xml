Consequently, cheat invasion is often considered equal to extinction in empirical and theoretical studies of cooperator-cheat dynamics. But does cheat invasion necessarily equate extinction in nature? By following the social dynamics of iron metabolism in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> during cystic fibrosis lung infection, we observed that individuals evolved to replace cooperation with a ‘private’ behaviour. Phenotypic assays showed that cooperative iron acquisition frequently was upregulated early in infection, which, however, increased the risk of cheat invasion. With whole-genome sequencing we showed that if, and only if, cooperative iron acquisition is lost from the population, a private system was upregulated. The benefit of upregulation depended on iron availability. These findings highlight the importance of social dynamics of natural populations and emphasizes the potential impact of past social interaction on the evolution of private traits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social evolution</kwd><kwd>infectious disease</kwd><kwd>cheating</kwd><kwd>privatisation</kwd><kwd>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008398</institution-id><institution>Villum Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>95-300-13894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Sandra Breum</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>r108-a10094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Sandra Breum</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Grundforskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marvig</surname><given-names>Rasmus L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005111</institution-id><institution>Rigshospitalet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R88-A3537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johansen</surname><given-names>Helle Krogh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF12OC1015920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johansen</surname><given-names>Helle Krogh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R167-2013-15229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johansen</surname><given-names>Helle Krogh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SESE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Ashleigh S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A population of pathogenic bacteria is found to respond to the loss of cooperation by privatising an essential function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Identifying mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of cooperation is a major achievement of evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamilton, 1963</xref>). We can predict in which conditions cooperation will thrive, and where it might pay to exploit cooperative neighbours. Evidence of tension between cooperative and cheating strategies are all around us in nature – for example, in the co-evolution between flowers and their pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jandér and Herre, 2010</xref>), the policing and counter-policing behaviours of social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster and Ratnieks, 2000</xref>) – and in human society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathew and Boyd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rand et al., 2011</xref>). Cases where these dynamics have resulted in the loss of cooperation are much less well understood, primarily because long-term consequences of cheat invasions are unobserved and unreported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sachs and Simms, 2006</xref>). This is for the obvious reason that it is inherently difficult to detect a history of something that no longer exists. And also because it is generally the case that once cheating has gone to fixation, it is almost impossible for cooperation to re-invade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>). This is where most studies of social dynamics end.</p><p>Individuals are nevertheless under selection to survive the loss of cooperation. Consider a population where cheating has gone to fixation. If cooperation fulfilled an important function, this population may now be at risk of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiegna and Velicer, 2003</xref>). To escape this fate, selection may favour individuals that can restore function by employing a ‘privatisation’ strategy – replacement of a mechanism that was once performed cooperatively as a group, with a selfish one that only benefits the actor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bel, 2006</xref>). As such, we use the term privatisation as it is normally understood in common language to describe a switch in strategy from one that helps a whole group to achieve a goal to one where a goal is achieved by the actor alone. This differs from its use for describing the acquisition of property for future benefit by a group or an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strassmann and Queller, 2014</xref>), the retention of public goods for individual use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asfahl and Schuster, 2017</xref>), and for when public goods only are useable to a part of a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niehus et al., 2017</xref>). Privatisation could be a common occurrence in nature that has nevertheless been overlooked because there is no reason, <italic>a priori</italic>, to interpret private function as a result of past social interaction. It may also have been missed for the practical reason that we are required to track behaviour over many generations post-cheat invasion in a natural population. We overcome these difficulties by studying the evolutionary dynamics of a cooperative trait for more than an estimated 1.3 million generations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), in a population of bacterial cells. We report the first observation (to our knowledge) of a natural population responding to cheat invasion by adopting a privatisation strategy and, therefore, avoiding the possibility of extinction.</p><p>Our study population is comprised of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> bacteria causing lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disease that causes the build-up of dehydrated mucus in lungs and sinuses, which <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Folkesson et al., 2012</xref>). The host actively withholds iron to limit infection, and, as a counter-measure, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> employ a range of different iron acquisition strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poole and McKay, 2003</xref>). The primary mechanism relies on secretion of the siderophore pyoverdine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konings et al., 2013</xref>). This has been demonstrated to be a cooperative trait, where iron-bound pyoverdine molecules are available for uptake not only by the producer, but also by neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West and Buckling, 2003</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also make a secondary siderophore, pyochelin, which is cheaper to produce but has a lower affinity for iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumas et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the Pseudomonas heme uptake system (<italic>phu</italic>) is private, as the iron-rich compound heme is taken up directly without the secretion of exploitable exoproducts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Additional mechanisms of uptake include the private ferrous iron transport system (<italic>feo</italic>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartron et al., 2006</xref>]), and the heme assimilation system (<italic>has)</italic>. The <italic>has</italic> system produces a hemophore that can bind to heme, or hemoglobin that contains heme. In the closely related system of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> it is conditionally cooperative, as uptake is direct without the hemophore at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghigo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Létoffé et al., 2004</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38594.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Main iron uptake systems of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</title><p>The pyoverdine and pyochelin systems produce siderophores which can steal Fe<sup>3+</sup>from host carriers.

Pyoverdine production has repeatedly been found to be lost during CF infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeukens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2011</xref>), and the <italic>phu</italic> system has been observed to be upregulated late in infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). A major challenge is to identify the selective pressures experienced in situ that cause such changes. Host adaptation, to accommodate for example antibiotic pressure and resource limitations, is frequently predicted to be the primary force in pathogen evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lieberman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young et al., 2012</xref>). Experimentally recreating host conditions in vitro is challenging, given the complex interplay between spatial structure, host immunity and nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers, 2016</xref>), which we are only beginning to be able to measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koo et al., 2011</xref>). Clinical measurements may differ from experimental in vivo and in vitro findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cornforth et al., 2018</xref>), and studies using ‘simple’ experimental conditions do not always give comparable results to those that use more complex, and potentially more clinically relevant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, longitudinal sampling of patients to track in situ evolution provides an opportunity to infer selection without making <italic>a priori</italic> assumptions about the experienced environment. Evolutionary theory lets us make testable predictions to distinguish the effect of host adaptations and social interactions. With this approach we have shown that cheating is a major selective force in the loss of cooperative iron acquisition in the CF lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identified changes in iron uptake strategies from genome sequences and correlated these with the social environment (the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clonal lineage infecting a host), and duration of infection. Specifically, we test two hypotheses: first, we ask whether an increase in cooperation facilitates the breakdown of cooperation in a natural population, and second, can cells survive the loss of cooperation by switching to a private, and, therefore, unexploitable mechanism for acquiring iron. Two collections of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> samples were used, covering 551 whole genome sequenced isolates from 64 Danish patients, of 55 clone types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Markussen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marvig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marvig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2011</xref>); allowing for the identification of patterns of convergent evolution. While the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations within patients are remarkably uniform at the clone type level, colonizers diversify during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mowat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Winstanley et al., 2016</xref>), and lineages may occupy distinct niches at late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jorth et al., 2015</xref>). The isolate collection has been shown to represent the genetic diversity well, with multiple genotypes co-occurring within individual patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sommer et al., 2016</xref>). A key step in our analysis is to categorise isolates with respect to their social environment, for example, presence vs absence of cooperators (pyoverdine producers). This is necessary for testing our hypothesis that iron acquisition strategy is influenced by the social environment. The likelihood that we do not capture all co-infecting strains in our sample, for example leading to mis-classification of isolates as belonging to an environment without pyoverdine, will homogenise the sample groups and hence obscure any differences. Sampling errors of this kind will, therefore, hinder our ability to detect an effect (Type I error).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolate collections</title><p>Two collections of whole genome sequenced <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates were used, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). The transmissible clonetypes DK1 (46 isolates) and DK2 (54 isolates) were sampled from 28 CF patients between 1972 and 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jelsbak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Markussen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marvig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Six previously unanalysed DK1 isolates were included (from patients P55M3, P24M2 and P30M0, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Further, 451 isolates of 54 clonetypes from 36 young CF patients were used (the ‘children’s collection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marvig et al., 2015</xref>), of which 10 were of the DK1 clone type). At each sampling time, 1–8 colonies were cultured from patient sputum, and stored at −80° C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johansen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sommer et al., 2016</xref>). The sampling regimen for each patient is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">2</xref>. The two collections complement each other as one covers a long time period, with relatively few samples from each patient and of both early and late infection stages, whilst the other covers the first 10 years of infection by environmental clone types, with more extensive sampling within patients. In the children’s collection there is limited transmission between patients, but some clone types infect multiple patients, and some patients are infected by multiple clone types either at the same time or in succession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marvig et al., 2015</xref>). All but two patients, however, harbour only one dominant clone type at a time and the social environment is thus made up of clonal lineages sharing the same ancestor. The analysis of increased pyoverdine production was only performed on the children’s collection, as described below.</p><p>The phylogeny of the 54 DK2 isolates has previously been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marvig et al. (2013)</xref>, and this was adapted for this study to phylogenetically map the order of mutations in regions of interest. To allow a similar analysis for the DK1 clone type, we used Snippy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seeman, 2015</xref>) to identify SNPs in each of the 56 DK1 isolates relative to the PAO1 reference genome (RefSeq assembly accession GCF_000006765.1) and compared the SNPs of all the DK1 isolates to identify those that differed between the isolates. The SNPs were further filtered to only retain SNPs at positions covered by at least 10 reads in all isolates and exclude those where all isolates show more than 80% non-reference reads at the given position. Based on 4,639 SNPs within 2,614,892 sites, a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was computed with RAxML version 8.2.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>), with default settings using a general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution (option -m GTRCAT). The tree was rooted with the PAO1 reference genome.</p><p>The length of infection of each clone type in each patient was calculated. Clone types sampled only once from an individual patient were excluded (23 isolates of 22 clone types). For the transmissible clone types DK1 and DK2 the total length of infection across patients was used (39 and 36 years, respectively). This is a very conservative estimate of length of infection, as evolution occurs independently in different patients. To calculate the number of generations, a doubling time of 74 min was used for clonal lineages infecting for less than 6 years, 83 min for 6–24 years and 109 min for &gt;24 years based on the measurements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al.

Measurement of pyoverdine production was carried out by fluorescence readings at 400/460 nm excitation/emission with a 475 nm cut-off following growth in iron-limited media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kümmerli et al., 2009</xref>). For each clonal lineage the baseline pyoverdine production was determined as that of the first isolate(s) of a clone type from a patient, and the production of all subsequent isolates of this clone type was compared to this. An isolate was classified as an over-producer if its production was &gt;30% higher than that of the first. This cut-off was chosen as ~95% of the isolates had a lower standard deviation between replicates. The data is available from Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.6963pj3). The analysis was performed on longitudinally sampled clone types from the children’s collection only, as the DK1 and DK2 isolates were not sampled frequently within patients. Only non-producers evolved from a clonal lineage that produced pyoverdine at the beginning of the infection period were included. Therefore clone types DK1 (10 isolates, P36F2), DK11 (two isolates, P51M5), DK40 (two isolates, P73M4) and DK53 (10 isolates, P36F2) were excluded from the analysis, as they were ‘chronic’ clone types with no pyoverdine producers sampled from the young patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). As there were only three samples from P51M5, this whole patient was excluded from the analyses. In lineages with both over- and non-producers, over-producers were sampled before non-producers in all but three cases. In two cases there was &lt;5 months between sampling, and we scored non-producers as occurring at the same time as overproducers. In one case the non-producer was sampled 2.95 years prior to the over-producer and scored as having occurred in the absence of an over-producer. The subsequent sampling of the over-producer, and an additional non-producer that shared the genotype with the first non-producer, was not included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, P53M4). In two clone types two independent transitions to non-producers were observed (non-producing isolates harboured different pyoverdine mutations) and these were included as independent events (P44F5 and P14M4). We focus here on within-clone type dynamics, as temporal overlap of longitudinally sampled clone types only occurred in two patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We categorized each clone type in individual patients as harbouring over-producers or not. If an over-producer was present, the length of time from that sampling to a non-producer was observed, or till the last sample was collected from the patient, was noted. Clone types without non-producers were classified as right-censored. The same was done for patients without over-producers. In total, 45 clonal lineages were followed covering 404 isolates of 33 clonetypes from 35 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; some clone types occur in multiple patients, and some patients are infected by multiple clone types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marvig et al., 2015</xref>]).

For pyoverdine, the presence of mutations was compared to the actual measurements of production; the two measures are highly consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>) but when incongruent the phenotype was used. For the <italic>phu</italic> region intergenic <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> mutations predicted to cause receptor upregulation were included, and when occurring without other <italic>phu</italic> mutations these were recorded separately. Transitions were identified within clonal lineages, that is if an isolate for example had a pyoverdine mutation and measured loss of production, and a subsequent isolate had the same pyoverdine mutation in addition to a pyochelin mutation, this was considered a transition from wild-type (WT) to loss of pyoverdine, to loss of pyochelin. If for example a <italic>phu</italic> and pyochelin mutation was observed for the first time in the same isolate the exact order could not be inferred. In the transmissible clone type DK2 pyoverdine production was detected to have been lost in an isolate from 1973 and the mutation and phenotype was found in all later isolates. Subsequently, independent clonal lineages for example accumulate <italic>phu</italic> mutations. In the analyses this was counted as one loss of pyoverdine, and then multiple independent <italic>phu</italic> mutations. We calculated the expected order of mutation, equally weighted by the size and number of mutations of the different systems.

In the absence of pyoverdine production the time between loss of production and occurrence of mutations was estimated. The analysis was performed on longitudinally sampled clonal lineages from both collections of isolates, that is lineages with at least two isolates with or without pyoverdine production.

Here, we found that the likelihood of these non-producers arising was significantly higher in the presence of super-cooperators [Survival analysis, χ<sup>2</sup> (2, N = 47) = 5.7; p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>]. Non-producers were present in four out of 21 clonal lineages without (19%, on average 2.60 ± 2.45 st. dev years into infection) and in eight out of 24 lineages (disregarding one where the non-producer was sampled prior to the super-cooperator) with super-cooperators (33%, on average 3.32 ± 3.32 st. dev years into infection and 1.45 ± 1.39 st. dev. years after sampling of a super-cooperator). There was no significant difference between the time of sampling of non-producers between lineages with or without super-cooperators (Welch Two Sample t-test, t = −0.54, df = 8.01, p = 0.61). From the data set it is not clear whether cheats evolve from super-cooperators or directly from isolates with WT pyoverdine production, as the genetic basis of over-production is unknown.</p><p>Why is upregulation of pyoverdine production associated with the subsequent loss of this trait? Non-producers appear to be favoured as a result of exploiting the pyoverdine production of neighbouring cells – a strategy referred to as cheating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghoul et al., 2014a</xref>). We have previously shown that non-producers in the lung acquire mutations in a pattern consistent with a cheating strategy, as opposed to one expected from redundancy, in that they retained the pyoverdine receptor only if producers were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). In other words, non-producers lose the capacity to contribute but retain the ability to benefit from pyoverdine, as long as it is being supplied by cooperative neighbours. The relative fitness of cheats is predicted by theory to be greater when there are higher levels of cooperation in a population, because their competitors are bearing a higher cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross-Gillespie et al., 2007</xref>). This prediction has been shown to hold in empirical tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghoul et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiricny et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, super-cooperators are predicted to be especially vulnerable to exploitation and invasion of cheats. While isolates with a WT level of pyoverdine production may also benefit from the presence of super-cooperators, the larger production cost differential between non-producers and super-cooperators gives non-producers a greater advantage than WT producers. The pattern of upregulation, followed by loss, is likely to be applicable to the evolution of other exoproducts during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events</title><p>How do the changes in cooperative pyoverdine production relate to the overall iron metabolism of the cells?

This is the potential extinction scenario of cheat invasion. However, because we have continued to sample after this event, we can observe how the population responds to this potentially catastrophic situation.

Increased expression of the <italic>phu</italic> system results from intergenic mutations between the <italic>phuS</italic> gene encoding a heme traffic protein, and the receptor gene <italic>phuR</italic> (<italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> mutations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>). In the isolate collections, a total of 29 SNPs and two indels accumulate in the <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> region. Eight of these mutations in the <italic>phuR</italic> promoter have been found to cause a significant upregulation of promoter activity, and one of these has further been shown, in an isogenic pair, to provide a growth benefit to the carrier when heme is available as an iron source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>); see also below). These specific mutations were found to arise significantly more frequently than expected by chance following the loss of pyoverdine production [Poisson test, P(X ≥ 5) ∼ pois (X; 0.39) &lt; 0.01); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>]. In three patients, non-producing isolates with <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> mutations were sampled at the same time as pyoverdine producers, however in two of these the producer and non-producers were unlikely to interact, and in the third the <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutation occurred outside the <italic>phu</italic> promoter region with unknown effects on heme uptake (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). We thus conclude that <italic>phu</italic> upregulation takes place when pyoverdine production is lost from the social environment. Many of the isolates with <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations also harboured pyoverdine receptor mutations that eliminate the possibility to cheat (6 out of 7 in DK1, 7 out of 7 in DK2, 1 out of 2 in DK53, 0 out of 1 in DK32; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). Knock-out of the pyoverdine receptor is, however, not expected to be a selective force in <italic>phu</italic> upregulation. Rather, the data suggest that both occur because pyoverdine is no longer available in the environment, selecting for privatisation of iron uptake and elimination of the costly receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38594.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Loss of cooperation precedes privatisation of iron uptake.</title><p>Inverse Kaplan-Meier graph showing that <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> mutations are observed 15 times when pyoverdine is absent from the social environment (solid line, n = 26), and only once when pyoverdine is available in the social environment (dashed line, n = 47, see text). The mutations are only found in clonal lineages that do not produce pyoverdine.

Changes in iron uptake strategy might more readily be expected to reflect changes in the lung environment as the availability of iron in different forms increases with disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter et al., 2013</xref>). And while iron is found to be equally available in its oxidized ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) and reduced ferrous forms (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in early infection, there is a skew towards the reduced form later, which the <italic>feo</italic> system targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter et al., 2013</xref>). Heme and hemoglobin are also present in the sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghio et al., 2013</xref>), and availability has been speculated to increase as the lung tissue degrades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>), as evidenced by increased coughing up of blood, termed hemoptysis, with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). As such, pyoverdine may be most efficient early in infection, and <italic>phu</italic> only advantageous later as lung tissue degrades and/or alternative sources of iron become more or less abundant. However, the patterns we observe are not consistent with this explanation. If pyoverdine production is maintained, the <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> genotype remains unaltered from colonization, even after more than 30 years of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations, responsible for upregulating the private <italic>phu</italic> system, are only observed in non-producers, and in 15 out of 16 cases after the loss of cooperation in the population [Survival analysis, χ<sup>2</sup> (2, N = 73) = 11.7; p &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 and 4</xref>], occurring between 0 to 35 years after the loss of pyoverdine production.

As iron is toxic at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzaldi and Skaar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Touati, 2000</xref>), an indiscriminate upregulation of one system could be a significant disadvantage in environments where iron concentrations fluctuate. We, therefore, tested whether the growth benefits of <italic>phu</italic> upregulation (by <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations) were dependent on iron availability, in the form of heme which the <italic>phu</italic> system targets. We examined the growth difference between a clinical isolate that had lost pyoverdine production, and an isolate, isogenic but for a clinical <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutation that cause an upregulation of the heme receptor gene <italic>phuR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>). The experiment was performed in iron-limited media supplemented with heme at biologically relevant concentrations, which ranged from &lt;1 μM typical of healthy individuals, across 2.5 μM, 5 μM to 10 μM typical of CF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghio et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that <italic>phu</italic> upregulation is only beneficial at a narrow range of intermediate heme concentrations. There was a significant growth difference between the isolates and heme concentrations, and an interaction effect (Two-Way ANOVA; Interaction term: Isolate*Heme: F = 48.11, df = 3, p &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). At 2.5 μM heme the isolate with an upregulated <italic>phu</italic> system achieved a higher density (Tukey HSD, p<sub>adj</sub> &lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, at 5 and 10 μM the isolate without upregulation had an advantage (p<sub>adj</sub> &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). No growth was observed in the absence of heme, and at 1 μM there was no significant difference in growth between the isolates but a trend for the WT to do better (p<sub>adj</sub> = 0.073). This suggests that <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations lead to increased heme uptake that is beneficial at low external concentrations (&gt;1 and&lt;5 μM heme) but detrimental at high concentrations (&gt;5 μM heme). Analyses of pairs of clinical isolates with and without <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations gave less clear results, but showed a similar pattern of a benefit of <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations at low concentrations of added heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). If iron availability increases during infection, an initially beneficial upregulation of heme uptake would turn toxic. In the <italic>phu</italic> system we found a significant bias towards mutations of the <italic>phu</italic> receptor gene <italic>phuR</italic> (Poisson test, P(X ≥ 24) ∼ pois (X; 10.69) &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). These were not randomly distributed but primarily found in the extracellular loops of the <italic>phu</italic> receptor, that initiate the uptake of heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noinaj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2015</xref>) [Poisson test, P(X ≥ 15)~pois (X; 7.28) &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>]. If there is selection to reduce iron concentration within cells, these may, therefore, represent compensatory mutations.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38594.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effect of <italic>phu</italic> upregulation depends on the heme concentration.</title><p>An isogenic pair of isolates differing only in a 1 bp <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> deletion was grown in iron-limited media supplemented with heme at 1–10 μM.

The observations we report here, however, demonstrate the errors of interpretation that can arise from assuming that bacterial cells are driven entirely by the evolutionary imperative to survive in the host. As in all other organisms, fitness is also determined by the ability to compete with members of the same species, and these two evolutionary drivers – host adaptation and competition – do not always coincide. Our results show that the initial upregulation of cooperation, selected by either the environmental conditions, competition or as a pleiotropic side-effect, facilitates cheating. The subsequent privatisation of iron uptake is a response to the loss of cooperation, not simply an adaptation to iron availability in the host as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marvig et al., 2014</xref>), and as we show this carries its own costs. The effect of the social environment on iron acquisition mechanism remains statistically detectable despite the noise from variation in patient age, sex, infection and treatment. In a clinical system like this, failure to appreciate these factors can lead to misinterpretation of how bacterial cells are influenced by the host environment and, therefore, impair necessary understanding for the development of intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leggett et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Evolutionary theory clearly predicts that any adaptation involving cooperation can be vulnerable to exploitation, irrespective of its benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981</xref>). But this is often overlooked when it is difficult to characterize the selective environment, as for example, inside a human host. By longitudinal sampling of bacterial populations, we were able to observe the consequences of cheat invasion for an essential trait and show that switching to a private strategy can provide bacterial cells with an evolutionary alternative. This observation highlights the importance of considering potential constraints imposed by social interactions: if a private trait is expressed it may not be the most efficient in a given environment, but simply the final recourse in a population with a history of exploitation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stuart West, Lars Jelsbak and Rolf Kümmerli for comments on the manuscript.

For the ‘children’s’ collection the young patients have been sampled frequently, for up to 10 years, and that the majority are infected with unique environmental clone types. When <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was found to transmit between CF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jelsbak et al., 2007</xref>), care was taken to avoid that younger patients become infected with adapted clone types in the clinic. In the collections we use this is clear as the children’s collection encompass 54 clone types while the collection of isolates from adults contain only two, highly transmissible, clone types. This collection covers &gt;30 years. To give an overview of the sampling regimen we present first an overview of isolates sampled from the individual patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">2</xref>).

Dashed red lines mark these cut-off points. Four clonal lineages of a ‘chronic’ phenotype with no pyoverdine producers sampled were excluded from the analysis on super-cooperators (DK1 and DK53 in P36F2, DK40 in P73M4, and DK11 in P51M5). When sampling is shown to start later than year 0 (as e.g. for P67M4) there was a sample collected earlier from the patient that either was not sequenced or of a clone type only sampled once.

There are two patients (P28F1 and P30F0) where DK1 isolates that have lost pyoverdine production and have <italic>phu</italic> upregulated are sampled concurrently with WT pyoverdine producers. In P30F0 the isolates with <italic>phu</italic> upregulation were isolated from the sinuses, and the rest from the lungs, and these have therefore inhabited different niches. In P28F1, the pyoverdine and <italic>phu</italic> mutations occurred in another patient (likely P46F0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>) and were transmitted to patient P28F1 where another DK1 lineage also established. In three patients DK1 and DK2 overlapped in time (P24M2, P43M2 and P73F1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Could the two clone types have interacted, in regards to iron uptake, in these three patients? Patient P73F1 was first found to be colonized by DK2 in 1984, which had already lost pyoverdine production and uptake ability in 1973 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). In the last two isolates there were two independent upregulations of the <italic>phu</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1-fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">5</xref>). A DK1 isolate was sampled in 2002 that also had pyoverdine production and uptake knocked-out, and carried <italic>phuS//phuR</italic> mutations for <italic>phu</italic> upregulation. From the DK1 phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>) it is unclear whether these mutations in DK1 occurred in patient P73F1 and were transmitted to patient P43M2 or vice versa. Given the simultaneous upregulation of <italic>phu</italic> in DK2 in P73F1 we speculate that they may have occurred in this patient. In patient P24M2 a WT-like DK1 clonal lineage is sampled over a timespan of nine years co-occurring with the non-cooperative and non-cheating DK2. The young patient P82M3 was infected by clone type DK32, and three of the late isolates had lost pyoverdine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). Two of these, co-occurring with pyoverdine producers, had a <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> mutation outside of the <italic>phuR</italic> promoter, as discussed in the main text. Patient P36F2 was first infected by DK53 and DK1, neither of which produced pyoverdine and DK53 further had <italic>phuS</italic>//<italic>phuR</italic> mutations.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Angela Wilks (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Andersen et al. describes the evolution of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in the lungs of people with CF with a particular focus on evolutionary contingency around cooperative iron acquisition systems. The authors analyze isolates obtained from CF patients sputum in two cohorts of patients with longitudinal sampling and conclude that a series of invasions caused by social evolution take place in the CF lung: first, social cheats invade in siderophore (public good) producing populations, leading to the demise of public good producers. Surprisingly, this event is followed by the raise in frequency of private iron acquisition strategies, which should in principle be able to compete against cheaters. This type evolutionary dynamics, reminiscent of a rock-paper-scissors game, are fundamentally interesting and potentially relevant in the context of pathogenesis, as they could shed light on the selective pressures that impact the evolution of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in CF patients.</p><p>All reviewers felt this was a potentially interesting and exciting study, however, a number of serious issues were raised by the reviewers (not by reviewer #3, who was brief but positive). These issues require your careful consideration before publication. Many of them revolve around the presentation of the data, which we felt lacked the required details. This lack of detail led to confusion by some of the reviewers, as you will see in their questions below. To be able to consider this paper for publication, we strongly encourage the authors to provide a better overview of the raw data in the main text (e.g. number of isolates, origin, time of isolation, numbers of isolates per patient, phenotypes tested, etc.). This could be done possibly through a dedicated figure or table.</p><p>We also found the style of writing to often be too colloquial. Specifically, frequent use of phrases like &quot;game over&quot;, &quot;dead end&quot;, &quot;last resort&quot; obscured the message of the paper. Other examples include &quot;Life, however, goes on&quot; and there are more. Along the same lines, the Abstract seems to sacrifice clarity for &quot;impact&quot;. This needs to be corrected. See comment 6.</p><p>One of the reviewers also questioned the novelty of the results, relative to previous findings by the same group. The authors need to clarify their main new data relative to previous work.</p><p>We expect to see a detailed point by point reply to the comments you will read below. Given that many of the questions were related to a lack of clear scientific presentation, once we receive your comments we will have to reevaluate the novelty and significance of the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarity of the data: It is very hard to follow the numbers in this work! Numbers are differently represented between figures and text and often do not seem to match. For example, In Figure 1 and the relevant text they claim they observed 14 pvd- cheating events (9+5), while later on they claim they had 23 events (14+9) (subsection “Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events”). What is the relation between these two numbers? The authors need to find a better way to represent the data in a clearer fashion. We strongly suggest to have a new figure with a visualization of the number of strains per time point, per patient and their phenotypes/genotypes.</p><p>2) Relation to previous work by the same group: The main problem I see here is the relation between this work and the mBio paper by Marvig et al., 2014, and the PNAS paper by Andersen et al., 2015, both done by the same research groups involved in this work and the latter with the same first author as the current work. The authors often refer to these two papers in the current manuscript, but reading these two papers reveal that most of the basic observations mentioned in the current text were already made in these two papers. It is therefore unclear what is the novelty of this manuscript.</p><p>a) Cheating on pyoverdine production: Andersen et al., 2015, have shown that pvd mutations first arise in pvd production pathway (mainly pvdS) and later in the reception pathway, only once the pvd- production mutants are fixed in the population (based on other strains obtained in the same sample and in previous samples of the same patient). They hypothesize that production mutants are cheaters and that pvd reception mutants are favorable due to the cost of reception in the absence of pvd-related benefit. Several points should be made with respect to this manuscript.</p><p>i) First, it seems that the basic observation of cheating on pvd production has already been made. The only thing that is added in this manuscript is the observation regarding the relation between cheating and super-producers, to which I have several reservations (see separate point below).</p><p>ii) In the current work, only production mutants are discussed, while reception mutants are not mentioned at all. Since both pvd reception mutants and phu+ mutants are correlated with fixation of the pvd production mutants, it is surprising that reception mutants were not discussed and compared with phu+ mutants.</p><p>b) Marvig et al., has already identified the phu+ promoter mutation and the fact that they arise only in pvd production mutants, though their work was done on a smaller number of lineages. Therefore, it is not clear what is the added value of the current work? Is it the demonstration that phu+ alleles are only beneficial at low heme levels (see comments on the experiments in a separate point)? Is the claim for novelty in this work depends on the enlarged statistical power? Or is it the claim that phu+ promoter mutants arise only when pvd+ phenotype is completely eliminated from the social environment and not only from the specific lineage? See comments on sociality below for the last option.</p><p>Altogether, the distinction between the current work and previous works of the group are not sufficiently clear.</p><p>3) Social interaction: It is hard to understand when do the authors discuss social environment within the given lineage (i.e., when discussing interaction between a mutant and its ancestor) and when do they discuss social environment based on multiple strains sampled from the same patient at the same time. While the authors claim social explanations for their observation, much of the analysis in the text is not based on direct social observations, but on comparisons between a mutant and its ancestors (e.g., Figure 1, 2, 3). The two places where a social context is mentioned are:</p><p>a) When they discuss the social environment of pvd- cheats, the authors mention that 14 events are not fixed while 9 other are fixed (subsection “Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events”).</p><p>b) Later, the authors mention that the phu+ mutations occurred significantly more when Pvd was lost, but here it is unclear whether they mean that Pvd was lost from the genome of the strains, or from the total social environment (subsection “Cheat invasion is associated with a subsequent switch to private iron uptake mechanism”), as they refer to Figure 2 which, to the best of my understanding, discussed only changes within a given genome and not the social context. On the other hand, they specifically mention that in all but three cases (I guess therefore that in 31-3=28 cases, but again – distinction between lineages and patients is unclear), phu+ arise when no pvd+ strains were observed at all.</p><p>In both cases there is insufficient information given on the social environment – how many strains were analyzed in any given sample. This data in neither presented nor analyzed in anyway whatsoever in the text. Now, this is obviously important – I would find the claim for fixation of a given genotype (or the elimination of another) to be much stronger if 10 isolates were sampled from the same patient at the same time than if only two samples were taken (or one!). Yet, the social data is completely absent, so I do not know how to interpret the claim for fixation of the cheater. As this is, to the best of my understanding, the most important point of the paper, the data supporting it should be presented and properly analyzed!</p><p>4) Pvd Super producers: the authors defined a subset of strains which produce more pvd than their ancestors (based on longitudinal sampling and genomic sequences). Super-production occurs in 50% of lineages and rather early (within ~2 years) in 33% of lineages. In a minority of super-producer lineages, the authors suggest that it is due to mutations in general regulators (e.g., lasR, mucA, gac). The authors suggest that this is an adaptation due to increased requirements for iron in the lungs. Finally, the author observed that a large fraction of super-producers became null producers (8/24) compared to strains that do not super-produce (4/21). We have several remarks on this part:</p><p>a) If super-production results from mutations in general regulators such as lasR or mucA, then pvd over-production might be a pleiotropic side effect of selection for a different trait dependent on the global regulator. This option is not mentioned in the text.</p><p>b) Super-producers by themselves are also super-cooperators which will be cheated by their wild-type pvd producer ancestors in their social environment. Something needs to explain the increase of cooperation. Selection for private pleiotropic effects of the mutation (section a) might explain this increased cooperation. Again, social evolution is not discussed in this context.</p><p>c) The observation that pvd- mutant phenotype arise more often in super-producers (8/24) than in wild-type producers (4/21) seems to be rather marginal to me. I'm not sure what is the statistical significance analysis, but if one simply assumes binomial distribution around the mean (12/45=26%), then with 21 samples, the chance of obtaining 4 or less events is ~30% and the chances of obtaining 8 events or more in 24 samples is ~40%. Therefore, I am not convinced that this difference is not occurring simply by chance.</p><p>5) Sensitivity to heme levels. If I understand correctly, the authors show in Figure 5 the average final OD for multiple related pairs which encode for the phu+ or phu-wt alleles (all in pvd- background) for different levels of heme (1, 2, 5, 10μM). I thought I got the picture clearly, but looking at the supplementary information and figure got me completely confused. The authors refer to six pairs of strains, for which they measured the growth in 2 and 5 μm of heme, but it is unclear on what was 1 and 10 μm measured. Also, while Figure 5 indicates that the phu-wt allele has a growth advantage in 5uM, Appendix 1—figure 7 shows that all the statistically significant (or marginally significant) effects in specific pairs, go on the other direction – phu+ grow better than phu-wt. I couldn't figure out how to resolve these two values in a satisfying manner.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Privatisation rescues essential function following loss of cooperation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this version, Andersen et al. tried to address the main criticism brought forward in the previous version. All in all, I find the data and figures added to the work to satisfy my main points of criticism. I still have few comments here and there, where I think analysis could be improved or representation could be simplified for the reader.</p><p>I would go over my previous main reservations and whether I am satisfied from the corrections done by the authors:</p><p>1) Connection between pvd receptor mutations and phu+ phenotypic change. The authors now added the analysis of pvd reception mutations and show a good correspondence between the phu+ promoter mutations and accumulation of pvd reception mutations. I think this supports the notion that cheating on pvd is not occurring upon the phu+ phenotypic change.</p><p>2) Social interactions. This is the main point of the paper – loss of pyoverdine production from the social environment and not only from a specific lineage explains the rise of phu+ phenotype. The authors now provide Appendix 1—figure 3A, B to directly show the data. I think this is a good start, but I would suggest that the authors would provide a more patient-centric view of the data and not lineage-centric. The problem with the current representation is that different lineages in the same patient are scattered throughout the two figures, complicating comparison. To look at the data of a specific patient, I had to scan the two figures to find all lineages sampled in this patient and then mentally order them by the sample time, to try and see whether the claim (pvd loss from all samples prior to phu+ mutation) can be verified. I suggest that in addition to the current representation, the authors should show a representation were the data samples for a single patient are clustered together with ascending years and the phenotypic/genetic status of each sample is clearly given (using the same mutation annotation as in the current figure). This would facilitate direct visual estimation of the social data in a given lineage. I don't think there is a need to show patients which have been sampled once with a single clone, as nothing much can be said about their social environment (many such patients are shown in Appendix 1—figure 2).</p><p>3) Super producers: the statistical claim of the author is that pvd cheaters are not only preferentially arising in the super-producers, but that they also arise more quickly (i.e., that the rate of appearance of the mutations is higher. This is clear from Figure 1 but is not mentioned appropriately in the text (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, third paragraph).

I am no expert in CF, but both things seem unlikely, though I might be completely wrong on that. In any case, I don't find this to be very important.

The authors analyze isolates obtained from CF patients sputum in two cohorts of patients with longitudinal sampling and conclude that a series of invasions caused by social evolution take place in the CF lung: first, social cheats invade in siderophore (public good) producing populations, leading to the demise of public good producers. Surprisingly, this event is followed by the raise in frequency of private iron acquisition strategies, which should in principle be able to compete against cheaters. This type evolutionary dynamics, reminiscent of a rock-paper-scissors game, are fundamentally interesting and potentially relevant in the context of pathogenesis, as they could shed light on the selective pressures that impact the evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients.</p></disp-quote><p>Point of clarification: this mis-represents our findings. Cells adopting private iron uptake strategies may also be pyoverdine cheaters, in fact, we find that they always are. There are not three distinct strategies as in the rock-paper-scissors game and this is not a good model for our observations. Instead, the population “escapes” coop cheat dynamics completely by switching to a private mechanism. To our knowledge, we are the first to report this strategy as a response to cheat invasion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarity of the data: It is very hard to follow the numbers in this work! Numbers are differently represented between figures and text and often do not seem to match. For example, In Figure 1 and the relevant text they claim they observed 14 pvd- cheating events (9+5), while later on they claim they had 23 events (14+9) (subsection “Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events”). What is the relation between these two numbers? The authors need to find a better way to represent the data in a clearer fashion. We strongly suggest to have a new figure with a visualization of the number of strains per time point, per patient and their phenotypes/genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The study includes two collections of isolates. One from young patients infected primarily with environmental clone types, sampled extensively within patients for max 10 years, and one from patients infected by two transmissible clone types, sampled extensively between patients for &gt;30 years. In the latter there are few samples from individual patients, and longer time between samples. In the analysis of upregulation of pyoverdine we only used samples from the frequently sampled young patients in order to track the pyoverdine dynamics within patients as closely as possible. This information is in the Materials and methods, but to clarify we have now mentioned the two isolate collections in the Introduction (last paragraph), provided more detail in the Materials and methods (subsection “Isolate collections”, first paragraph; subsection “Changes in pyoverdine production during infection”, first paragraph; subsection “Transitions between public and private iron uptake”, first paragraph), and further described in the Results and Discussion which isolates are used when (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, first paragraph; subsection “Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events”, first paragraph; subsection “Cheat invasion is associated with a subsequent switch to private iron uptake mechanism”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Relation to previous work by the same group: The main problem I see here is the relation between this work and the mBio paper by Marvig et al., 2014, and the PNAS paper by Andersen et al., 2015, both done by the same research groups involved in this work and the latter with the same first author as the current work. The authors often refer to these two papers in the current manuscript, but reading these two papers reveal that most of the basic observations mentioned in the current text were already made in these two papers. It is therefore unclear what is the novelty of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded the Introduction (last paragraph), and the Discussion (subsection “Conclusions”) to clarify the novel contribution made by the current submission. This is the first study that we know of to reveal privatisation as a strategy to survive the loss of an essential trait through cheat invasion. Neither of the papers cited address this question, neither is it possible to address this question with the data they present. No other study has shown this in bacteria or in any other system. Bacterial infections offer unique opportunities to observe long-term evolutionary dynamics that are not possible in other taxonomic groups that are studied by the research community interested in social behaviours, e.g. the social insects, vertebrates. In no other system has it been possible to observe the invasion of cheats and the following evolutionary response in a natural population. We expect our results to be of general interest beyond the microbiology community.</p><p>Marvig et al., 2014, showed that intergenic mutations in the phu system are common, found in isolates that do not produce pyoverdine, and cause an increased growth rate in the presence of heme as an iron source. The results are interpreted as host adaptation to increased availability of heme as an iron source. In Andersen et al., 2015, we reported the first evidence that cheating is responsible for long-term loss of pyoverdine in a population of <italic>P.</italic> </p><p><italic>aeruginosa</italic> infecting the CF lung. Importantly, we were able to present data that helped to reject the alternative, widely-held hypothesis: that pyoverdine loss was due to redundancy as iron levels changed through infection. We provided the first evidence of cheat invasion in a natural population of infectious bacteria.</p><p>The current paper reports the following novel findings: (1) increased cooperation facilitates the invasion of cheats, and (2) bacterial populations respond to the loss of an essential trait through cheating by switching to a private mechanism for iron uptake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Cheating on pyoverdine production: Andersen et al., 2015, have shown that pvd mutations first arise in pvd production pathway (mainly pvdS) and later in the reception pathway, only once the pvd- production mutants are fixed in the population (based on other strains obtained in the same sample and in previous samples of the same patient). They hypothesize that production mutants are cheaters and that pvd reception mutants are favorable due to the cost of reception in the absence of pvd-related benefit. Several points should be made with respect to this manuscript.</p><p>i) First, it seems that the basic observation of cheating on pvd production has already been made. The only thing that is added in this manuscript is the observation regarding the relation between cheating and super-producers, to which I have several reservations (see separate point below).</p></disp-quote><p>The observation of cheating is not claimed as novel in this manuscript but stated as a finding of our previous article (Introduction, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) In the current work, only production mutants are discussed, while reception mutants are not mentioned at all. Since both pvd reception mutants and phu+ mutants are correlated with fixation of the pvd production mutants, it is surprising that reception mutants were not discussed and compared with phu+ mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>The Phu+ mutants are found only when pyoverdine production has been lost from the population, i.e. when cheating is no longer an option. We have elaborated: “Knock-out of the pyoverdine receptor is, however, not expected to be a selective force in <italic>phu</italic> upregulation. Rather, the data suggest that both occur because pyoverdine is no longer available in the environment, selecting for privatisation of iron uptake and elimination of the costly receptor”. The presence or absence of pyoverdine receptor mutations have been added to Appendix 1—figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Marvig et al., has already identified the phu+ promoter mutation and the fact that they arise only in pvd production mutants, though their work was done on a smaller number of lineages. Therefore, it is not clear what is the added value of the current work? Is it the demonstration that phu+ alleles are only beneficial at low heme levels (see comments on the experiments in a separate point)? Is the claim for novelty in this work depends on the enlarged statistical power? Or is it the claim that phu+ promoter mutants arise only when pvd+ phenotype is completely eliminated from the social environment and not only from the specific lineage? See comments on sociality below for the last option. Altogether, the distinction between the current work and previous works of the group are not sufficiently clear.</p></disp-quote><p>See comment above. The current manuscript is clearly distinct from Marvig et al. in the hypotheses tested, which concern selective forces responsible for the observed changes, i.e. social interactions and not solely host adaptation. It is significantly less challenging to report the presence of a mutation than it is to present evidence for why a mutation has arisen, and why it has spread. This is what we do here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Social interaction: It is hard to understand when do the authors discuss social environment within the given lineage (i.e., when discussing interaction between a mutant and its ancestor) and when do they discuss social environment based on multiple strains sampled from the same patient at the same time.</p></disp-quote><p>The social environment is characterized as the co-occurring genotypes within a clone type, i.e. mutants and ancestor, as described (“the social environment (the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clonal lineage infecting a host)”) and now as further clarified in the first paragraph of the subsection “Isolate collections”. We focus on within clone-type events as continuous overlap between clone types within patients occurred rarely. The distinction has been further highlighted in the first paragraph of the subsection “Changes in pyoverdine production during infection” and Appendix 1—figures 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors claim social explanations for their observation, much of the analysis in the text is not based on direct social observations, but on comparisons between a mutant and its ancestors (e.g., Figure 1, 2, 3). The two places where a social context is mentioned are:</p><p>a) When they discuss the social environment of pvd- cheats, the authors mention that 14 events are not fixed while 9 other are fixed (subsection “Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events”).</p><p>b) Later, the authors mention that the phu+ mutations occurred significantly more when Pvd was lost, but here it is unclear whether they mean that Pvd was lost from the genome of the strains, or from the total social environment (subsection “Cheat invasion is associated with a subsequent switch to private iron uptake mechanism”), as they refer to Figure 2 which, to the best of my understanding, discussed only changes within a given genome and not the social context. On the other hand, they specifically mention that in all but three cases (I guess therefore that in 31-3=28 cases, but again – distinction between lineages and patients is unclear), phu+ arise when no pvd+ strains were observed at all.</p><p>In both cases there is insufficient information given on the social environment – how many strains were analyzed in any given sample. This data in neither presented nor analyzed in anyway whatsoever in the text. Now, this is obviously important – I would find the claim for fixation of a given genotype (or the elimination of another) to be much stronger if 10 isolates were sampled from the same patient at the same time than if only two samples were taken (or one!). Yet, the social data is completely absent, so I do not know how to interpret the claim for fixation of the cheater. As this is, to the best of my understanding, the most important point of the paper, the data supporting it should be presented and properly analyzed!</p></disp-quote><p>The number of samples and extent of sampling from each patient is available in Supplementary file 2. To further clarify the sampling regimen we have included Appendix 1—figures 1 and 2 showing sampling time for the clone types that were longitudinally sampled from patients, highlighting over-producers and non-producers from the children’s collection (Appendix 1—figure 1; Clone types that were only sampled once are not included in the analysis or the figure, l. 183-184). For the transmissible clone types both the sampling time across patients and phylogenies with selected pheno – and genotypes are shown (Appendix 1—figures 2 and 3).</p><p>During patient sampling sputum was collected and cultured, and 1-8 colonies were selected and stored for further analyses, as clarified in the first paragraph of the subsection “Isolate collections”. Therefore, the sequencing effort was partly determined by how the samples were originally collected, and partly by prioritizing extent of sampling, rather than depth, for the children’s collection. As mentioned in the introduction, a subsequent metagenomic study showed that the longitudinal samples represent the standing diversity well, and as we explain “The likelihood that we do not capture all co-infecting strains in our sample, leading to mis-classification of isolates as belonging to an environment without pyoverdine, will homogenise the sample groups and hence obscure any differences. Sampling errors of this kind will, therefore, hinder our ability to detect an effect (Type I error).” While more samples are of course always desirable, we feel very confident in the presented result, in particular because of the high degree of convergent evolution of the genotypes we focus on, across clone types and patients.</p><p>Throughout the text we have clarified that some clone types occur in multiple patients, while some patients are infected by multiple clone types (subsection “Isolate collections”, first paragraph; subsection “Changes in pyoverdine production during infection”, last paragraph; subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, second paragraph; Supplementary file 2), which may have caused confusion in the presentation of results on clonal lineages in patients.</p><p>We define samples as co-occurring if they are sampled &lt; 1 year apart (subsection “Evolution of iron acquisition systems in the lung – the sequence of events”, last paragraph). That means that if a non-producer is sampled and a producer sampled &lt; 1 year prior, or subsequently, then the social environment of that non-producer is considered to be cooperative. When no more producers are sampled, cheating is considered to have gone to fixation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Pvd Super producers: the authors defined a subset of strains which produce more pvd than their ancestors (based on longitudinal sampling and genomic sequences). Super-production occurs in 50% of lineages and rather early (within ~2 years) in 33% of lineages. In a minority of super-producer lineages, the authors suggest that it is due to mutations in general regulators (e.g., lasR, mucA, gac). The authors suggest that this is an adaptation due to increased requirements for iron in the lungs. Finally, the author observed that a large fraction of super-producers became null producers (8/24) compared to strains that do not super-produce (4/21). We have several remarks on this part:</p></disp-quote><p>We do not state that super-producers become cheats, rather that cheats are more likely to be sampled following the observation of super-cooperators (subsection 2 More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, third paragraph). As the genetic basis for increased production is not identified, we do not know if a sampled cheat evolved from a super-cooperator or from an isolate with WT pyoverdine production. We have clarified this in the third paragraph of the subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) If super-production results from mutations in general regulators such as lasR or mucA, then pvd over-production might be a pleiotropic side effect of selection for a different trait dependent on the global regulator. This option is not mentioned in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that over-production of pyoverdine may be a part of an overall “acute infection” phenotype. We have further highlighted in the text that this may be as a pleiotropic effect or beneficial trait (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, second paragraph). Regardless of whether the selective force is iron uptake or host colonization, the effects of upregulation on social interaction may be the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Super-producers by themselves are also super-cooperators which will be cheated by their wild-type pvd producer ancestors in their social environment. Something needs to explain the increase of cooperation. Selection for private pleiotropic effects of the mutation (section a) might explain this increased cooperation. Again, social evolution is not discussed in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>We present three hypotheses for increased pyoverdine production, i) iron limitation, ii) inter-species iron competition, and iii) selection on an acute infection phenotype (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, second paragraph). Organisms with WT level production of pyoverdine may also exploit super-cooperators but the benefit of exploitation increases with an increased difference in pyoverdine production. Hence, cheats will have a greater benefit exploiting super-cooperators than WT, and than WT exploiting super-cooperators. We have clarified this in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection. As such, this paragraph is all about social evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The observation that pvd- mutant phenotype arise more often in super-producers (8/24) than in wild-type producers (4/21) seems to be rather marginal to me. I'm not sure what is the statistical significance analysis, but if one simply assumes binomial distribution around the mean (12/45=26%), then with 21 samples, the chance of obtaining 4 or less events is ~30% and the chances of obtaining 8 events or more in 24 samples is ~40%. Therefore, I am not convinced that this difference is not occurring simply by chance.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the statistical analysis are presented in the text (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, third paragraph) and graphically in the inverse Kaplan-Meier plot in Figure 1. We have used a Survival analysis to take into account the timing of events and not simply correlate presence / absence. This has been further clarified in the Materials and methods and Results and Discussion (subsection “Changes in pyoverdine production during infection”, last paragraph; subsection “Cheat invasion is associated with a subsequent switch to private iron uptake mechanism”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Sensitivity to heme levels. If I understand correctly, the authors show in Figure 5 the average final OD for multiple related pairs which encode for the phu+ or phu-wt alleles (all in pvd- background) for different levels of heme (1, 2, 5, 10μM). I thought I got the picture clearly, but looking at the supplementary information and figure got me completely confused. The authors refer to six pairs of strains, for which they measured the growth in 2 and 5 μm of heme, but it is unclear on what was 1 and 10μm measured. Also, while Figure 5 indicates that the phu-wt allele has a growth advantage in 5uM, Appendix 1—figure 7 shows that all the statistically significant (or marginally significant) effects in specific pairs, go on the other direction – phu+ grow better than phu-wt. I couldn't figure out how to resolve these two values in a satisfying manner.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the text Figure 5 shows growth measurements of an isogenic pair of clinical isolates, differing only in the presence of a phuS//phuR mutation (subsection “Uptake of heme following phuS//phuR mutations”, first paragraph; subsection “Why is private heme uptake only upregulated if cooperation is lost?”, first paragraph). Here we see a clear difference in growth dependent on the heme availability. In Appendix 1—figure 4 we show measurements from pairs of clinical isolates that differ in the presence of phuS//phuR mutations (subsection “Uptake of heme following phuS//phuR mutations”, last paragraph). Although the isolates in a pair are the closest related we have, they have been sampled many years apart and differ by many additional mutations that likely affect growth (Appendix). These isolates overall show higher growth at 5 μm heme added, compared to at 2.5 μm for the isogenic pair. We have added text to highlight this difference (subsection “Why is private heme uptake only upregulated if cooperation is lost?”, last paragraph; Appendix). In the Methods we have switched the order of presenting the isogenic pair and the clinical isolates for clarity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this version, Andersen et al. tried to address the main criticism brought forward in the previous version. All in all, I find the data and figures added to the work to satisfy my main points of criticism. I still have few comments here and there, where I think analysis could be improved or representation could be simplified for the reader.</p><p>I would go over my previous main reservations and whether I am satisfied from the corrections done by the authors:</p><p>1) Connection between pvd receptor mutations and phu+ phenotypic change. The authors now added the analysis of pvd reception mutations and show a good correspondence between the phu+ promoter mutations and accumulation of pvd reception mutations. I think this supports the notion that cheating on pvd is not occurring upon the phu+ phenotypic change.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, thank you for the suggestion. We agree that this has helped to clarify our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Social interactions. This is the main point of the paper – loss of pyoverdine production from the social environment and not only from a specific lineage explains the rise of phu+ phenotype. The authors now provide Appendix 1—figure 3A, B to directly show the data. I think this is a good start, but I would suggest that the authors would provide a more patient-centric view of the data and not lineage-centric. The problem with the current representation is that different lineages in the same patient are scattered throughout the two figures, complicating comparison. To look at the data of a specific patient, I had to scan the two figures to find all lineages sampled in this patient and then mentally order them by the sample time, to try and see whether the claim (pvd loss from all samples prior to phu+ mutation) can be verified. I suggest that in addition to the current representation, the authors should show a representation were the data samples for a single patient are clustered together with ascending years and the phenotypic/genetic status of each sample is clearly given (using the same mutation annotation as in the current figure). This would facilitate direct visual estimation of the social data in a given lineage. I don't think there is a need to show patients which have been sampled once with a single clone, as nothing much can be said about their social environment (many such patients are shown in Appendix 1—figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a useful way to present the data and have provided a patient-centric overview in Appendix 1—figure 4, showing the phenotypes and sampling time for the transmissible clone types DK1 and DK2. The two additional clone types that acquire phu mutations have also been included. We discuss the within-patient social environment in the Appendix text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Super producers: the statistical claim of the author is that pvd cheaters are not only preferentially arising in the super-producers, but that they also arise more quickly (i.e., that the rate of appearance of the mutations is higher. This is clear from Figure 1 but is not mentioned appropriately in the text (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, third paragraph). I think the authors should also mention that the mean time for appearance of a pvd- mutation was quicker for the eight mutations that arose in the presence of super producer than the mean time for the four that arose without it.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, the cleanest prediction that we can make is that cheats are more likely to arise in the presence of super-cooperators, compared to when they are absent. This is the prediction we test with our “survival analysis”. Predicting a difference in time before a mutation arises is more tenuous: what to compare exactly? Time since super-producer first arrives and appearance of a cheat, or time since first colonization and the appearance of a cheat in both cases? As we are interested in the potential effect of super-cooperators in the analysis, we compare the time since first sampling of super-cooperator and appearance of a cheat, to time from colonisation to cheat appearance in the absence of super-cooperators. The reviewer highlights that the difference in time axes on the figure can lead to the mistaken impression that cheats arise quicker in the presence of super-producers. In order to avoid misleading readers, we now explicitly state in the text that there is no significant difference in time to first appearance (subsection “More cooperative populations are more vulnerable to exploitation”, third paragraph), and in the Materials and methods we further clarify “If an over-producer was present, the length of time from that sampling to a non-producer was observed […]”. Thank you to the reviewer for pointing out that this would be helpful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Number of generations. The reviewers have cut their estimates considerably, but still rely on an estimation of doubling time of ~70 minutes, which I still find unconvincing – it will either imply that the whole mocus volume of the lungs is replaced every 70 minutes (as in a chemostat, where growth is determined by clearance rate), or that there is a massive level of cell death alongside fast cell growth (and then the chemostat assumptions fail, as average growth does not reflect cell divisions). I am no expert in CF, but both things seem unlikely, though I might be completely wrong on that. In any case, I don't find this to be very important. I would just throw away this estimate, but if the authors choose to keep it, I would not object.</p></disp-quote><p>Our estimate for generation times is based on the experimental work by Yang et al., 2011 on the very isolate collection that we work on. It is, to our knowledge, the best available for the CF environment. This is highlighted in the legend (Supplementary file 1A legend).</p></body></sub-article></article>
