Here we show that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22), a target-derived presynaptic organizer in the mouse hippocampus, induces the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. FGF22 is released from CA3 pyramidal neurons and organizes the differentiation of excitatory nerve terminals formed onto them. Local application of FGF22 on the axons of dentate granule cells (DGCs), which are presynaptic to CA3 pyramidal neurons, induces IGF2 in the DGCs. IGF2, in turn, localizes to DGC presynaptic terminals and stabilizes them in an activity-dependent manner. IGF2 application rescues presynaptic defects of <italic>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cultures. IGF2 is dispensable for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for the following presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. These results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian hippocampus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12151.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12151.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12151.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells in the developing brain must organize themselves into complex networks by forming appropriate connections with one another. These connections are known as synapses, and they assemble via two critical stages. First, a new synapse forms, and then it stabilizes. This first stage is a localized event that involves the contact site between the two nerve cells, while the stabilization of a synapse requires the expression of genes in a nerve cell’s nucleus. Furthermore, only active synapses may be stabilized.</p><p>Many synapses form in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which plays a key role in learning and memory. A protein called fibroblast growth factor 22 (or FGF22 for short) helps synapses to initially form within the hippocampus. However, much less is known about the signals that regulate the stabilization of synapses and the genes that are involved. It is also not clear if these genes might be controlled by FGF22 signaling.</p><p>To address these questions, Terauchi et al. searched the mouse hippocampus for genes with expression that depended on FGF22 signaling. One gene in particular, which encodes a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), was much less expressed in mice that lack FGF22 compared to normal mice. Further experiments revealed that only active nerve cells transport IGF2 to synapses, and that IGF2 helps to stabilize these structures. By contrast, IGF2 is not required for synapse to initially form. This indicates that FGF22 controls both the formation and stabilization of synapses, and that it controls the first stage directly, and the second stage indirectly via its effects on IGF2 expression.</p><p>Terauchi et al. also showed that FGF22-IGF2 signaling is not involved in the stabilization of all synapses in the mouse hippocampus. Instead, synapses between different types of nerve cell appear to use distinct signals for synapse formation and stabilization. A key topic for future studies will be to understand these specific signals and how they cooperate in the brain to establish precise networks of nerve cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12151.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12151.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synaptic stabilization</kwd><kwd>feedback signaling</kwd><kwd>neural activity</kwd><kwd>presynaptic organizer</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS070005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umemori</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH091429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umemori</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-NS072192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehtinen</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bipolar Disorder Fund for Neuroscience Research at Harvard University, supported by Kent and Liz Dauten</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umemori</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Feedback signaling between the synapse and nucleus via FGF22 and IGF2 directs the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mouse hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses are the sites of neuronal communication in the brain. Proper synapse formation is critical for appropriate brain function; aberrant synaptic connectivity may result in various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism, Fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casillas-Espinosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lisman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</xref>). Synapse formation begins with target recognition by axons, which is followed by synaptic differentiation at the contact sites. Synaptic differentiation is regulated by signals that are exchanged between pre- and postsynaptic sites. Various target-derived presynaptic organizers, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), WNTs, neurotrophins, neuroligins, Ephs/ephrins, SynCAMs, netrin-G ligands (NGLs), and signal regulatory proteins (SIRPs) are shown to promote local differentiation of presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Darabid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox and Umemori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henriquez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson-Venkatesh and Umemori, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Regehr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salinas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen and Scheiffele, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siddiqui and Craig, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zweifel et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Initial synapses thereafter maturate, resulting in a more stable, functional, and finely tuned neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goda and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>). Presynaptic stabilization has been shown to require gene expression. At the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a retrograde signal initiated by glass bottom boat (Gbb), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of bone morphogenic protein (BMP), controls presynaptic growth and stabilization through transcriptional regulation in motor neurons. During this process, Gbb and its receptor are internalized and transported from the nerve terminal to the cell body as a retrograde signal. This signal then activates a transcription factor, Mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marqués et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCabe et al., 2003</xref>). Activated Mad regulates transcription of genes including <italic>Trio</italic> and <italic>dfmr1</italic> (fly homolog of FMR1). Trio and dFMR1 play critical roles in modulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics and stabilizing microtubules in the presynaptic motor neurons, leading to presynaptic growth and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ball et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nahm et al., 2013</xref>). In the mammalian brain, changes in gene expression, as a consequence of axon–dendrite contacts, are also likely to contribute to presynaptic stabilization. For example, expression of genes encoding vesicle proteins increases soon after synaptogenesis begins, and neurons synthesize different isoforms of vesicle proteins before and after their axons contact targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campagna et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lou and Bixby, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plunkett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). In addition, synaptic stabilization is influenced by neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ackermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lichtman and Colman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruthazer and Cline, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waites et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is not known whether and how target-derived molecules control gene transcription in the presynaptic neurons for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals, and whether such a pathway is regulated by neural activity.</p><p>We have previously found that FGF22 serves as a target-derived presynaptic organizer in the mouse hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory, emotional processing, and social behavior. FGF22 is released from CA3 pyramidal neurons and promotes local differentiation of the excitatory presynaptic terminals formed onto them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terauchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2015</xref>). FGF22-dependent presynaptic differentiation requires two FGF receptors (FGFRs), FGFR2b and FGFR1b, in dentate granule cells (DGCs), the major presynaptic neurons for CA3 pyramidal neurons, and the downstream signaling molecules FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) and PI-3 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dabrowski et al., 2015</xref>). Signals mediated by FRS2 and PI-3 kinase are known to regulate gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that FGF22 signaling eventually regulates gene expression and that those FGF22-induced molecules, in turn, contribute to the stabilization of presynaptic terminals.</p><p>Here, we identified FGF22 target genes in the presynaptic DGCs and asked whether the target genes contribute to presynaptic stabilization. We find that i) target-derived FGF22 signaling induces the expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (<italic>Igf2</italic>) gene in DGCs, ii) IGF2 then localizes to presynaptic terminals of DGCs and stabilizes them, iii) the transportation of IGF2 to the presynaptic terminal is activity-dependent, and iv) IGF2 is not required for the initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for subsequent presynaptic stabilization both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, FGF22 is a target-derived molecule not only organizing local, initial presynaptic differentiation, but also regulating IGF2 expression in the presynaptic neurons. IGF2, in turn, contributes to presynaptic stabilization in an activity-dependent manner. Our results reveal a novel feedback signal that is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inactivation of FGF22 decreases IGF2 expression in DGCs during synapse formation</title><p>FGF signals are involved in the development of many organs via regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that in the hippocampus, the excitatory presynaptic organizer FGF22 would activate gene expression in the presynaptic neurons for the stabilization of presynaptic terminals. We focused on genes expressed in DGCs, because they provide a major excitatory input to CA3 pyramidal neurons, and their presynaptic differentiation is dependent on FGF22–FGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dabrowski et al., 2015</xref>).

We next asked where the induced IGF2 localizes in the DGCs. To address this question, we transfected EGFP-tagged IGF2 (IGF2-EGFP) and analyzed its localization in cultured DGCs. IGF2-EGFP showed a punctate pattern in neurofilament-positive axons of DGCs, while it was dim and diffuse throughout MAP2-positive dendrites of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). IGF2-EGFP puncta in the axons of cultured DGCs were colocalized with cotransfected synaptophysin-mCherry (83.1 ± 1.0% of IGF2-EGFP puncta were colocalized with synaptophysin-mCherry; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that IGF2 localizes to presynaptic terminals. We then asked whether IGF2, which is a secreted protein, is localized on the surface of presynaptic terminals. We stained IGF2-EGFP transfected neurons with the anti-GFP antibody without a detergent followed by Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

IGF2R, the major receptor for IGF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez and Torres-Aleman, 2012</xref>), showed a punctate pattern in the axons of DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and was localized at presynaptic terminals (84.32 ± 0.90% of IGF2R puncta were colocalized with VGLUT1 puncta; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Initial synaptic differentiation is usually regarded as an activity-independent step, while synaptic maturation, including synaptic growth, elimination, and stabilization, is influenced by neural activity. Our previous report identified that activity-dependent refinement of DGC–CA3 connections begins at ~P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yasuda et al., 2011</xref>), which is around when we observed decreased IGF2 expression in <italic>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, we next asked whether IGF2 expression, IGF2 localization, and/or IGF2 function for synaptogenesis require neural activity. With FGF22 treatment, IGF2 expression increased in the soma of cultured DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Blockade of neural activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) did not disturb the ability of FGF22 to increase IGF2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). We then examined the effect of TTX on presynaptic localization of IGF2. We found that TTX treatment reduced the clustering and synaptic localization of IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Finally, we assessed the requirement of neural activity in IGF2 function to induce presynaptic development. IGF2 overexpression increased synaptophysin-YFP accumulation in cultured DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). This increase was completely blocked by TTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). These results indicate that neural activity is not required for FGF22 to induce IGF2 expression, but is necessary for IGF2 to localize to and organize development of presynaptic terminals. To confirm that the activity of presynaptic neurons is critical for the localization and function of IGF2, we suppressed intrinsic neuronal excitability of DGCs by sparsely transfecting the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.1, in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson-Venkatesh et al, 2015</xref>). Similarly to the results with TTX, Kir2.1 expression in DGCs decreased the synaptic localization of IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>) and completely blocked the synaptogenic function of IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>).

Meanwhile, decreased IGF2 expression was observed in <italic>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at P14, but not at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and the effects of IGF2 on presynaptic development is activity-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). These results raise the possibility that IGF2 contributes to FGF22-dependent presynaptic development in a stage-specific manner: IGF2 is not required during the initial stage but is required during the following stage of synapse formation, i.e., activity-dependent synapse stabilization. To test this possibility, we employed an shRNA knockdown approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) to silence the expression of IGF2 in DGCs from 1DIV by using two independent shRNA plasmids. Knockdown of IGF2 did not apparently alter the morphology of DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). We assessed synaptic vesicle (synaptophysin-YFP) accumulation in response to FGF22 in the axons of IGF2-knockdown DGCs (from 1DIV) during the initial presynaptic differentiation (6DIV) and subsequent presynaptic stabilization (12DIV) stages. At 6DIV, we did not observe any differences between IGF2-knockdown and control DGCs: the basal levels of synaptophysin-YFP accumulation were not different, and IGF2-knockdown DGCs still responded to FGF22 treatment to increase the accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). On the other hand, at 12DIV, the number and size of synaptophysin-YFP puncta were significantly decreased in IGF2-knockdown DGCs compared to those in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). In addition, IGF2-knockdown DGCs no longer show FGF22-dependent increases in the accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). These results suggest that IGF2 is not necessary for the initial presynaptic differentiation induced by FGF22, but is required for a later stage of presynaptic development. To confirm the role of IGF2 in the late stage of presynaptic development, we knocked down IGF2 from 6DIV and assessed presynaptic development at 12DIV. IGF2 knockdown from 6DIV decreased the number and size of presynaptic terminals (as assessed by synaptophysin-YFP accumulation) and blocked the synaptogenic effects of FGF22 at 12DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>), suggesting that IGF2 is indeed critical for the later stage of presynaptic stabilization.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12151.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>IGF2 is dispensable for FGF22-dependent initial presynaptic differentiation, but is required for subsequent presynaptic stabilization.</title><p>(<bold>A-D</bold>) Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with the plasmid expressing synaptophysin-YFP together with the plasmid expressing either control-shRNA, IGF2-shRNA#1, or IGF2-shRNA#2 at 1DIV.

In contrast, in the mammalian brain, such feedback pathways for presynaptic stabilization had not been identified. We focused on FGF signaling, because gene expression is one of the most significant outcomes of FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dorey and Amaya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Partanen, 2007</xref>). Thus, FGF-dependent gene expression is poised to have important effects on neuronal network development. Here, we have shown that the FGF22–IGF2 signaling serves as a feedback pathway important for the stabilization of DGC presynaptic terminals in the mammalian hippocampus.</p><p>An important next question is how IGF2 stabilizes presynaptic terminals. IGF2, which often acts as an autocrine factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollak et al., 2004</xref>), mediates its functions mainly via IGF2 receptor (IGF2R) as well as via IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez and Torres-Aleman, 2012</xref>). In neurons, both receptors are used to mediate IGF2 signal and participate in various physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agis-Balboa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmeisser et al., 2012</xref>). We showed that IGF2 is secreted and tethered on the surface of presynaptic terminals of DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). IGF2R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement1</xref>) and IGF1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>) are also localized at presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that IGF2 is secreted from the presynaptic terminal and binds to IGF2R/IGF1R, which is also localized at the presynaptic terminal, so that IGF2 acts locally in an autocrine manner for its effects. Yet, we cannot exclude the possibility that IGF2 may also act as a global presynaptic organizer if IGF2 is released from the presynaptic terminal. IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which may regulate local translation, and IGF2R is known to signal through G proteins, which may ultimately affect calcium homeostasis. Calcium homeostasis and local translation of synaptic proteins, as well as regulation of cytoskeletal structures like Trio may all contribute to IGF2-dependent presynaptic stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic stabilization by IGF2</title><p>Neural activity is involved in synaptic stabilization. It has been proposed that active synapses are stabilized and inactive ones are destabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lichtman and Colman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruthazer and Cline, 2004</xref>). Various forms of activity are involved: in most cases, synaptic transmission and synaptic competition are considered critical for synapse refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lichtman and Colman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waites et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, intrinsic activity also plays critical roles in synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson-Venkatesh et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which intrinsic activity contributes to synapse stabilization during development are largely unknown. We found that IGF2's function in synaptic stabilization requires intrinsic neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). IGF2 is not transported to presynaptic terminals when intrinsic neuronal excitability of DGCs is suppressed. Thus, our results reveal that IGF2 is a mediator of intrinsic activity-dependent presynaptic stabilization. Since IGF2's effects are for the stabilization of synaptic vesicles but not for the initial recruitment of synaptic vesicles (which is carried out by FGF22), it is reasonable that TTX/Kir2.1 did not affect synaptic vesicle transportation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>How does intrinsic activity regulate IGF2 localization? Neural activity is known to control motor function of KIF proteins and regulate intracellular transport of synaptic components, such as mitochondria and AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoerndli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saxton and Hollenbeck, 2012</xref>). Neural activity also modulates phosphorylation of the C terminal domain of KIF3A, which affects loading of N-cadherin containing cargos and contributes to the maintenance of homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, neural activity may regulate the IGF2 transport complex through phosphorylation of motor proteins. It will be interesting to investigate the mechanisms of IGF2 transport to presynaptic terminals and how neural activity regulates the transport.</p><p>In addition, neural activity may regulate the secretion of IGF2. Neural activity controls exocytotic secretion of cytoplasmic vesicles in neurons: in olfactory bulb neurons, K<sup>+</sup>-induced depolarization activates the exocytotic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor, synaptotagmin-10, to induce secretion of IGF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in addition to transportation, secretion of IGF2 at presynaptic sites might also be controlled by neural activity. If this is the case, one may speculate that activity blockade would increase the intracellular IGF2 levels. However, we did not observe an increase in the intracellular IGF2 levels, probably because neural activity is also critical for IGF2 transportation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>It is also possible that various activity-dependent genes might influence IGF2/IGF2R localization, which is an interesting future study. Our Kir2.1 experiments, in which Kir2.1 was sparsely transfected so that we can ignore effects from postsynaptic neurons, suggest that changes in postsynaptic activity do not play critical roles in IGF2 localization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell-wide development of presynaptic neurons by IGF2</title><p>In addition to presynaptic stabilization, signals propagated from target-derived molecules may influence further cell-wide development of the presynaptic neurons. In the mammalian brain, signaling from target-derived neurotrophins has been well characterized. For example, nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling regulates gene expression, including <italic>TrkA</italic>, <italic>p75</italic>, <italic>Bdnf</italic>, and <italic>Ntf5</italic>, and controls cell survival and death of own and neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deppmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singh et al., 2008</xref>) as well as dendritic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Since IGF2 has been shown to exhibit broad functions in the brain, IGF2 may not only contribute to presynaptic stabilization, but also various aspects of cell-wide development, including neurogenesis, neurite growth, and spine maturation. For neurogenesis, IGF2 is implicated in maintenance and expansion of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ziegler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2014</xref>) and proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns and Hassan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehtinen et al., 2011</xref>) in the developing brain. IGF2 also contributes to adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ouchi et al., 2013</xref>). For neuronal development, IGF2 leads to nerve sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caroni and Grandes, 1990</xref>), neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2013</xref>), as well as spine maturation in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmeisser et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, IGF2 may serve as a general regulator of the development of presynaptic neurons (DGCs) downstream of FGF22.</p><p>Since IGF2 is still expressed in calbindin-positive DGCs in <italic>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), IGF2 can be expressed in an FGF22-independent manner as well. Indeed, IκB, which is not utilized by FGF22 signaling, has been shown to induce expression of IGF2 for spine maturation in mature hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmeisser et al., 2012</xref>). The expression of the mouse <italic>Igf2</italic> gene is regulated by three alternative promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sasaki et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, different signals seem to be used to regulate distinct phases of neuronal development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Temporal and spatial specificity of IGF2 effects</title><p>The presynaptic effects of IGF2 are stage and cell-type specific. FGF22-dependent IGF2 expression was observed in young, calretinin-positive DGCs, but not in mature, calbindin-positive DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Specific responsiveness of calretinin-positive DGCs to FGF22 appears to be linked to the developmental stage. Calretinin-positive DGCs elongate axons to CA3 and contact CA3 pyramidal neurons to form synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aguilar-Arredondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ming and Song, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yasuda et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, around that stage, DGCs may become more responsive to FGF22. Our results are consistent with the idea that IGF2 is induced by CA3-derived FGF22 when DGC axons contact with their target dendrites. The data from CA3-selective <italic>Fgf22</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the local FGF22 application experiments, in which IGF2 was induced by axonal application of FGF22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–I</xref>), further support this idea. Our results also suggest that IGF2 is not critical for initial synaptic differentiation, because no defects were found in the absence of IGF2 at 6DIV in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>) or P8 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, it is important for the later stages of synapse development: after 6DIV in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>) and P14 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), when neural activity influences synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yasuda et al., 2011</xref>). As IGF2 effects are activity dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we propose that IGF2, induced by target-derived FGF22, is mainly important for the stages of activity-dependent synapse stabilization.</p><p>Interestingly, induction of IGF2 by FGF22 is specific to DGCs. CA3 pyramidal neurons, which release FGF22, receive excitatory synaptic inputs from collateral/associational CA3 pyramidal neurons and stellate cells in the entorhinal cortex, in addition to inputs from DGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Urban et al., 2001</xref>). However, CA3 neurons do not respond to FGF22 to induce IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since <italic>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice show defects in excitatory synapse formation both in the SL (where DGC to CA3 synapses are located) as well as SR (where CA3 to CA3 synapses are located) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terauchi et al., 2010</xref>), the lack of IGF2 induction in CA3 neurons indicates that IGF2 is a unique target of FGF22 specifically in differentiating DGCs. It is possible that CA3 neurons express genes other than IGF2 in an FGF22-dependent manner for presynaptic stabilization. If so, different types of presynaptic neurons might process FGF22 signaling through their own transcription regulation to promote neuron type-specific presynaptic stabilization.</p><p>It is worth noting that many synapse organizing molecules show input specificity. FGF22 affects synapse formation in the SR and SL layers of CA3, but not the SLM (stratum lacunosum moleculare) layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terauchi et al., 2010</xref>). Neuroligins in cerebellar Purkinje cells have a role in the formation of climbing fiber synapses, but not parallel-fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Cadherin-9 is involved in the formation and differentiation of DGC–CA3 synapses, but not CA3–CA3 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Neuroligin2 regulates inhibitory synaptic function in a pathway-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it appears that there are input specific synaptic organizers that cooperate to establish precise networks in the brain. Our work on IGF2, which is specific to DGC–CA3 synapses, would add an example of how our brain utilizes specific molecules to emerge synapse specificity.</p><p>It will be also interesting to examine whether stabilization of inhibitory synapses is regulated by a similar feedback pathway. In CA3, FGF7 acts as a target-derived presynaptic organizing molecule for inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terauchi et al., 2010</xref>). Our preliminary screen suggests that FGF22 and FGF7 may regulate distinct molecules in excitatory (DGCs) vs. inhibitory neurons for synapse stabilization, because <italic>Igf2</italic> was not identified as a target gene of FGF7.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implication in neuropsychiatric disorders</title><p>IGF2 is implicated in behavioral phenotypes such as fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agis-Balboa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Agis-Balboa and Fischer, 2014</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2015</xref>), and memory consolidation and enhancement in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pascual-Lucas et al., 2014</xref>).

Data were obtained with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), digitized with Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments) and collected with Clampex 10.0 (Axon Instruments). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted with 4–6 MΩ pipette containing (in mM) 135 K-MeSO<sub>4</sub>, 7 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Li-GTP, and 7 phosphocreatine. Cells were held at -70 mV. aCSF was supplemented during recording with 500 nM tetrodotoxin and 50 µM picrotoxin and warmed to 32°C. mEPSCs were analyzed using Minianalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA).</p><p>For fEPSP recordings: mice (2–3 months old) were decapitated and the hippocampal lobules cut in the same solution as above. Transverse slices (400 µm) of the hippocampus were then cut using a tissue chopper (Stoelting, Kiel, WI). After slicing, sections were incubated in an NMDG-HEPES recovery solution for 15 min at 34°C before putting the slices into aCSF for 1 hr. Slices were then incubated in aCSF at room temperature for at least 1 hr before recording. Then, slices were transferred to a recording chamber, maintained at 32°C and continuously perfused at 1–2 ml/min with oxygenated aCSF. Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass and filled with 1 M NaCl, 25 mM HEPES (1.5 mm o.d.; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The recording pipette was placed in the in the SL or SR layers of the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Recordings were made with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, collected using Clampex 10.3, and analyzed using Clampfit 10.3. fEPSPs were evoked using cluster electrodes (FHC) placed in the SL or SR layers of the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Current between 0.1–1 mA for 0.1 s was used to elicit a response. Maximum responses were then used for paired-pulse facilitation experiments. 1 µM DGC-IV was then added to the aCSF and the experiments were repeated after 10 min of perfusion with drug.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Imaging</title><p>Fluorescent images were taken on epi-fluorescence microscopes (Olympus BX61 and BX63) or confocal microscopes (Olympus FV1000 and Carl Zeiss LSM700, Germany). With epi-fluorescence microscopes, 12-bit images at a 1,376 x 1,032 (Olympus BX61) or 1,376 x 1,038 (Olympus BX63) pixel resolution were acquired with 40x and 20x objective lenses using an F-View II CCD camera (Soft Imaging System, Germany) or an XM10 Monochrome camera (Olympus). With confocal microscopes, 12-bit (FV1000) or 8-bit (LSM700) images at a 1,024 x 1,024 pixel resolution were obtained using 20x, 40x and 63x objective lenses with a 1.0 or 1.5x zoom. Images were acquired as a z-stack (17–20 optical sections, 0.4 μm step size). Images in the same set of experiments were acquired with the identical acquisition settings regarding the exposure time, laser power, detector gain, or amplifier offset.</p><p>The intensity of stained signals and the size and density of stained puncta were quantified and analyzed using MetaMorph software. For images of hippocampal sections, the staining intensity in the lateral ventricle was calculated as the background signal and subtracted from each image. For images of cultured neurons stained for synaptic proteins, the staining intensity of the dendritic shaft in control cultures was calculated as the background signal and subtracted from each image. For images of cultured neurons stained for anti-IGF2 antibody, the lowest staining intensity in the culture was calculated as the background signal and subtracted from each image. For colocalization analyses, objects were considered to colocalize if more than 25% of the object was overlapped with the other object.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical tests performed were two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or Two-way ANOVA, as indicated in the figure legend.

The authors previously showed that target-derived FGF22 promoted presynaptic differentiation of excitatory synapses between dentate gyrus granule cells (DGCs) and CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (Terauchi et al., Nature 2010). They also showed that another target-derived factor, SIRPα, regulated synapse maturation of DGCs during postnatal weeks 2-4 (Toth et al., Nat Neurosci 2013). In this manuscript, the authors report decreased IGF2 expression in calretinin-positive DGCs in total and CA3-specific FGF22-null mice in vivo, and that bath and local application of FGF22 induced expression of IGF2 specifically in calretinin-positive immature DGCs in vitro. Overexpressed IGF2-EGFP localized to DGC axons in an activity-dependent manner and promoted presynaptic differentiation, as measured by accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP. In addition, treatment with IGF2 restored excitatory presynapse differentiation in FGF22-null CA3 neurons in vitro without changes in postsynaptic markers. FGF22-dependent accumulation of synaptophysin-YFP in cultured wild-type DGCs required IGF2 only after 6DIV. Finally, excitatory synapses were reduced in IGF2-null calretinin-positive DGCs in vivo. From these data, authors conclude that target-derived FGF2 induces expression of IGF2, which is critical for the activity-dependent stabilization of DGC presynaptic terminals on CA3 neurons. It has not been clear whether and how target-derived molecules control gene transcription and stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the mammalian CNS. This study that sheds light on the novel role of FGF22-induced IGF2 in activity-dependent stabilization of presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus. However, several key issues need to be addressed to support the authors' claim.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most of the data presented in this manuscript are of high quality and convincing, except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Immunoreactive signals from IGF2 antibody are too faint and weak. Because the authors have potent IGF2 knockdown vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and IGF2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), the authors could validate the IGF2 antibody using these reagents.</p><p>2) The decrease in the frequency of mEPSCs in IGF2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and 9E</xref>) could be explained by a decrease in the release sites (inputs) and/or a decrease in the probability of neurotransmitter release. The authors could analyze the paired-pulse ratio to help interpret the data.</p><p>3) It is not completely clear at which stage of synapse development IGF2 works. As the same authors classified previously (Toth et al., Nat Neurosci 2013), three different stages of synapse development can be defined for DGC-CA3 synapses: P0-P14, initial synapse differentiation; P15-P29, synapse maturation; P30-P44, synapse maintenance. In most experiments, authors examined the effect of IGF2 at 10DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) or 13DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, IGF2 is highly expressed in calretinin-positive DGCs, which mostly correspond to neurons born 3-17.5 days ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, IGF2 appears to be a molecule that regulates initial synapse &quot;differentiation&quot; after FGF22. The authors claim that IGF2 is dispensable for initial presynaptic differentiation, but critical for presynaptic stabilization based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. However, in this experiment, FGF22 was applied to hippocampal neurons transfected with shRNA against IGF2 at 1DIV and examined at 6DIV or 12DIV. FGF22-induced synaptophysin accumulation was observed in neurons fixed at 6DIV, but not those at 12DIV. However, prolonged knockdown of IGF2 could have non-specific effects on neurons, such as reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced expression of FGF receptors. To examine the role of IGF2 at later synapse developmental stages, the authors need to knockdown IGF2 at later time points.</p><p>4) It is interesting that FGF22-induced IGF2 expression only in calretinin-positive young DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but not in other DGCs, which also respond to FGF22. However, IGF2 immunoreactivity remained unaffected in calbindin-positive DGCs in FGF22-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that IGF2 can be expressed in an FGF-independent manner. Many questions remain unanswered here. What determines the specific responsiveness of calretinin-positive DGCs to FGF22? How is IGF2 expressed in calbindin-positive DGCs in FGF22-null mice? What roles does IGF2 play in calbindin-positive DGCs? Why do DGCs express IGF2 by two different pathways (i.e., FGF22-dependent and independent) at different developmental stages? The authors need to provide some explanations. In most of the vitro experiments, the authors examined the roles of IGF2 on presynaptic differentiation in prox1-positive DGCs, which includes many calretinin-negative DGCs. Considering that FGF22-induced IGF2 expression was specifically observed in calretinin-positive DGCs, the authors need to focus on these cells, or at least show what percentage of their cultured neurons corresponds to calretinin-positive DGCs.</p><p>5) The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref> is attractive, but is not completely supported by their data. First, it is unclear where and how IGF2 is located on presynaptic sites. Is overexpressed IGF2-EGFP localized on the surface of presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)? If so, depending on where and how IGF2 is released, IGF2 should not be considered as a local, but a global, presynaptic organizer. Second, it is unclear where and how neuronal activity is required for the effect of IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If IGF2 is secreted by neuronal activity as the authors suggest in the Discussion, why didn’t tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment increase intracellular IGF2 levels? IGF2 may be transported to presynaptic terminals by neuronal activity, but why didn’t TTX treatment affect transport of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>)? Neuronal activity may affect the exocytosis/endocytosis ratio or stabilization of IGF2 in axons. It is also possible that TTX treatment for 7 days from 1DIV may change expression of various genes that affect axon branching and expression of IGF2 receptors. Changes in postsynaptic neuronal activity may also contribute to presynaptic accumulation of synaptophsyin-YFP by some other mechanisms. These issues require further clarification and discussion.</p><p>6) The role of endogenous IGF2 at DGC-CA3 synapses in vivo is not completely clear from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Because the authors recorded from CA3 neurons, mEPSCs originating from synapses at the strata radiatum and lucidum are mixed. The authors need to show that mossy fiber-evoked EPSC(P)s are specifically affected in IGF2-null mice. In addition, changes in presynaptic differentiation should be assessed by paired-pulse stimulation of specific input fibers. Electron microscopic analyses of pre- and postsynaptic structures of DGC-CA3 synapses in IGF2-null mice would also strengthen the authors' argument.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12151.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><p> <italic>1) Most of the data presented in this manuscript are of high quality and convincing, except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

However, prolonged knockdown of IGF2 could have non-specific effects on neurons, such as reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced expression of FGF receptors. To examine the role of IGF2 at later synapse developmental stages, the authors need to knockdown IGF2 at later time points.</italic> We appreciate the comment. In our previous papers, we have defined the stages of synapse development based on its dependence on neural activity: in the hippocampus, synapse development from P0 to ~P14 is not apparently influenced by neural activity (&quot;initial synapse differentiation&quot;), but that from ~P14 to ~P28 is regulated by activity, where we found that activity-dependent synapse maturation (e.g., mediated by SIRP; Toth et al., 2013) and activity-dependent synapse elimination (Yasuda et al., 2011) take place. Because the effects of IGF2 are dependent on neural activity, we proposed that IGF2 is critical for &quot;synapse maturation/stabilization&quot; in the manuscript. As suggested, we have further examined the role of IGF2 at later stages of synapse development both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In vitro, we knocked down IGF2 at a later synapse developmental stage, from DIV6, and examined the effects at DIV12. We found that IGF2 knockdown from DIV6 decreased the number and size of presynaptic terminals (as assessed by synaptophysin-YFP) and blocked the synaptogenic effects of FGF22. Since IGF2 knockdown from DIV1-DIV6 did not affect presynaptic terminals or synaptogenic effects of FGF22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), our result suggests that IGF2 is indeed critical for a later stage of synapse development (after DIV6). This new result is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>.</p><p>In vivo, we analyzed the time course of presynaptic development in IGF2KO mice from P8 to P29. We found that in the SL layer of CA3, IGF2KO mice show no presynaptic defects at P8, but start to show mild defects at P14 (the number of VGLUT1 puncta was normal, but their size was decreased), and exhibit significant defects at P21 and P29 (both the number and size of VGLUT1 puncta were significantly decreased). We did not detect any changes in the SR layer of CA3. Thus, IGF2 appears to be mainly important for DGC-CA3 synapse development after P14. These results are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>These results suggest that IGF2 is not critical for initial synapse development, but is important for the later stages of synapse development (after DIV6 or P14). As IGF2 effects are activity dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we propose that IGF2 is mainly important for the stages of synapse maturation and stabilization. These results are also discussed in the text (subsection “Temporal and Spatial Specificity of IGF2 Effects”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) It is interesting that FGF22-induced IGF2 expression only in calretinin-positive young DGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but not in other DGCs, which also respond to FGF22. However, IGF2 immunoreactivity remained unaffected in calbindin-positive DGCs in FGF22-null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that IGF2 can be expressed in an FGF-independent manner.

The authors need to provide some explanations.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that because IGF2 is still expressed in calbindin-positive DGCs in <italic>Fgf22<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, IGF2 can be expressed in an FGF22-independent manner as well. Indeed, IκB, which is not utilized by FGF22 signaling, has been shown to induce expression of IGF2 for spine maturation in mature hippocampal neurons (Schmeisser MJ, et al., 2012). The expression of the mouse <italic>Igf2</italic> gene is regulated by three alternative promoters (Sasaki et al., 1992). Thus, different signals seem to be used to regulate distinct phases of neuronal development.</p><p>Specific responsiveness of calretinin-positive DGCs to FGF22 appears to be linked to the developmental stage. Calretinin-positive DGCs elongate axons to CA3 and contact CA3 pyramidal neurons to form synapses (Ming and Song, 2005; Li et al., 2009; Aguilar-Arredondo A et al., 2015; Yasuda et al., 2011), and that is when DGCs respond to FGF22. Thus, around that stage, DGCs may become more responsive to FGF22. We have included these points in the Discussion (subsection “Temporal and Spatial Specificity of IGF2 Effects”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>In most of the vitro experiments, the authors examined the roles of IGF2 on presynaptic differentiation in prox1-positive DGCs, which includes many calretinin-negative DGCs.

As suggested, we examined the percentage of calretinin-positive DGCs in culture by co-staining for calretinin and prox1. We found that a majority of DGCs (around two thirds) were calretinin positive in our culture. Thus, our results with DGCs mostly reflect results from calretinin-positive DGCs. We have added these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and described the results in the text.</p><p><italic>5) The model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref> is attractive, but is not completely supported by their data. First, it is unclear where and how IGF2 is located on presynaptic sites. Is overexpressed IGF2-EGFP localized on the surface of presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)? If so, depending on where and how IGF2 is released, IGF2 should not be considered as a local, but a global, presynaptic organizer.</italic></p><p>We examined whether IGF2-EGFP is localized on the surface of neurons by staining transfected neurons without a detergent (with anti-GFP followed by Alexa Fluor 647). We found that ~40% of IGF2-EGFP is localized on the surface of neurons. Furthermore, surface IGF2-EGFP is always localized at presynaptic terminals, as it shows perfect colocalization with synaptophysin-mCherry. A majority of intracellular IGF2 is also localized at presynaptic terminals (~75%).</p><p>In addition, we found that the major receptor for IGF2, IGF2R, is also localized at presynaptic terminals (a minor receptor for IGF2, IGFR1, is also localized at synapses; Gazit et al., 2016).</p><p>These results are consistent with the notion that IGF2 is secreted from the presynaptic terminal and binds to IGF2R, which is also localized at the presynaptic terminal, so that IGF2 acts locally in an autocrine manner for its effects. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We do agree that it is possible that secreted IGF2 may also act as a global presynaptic organizer if IGF2 is released from the presynaptic terminal. We have discussed this possibility in the text (subsection “A Novel Feedback Pathway through Transcriptional Regulation for Presynaptic Stabilization in the Mammalian Brain”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>Second, it is unclear where and how neuronal activity is required for the effect of IGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If IGF2 is secreted by neuronal activity as the authors suggest in the Discussion, why didn’t tetrodotoxin (TTX) treatment increase intracellular IGF2 level?. IGF2 may be transported to presynaptic terminals by neuronal activity, but why didn’t TTX treatment affect transport of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>)? Neuronal activity may affect the exocytosis/endocytosis ratio or stabilization of IGF2 in axons. It is also possible that TTX treatment for 7 days from 1DIV may change expression of various genes that affect axon branching and expression of IGF2 receptors. Changes in postsynaptic neuronal activity may also contribute to presynaptic accumulation of synaptophsyin-YFP by some other mechanisms. These issues require further clarification and discussion.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the comments. To further address the role of activity on IGF2 localization and function, we suppressed intrinsic neuronal excitability by overexpressing the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1. We found that co-expression of Kir2.1 with IGF2 decreased synaptic localization of IGF2 as well as its synaptogenic function, similarly to the effects of TTX. These experiments suggest that intrinsic neuronal excitability of the presynaptic neurons is critical for IGF2 localization and thus, for its synaptogenic function.</p><p>We think that since neural activity is important for IGF2 transportation, TTX/Kir2.1 did not increase the intracellular IGF2 levels. We also think that IGF2's effects are for the stabilization of synaptic vesicles but not for the initial recruitment of synaptic vesicles (which is carried out by FGF22), and thus, TTX/Kir2.1 did not affect synaptic vesicle transportation. We agree that neural activity may affect the secretion of IGF2, and we plan to utilize IGF2-pHluorin to test this idea in future studies. We also agree that various activity-dependent genes might influence IGF2/IGF2R localization, which is an interesting future study. Our Kir2.1 experiments, in which Kir2.1 was sparsely transfected so that we can ignore effects from postsynaptic neurons, suggest that changes in postsynaptic activity do not play critical roles in IGF2 localization and function. We have included the data with Kir2.1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref> and discussed these points in the text (subsection “Activity-Dependent Regulation of Presynaptic Stabilization by IGF2”).</p><p><italic>6) The role of endogenous IGF2 at DGC-CA3 synapses</italic> in vivo <italic>is not completely clear from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.
