Atg8 proteins are localized to the membrane in an ubiquitin-like conjugation reaction, but how this conjugation is coupled to the presence of the cargo is unclear. Here we show that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Atg19, Atg34 and the human p62, Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors interact with the E3-like enzyme Atg12~Atg5-Atg16, which stimulates Atg8 conjugation. The interaction of Atg19 with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is mediated by its Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs). We identify the AIM-binding sites in the Atg5 subunit and mutation of these sites impairs selective autophagy. In a reconstituted system the recruitment of the E3 to the prApe1 cargo is sufficient to drive accumulation of conjugated Atg8 at the cargo. The interaction of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and Atg8 with Atg19 is mutually exclusive, which may confer directionality to the system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18544.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18544.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A living cell must remove unhealthy or excess material from its interior in order to remain healthy and operational. Cells pack this waste into membrane-bound compartments named autophagosomes in a process called autophagy. So-called autophagy proteins make sure that only the unwanted material is eliminated. However, it was not completely clear how these proteins achieve this.</p><p>What was known was that proteins called cargo receptors recognize and bind to specific waste materials. At the same time, so-called autophagy enzymes tag the membranes of the autophagosome with a protein known as Atg8, so that cargo receptor molecules can bind this membrane. Now, Fracchiolla, Sawa-Makarska et al. report that, in yeast, an autophagy enzyme links these two events by binding to the cargo receptor and promoting the tagging of the autophagosome’s membrane at the same place. The enzyme in question is a complex made from three autophagy proteins (called Atg12, Atg5 and Atg16), and its activity ensures that the membrane is tagged only next to those materials that need to be disposed of.</p><p>Although it is now clearer how a cell’s waste ends up in the autophagosome, it is still puzzling how this process is regulated and how the other autophagy-related components contribute to this highly coordinated process. In particular, an important next step will be to find out what is the source of membrane that gives rise to the autophagosome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macro-autophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a conserved pathway for the delivery of cytoplasmic material into the lysosomal system for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraft and Martens, 2012</xref>). Upon induction of autophagy, double membrane organelles termed autophagosomes are formed in a de novo manner. Initially, autophagosome precursors appear as small membrane structures referred to as isolation membranes (or phagophores). As isolation membranes expand, they gradually enclose cytoplasmic cargo material. Upon closure of the isolation membranes, autophagosomes are formed within which the cargo is isolated from the rest of the cytoplasm. Autophagosomes subsequently fuse with the lysosomal compartment where the inner membrane and the cargo are eventually degraded.</p><p>When induced by starvation autophagy can be relatively non-selective with regard to the cargo that is sequestered within autophagosomes. However, it has become clear that autophagy can be highly selective and even exclusive when induced by the presence of intracellular cargo material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). Substances including aggregated proteins, cytosolic pathogens and damaged or surplus organelles have all been shown to be selectively degraded by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>). Autophagy thereby protects the organism from pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration, cancer and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> the cytoplasm-to-vacuole-targeting (Cvt) pathway mediates the delivery of the oligomeric prApe1 enzyme as well as Ams1 and Ape4 into the vacuole via small autophagosomes that are referred to as Cvt vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakatogawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Selectivity of autophagic processes is mediated by cargo receptors that link the cargo to isolation membranes due to their ability to simultaneously bind the cargo and Atg8-family proteins on the isolation membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansen and Lamark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stolz et al., 2014</xref>). The interaction of the cargo receptors with Atg8-family proteins is mediated by LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">;Ichimura et al., 2008</xref>) also known as Atg8 interacting motifs (AIMs) in the cargo receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noda et al., 2010</xref>). Atg8-family proteins are ubiquitin-like proteins that are conjugated to the headgroup of the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) rendering the otherwise soluble proteins membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>). This conjugation reaction is also referred to as lipidation. The Atg8 conjugation cascade is analogous to the chain of reactions that mediate the conjugation of ubiquitin to its substrates. Thus, Atg8 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7 under consumption of ATP and subsequently transferred to the E2-like enzyme Atg3 from which Atg8 is ultimately transferred to the headgroup of PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klionsky and Schulman, 2014</xref>). This last step is strongly facilitated by a complex composed of the Atg12~Atg5 protein conjugate and Atg16. The Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex acts in an E3-like manner and determines the site of Atg8 conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujita et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>). The Atg8 conjugation machinery acts in concert with other proteins of the autophagic machinery including the Atg1/ULK1 complex, the class III PI3K complex 1, Atg9 and the WIPIs to mediate the efficient generation of autophagosomes or Cvt vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujita et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Juris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kishi-Itakura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraft et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizushima et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sou et al., 2008</xref>). The precise mechanisms by which the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and Atg8 aid the formation, elongation or closure of the autophagosomal membranes are unclear.</p><p>Recent work has provided important information about how the presence of an autophagic cargo induces the formation of an isolation membrane. In particular, it was shown that the Atg19 cargo receptor recruits the Atg11 scaffold protein to the prApe1 cargo for Atg1 kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Torggler et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, it was demonstrated that the cargo receptors Optineurin and NDP52 recruit the ULK1 complex to damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, TRIM proteins were shown to localize the ULK1, PI3K complexes and ATG16L1 to their cargo in a process referred to as precision autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A major question is how the presence of an autophagic cargo is coupled to Atg8 conjugation and thus isolation membrane formation in space and time. Here we show that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Atg19 and Atg34 as well as the human p62, Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors interact with the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex. Employing Atg19 as a model in a fully reconstituted system we show that it is capable of recruiting Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 to the prApe1 cargo. This recruitment is mediated by a direct interaction of the AIM motifs in Atg19 with the Atg5 subunit. In our in vitro system the recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is sufficient to drive accumulation of lipidated Atg8 at the cargo. Since the interaction of the Atg19 cargo receptor with the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is outcompeted by Atg8, the system may have an inherent directionality whereby the final product in form of Atg8~PE could displace the upstream conjugation machinery at the concave side of the isolation membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During classical ubiquitination reactions the localization of the E3 ligase determines where ubiquitin is conjugated to its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). We therefore asked if autophagic cargo receptors could interact with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 E3-like complex and thereby recruit it to the cargo. Indeed, in pull down experiments GST-Atg19 used as a bait successfully pulled down Atg12~Atg5-Atg16, demonstrating a direct interaction between these two components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a complementary approach we imaged the recruitment of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry to beads coated with GST-Atg19 under equilibrium condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry was robustly and specifically recruited to these beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The α-mannosidase (Ams1) receptor Atg34 was also able to bind the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that this interaction is a more general property of cargo receptors. In order to test if this interaction occurs in cells we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using Atg5-TAP to pull down 6xmyc-Atg19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Atg19 was specifically pulled down by Atg5-TAP. Employing the M-Track assay, which is based on the methylation of the human histone 3 N-terminus by the human SUV39H1 methyltransferase when the two components come into close contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zuzuarregui et al., 2012</xref>), we confirmed that Atg19 and the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex are in close proximity in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It was previously shown that overexpression of a methyltransferase does not result in unspecific methylation of the histone 3 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezovich et al., 2015</xref>). Next, we tested if the interaction of cargo receptors with the E3-like complex is conserved. To this end, we co-expressed human GFP-ATG5 and mCherry-p62 in HeLa cells in which the endogenous p62 had been knocked-down by RNAi. mCherry-p62 was efficiently co-precipitated by GFP-ATG5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We confirmed this result by using a microscopy-based assay in which we imaged the recruitment of mCherry-p62 to GFP-ATG5 coated beads in HeLa cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We extended this analysis by investigating other human cargo receptors and found that NDP52 was also pulled down by GFP-ATG5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In addition, we detected a weak but consistent co-precipitation of Optineurin (OPTN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In summary, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Atg19 and Atg34 cargo receptors directly interact with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 E3-like enzyme and an interaction with this complex is also detectable for the human cargo receptors p62, OPTN and NDP52.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cargo receptors interact with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots of GST-pull down experiments using GST-Atg19 as bait and the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex as prey.

However, when tested in isolation Atg16 did not show any detectable binding to Atg19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Full length Atg16 may therefore enhance the interaction by an allosteric effect on Atg5 or by increasing the avidity of the interaction due to its ability to self-associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujioka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufmann et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In order to identify the regions in Atg19 that are required for the interaction with Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 we tested a series of Atg19 truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) for their interaction with the entire complex and components thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Atg5 and Atg5-Atg16 showed robust interaction with all Atg19 truncations including the C-terminal domain encompassing amino acids 365–415 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The presence of Atg12, either in context of the Atg12~Atg5 conjugate or the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex, changed the properties of the interaction and required the presence of amino acids 124–254, which include the cargo binding domain of Atg19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamasaki et al., 2016</xref>). We corroborated the results of the pull down experiments for the full Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex in a microscopy-based assay under equilibrium conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This assay confirmed that the coiled-coil domain of Atg19 is required for the interaction when Atg5 is conjugated to Atg12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To interrogate the role of the C-terminal region of Atg19 we performed further microscopy-based interaction experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with the pull down experiments the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex bound strongly to full length Atg19 but not to the isolated C-terminus (amino acids 365–415) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>) . Intriguingly, deletion of the last eight amino acids containing the canonical AIM motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>) from the C-terminus of Atg19 strongly reduced the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggesting that this AIM motif contributes to the interaction of Atg19 with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex. Next, we further dissected the contribution of the AIM motifs in the Atg19 C-terminus to the interaction with Atg5. While deletion of the canonical AIM motif in the extreme C-terminus resulted in strong but incomplete reduction in Atg5 binding, further mutation of two additional AIM-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>) completely abolished the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The AIM-dependent association of Atg19 with Atg5 is relevant for the interaction of the two proteins in vivo as the W412A mutation in the canonical AIM motif of Atg19 results in markedly reduced interaction of the two proteins in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The AIM motifs in the C-terminal domain of Atg19 are required for its interaction with Atg5 and are competitively bound by Atg8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequence of the C-terminal domain (365-415) of Atg19 containing the canonical AIM motif (<sup>412</sup>WEEL<sup>415</sup>) and two AIM-like motifs (<sup>376</sup>FYSF<sup>379</sup>, <sup>384</sup>LPEL<sup>387</sup>).

To test this possibility, we immobilized the C-terminus of Atg19 on beads and added Atg5-mCherry-Atg16 (1–46). Subsequently, we added GFP-Atg8 or Atg8 to the beads and determined the signal of Atg5-mCherry-Atg16 (1–46) on the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Indeed, Atg8 outcompeted the Atg19-bound Atg5-mCherry-Atg16 (1–46) in a dose dependent manner. The loss of the Atg5-mCherry signal correlated with an increased GFP-Atg8 signal at the bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Thus, the interaction of Atg5 with the C-terminus of Atg19 is AIM-dependent and mutually exclusive with Atg8 binding. Next, we asked if the interaction of Atg19 with Atg5 is also mutually exclusive with the Atg19 - Atg8 interaction in the context of the entire Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and when Atg19 is bound to the prApe1 cargo. First, we generated cargo mimetic beads by attaching the prApe1 propeptide to them via a GST-tag. Consistent with previous results Atg19 was robustly recruited to these beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfaffenwimmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>). Next we tested if Atg19 recruited the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the artificial cargo. Indeed, the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex showed a strong Atg19 dependent signal at the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Employing this experimental setup, we then went on by adding GFP-Atg8 to the cargo mimetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The complex was displaced in a concentration dependent manner confirming that Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 and Atg8 compete for the same binding sites on Atg19.</p><p>The Atg5 subunit of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and the AIM-like motifs in Atg19 are both essential for the binding of these two components. Moreover, the interaction of Atg19 with Atg5 and Atg8 is mutually exclusive, strongly suggesting that the AIM motifs in Atg19 directly interact with Atg5. To identify potential binding sites in Atg5 for the AIM motif we employed computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. To this end, we used the structure of Atg5-Atg16 (1–46) from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (PDB:2DYO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsushita et al., 2007</xref>) and performed molecular dynamics simulations which allowed us to capture the flexibility of the Atg5-Atg16 (1–46) complex. Subsequently, in silico docking was performed for 10 randomly selected snapshots from the molecular dynamics trajectory using a peptide encompassing the canonical AIM motif (<sup>411</sup>TWEEL<sup>415</sup>) of Atg19. Modelling analysis suggested three possible binding sites for the peptide, two of which mapped to Atg5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) and one to a site formed by Atg16. Since our pull down experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) did not detect any direct interaction of Atg16 with Atg19 the latter site was excluded from further analysis. The other two sites were analyzed. Both contained residues that were persistently involved in forming salt bridges and/or hydrogen bonds with the TWEEL peptide. These were K57 and K137 in the first binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, pose 1) and N84 and R208 in the second binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, pose 2). These two sites show a similar architecture composed of a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by positively charged residues. Specifically, molecular dynamics simulations showed that the hydrophobic pocket serves to dock W412 and L415 of the TWEEL peptide, while lysine, arginine and asparagine residues on the surface of Atg5 contact the peptide via salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the glutamic acid residues E413 and E414. Structural superposition showed that the two sites are unrelated to the AIM-binding sites of Atg8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structure of the Atg5-Atg16 (1–46) complex with the predicted binding sites for the TWEEL peptide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of Atg5 in complex with the N-terminus of Atg16 (PDB:2DYO, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsushita et al., 2007</xref>]).

Atg5 K137E as well as Atg5 R208E still efficiently bound to Atg19, while the Atg5 K57E and Atg5 N84E mutants showed no detectable binding in this assay.</p><p>We went on to test the effect of the K57E and N84E mutations on the recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to cargo mimetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). The wild type Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry complex robustly localized to the beads. Introduction of the K57E into Atg5 resulted in a strongly reduced recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex, while the N84E mutation rendered the recruitment undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). When combined, the two mutations also resulted in a loss of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry complex recruitment to the beads. Thus, introducing negative charge at positions 57 and 84 in the two predicted AIM binding sites interfered with the interaction of the two proteins. These residues are therefore likely to be directly involved in the formation of binding sites for the AIM motif. Interestingly, in the context of the Atg12~Atg5 conjugate N84 in pose two would be largely covered by Atg12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This may explain why the C-terminal domain of Atg19 containing the AIM motif is not sufficient for the interaction with Atg12~Atg5 and requires the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>), which may reorient Atg12 away from pose 2.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutation of the predicted binding sites for Atg19 in Atg5 impairs the recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to cargo mimetic beads and Cvt pathway function but does not affect bulk autophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie stained gels showing the input amounts of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry complex (upper gel) and of the GST-prApe1(1–41) + Atg19 or GST proteins on the beads (lower gel) used for the experiment shown in (<bold>B</bold>).

Consistent with the results shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), wild type Atg5 robustly co-precipitated Atg19. The K57E,N84E double mutant Atg5 showed a strongly reduced ability to interact with Atg19, but the interaction was still detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). It was previously shown that Atg16 interacts with Atg21 and that this interaction recruits the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Juris et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore asked if the residual interaction of the K57E,N84E mutant Atg5 with Atg19 could be dependent on the recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the PAS by Atg21. To this end, we introduced the E102A mutation into Atg16, which was reported to abolish the Atg16 - Atg21 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Juris et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the interaction of the Atg5 K57E,N84E with Atg19 became undetectable in context of the Atg16 E102A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested the impact of the single mutations or their combination on the functionality of the Cvt pathway by monitoring prApe1 processing. The N84E mutation, which had the stronger effect on the Atg19 - Atg5 interaction also affected prApe1 processing more pronouncedly compared to the K57E mutation while the K57E,N84E double mutation had the strongest effect on prApe1 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the cells expressing Atg5-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) we consistently noticed a somewhat lower levels of the Atg12~Atg5 for the K57E,N84E double mutant under rich conditions. This effect was not seen for the myc-tagged version. prApe1 processing was also affected by the K57E,N84E double mutation under starvation condition in the context of the Atg16 D101A, E102A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast, starvation-induced bulk autophagy as measured by GFP-Atg8 cleavage and the Pho8∆60 assay was not significantly affected by the Atg5 K57E,N84E double mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>), even when tested in combination with the Atg16 D101A, E102A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The data presented so far have shown that the Atg19 cargo receptor can recruit the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the prApe1 cargo and that mutations that abolish this interaction reduce the efficiency of the Cvt pathway. The cargo receptor - E3 interaction might therefore be a minimal axis to couple Atg8 conjugation to the cargo. To test this hypothesis, we developed a fully reconstituted system to recapitulate these reactions. In analogy to the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, we added the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to cargo mimetic beads bound by Atg19. The Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex directly binds to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>) and it may thus be able to link membranes and the cargo. To test this, we added small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) labeled by the incorporation of ATTO390-PE or Rhodamine to Atg19-bound cargo mimetic beads in the presence or absence of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The SUVs were recruited to the beads in an Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The complexes containing the Atg19 binding defective mutants of Atg5 were less efficiently recruited to cargo mimetic beads and were also less efficient in membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the complex brings the membrane substrate for Atg8 conjugation in proximity of the cargo. Next we analyzed if this minimal system would allow local accumulation of conjugated Atg8 by adding the ubiquitin-like molecule GFP-Atg8, the E1-like enzyme Atg7, the E2-like enzyme Atg3, and the cofactors MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ATP to the system. Intriguingly, GFP-Atg8 showed increased signal at the cargo in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also detected an increased signal for the membrane and the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), likely due to its association with Atg8 and the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>). Since the presence of ATP increased the GFP-Atg8 signal at the beads, this effect may be due to lipidation of Atg8 and thus its stable anchoring and concentration on the membranes. If so, then the lipidated Atg8 should be more strongly bound by the Atg19 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>). To test this, we conducted FRAP experiments on the cargo mimetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Indeed, Atg8 recovered more slowly in the presence of ATP and recovery was slowest for the Atg8 positive puncta, which we interpret as larger Atg8-positive vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In vitro reconstitution of cargo-directed Atg8 lipidation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GST-prApe1(1–45) + Atg19 ± Atg12~Atg5-Atg16-mCherry coated Sepharose beads were imaged in the presence of ATTO390-containing SUVs and GFP-Atg8∆R117, Atg7, Atg3, MgCl<sub>2</sub> with or without ATP.

For this reason, we recruited vesicles to cargo mimetic beads via the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and washed away unbound vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Subsequently, we added the Atg8 conjugation machinery. In the presence of ATP the bead associated signal was increased, consistent with local lipidation of Atg8 at the cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To corroborate this result, we performed FRAP experiments on these beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Indeed, the recovery of Atg8 was much reduced in the presence of ATP, consistent with its stable attachment to the membrane via lipidation. Furthermore, upon addition of the Atg4 protein, which removes Atg8 from PE the GFP-Atg8 signal decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have shown that the cargo receptor Atg19 directly interacts with the Atg5 subunit of the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex and that this interaction is sufficient to direct Atg8 conjugation to the cargo in a reconstituted system. The recruitment of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex requires the AIM motifs of Atg19 and it is likely that these motifs directly bind Atg5 since our modeling analysis and molecular dynamics simulations predicted two binding sites for the C-terminal AIM motif of Atg19 and mutation of these sites abolished Atg19 binding. In addition, the interaction of Atg19 with Atg5 is competitive with the interaction with Atg8, which also directly interacts with the C-terminal AIM motif of Atg19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noda et al., 2008</xref>). Additional regulation of the two mutually exclusive binding events may occur due to phosphorylation as it was shown that Atg19 is phosphorylated in its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfaffenwimmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since Atg19 contains multiple AIM-like sequences, it is possible that both sites in Atg5 contribute to Atg19 binding.

Since the coiled-coil domain of Atg19 was required for the interaction of Atg19 with Atg5 when conjugated to Atg12, we hypothesize that the coiled-coil domain is required to expose binding site two by changing the position of Atg12.</p><p>The interaction of cargo receptors with the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is conserved since we detected an interaction of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Atg34 and human p62, NDP52 and Optineurin cargo receptors with Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 and ATG5, respectively, suggesting that the recruitment of the E3-like ligase for ATG8-family members conjugation to the cargo is a more general property of cargo receptors. Future work will have to elucidate the biochemical details of the interaction of the human cargo receptors with ATG5 and the ATG12~ATG5-ATG16L complex. It is possible that this interaction is at least for p62 in part mediated indirectly by ALFY since it interacts with p62 and ATG5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>). A similar mechanism has been described for <italic>C. elegans</italic> where EPG-7 binds both, p62/SQST-1 and ATG12/LGG-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The results presented in this study suggest the following sequence of events, at least for the Cvt pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). When bound to their respective cargo, cargo receptors cluster and provide a high-avidity binding platform that recruits the autophagy machinery, including the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex. This machinery is able to bring and keep membranes in close proximity to the cargo and to act catalytically by promoting several rounds of Atg8 conjugation. Consistent with the idea of local Atg8 lipidation the E2-like Atg3 enzyme localizes to the site of autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ngu et al., 2015</xref>). The Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is able to directly bind lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>) and thus it may link the cargo to the membrane. However, in vivo additional interactions with PROPPINs/WIPIs will render the system more robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Juris et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18544.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the molecular mechanism of cargo-directed Atg8 lipidation.</title><p>The Atg19 cargo receptor binds the cargo (1) and recruits the E3-like Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex to the cargo via its AIM motifs (2). In the presence of a membrane source, Atg8 is locally conjugated (3) and may eventually outcompete the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex from Atg19 binding. At the same time the AIM motifs of Atg19 may keep the Atg8-coated isolation membrane close to the cargo excluding non-cargo material from incorporation into selective autophagosomes (4).

In conflict with this hypothesis is the finding that the signal of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex at the bead was not decreased upon addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We interpret this result with the previously described interactions of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex with the membrane and lipidated Atg8 on the convex side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with exclusion of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 from the concave side of the isolation membrane, the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex is excluded from the autophagosomal lumen in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mizushima et al., 2003</xref>). On the concave side Atg8 may be subsequently bound with high avidity by the cargo receptors, which could result in close apposition of the membrane and the cargo and thus exclusion of non-cargo material from the autophagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawa-Makarska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wurzer et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, this mechanism would localize the Atg8 conjugation machinery to the highly curved edge of the membrane where the isolation membrane has not yet formed, which may additionally stimulate Atg8 conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nath et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the intricate AIM/LIR-based interplay between the cargo, the cargo receptors, the Atg8 conjugation machinery and Atg8 may serve to confer directionality to the Atg8 lipidation resulting in robust membrane growth exclusively around the cargo. In vivo, this may occur at a permissive site such as the vacuole or the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakatogawa

Initially, the Atg5-Atg16 complex was minimized in vacuum using steepest descent for 2000 steps. Subsequently, the complex was solvated in a rectangular box with 22,250 SPC water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berendsen et al., 1981</xref>). The overall system was electrostatically neutral and therefore no ions were added. The solvent configurations were relaxed with another round of energy minimization where the solute atoms were position-restrained. Initial random velocities were drawn from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 50 K. Position restraints on the solute atoms were applied with an initial force constant of 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>−2</sup>. With each step of equilibration performed at constant volume, the temperature was increased by 50 K, the force constant of the position restraints was reduced by a factor of 10 and the system was simulated for 20 ps. The final equilibration step was simulated for 40 ps at 298 K, without any position restraints. After these equilibration steps, the system was simulated for 1 ns at a constant temperature of 298 K using weak coupling at constant volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>). Two separate temperature baths were used for the solute and solvent and the relaxation time was set to 0.1 ps. All bond lengths were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ryckaert et al., 1977</xref>) with a geometric accuracy of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, which enabled the use of a two fs time step. The center of mass translation motion was removed every 1000 steps. A triple range cut-off scheme was used to calculate the non-bonded interactions and a pair-list was generated every fifth time step. Interactions within 0.8 nm were calculated at every time step, whereas the interactions between 0.8 and 1.4 nm were evaluated only when the pair-list was updated and kept constant at intermediate time steps. The interactions beyond 1.4 nm were approximated by a reaction field contribution, representing a homogeneous medium with a dielectric constant of 61, as appropriate for SPC water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heinz et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Docking</title><p>The molecular dynamics simulation, as described above, was used to obtain different configurations of the Atg5-Atg16 complex that could be used for docking. The initial configuration of Atg5-Atg16, as well as ten snapshots obtained from the simulation (sampled every 100 ps) were used to take the flexibility of the proteins into account during the subsequent docking procedure. The C-terminal peptide TWEEL of Atg19 was modeled with NH and COO<sup>-</sup> termini. The NH terminus was chosen to represent the NH group of the peptide bond that would be present in the complete Atg19. AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>) was used to dock the peptide into the configurations of the Atg5-Atg16 complex. The exhaustiveness was set to 50 and the search space was defined such that the whole complex was searched. The peptide was completely flexible during the docking process, whereas the Atg5-Atg16 complex was kept rigid. For each of the configurations of Atg5-Atg16, the nine best poses of TWEEL were evaluated. The docking results were manually examined in order to discard any poses in which the Thr amino acid of the peptide was completely buried. These poses would not be possible with the complete Atg19 and are therefore not of interest. Three major interaction sites were found to be reoccurring in multiple snapshots of the Atg5-Atg16 complex. One of them involved residues of both Atg5 and Atg16. Since the focus of the present study was identification of the interactions of TWEEL with Atg5, this interaction site was no longer considered. For other binding sites, the hydrogen bonding patterns were examined for all the poses of the docked peptide in all of the configurations of Atg5-Atg16. Generally, several configurations of the peptide were found in each of the binding sites, but here we focused on the residues that were most prone to be involved in salt bridges or hydrogen bonds to the TWEEL peptide. The first binding site, which was also found in the initial configuration of the Atg5-Atg16 complex, was characterized by persistent salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between the glutamic acids of the peptide with K57 and K137. In the second binding site, the residues N84 and R208 were the ones that were most often involved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with TWEEL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Superposition of protein structures</title><p>The Atg8 (PDB: 2ZPN, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noda et al., 2008</xref>) and Atg5 (PDB: 2DYO, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsushita et al., 2007</xref>) structures were superposed by secondary-structure matching (SSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>) using the Coot software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The Atg8 molecule in complex with Atg19 AIM motif was superposed onto the two ubiquitin-like Atg5 bundles separately. The resulting shift of Atg19 AIM motif was depicted omitting the original Atg8 structure for clarity, indicating putative AIM binding pockets on Atg5.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are supported by ERC grants (No. 260304, No. 646653 to SM and No. 279408 to Bojan Zagrovic), by Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) grants (No. P25546-B20 to SM; No. P 25522-B20 and P 28113-B28 to CK; No. T724-B20 to JSM), by a Vienna Research Groups for Young Investigators grant from the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF, VRG10-791 001 to CK) and by the EMBO Young Investigator Program to SM and CK.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanism of cargo-directed Atg8 conjugation during selective autophagy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the authors present a mechanistic study describing cargo-stimulated Atg8 lipidation via Atg5/12/16 in biochemical reconstitution studies, providing a novel insight into the mechanism of autophagosome formation during selective autophagy. However, additional work is required to strengthen the manuscript to meet the standards for <italic>eLife</italic>. There was a general sense that much more clarity and caution needs to be applied to the description of experiments, results and, most importantly, conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Bulk autophagy (starvation-induced non-selective autophagy) should be examined in the Atg5 mutant cells.</p><p>2) The binding assays with the Atg5 mutants are largely in-vitro with purified components on beads. The interactions of these mutants in-vivo should be tested either by co-IP or perhaps some other method like proximity labeling, given that the effects on prApe1 processing are modest at best.</p><p>3) Additional assays or replicates are necessary to demonstrate that the mapped residues in Atg5 (N84E, K57/N84E) are the key mediators of the Atg5-Atg19 interaction. Reviewers have a concern that reduced prApe1 processing in the Atg5 mutant strains presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> could be attributed to reduced loading of the gel (with quite large error across the replicate experiments) and also the in vitro lipidation assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows a minimal defect in Atg8 lipidation in the Atg5 double mutant.</p><p>4) Several other adaptors such as p62 should be examined to investigate their interactions with Atg5-12-16 to demonstrate that the mechanism is not limited to yeast and has a broad impact.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanism of cargo-directed Atg8 conjugation during selective autophagy&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In order to test the effect of the K57E,N84E mutations in Atg5 on starvation-induced bulk autophagy we conducted the GFP-Atg8 cleavage assay. The three replicates performed by us show no impairment of bulk autophagy in cells expressing the K57E,N84E mutant. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref> for a representative blot.</p><p>We also performed Pho8Δ60 activity assays in order to test the effect of the K57E, N84E and K57E, N84E mutations on bulk autophagy. The experiments performed show no difference in activity of the Pho8Δ60 enzyme between wild type Atg5 and the mutants. Please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J, K</xref> for quantifications. Thus, our data strongly suggest that the K57E, N84E mutant does not affect bulk autophagy.</p><p><italic>2) The binding assays with the Atg5 mutants are largely in-vitro with purified components on beads. The interactions of these mutants in-vivo should be tested either by co-IP or perhaps some other method like proximity labeling, given that the effects on prApe1 processing are modest at best.</italic> </p><p>We have conducted co-IP experiments with Atg5 K57E, N84E and a representative blot of such an experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. In particular, we found that the K57E,N84E mutation resulted in a robust decrease in the interaction with Atg19. In order to corroborate this result, we went a step further and investigated the Atg5 – Atg19 interaction in context of the Atg16 E102A mutation. This mutation is based on a previous finding by Juris et al., 2015, EMBOJ (PMID: 25691244) reporting that Atg21 recruits Atg16 to the PAS during the Cvt pathway and that the E102A mutation in Atg16 impairs the Atg16 – Atg21 interaction. We reasoned that this interaction may indirectly stabilize the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 – Atg19 complex. Indeed, we found an even further decrease of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 – Atg19 interaction in context of the Atg16 E102A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Additional assays or replicates are necessary to demonstrate that the mapped residues in Atg5 (N84E, K57/N84E) are the key mediators of the Atg5-Atg19 interaction. Reviewers have a concern that reduced prApe1 processing in the Atg5 mutant strains presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> could be attributed to reduced loading of the gel (with quite large error across the replicate experiments) and also the</italic> in vitro <italic>lipidation assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> shows a minimal defect in Atg8 lipidation in the Atg5 double mutant.</italic> </p><p>We have replaced the blot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> with a technically better blot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also conducted additional prApe1 processing assays that confirm the impairment of prApe1 processing by the Atg5 K57E, N84E mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This included the analysis of the prApe1 transport in context of the Atg16 D101A, E102E mutation, which was reported to reduce the recruitment of Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 by Atg21 to the PAS (please see Juris et al., 2015, EMBOJ (PMID: 25691244) and our reply to your comment number 2).</p><p>Moreover, we have conducted additional in vitro lipidation assays and quantified them. The graph of this quantification has been inserted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and it shows that the Atg5 mutants do not display significant defects in promoting Atg8~PE conjugation. A more representative gel of the in vitro conjugation assay has been inserted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> in place of the previous one (right panel).</p><p><italic>4) Several other adaptors such as p62 should be examined to investigate their interactions with Atg5-12-16 to demonstrate that the mechanism is not limited to yeast and has a broad impact.</italic> </p><p>In our previous version we could already demonstrate that the human ATG5 coprecipitates p62. Upon request of the reviewers we have now extended this analysis and demonstrate that also the Optineurin and NDP52 cargo receptors co-precipitate with ATG5 (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-H</xref>). Thus the interaction of cargo receptors with components of the Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 appears to be a more general phenomenon. At this point we do not know if this interaction is direct and in order to thoroughly investigate this interaction we would have to have the recombinant human Atg12~Atg5-Atg16 complex in our hands, which is currently not the case.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors should describe how the E102A mutation affects the function of Atg16.
