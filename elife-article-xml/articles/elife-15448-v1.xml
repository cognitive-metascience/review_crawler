It is well known that stressful experiences increase addiction vulnerability. However, it is not clear how repeated stress promotes learning of cue-drug associations, as repeated stress generally impairs learning and memory processes unrelated to stressful experiences. Here, we show that repeated social defeat stress in rats causes persistent enhancement of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Protein kinase A-dependent increase in the potency of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling underlies LTP facilitation. Notably, defeated rats display enhanced learning of contextual cues paired with cocaine experience assessed using a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Enhancement of LTP in the VTA and cocaine CPP in behaving rats both require glucocorticoid receptor activation during defeat episodes. These findings suggest that enhanced glutamatergic plasticity in the VTA may contribute, at least partially, to increased addiction vulnerability following repeated stressful experiences.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15448.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15448.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15448.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Daily stress increases the likelihood that people who take drugs will become addicted. A very early step in the development of addiction is learning that certain people, places, or paraphernalia are associated with obtaining drugs. These ‘cues’ – drug dealers, bars, cigarette advertisements, etc. – become powerful motivators to seek out drugs and can trigger relapse in recovering addicts. It is thought that learning happens when synapses (the connections between neurons in the brain) that relay information about particular cues become stronger. However, it is not clear how stress promotes the learning of cue-drug associations.</p><p>Stelly et al. investigated whether repeated episodes of stress make it easier to strengthen synapses on dopamine neurons, which are involved in processing rewards and addiction. For the experiments, rats were repeatedly exposed to a stressful situation – an encounter with an unfamiliar aggressive rat – every day for five days. Stelly et al. found that these stressed rats formed stronger associations between the drug cocaine and the place where they were given the drug (the cue). Furthermore, a mechanism that strengthens synapses was more sensitive in the stressed rats than in unstressed rats. These changes persisted for 10-30 days after the stressful situation, suggesting that stress might begin a period of time during which the individual is more vulnerable to addiction.</p><p>The experiments also show that a hormone called corticosterone – which is released during stressful experiences – is necessary for stress to trigger the changes in the synapses and behavior of the rats. However, corticosterone must work with other factors because giving this hormone to unstressed rats was not sufficient to trigger the changes seen in the stressed rats. Future experiments will investigate what these other stress factors are and how they work together with corticosterone.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15448.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15448.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA007471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Jason B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA015687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morikawa</surname><given-names>Hitoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA015521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morikawa</surname><given-names>Hitoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enhanced glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons may contribute to repeatedly stressed rats becoming more vulnerable to addiction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans with a history of stressful or traumatic experiences are more prone to develop substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sinha, 2008</xref>). Adverse experience recruits the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response, culminating in release of glucocorticoids that enables the body to cope with insults to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munck et al., 1984</xref>). In rodent models, repeated activation of the stress response typically disrupts learning and cognition [e.g., spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conrad et al., 1996</xref>), working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mizoguchi et al., 2000</xref>), and cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liston et al., 2006</xref>)]. In contrast to these deficits, prior stress enhances the learning of Pavlovian cue-outcome associations driven by rewarding stimuli, assessed with conditioned place preference (CPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kreibich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chuang et al., 2011</xref>), or aversive/stressful stimuli, assessed with fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conrad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sandi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suvrathan et al., 2014</xref>). These effects of stress may have arisen from evolutionary pressure to rapidly acquire information predicting food, shelter, and predator threat during periods of duress. Augmented Pavlovian reward learning mechanisms in stressed individuals may also heighten susceptibility to addiction, as acquisition of cue-drug associations is a crucial early step in drug use, and powerful, enduring memories of drug-associated cues trigger craving and relapse as recreational use progresses to addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is not clear how repeated stressful experience promotes the learning of cue-drug/reward associations, as repeated stress is generally detrimental to synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory unrelated to stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim and Diamond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chattarji et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mesolimbic dopamine system originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is critical for reward processing. VTA dopamine neurons tonically fire action potentials (APs) at 1–5 Hz, while responding to unexpected rewards with phasic burst firing (2–10 APs at 10–50 Hz). These dopamine neuron responses are hypothesized to drive the learning of Pavlovian cue-reward associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Darvas et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, over the course of repeated cue-reward pairing, dopamine neurons acquire a conditioned burst response to reward-predictive cues, which is thought to encode the positive motivational valence of those cues and to invigorate reward-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berridge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Glutamatergic inputs activating NMDA receptors (NMDARs) drive the transition from tonic firing to bursting in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Overton and Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zweifel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011</xref>); therefore, potentiation of cue-driven NMDAR inputs may contribute to the acquisition of conditioned bursting. Indeed, NMDAR-mediated transmission undergoes long-term potentiation (LTP) when cue-like glutamatergic input stimulation is repeatedly paired with reward-like bursting in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harnett et al., 2009</xref>). LTP induction requires amplification of burst-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by preceding activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs; more specifically mGluR1) coupled to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>). Here, IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) detect the coincidence of IP<sub>3</sub> generated by glutamatergic input activating mGluRs and burst-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. IP<sub>3</sub> enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs by promoting access to the stimulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites, thereby promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor and Laude, 2002</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that repeated social defeat stress (1) enhances NMDAR LTP in the VTA via an increase in IP<sub>3</sub> sensitivity of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and (2) promotes acquisition of cocaine CPP in behaving rats, and both of these effects require glucocorticoid action during defeat stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Repeated social stress increases mGluR-dependent facilitation of burst-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title><p>NMDAR LTP induction requires mGluR/IP<sub>3</sub>-induced facilitation of burst-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harnett et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we first examined the effect of the group I mGluR agonist DHPG (1 µM; 5-min perfusion) on burst-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, assessed by the size of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated SK currents (termed burst I<sub>K(Ca)</sub>) in control and stressed animals.

It is of note that dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, in contrast to VTA neurons recorded in the present study, display significant PKA-dependent regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and NMDAR LTP induction in control rats, which cannot be further enhanced by repeated drug exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harnett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that repeated social defeat (10 days) in mice leads to long-lasting (&gt;4 weeks) alterations in gene expression and behavior (e.g., reduced social contact), with little recovery unless treated with antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsankova et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, mGluR/IP<sub>3</sub> action on burst-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals remained elevated for 10–30 days following the 5-day defeat paradigm in rats, although displaying gradual decline during the 30-day stress-free period. It remains to be determined how this recovery is affected by different stress paradigms (e.g., duration or type/severity) and treatments following stress experience.</p><p>Mouse studies have also shown that individual animals display different susceptibility to repeated social defeat when assessed by the degree of social avoidance, which correlates with biochemical and physiological changes in the mesolimbic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, these studies observed hyperactivity of VTA dopamine neurons, assessed in vivo or ex vivo, associated with an increase in I<sub>h</sub>, after 10-day defeat in susceptible mice. However, these parameters were not affected by 5-day social defeat in the current study conducted in rats.</p><p>How could repeated stress lead to increased PKA activity regulating IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in the VTA? Stress, including social defeat, promotes bursting in a subpopulation of VTA dopamine neurons, causing increased dopamine transients in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anstrom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>). Bursting also releases dopamine locally from the soma and dendrites, activating somatodendritic D2 autoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>). Chronic stimulation of G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors, such as D2 receptors, is known to upregulate the cAMP-PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>), which may contribute to stress-induced IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization. Interestingly, intra-VTA blockade of NMDARs during each social defeat episode, which would suppress dopamine neuron bursting, has been shown to prevent repeated stress-induced increases in cocaine self-administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Covington et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>GR signaling during defeat sessions is necessary for the enhancement of IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitivity. Stress-induced activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system is regulated by glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marinelli and Piazza, 2002</xref>). Recent evidence implicates GRs expressed in projection areas, not in the VTA, in long-term glucocorticoid regulation of dopamine neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambroggi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Butts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barik et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, glucocorticoids can also enhance synthesis of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a major stress-related neuropeptide, and activation of CRF neurons in brain areas providing major CRF inputs to the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makino et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodaros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolber et al., 2008</xref>). GR blockade may therefore attenuate CRF-induced excitation of dopamine neurons during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalivas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ungless et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wanat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holly et al., 2015</xref>). We found that GR activation alone is not sufficient for IP<sub>3</sub>R sensitization. Thus, the potential GR mechanisms described above may act to amplify glutamatergic input-driven bursting activity during stress episodes, likely further enhanced by stress-induced activation of noradrenergic inputs stimulating dopamine neurons via α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grenhoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paladini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morilak et al., 2005</xref>), thereby enabling large local dopamine release in the VTA. In this regard, it is interesting that repeated cocaine treatment was capable of causing similar enhancement of mGluR/IP<sub>3</sub> action in a GR-independent manner.

Blockade of the critical components regulating NMDAR LTP induction (i.e., NMDARs, group I mGluRs, PKA, or LTCCs) in the VTA during conditioning has been shown to suppress CPP acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harnett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whitaker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Degoulet et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, systemic GR blockade during defeat episodes prevented both the enhancement of the LTP induction mechanism and that of cocaine CPP acquisition, consistent with the potential role of NMDAR plasticity in this form of Pavlovian learning. However, enhanced CPP acquisition observed in defeated rats may well be caused by an increase in the primary rewarding action of cocaine itself. The relative contribution of these two possibilities, i.e., enhanced learning mechanism vs. enhanced cocaine reward, remains to be determined.</p><p>It is well known that repeated stress impairs LTP of AMPAR-mediated transmission in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foy et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shors et al., 1989</xref>), an effect that requires GR activation during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). LTP is similarly impaired in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldwater et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, repeated stress leads to enhancement of AMPAR LTP in the lateral amygdala, which underlies Pavlovian fear conditioning driven by stressful/aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodriguez Manzanares et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suvrathan et al., 2014</xref>). Alterations in the function/expression of NMDARs are implicated in these forms of metaplasticity, as NMDARs play a key role in AMPAR LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim and Diamond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chattarji et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we described a distinct form of stress-induced metaplasticity in the VTA, i.e., enhancement of mGluR/IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent NMDAR LTP, which may, at least in part, contribute to the enhanced drug reward-based Pavlovian learning. This may illuminate a key mechanism by which stressful experience increases vulnerability to addiction, a chronic relapsing disorder perpetuated by memories of drug-associated stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Houston, Texas) were housed in groups of 2–3 on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum.

Residents (used for ~8–10 months) were screened for aggression (biting or pinning within 1 min) by introducing a male intruder to the home cage. Intruders and controls were young males (4–5 weeks old at the beginning) housed in groups of 2–3. For defeat sessions, residents and intruders were taken to a darkened procedure room at the end of the dark cycle. Intruders were introduced to residents’ home cages after removing females. Following 5 min of direct contact, a perforated Plexiglass barrier was inserted for 25 min to allow sensory contact. For repeated defeat, intruders underwent one session daily with a novel resident. Handled controls were taken to a darkened procedure room and placed in novel cages for 30 min. Unhandled controls remained undisturbed in the colony.

Putative dopamine neurons in the lateral VTA were identified by spontaneous firing of broad APs (&gt;1.2 ms) at 1–5 Hz in cell-attached configuration and large I<sub>h</sub> currents (&gt;200 pA; evoked by a 1.5 s hyperpolarizing step of 50 mV) in whole-cell configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margolis et al., 2008</xref>).

For bursts, 5 APs were evoked at 20 Hz. The time integral of the outward tail current, termed I<sub>K(Ca)</sub> (calculated after removing the 20 ms window following each depolarizing pulse; expressed in pC), was used as a readout of AP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, as it is eliminated by TTX and also by apamin, a blocker of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated SK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cui et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flash photolysis</title><p>Cells were loaded with caged IP<sub>3</sub> (50–400 µM; generous gift from Dr. Kamran Khodakhah) through the recording pipette. A UV flash (~1 ms) was applied with a xenon arc lamp driven by a photolysis system (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK). The UV flash was focused through a 60× objective onto a ~350 μm area surrounding the recorded neuron. Photolysis of caged compounds is proportional to the UV flash intensity; therefore, the concentration of IP<sub>3</sub> was defined as the product of caged IP<sub>3</sub> concentration in the pipette (µM) and flash intensity (µJ) measured at the focal plane of the objective (expressed in µM·µJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>NMDAR LTP experiments</title><p>Synaptic stimuli were delivered with a bipolar tungsten electrode placed ~50–100 μm rostral to the recorded neuron. To isolate NMDAR EPSCs, recordings were performed in DNQX (10 µM), picrotoxin (100 µM), CGP54626 (50 nM), and sulpiride (100 nM) to block AMPA/kainate, GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>B</sub>, and D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors, and in glycine (20 µM) and low Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM) to enhance NMDAR activation. NMDAR EPSCs were monitored every 20 s. The LTP induction protocol consisted of photolytic application of IP<sub>3</sub> (250 µM·µJ) 50 ms prior to the simultaneous delivery of synaptic stimulation (20 stimuli at 50 Hz) and a burst (5 APs at 20 Hz), repeated 10 times every 20 s. LTP magnitude was determined by comparing the average EPSC amplitude 30 min post-induction with the average EPSC amplitude pre-induction (each from a 5 min window).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Place conditioning</title><p>A CPP box (Med Associates, St. Albans, Vermont) consisting of two distinct compartments separated by a small middle chamber was used for conditioning. One compartment had a mesh floor with white walls, while the other had a grid floor with black walls. A discrete cue (painted ceramic weight) was placed in the rear corner of each compartment (black one in the white wall side, white one in the black wall side; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) for further differentiation. One day after undergoing repeated stress or control procedures, rats were pretested for initial side preference by exploring the entire CPP box for 15 min. The percentage of time spent in each compartment was determined after excluding the time spent in the middle chamber. Rats with initial side preference &gt;60% were excluded. Starting the next day, rats were subjected to 1-day or 3-day conditioning, in which they were given a saline injection in the morning and confined to one compartment, then in the afternoon given cocaine (5 mg/kg) and confined to the other compartment (10 min each). Compartment assignment was counterbalanced such that animals had, on average, ~50% initial preference for the cocaine-paired side. A 15 min posttest was performed 1 day after the last conditioning session. The CPP score was determined by subtracting the preference for the cocaine-paired side during pretest from that during posttest. The experimenter performing CPP experiments was blind to animal treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Naoshige Uchida, and a Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to share his identity: Jochen Roeper.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study found that repeated social defeat stress enhances long-term potentiation of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The authors also found that protein kinase A-dependent sensitization of IP3-mediated calcium release plays a key role in this process, and that this plasticity is triggered by stress-related glucocortcoids (GR). The authors also present evidence indicating that cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) conditioning is enhanced after repeated social defeat stress. The referees found this study of significance and timely, addressing important questions relevant to the mechanism underlying drug addiction. The manuscript is well written and the data are generally sound. However, there are two major issues upon which we would like to see your response.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was pointed out that the CPP experiment is difficult to interpret without further control data. Specifically, the current protocol (1 day conditioning with 5mg/kg cocaine) does not induce CPP robustly in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). This may be because the dose of cocaine used, together with the other experimental conditions, is not rewarding at all, or because conditioning was not enough. Depending on these possibilities, the interpretation of the result can be very different. If the authors claim that social defeat stress enhanced learning, the authors should show that this dose of cocaine is rewarding, and extended conditioning actually causes CPP in control mice. Thus, we would like to see the data indicating that positive CPP can be observed in control animals with the same dose of cocaine.</p><p>2) The authors interpret the result as &quot;enhanced learning of associated cue valence&quot;, however, it is possible that the increased CPP is due to an enhanced rewarding effect of cocaine. Please interpret the results more carefully so that it becomes clearer that the latter interpretation is plausible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper is well written and effectively discusses a series a thoughtful experiments surrounding the authors' central question. Namely, that GR receptors inDA neurons of the VTA shape changes in synaptic strength following an ethologically relevant model of stress and this is accompanied by enhanced place conditioning for cocaine. However, there are major issues that should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Perhaps the most serious issue, in my opinion, is the interpretation of the CPP data. Here the authors observe a CPP in stressed rats after a single conditioning trial, however, a similar CPP is not developed in control animals.</p><p>1) Without a positive control (i.e. an observed CPP in controls), these data are not interpretable. I understand the journal's mandate to not require additional experiments, but this is one of those cases where this is critical. Are CPPs generally observed after a single conditioning session with a 5mg/kg IP dose? If not, the authors should extend the conditioning protocol until a CPP can be observed in all animals.</p><p>2) The authors interpret CPP as &quot;enhanced learning of associated cue valence&quot;, however, it could very well also be just enhanced reward of cocaine. CPP technically measures reward, so it is unclear why the authors did not acknowledge the possibility (in my opinion, strong likelihood) that social defeat stress actually enhances cocaine reward rather than Pavlovian associations. Please revise thoroughly to account for this alternative possibility.</p><p>3) The authors overstate the involvement of dopamine in learning – this is a well-supported theory, but certainly only one of several. In the Introduction the authors state, &quot;…dopamine neuron responses drive the learning of Pavlovian cue-reward associations&quot;, this should be adjusted to reflect that this is a theory, perhaps, &quot; dopamine neuron responses are hypothesized to drive the learning…&quot;.</p><p>4) The involvement of LTP in the CPP behavioral data is too speculative, for example in the first paragraph of the subsection “Repeated Social Stress Promotes Learning of Cocaine-Associated Cues in a GR-Dependent Manner”; please revise. Specifically, there is not a single piece of empirical evidence that the observed LTP &quot;promotes&quot; the Pavlovian associations that give to rise to CPP. This should be thoroughly re-written, to reflect the findings as they actually are. Namely, that LTP enhancement accompanies social defeat stress (or it could in fact be an epiphenomenon of the defeat). To show unambiguously that it &quot;promotes&quot; the behavioral effects observed, would require a whole new set of experiments, which fall outside of the scope of this study.</p><p>5) Animal/group numbers were poorly described. Please clarify these as well as the degrees of freedom for all experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an excellent study which has discovered that chronic social defeat stress in rats leads to a persistent enhancement of in vitro NMDA-LTP in DA VTA neurons, without changing intrinsic firing properties. The Morikawa lab has previously discovered and carefully characterized this type of plasticity. Here, they also show that PKA-dependent sensitization of IP3-mediated calcium release is a key component of the underlying signalling process and that this plasticity is triggered by stress-related glucocortcoids (GR). Importantly, they give also some evidence that the GR-dependent enhanced NMDA-LTP might be relevant for potentiating cocaine-induced condition place-preference learning. The behavioral data do however not prove that NMDA-LTP itself in causal for the learning improvement, but it a likely candidate.</p><p>While the Discussion covers well the changes in signaling processes induced by stress that might converge on enhanced NMDA-LTP, it avoids a very important issue regarding the different outcome of chronic social defeat stress (resilient and non-resilient) and the correlative and even causal link to changes in DA VTA neuronal firing. In contrast, this study sees no changes in DA VTA firing, which might imply that these were highly resilient rats. It would be important to provide additional data on the post-stress behaviors of the rats used, e.g. reduced social approach and/or anhedonia that have been associated with altered in vivo and vitro firing pattern of DA VTA – enhanced mean frequencies and increased bursting. Interestingly, the molecular mechanism identified here would be a very good candidate for inducing these activity pattern in DA VTA neurons of non-resilient post-defeat animals. In addition to providing this information, the authors should more actively engage with this prominent literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In general, this is an interesting manuscript. The data is sound, and the central message is timely and of significance.</p><p>1) If recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents is enhanced after stress, then there may be a change in firing pattern and waveform (i.e. AHP) of glutamate-evoked spiking of DA neurons, but not tonic as observed. Did the authors consider examining this measure?</p><p>2) Is the enhancement of IP3 sensitivity after stress similar for all Gq-coupled GPCRs? Or is only mGluR1 function increased due to the IP3 enhancement? This may have important implications for understanding functional consequences.</p><p>3) An additional experiment with a more direct link between the cocaine CPP and changes in IP3 signaling in VTA DA neurons after stress would help strengthen the study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Repeated social defeat stress enhances synaptic plasticity that drives learning of drug-associated cue valence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, it should be noted that socially defeated rats displayed no significant increases in the overall activity level during the cocaine conditioning sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the &quot;locomotor stimulating&quot; action of cocaine was not altered by repeated defeat experience.&quot;</p><p>This statement is very misleading. Are the authors suggesting that because stressed mice did not show enhanced cocaine locomotor activity compared to control mice, that they likely did not have enhanced cocaine reward? If in fact this is what the authors are trying to convey, then I would surmise that they are equating locomotor activation with reward, which has repeatedly been shown not to be the case (for example, see PMID: 22197517).</p><p>As such, the interpretation of the data continues to the main problem of the paper. Place conditioning is a test of reward and/or aversion and not a test that provides a clear examination of drug-associated cues without more specific controls in place. Perhaps if the authors had administered drug in the CPP chamber or, better yet, had the animals self-administer the drug in the CPP chamber then this interpretation would be more acceptable. As is, the question they are answering is one of subjective cocaine experience and not of learning cues associated with drug taking.</p><p>In fact, the citations the authors employ to justify their use of CPP clearly state that CPP is a measure of reward: &quot;…Pavlovian cue-outcome associations driven by rewarding stimuli, assessed with conditioned place preference (CPP) (Kreibich et al., 2009; Burke et al., 2011; Chuang et al., 2011)…&quot;.</p><p>Kreibich AS, Briand L, Cleck JN, Ecke L, Rice KC, Blendy JA (2009) Stress-induced potentiation of cocaine reward: a role for CRF R1 and CREB.
