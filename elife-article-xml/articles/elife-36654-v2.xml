Existing cell-based, protein-protein interaction assays, such as yeast two-hybrid or protein-fragment complementation, do not provide information about the site of interaction or the proportion of free versus bound species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fields and Sternglanz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michnick et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we introduce a methodology called VivosX (<italic>in <bold>vivo</bold></italic> di<bold>s</bold>ulfide <bold>cross</bold>linking) which is a simple, quantifiable assay for reporting site-specific interactions that occur inside the nucleus or the cytosol. VivosX uses structural information to guide the placement of a pair of cysteine probes on the opposite sides of a contact site such that they fall within disulfide crosslinking distance when the two proteins interact. The disulfide adducts do not accumulate naturally due to the reducing environment of the nucleus and cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dardalhon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Østergaard et al., 2004</xref>), but will do so under oxidizing conditions. Interactions captured by disulfide crosslinking, along with any non-interacting, uncrosslinked species, are determined by non-reducing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. VivosX can be applied to detect the oligomerization status of nuclear and cytosolic factors based on the proportion of crosslinked and uncrosslinked species, providing a simple strategy to study, for example, how transcription factors or signaling molecules dimerize in response to cellular cues. As a proof of concept, VivosX was used to detect interactions between specific histone proteins within the nucleosomes of yeast and human cells.</p><p>The canonical view of the nucleosome structure, in which a ~150 basepair DNA wraps around an octameric histone core with two copies of each H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luger et al., 1997</xref>), represents only one of the many facets of the basic packaging unit of chromatin in a living cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luger et al., 2012</xref>). Nucleosomes in the vicinity of promoters, for example, are subjected to a variety of chromatin remodeling activities that alter not only nucleosome conformation, but also histone core composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>). When a chromatin remodeler repositions a nucleosome to facilitate transcription factor binding, it transiently stretches out a segment of the nucleosomal DNA at one region, makes a bulge at another, and distorts the histone core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deindl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). To promote transcription of a gene, the nucleosome immediately downstream of an RNA polymerase II promoter is often installed with one or two copies of the variant histone H2A.Z in place of H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). To understand transcriptional control in eukaryotes, and perhaps even in archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>), it is important to decipher how histone movements are choreographed at different stages of transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based techniques have been instrumental in uncovering the dynamic interactions of a specific type or post-translationally modified histone with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilmour and Lis, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Neill and Turner, 1995</xref>). It remains technically challenging to distinguish nucleosomes containing different combinations of histones (e.g. homotypic H2A.Z/H2A.Z versus heterotypic H2A/H2A.Z nucleosomes). This obstacle motivated us to develop the VivosX technique to differentiate nucleosomes with distinct histone combinatorial states by capturing site-specific histone-histone interactions <italic>in situ</italic>. Importantly, this technique is not limited to studying histones, but can be used to examine many protein complexes within cells for which structural information is available.</p><p>Disulfide crosslinking of strategically positioned cysteines on reconstituted nucleosomes or endogenously purified histone substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> has generated important structural and molecular insights. For example, crosslinking of cysteine probes substituted at the basic N-terminal tail of H4 and the acidic patch of H2A demonstrated the direct interaction between the histone tail and the histone core of neighboring nucleosomes during chromatin fiber compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dorigo et al., 2004</xref>). Disulfide crosslinking between two H3 molecules was used to demonstrate the tetrameric nature of the H3-H4 complex when bound by the histone chaperone Nap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2011</xref>). A disulfide crosslinking approach that restricts conformational flexibility of the histone fold domain of H3 and H4 revealed that histone fold distortion is a prerequisite of remodeler-catalyzed histone octamer sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, disulfide crosslinking has been applied to stabilize the conformation of nucleosomes to facilitate structural analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frouws et al., 2018</xref>). The use of disulfide crosslinking to probe protein-protein interactions has also been fruitful for the studies of the conformational dynamics of transmembrane proteins, including chemoreceptors and rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falke and Koshland, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrens et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>While disulfide crosslinking has been used successfully <italic>in vitro</italic>, this approach has not been well developed as a general strategy for capturing protein-protein interactions in cells. One technical challenge is that the reducing environment inside the cytoplasm and nucleus inhibits disulfide accumulation even when cysteine pairs are within crosslinking distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dardalhon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Østergaard et al., 2004</xref>). Although cysteine pairs can be activated to form disulfide linkages in the presence of a thiol-reactive oxidant, such reactions are dependent on the accessibility of the thiol groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1987</xref>). Thus, the choice of cysteine probe substitutions must be guided not only by structural information but also conformational dynamics.</p><p>Our group studies the molecular mechanisms that regulate the turnover of histone H2A.Z at promoters, a chromatin remodeling activity that is linked to a variety of chromosomal functions (such as transcriptional activation, chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and transcriptional anti-silencing), likely resulting from a general function in facilitating chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhillon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raisner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rangasamy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). At promoters of yeast and human cells, H2A.Z is inserted into +1 nucleosomes, which are located immediately downstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barski et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In human cells, H2A.Z is also associated with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rangasamy et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike H2A.Z found in euchromatin, heterochromatic H2A.Z is generally monoubiquitylated at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>). What functional role the ubiquitin moiety has on H2A.Z remains unclear. SWR, a multi-subunit chromatin remodeler, catalyzes H2A.Z deposition via a histone exchange mechanism driven by ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>). SWR removes an H2A-H2B dimer and concomitantly inserts H2A.Z-H2B onto each face of the nucleosome, thereby converting the canonical H2A/H2A (AA) nucleosome to the heterotypic H2A/H2A.Z (AZ) nucleosomal intermediate before forming the homotypic H2A.Z/H2A.Z (ZZ) nucleosomal product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luk et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are preferentially disassembled via a process that is dependent on the preinitiation complex (PIC), although it is unclear whether the ZZ or the AZ species are equally targeted for disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Within an AA, AZ or ZZ nucleosome, the two L1 loop regions of the histone fold domains of the opposing H2A and/or H2A.Z molecules come into contact with each other at an interface that passes through the nucleosomal dyad, but not when the histones are outside of the nucleosomal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suto et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the L1-L1’ (prime represents the symmetrical nucleosomal counterpart) interface is ideal for the placement of cysteine probes for <italic>in vivo</italic> disulfide crosslinking. The assumption is that only when histones are inserted into nucleosomes will the cysteine pairs be close enough to form disulfide bonds, allowing crosslinking efficiency to act as a metric for the global occupancy of H2A and H2A.Z (these histones naturally lack cysteine).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36654.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cysteine substitution at multiple positions of the L1 region of H2A.Z supports Z-to-Z crosslinking in yeast cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The L1-L1’ interface of the ZZ nucleosome (PDB: 1F66) is highlighted by a yellow box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suto et al., 2000</xref>).

The precipitated histones were extracted for 60 min using a buffer called TUNES, which contains Tris base, urea, NaCl, EDTA, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and glycerol. To ensure that the disulfide linkages formed are representative of the protein-protein interactions captured <italic>in vivo</italic>, N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) was added to block any free thiol groups from crosslinking after cell lysis. Proteins were resolved by non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting.

The disulfide crosslinking efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of ZxZ over total H2A.Z immunoblotting signals, does not correlate particularly well with Cα-Cα’ proximity, suggesting that the L1-L1’ interface is dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This difference was likely due to atmospheric oxidation of the dithiols during the cell lysis, chromatin preparation and/or MNase digestion steps. Such background oxidation was minimized in the whole cell extracts as cells were fixed by TCA and extraction was performed in the presence of the thiol blocker NEM. TCA and NEM were added to the native nucleosomes only after MNase digestion. Note also that there is an extra band between the 37 and 50 kD markers in the anti-H2A blot of native nucleosomes.

At +1 nucleosomes, for instance, the cycling of the AA, AZ and ZZ compositional states, is somehow linked to histone octamer eviction and efficient transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>). VivosX revealed for the first time that the ZZ nucleosomes are preferentially disassembled by the transcription machinery. Traditionally to address such a question, biochemical fractionation of AZ and ZZ nucleosomes (before and after a block in PIC assembly) would be necessary. This approach involves technically non-trivial techniques such as sequential immunoprecipitation and relies on antibodies that may be limiting in quantity or expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, VivosX uses immunoblots of whole cell extracts, underscoring the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the VivosX approach. The feasibility of extending VivosX to mutant screens for genes required for H2A.Z deposition and eviction makes the VivosX technique powerful.</p><p>One potential caveat of VivosX is the ‘observer effect’, where the crosslinking of two histones could potentially perturb <italic>in vivo</italic> chromatin dynamics. For example, Z-to-Z crosslinking might interfere with ZZ nucleosome disassembly. As such, VivosX may overestimate the <italic>in vivo</italic> level of ZZ nucleosomes. Alternatively but not exclusively, Z-to-A and A-to-A crosslinking could interfere with the H2A.Z deposition function of SWR as the remodeler replaces each of the two nucleosomal A-B dimers with Z-B dimers one at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, in the experiment where VivosX was used to predict changes in H2A.Z occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), H2A.Z eviction or deposition was blocked for at least 1 hr (a duration exceeding the turnover half-life of H2A.Z at a typical promoter) before the induction of crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this precaution and the fact that H2A.Z VivosX correctly reported the change in H2A.Z occupancy, we cannot rule out that the L1-L1’ disulfide crosslinking is indirectly interfering with H2A.Z deposition and eviction.</p><p>A second potential caveat was that 4-DPS, the oxidizing agent used in VivosX, could elicit an oxidative stress response as has been observed for other oxidizing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>). The transcriptional perturbation resulting from the oxidative stress could contribute to a change in H2A.Z occupancy and thus crosslinking efficiency. However, this does not appear to be the case. In a control experiment, sodium azide was added in conjunction with 4-DPS during the crosslinking step to inhibit ATP-dependent processes, such as transcription and replication. Similar levels of the ZxZ adducts were observed in the presence or absence of azide after 4-DPS treatment, suggesting that bulk Z-to-Z crosslinking is not dramatically affected by the oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), although rearrangement of the genomic ZZ nucleosome occupancy cannot be ruled out. Thus, interpretation of VivosX data must take the oxidative response caveat and the observer effect into consideration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications on nucleosomal dynamics</title><p>The average distance between the two alpha carbon atoms (Cα-Cα’) of a disulfide bond is 5.6 Å with a range of 4.3 Å – 6.5 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). It was therefore surprising that multiple positions along the L1 region of H2A and H2A.Z supported robust intra-nucleosomal crosslinking given that some of these positions have Cα-Cα’ distances &gt; 7 Å in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, some of the crosslinkable L1 side chains (e.g. Y40 and A41 of H2A) are largely inaccessible to solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2001</xref>). Given that the thiol-disulfide interchange between cysteine thiols and 4-DPS involves the S<sub>N</sub>2 nucleophilic substitution mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), the L1 loop must adopt an alternative conformation from that observed in the crystal structure to allow the inaccessible cysteine thiolate to attack the disulfide of 4-DPS. We speculate that the nucleosomal L1-L1’ interface between the two H2A.Z and/or H2A is dynamic. It has been proposed that the two halves of the nucleosome could transiently open like a clam, as they split between the two DNA gyres while the dyadic DNA region acts as a hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews and Luger, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Such a clamshell opening motion could further increase the degree of freedom of the L1-L1’ interface, promoting VivosX adducts of H2A and H2A.Z.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned solvent accessibility issue, the biochemical environment surrounding the cysteine residues can also influence disulfide crosslinking efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh and Whitesides, 1993</xref>). The first step of the thiol-disulfide interchange reaction requires deprotonation of the cysteine sulfhydryl and thus will be facilitated by lowering of the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of the cysteine thiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The resulting thiolate then attacks the disulfide on 4-DPS to form a trisulfur anionic intermediate [<sup>δ-</sup>S–S–S<sup>δ-</sup>], which will be promoted by a basic environment and clearance from steric/positional constraints. Finally, the second S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction will involve the opposite cysteine, again in thiolate form, to attack the mixed disulfide bond from the cysteine side to form a cystine, which is affected by the cysteine p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> and the position and orientation of the thiolate. Altogether, multiple factors could affect the crosslinking efficiency of L1-L1’ at the different cysteines on L1, explaining why crosslinking efficiency does not simply correlate with Cα-Cα’ distance of the cysteine pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>A recent study from the Richmond lab indicated that recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> H2A with the corresponding cysteine substitution as yeast Hta1(N39C) and Htz1(T46C) supported efficient L1-L1’ crosslinking of histone octamers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frouws et al., 2018</xref>).

Notwithstanding a minor contribution of the uncrosslinked monomers a result of inefficient crosslinking, the bulk of the uncrosslinked species should represent the non-nucleosomal pools of A-B and Z-B dimers, which constitute 39% and 26% of total H2A and H2A.Z, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> lane 6, <bold>3B</bold> lane 6, and <bold>3C</bold> lanes 2 and 4). These unincorporated histones could be A-B and Z-B dimers that are associated with histone chaperones or chromatin remodelers, like SWR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun and Luk, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). These dimers could also be associated with chromatin in the form of hexasomes (partial nucleosomal particles missing one A-B or Z-B dimer) or non-nucleosomal histone-DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although native yeast core histones are conveniently cysteine free, other non-histone proteins subjected to VivosX may not be. To determine how much background crosslinking is contributed by the endogenous cysteines on an interacting protein pair, 4-DPS treatment of cells expressing the unmodified genes should be included as negative controls. However, we argue that endogenous cysteines that are outside of a ~ 15 Å radius from the intended cysteine probe should not interfere with VivosX and thus need not be removed, as the histone mutants Htz1(H44C), Htz1(T49C), and Hta1(G38C) exhibited virtually no crosslinking.

However, to what extent the two nucleosomal H3 proteins crosslink with each other via the C110-C110’ disulfide linkage remains unclear. Earlier studies on H3 C110 crosslinking encountered three technical challenges that are relevant to this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrard et al., 1977</xref>). The first technical hurdle was the potential artifact of thiol-disulfide interchange after cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrard et al., 1977</xref>). This problem was overcome for VivosX by rapidly fixing the yeast cells with TCA before mechanical disruption and protein extraction in the presence of excess NEM, which effectively blocks non-specific disulfide crosslinking upon cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Similarly, human proteins were directly extracted into NEM and the TCA fixation step was not necessary as the TUNES-NEM extraction buffer directly lysed the human cells. The second challenge was the preservation of the disulfide crosslinks formed inside cells during the protein extraction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrard et al., 1977</xref>). For H2A and H2A.Z, no decrease in L1-L1’ adducts was observed as a function of time after lysis, suggesting that the L1-L1’ disulfide crosslinks are relatively stable under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). The final challenge for the H3 studies was that the biological role of C110-C110’ crosslinking is unknown, thereby precluding the use of genetics to verify the H3 crosslinking status. We exploited the H2A.Z turnover pathway to perturb the L1-L1’ interaction of H2A.Z using mutants that both decrease and increase H2A.Z at promoters to validate the VivosX approach. Interestingly, in the VivosX analysis of human H2A.Z where efficient H2A.Z L1-L1’ crosslinking was observed, no 4-DPS-dependent C110-C110’ H3 crosslinking adduct was detected in the non-reducing anti-H3 immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is consistent with a previous conclusion that the C110 of histone H3 is inaccessible to thiol-specific reagents and requires destabilization of the nucleosome structure to make C110 solvent accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1987</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>VivosX can detect both modified and unmodified ZZ nucleosomes in human cells</title><p>The Cα-Cα’ distance for the L1-L1’ interface at H43 of human H2A.Z is 8.2 Å, which is 2.6 Å greater than that of the average disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suto et al., 2000</xref>). The ability of H2A.Z(H43C) to efficiently form intra-nucleosomal crosslinks suggests that the L1-L1’ interface of ZZ nucleosomes in human cells is not only solvent accessible, but also dynamic as in the case of the yeast ZZ nucleosomes. Unlike yeast, however, a subpopulation of H2A.Z in mammalian cells is monoubiquitylated, and these modified H2A.Z molecules are associated with facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>). The observation that monoubiquitylated H2A.Z(H43C) readily forms disulfide crosslinks further supports that the accessibility and dynamics of the H2A.Z L1-L1’ interface is independent of transcription.</p><p>Our VivosX data suggest that up to two ubiquitin moieties can be simultaneously attached to one ZZ nucleosome. We deduce that the two ubiquitin moieties are separately attached to the opposite faces of the ZZ nucleosome given that reduction of the disulfide bond gave rise to mono- but not di-ubiquitylated H2A.Z. This observation is in concordance with a previous result that showed only one of the three lysines in the 120-<bold>KK</bold>GQQ<bold>K</bold>-125 motif at the C-terminus of H2A.Z was exclusively ubiquitylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sarcinella et al., 2007</xref>).

For example, VivosX could be used to elucidate the combinatorial interactions of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family transcription factors. Using crystallographic data available for the bHLH-LZ heterodimers, like Myc-Max and Mad-Max, cysteine probes can be placed near the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nair and Burley, 2003</xref>). As pairing of different bHLH-LZ dimers and subsequent binding to DNA sites are known to elicit specific cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diolaiti et al., 2015</xref>), the relative abundance of the disulfide adducts between the different bHLH-LZ partners could be used as a metric of pairing status in cells and analyzed by VivosX in a spatiotemporal manner.</p><p>The observation that ZZ nucleosomes can be monoubiquitylated asymmetrically on one H2A.Z or symmetrically on both raises the possibility that VivosX can be used to determine the stoichiometry of post-translational modifications (especially ubiquitin or SUMO) on other non-histone dimers or oligomers. For example, the DNA replication processivity clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which functions as a trimer, can be conjugated to either ubiquitin or SUMO on the same lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choe and Moldovan, 2017</xref>). Ubiquitylation promotes translesion synthesis bypass, whereas SUMOylation suppresses unwanted homologous recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choe and Moldovan, 2017</xref>). Whether these modifications are present on the same PCNA trimer <italic>in vivo</italic> is a question that can be addressed by VivosX.

The <italic><sup>V5</sup>HTA1(N39C) HTZ1(T46C)<sup>FL</sup></italic> haploid, yEL349, was derived from yEL286, which contains the <italic><sup>V5</sup>HTA1(N39C)</italic> allele.

A synthetic gene fragment of the same region but with a 2xV5 tag immediately after the <italic>HTA1</italic> start codon was subcloned into the JH55 backbone via the <italic>XbaI</italic> sites to make pEL305. The <italic>CEN ARS HIS3 <sup>V5</sup>HTA1(N39C)-HTB1</italic> plasmid (pEL440), was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pEL305 template. For the other <italic><sup>V5</sup>HTA1(Cys)-HTB1</italic> plasmids, pEL305 was linearized with BstAPI and MfeI, and synthetic double-stranded DNA fragments (<italic>GenScript</italic>) containing individual cysteine substitution at L1 with at least 60 bp of overlapping regions on both sides were recombined using the Gibson assembly kit (<italic>New England Biolabs</italic>), creating pEL558-pEL561.

Yeast cells bearing the cysteine substituted L1 mutants (or the wild-type control) were cultured in 5 mL of CSM media (without cysteine, <italic>Sunrise Science Products</italic>) in 50-mL conical tubes at 30°C to logarithmic phase [Optical density, (OD)<sub>600</sub> of 0.5] before addition of 180 µM 4-DPS (<italic>Sigma Aldrich</italic>, Cat # 143057, 180 mM stock concentration in DMSO). Note that culturing cells in the Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YEPD) media is not recommended for VivosX, as crosslinking efficiency is lower than when CSM media was used (data not shown), possibly due to neutralization of 4-DPS by free thiols in the YEPD media. The cultures were incubated at 30 ˚C for 20 min and then quenched with 20% TCA. After centrifugation at 2095 xg for 5 min in a swinging bucket rotor (SX4750, <italic>Beckman coulter</italic>), the pelleted cells were washed once with 1 mL 20% TCA and transferred to 1.7 mL screw cap tubes. After pelleting the cells again and removing the supernatant, homogenization was performed in the presence of 400 µL 20% TCA and ~450 µL of zirconia beads (0.7 mm diameter, <italic>BioSpec,</italic> 11079107zx) using a FastPrep-24 instrument (<italic>MP Biomedicals</italic>) at power level '6' for two times 20 sec with a 1 min incubation on ice in-between. After transferring 200 µL of the lysate to a new microcentrifuge tube, the precipitated total proteins along with cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,400 xg for 15 min at 4 ˚C. The pellets were then washed with ice-cold acetone, minced with pipet tips, and dispersed as much as possible. The insoluble materials were pelleted again by centrifugation at 20,400 xg for 15 min at 4 ˚C before re-suspending in the TUNES buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.2, 6 M Urea, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.4 M NaCl, 10% glycerol). Where indicated, 50 mM of NEM was added. Extraction was performed at 30°C for 60 min with constant mixing in a vortexer (<italic>TOMY</italic>, MT-400) followed by centrifugation at 20,400 xg for 10 min. For non-reducing SDS-PAGE, 1 part of 1% bromophenol blue was added to 24 parts of the cleared extracts. For reducing SDS-PAGE, 25 parts of the bromophenol blue/extract mixtures were mixed with 1 part of β-ME and heated at 55 ˚C for 5 min. Electrophoresis was performed at 150 V for 1 hr 25 min in the Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% w/v SDS). The Prestained Precision Plus Protein Standards (<italic>BioRad</italic>, Cat. 1610375) were used in all gels.</p><p>The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to methanol-treated PVDF membranes (<italic>BioRad</italic>, Cat # 162–0174) using the XCell II blotting system at a constant voltage of 25 V for 2 hr in the Transfer buffer (12.4 mM Tris, 96 mM glycine, 0.1% w/v SDS, 20% v/v methanol). The membranes were blocked with 2% of the ECL Prime Blocking agent (<italic>GE Healthcare</italic>) and probed with the indicated antibodies. Anti-FLAG (<italic>Sigma Aldrich</italic>, Cat.

This was achieved by an initial immunoblotting analysis that uses equal volume (25 µL) of samples followed by a second analysis that uses adjusted volumes (10–40 µL) based on the signals [i.e. anti-FLAG for Htz1(Cys)<sup>FL</sup> and anti-H2A for <sup>V5</sup>Hta1(Cys)] of the β-ME-treated samples of the first immunoblot.</p><p>Preparation of the cultures of the Anchor-away strains was modified for VivosX as follows. <italic>TBP-FRB</italic> (yEL402), <italic>SWC5-FRB</italic> (yEL403) and untagged control (yEL401) strains were cultured in 50 mL CSM medium to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 before the addition of 1 ug/mL rapamycin (RAP, 1 mg/mL stock concentration in DMSO) or equal volume of DMSO. After incubation at 30°C for 1 hr, 5 mL cultures were transferred into a 50-mL falcon tube and incubated with either 180 µM 4-DPS or equivalent volume of DMSO for 20 min.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Geeta J Narlikar as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tim Formosa (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; manuscript the authors describe a novel disulphide cross-linking approach that they term VivosX to assess in vivo interactions between canonical and variant H2A histones. The approach relies on strategically placed cysteines that are expected to form disulphide bonds under oxidizing conditions. The authors provide extensive validation of the method and clear description of its use. While they note that the results obtained must be considered to be qualitative assessments, they demonstrate that both global decreases and increases in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes that result from physiological perturbations were detectable using their VivosX technique. For example, in previous work the Luk group showed that PIC formation is responsible for evicting H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes, and here they find that PIC preferentially removes homo-ZZ over hetero-ZA nucleosomes. They also show that a ubiquitin modification at the C-terminus can be detected for H2A.Z nucleosomes. Overall the VivosX approach appears to be a useful approach to rapidly screen for effects of mutants and environmental conditions on the composition of nucleosomes in terms of H2A and H2A.Z. A strength of the approach is its relative ease of use because it relies on directly probing histone proteins that are TCA precipitated from whole cell extracts.</p><p><italic>eLife</italic>'s policy on this category of papers states that new methods &quot;will be assessed in terms of their potential to facilitate experiments that address problems that to date have been very challenging or even intractable.&quot; On this point the authors succeed, as the difficulty of measuring changes in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes has posed an impediment to understanding the roles of this histone variant. The category description also states that &quot;Tools and Resources articles do not have to report major new biological insights or mechanisms, but it must be clear that they will enable such advances to take place.&quot; It is less clear that, as written, this criterion is met; the authors don't discuss how this new method might be applied to address questions beyond those relating to the H2A/H2A.Z composition of nucleosomes. Below we suggest some ways in which the authors can discuss the broader uses of the VivosX approach.</p><p>1) With the numerous hetero and homo-dimeric complexes in the cell (where crystal structures are known), the authors' work makes it a realistic goal to monitor the relative proportions of these pairings by engineering S-S bonds (for example, Myc-Max and Mad-Max and there are many others).

The approach relies on strategically placed cysteines that are expected to form disulphide bonds under oxidizing conditions. The authors provide extensive validation of the method and clear description of its use. While they note that the results obtained must be considered to be qualitative assessments, they demonstrate that both global decreases and increases in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes that result from physiological perturbations were detectable using their VivosX technique. For example, in previous work the Luk group showed that PIC formation is responsible for evicting H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes, and here they find that PIC preferentially removes homo-ZZ over hetero-ZA nucleosomes. They also show that a ubiquitin modification at the C-terminus can be detected for H2A.Z nucleosomes. Overall the VivosX approach appears to be a useful approach to rapidly screen for effects of mutants and environmental conditions on the composition of nucleosomes in terms of H2A and H2AZ. A strength of the approach is its relative ease of use because it relies on directly probing histone proteins that are TCA precipitated from whole cell extracts.</italic></p><p>The reviewers’ comments make us realize that our comment about VivosX being qualitative is inaccurate, as this approach was used to make quantitative assessments, such as those found in Figures 5A and 5C. Therefore, the sentence ‘the VivosX readout is qualitative’ is removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>eLife's policy on this category of papers states that new methods &quot;will be assessed in terms of their potential to facilitate experiments that address problems that to date have been very challenging or even intractable.&quot; On this point the authors succeed, as the difficulty of measuring changes in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes has posed an impediment to understanding the roles of this histone variant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The category description also states that &quot;Tools and Resources articles do not have to report major new biological insights or mechanisms, but it must be clear that they will enable such advances to take place.&quot; It is less clear that, as written, this criterion is met; the authors don't discuss how this new method might be applied to address questions beyond those relating to the H2A/H2A.Z composition of nucleosomes. Below we suggest some ways in which the authors can discuss the broader uses of the VivosX approach.</p></disp-quote><p>To emphasize the general application of VivosX, we have revised the manuscript as follows:</p><p>First, the title has been changed to “VivosX, a disulfide crosslinking approach to capture site-specific, protein-protein interactions in yeast and human cells”. Second, the Introduction was revised to explicitly state that VivosX is a general strategy for probing site-specific, protein-protein interactions and that the histone study is a proof of concept for the new approach. Third, the application of VivosX to study questions beyond histone dynamics is discussed (Subsection “Applications of VivosX beyond histone dynamics”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) With the numerous hetero and homo-dimeric complexes in the cell (where crystal structures are known), the authors' work makes it a realistic goal to monitor the relative proportions of these pairings by engineering S-S bonds (for example, Myc-Max and Mad-Max and there are many others). The authors should discuss such possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, potential applications of VivosX for probing other protein–protein interactions are discussed.

However, we normalized the AxZ and ZxZ data to total H2A.Z instead of monomer H2A.Z (mono Z) because mono Z level is reciprocal to AxZ and ZxZ levels.

We then say that histone crosslinking was used to test the robustness of the assay.
