mechanisms remaining largely unknown. Using the sea urchin larva, this work identified the SLC4 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter family member <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> to be critically involved in the formation of an elaborate calcitic endoskeleton. <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> is specifically expressed by calcifying primary mesenchyme cells with peak expression during de novo formation of the skeleton. Knock-down of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> led to pH regulatory defects accompanied by decreased calcification rates and skeleton deformations. Reductions in seawater pH, resembling ocean acidification scenarios, led to an increase in <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> expression suggesting a compensatory mechanism in place to maintain calcification rates. We propose a first pH regulatory and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrating mechanism that is fundamentally linked to the biological precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. This knowledge will help understanding biomineralization strategies in animals and their interaction with a changing environment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36600.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many marine organisms such as mussels, sea urchins or corals, have skeletons and shells, which – due to their beautiful colors and shapes – are often desirable collector pieces. These structures are made from calcium and carbonate ions that react to form calcium carbonate crystals in a process known as biomineralization.</p><p>In sea urchin larvae, for example, the skeleton is built by so-called primary mesenchyme cells, which work similar to the bone forming cells in mammals. These mesenchyme cells use calcium from the sea water, which travels to the site where the shell starts to form. About half of the carbonate comes from carbon dioxide that the animals make as they breathe, but it is not known how the other half gets to the site of biomineralization.</p><p>Producing a skeleton generates acid, and marine animals need to be able to regulate their pH levels, as too acidic environments can dissolve the calcium carbonate and threatening to destroy the developing shell. How cells accumulate enough carbonate to make their shells, and how they cope with acidity is still poorly understood.</p><p>Here, Hu et al. address this problem by studying purple sea urchin larvae, revealing that they use ion transporters to gather bicarbonate from seawater. These structures are part of a group of bicarbonate transporters known as the ‘SLC4 transporter family’, which sit across the membrane of the mesenchyme cells and move the bicarbonate ions along. As the sea urchin larvae develop, the levels of the transporter protein start to rise in mesenchyme cells, peaking around the time they are producing the skeleton.</p><p>Stopping the production of the transporter hindered the larvae from building normal skeletons and also made their cells more acidic. It turns out that bicarbonate is more than a skeleton ingredient – it also helps to buffer the acid made in the process. Bicarbonate ions can combine with acidic molecules to form water and carbon dioxide. Bicarbonate pumped in from the sea neutralises the acidic molecules made during calcium carbonate formation, which helps to stabilize pH levels.</p><p>When the acidity of the water was experimentally increased, it prompted the sea urchins to produce more of the SLC4 transporters, revealing that they may have another role to play. Their acid-neutralizing capability helped the animals to cope with changes in their environment. Taking on more bicarbonate could therefore help to compensate for rising acidity, allowing skeleton production to carry on as normal.</p><p>This last finding is important in the context of ocean acidification. As the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, more of the gas dissolves in the sea. The chemical reactions that follow make the water more acidic and decreases the pH levels of the sea. Understanding how animals make their skeletons and shells, and manage acid, could reveal how they will cope as the environment changes in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcification</kwd><kwd>larval skeleton</kwd><kwd>primary mesenchyme cells</kwd><kwd>Na+/HCO3- cotransporter</kwd><kwd>ocean acidification</kwd><kwd>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cluster of Excellence CP1519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Marian Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cluster of Excellence CP1409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Marian Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular carbon accumulation systems are a fundamental prerequisite for biomineralization to stabilize pH and to supply inorganic carbon for CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation under changing environmental conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sea urchin larvae with their elaborate calcareous endoskeleton have been studied by embryologists for over a century to promote our understanding of calcification in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boveri, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker and Lennarz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilt, 2002</xref>). Similar to mammalian osteoblasts that arise from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), the sea urchin larval skeleton is also produced by a specific cell line – the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilt, 2002</xref>). During the blastula stage, PMCs ingress into the blastocoel and migrate in a stereotypical pattern, forming a posterior ring around the blastopore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ettensohn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gustafson and Kinnander, 1956</xref>). Amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is precipitated within intracellular vesicles that exocytose their content into the lumen of a syncytial cable formed by the PMCs. This process involves at least 40 distinct skeletal matrix proteins supporting the formation of the mature calcite spicules within this extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beniash et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benson et al., 1986</xref>). Some of these matrix proteins are also present in intracellular compartments where they may play a role in the stabilization of ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Urry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilt, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, recent findings suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> also enters calcification vesicles by endocytosis of seawater into a vesicular network within the PMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vidavsky et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>During de novo formation of the larval skeleton in the mid-gastrula stage, calcium uptake increases ten-fold, compared to the blastula stage. 70% of this calcium is incorporated into the newly formed spicules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakano et al., 1963</xref>), while the remaining 30% reflects the uptake of calcium into cell organelles, including mitochondria and the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decker et al., 1987</xref>). Besides the availability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, i.e. CO<sub>2</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) is required at equimolar levels for the precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Radioisotopic measurements demonstrate that up to 63% of carbon for spicule formation derives from respiratory CO<sub>2</sub>, while the remaining DIC that is incorporated into the spicules derives from seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sikes et al., 1981</xref>). Based on the assumption that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> rather than CO<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> supplies the remaining 37% of DIC for calcification, 1.6 protons are generated per molecule CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> precipitated. An even stronger local acidification at the site of ACC formation can be expected considering CO<sub>2</sub> as the major source of DIC. Based on these calculations, it has been suggested that PMCs are capable of efficiently handling this proton load using pH regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sikes et al., 1981</xref>). However, such potential acid-base regulatory mechanisms in PMCs remain poorly understood despite their importance in the formation of the larval skeleton.</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that pH<sub>i</sub> regulation of PMCs is dependent on external Na<sup>+</sup> as well as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to compensate for an intracellular acidosis indicating Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> buffering mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport in the calcifying PMCs is underlined by the observation that DIDS (4,4´-diisothiocyano-2,2´´-disulfonic acid stilbene), an inhibitor for most SLC4 family transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Romero et al., 2004</xref>) inhibits uptake and deposition of <sup>45</sup>Ca into spicules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yasumasu et al., 1985</xref>). Accordingly, it has been concluded that these compounds block the supply of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> for ACC formation rather than the ability of PMC cells to form their syncytium as shown for other blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitsunaga et al., 1986</xref>). Furthermore, H<sup>+</sup>-export pathways involving Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange were suggested to remove protons from the cytosol of PMCs although amiloride, an inhibitor for Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent H<sup>+</sup> exchange had no effect on spicule formation and pH<sub>i</sub> regulation of PMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mitsunaga et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we hypothesize that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport pathways, <italic>via</italic> a so far unidentified HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport mechanism affect the calcification process in different ways: (i) HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport supplies the cell with substrate for the precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> and (ii) the regulation of intracellular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> homeostasis is critical to buffer excess protons generated by the intravesicular precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Apart from an endogenous generation of protons through biomineralization, pH regulatory mechanisms of sea urchin larvae have received considerable attention in the context of CO<sub>2</sub> driven sea water acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). The sea urchin larva has been extensively studied with respect to their potential for physiological acclimation and evolutionary adaptation to predicted near-future ocean acidification. These studies suggested that energy allocations and ion regulatory efforts are key processes that determine the resilience to reductions in seawater pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pespeni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). These studies also indicated that despite moderate impacts at the organismal level, the compensatory reactions at the cellular level are substantial. Thus, a better mechanistic understanding for cellular processes affected by changes in seawater pH is essential to explain energy allocations in the sea urchin larva exposed to experimental ocean acidification.</p><p>Four Slc4 transporters were identified in the genome of the purple sea urchin, <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tu et al., 2012</xref>). To date, little is known regarding the function and tissue-specific localization of Slc4 transporters in the sea urchin larva. During the period of early skeleton formation in the sea urchin embryo (30–48 hr post fertilization), highest transcript abundance was detected for the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> gene compared to all other Slc4 transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tu et al., 2014</xref>). This gene shares highest sequence identity with the mammalian Slc4a10 (NBCn2) gene that encodes an electroneutral sodium-dependnet Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger with Cl<sup>-</sup> self-exchange activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). This prompted us to hypothesize that <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> may be critically involved in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport during formation of the larval skeleton. Here, we test the role of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> in the maintenance of intracellular pH homeostasis and as a DIC concentration mechanism in the calcifying PMCs of the sea urchin embryo. Since pH<sub>i</sub> regulation is intrinsically linked to precipitation of ACC, these mechanisms will fill an important knowledge gap regarding the fundamental principles of biomineralization in the sea urchin larva.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression pattern of the sea urchin <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> bicarbonate transporter</title><p>The <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> has widespread expression in blastula embryos at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf), including the PMCs surrounding the blastopore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The human NBCn2 encoded by <italic>Slc4a10</italic> has absolute requirements for Na<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and appears to be a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger that is blocked in the presence of 200 µM DIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). Earlier studies demonstrated that pH<sub>i</sub> regulation in PMCs is also highly Na<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-dependent thereby supporting the involvement of an Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport mechanism in the regulation of PMC pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). Together with findings of the present work demonstrating that pH<sub>i</sub> regulation in PMCs is DIDS sensitive (IC<sub>50</sub> = 120 µM) and that knock-down of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> reduces the ability to compensate an intracellular acidosis, there is strong evidence that <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> plays a central role in controlling pH<sub>i</sub> of PMCs.</p><p>ACC is precipitated in intracellular vesicles which are subsequently exocytosed into the luminal space of the syncycial cable to form and maintain the larval skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vidavsky et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, protons generated during the formation of ACC must be removed from the vesicles into the cytosol to avoid an increasing intravesicular acidification leading to inhibition of CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation. This uptake of protons into the cytosol may cause disturbances in pH<sub>i</sub> homeostasis if not actively compensated by buffering and secretion of protons. Here, the PMCs of the sea urchin larva share many common features with mammalian osteoblasts where precipitation of the calcium phosphate mineral, hydroxyapatite, is initiated in vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boonrungsiman et al., 2012</xref>). These vesicles are exocytosed from osteoblasts to deliver mineral to the protein matrix of the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson, 2003</xref>). During mineral precipitation large amounts of acid are produced that need to be removed in order to maintain the slightly alkaline conditions at the site of bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandao-Burch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, osteoblasts also possess a high pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory capacity during biomineralization that is achieved by a basolateral Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 1 (NHE1) and NHE6 as well as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> exchange mechanisms by the anion exchanger 2 (AE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mobasheri et al., 1998</xref>). The present work demonstrates that similar to mammalian osteoblasts, PMCs of the sea urchin larva also possess pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory mechanisms to promote biomineralization. Highest expression of the PMC-specific bicarbonate transporter <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> is accompanied by the onset of skeleton formation in the sea urchin embryo and expression levels decrease in later stages that have lower calcification rates. The progressive down regulation of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> is accompanied by a migration of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> expressing cells toward the tips of the spicules during further development.</p><p>Immunocytochemical analyses using a custom made antibody designed against the sea urchin SpSlc4a10 demonstrated high concentrations of this protein in PMCs. This suggests substantial HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport capacities by PMCs that may be associated with pH<sub>i</sub> regulation and accumulation of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to promote precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Besides a localization of SpSlc4a10 in the plasma membrane, large intracellular compartments demonstrated positive immunoreactivity as well. In mammalian skeletal tissues AE2 has been associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it is hypothesized to control pH within the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bronckers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holappa et al., 2001</xref>). By controlling pH inside the Golgi, AE2 is believed to mediate posttranslational modification of matrix proteins, their packaging, transfer to the outer plasma membrane and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bronckers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>). A lack of this protein in skeletogenic cells is often associated with osteoporosis-like skeletal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, future studies will address the function of the SpSlc4a10 transporter in subcellular compartments and organelles of PMCs.</p><p>The disturbance of skeletogenesis in the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants may be due to multiple factors, including (i) disturbance of PMC migration (ii) reductions in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply (iii) decreased control of pH<sub>i</sub>. The phenotype of the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants was characterized by decreased calcification abilities and abnormally formed spicules, lacking or having irregular branchings from the primary rods. Localization of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> positive PMCs in control and morphants indicated an abnormal migration of PMCs. Disturbance of migratory patterns and syncytium formation has been documented in several earlier studies using pharmacological approaches. For example loop diuretics, blocking the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter (NKCC) inhibited the fusion and formation of cytoplasmic cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basse et al., 2015</xref>). Also the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (HKA) inhibitor SCH28080 decreased calcification through impaired PMC fusion. However, while inhibition of HKA decreased pH<sub>i</sub> of PMCs, no changes in the migratory pattern were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schatzberg et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, the disruption of cell migration in the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants may be explained by changes in pH<sub>i</sub> gradients that can be critical for cell polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). It has been demonstrated that inhibition of NHE1, an important regulator of pH<sub>i</sub>, caused pH<sub>i</sub> gradients to flatten or disappear. These gradients serve as an axis of movement in migrating cells and so their absence would likely affect migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). This hypothesis would be underlined by the down regulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger (<italic>SpSlc9a2</italic>) in the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants. Although these are likely explanations for the observed migratory defects, intracellular pH disturbances were demonstrated to be associated with a wide range of cellular dysfunctions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kurkdjian and Guern, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Madshus, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roos and Boron, 1981</xref>) that may also systemically disturb PMC migration.</p><p>The present work provides further evidence for the requirement of bicarbonate transport pathways to regulate pH<sub>i</sub> that are likely the primary cause for reduced and abnormal skeleton formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that reductions in calcification observed for the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants resulted from the decreased pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory ability of PMCs. The uncompensated proton load generated by the formation of ACC leads to an intracellular acidosis impairing futher precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, since 40% of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that is incorporated into spicules derives from the seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sikes et al., 1981</xref>), it can be suggested that <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> may be also involved in a HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrating mechanism to promote intracellular calcification. Corroborating ealier studies that demonstrated reductions in Ca<sup>45</sup> uptake into spicules in the presence of the anion exchange inhibitor, DIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yasumasu et al., 1985</xref>), the present work could show reduced incorporation of calcein in larvae treated with this compound. These reductions in calcification rates are accompanied by decreased pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory abilities under DIDS treatment. However, DIDS is a broad-band inhibitor for most SLC4 transporters, and has been demonstrated to potentially also inhibit the gastric-type H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sugita et al., 1999</xref>). Accordingly, it remains unresolved whether decreased pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory abilities under DIDS treatment can be attributed to an inhibition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or H<sup>+</sup> transport. Nonethless, the knock-down of the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> caused similar reductions in pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory capacities and calcein incorporation into spicules providing strong evidence for <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> to be a key player controlling intracellular ACC formation in the sea urchin larva.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36600.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for pH regulation and bicarbonate transport in PMCs of the sea urchin larva.</title><p>PMCs form a syncytium within the extraxellular matrix (ECM) that has a pH the same as sea water (SW) in which the larva develops.

A putative electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup>-independent Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporter SLC4γ has been exclusively associated with calcifying tissues of scleratinian corals that is lacking in other non-calcifying cnidarians. Based on the findings of the present work, future studies will use the sea urchin larva as a model to identify other PMC-specific acid-base transporters (e.g. Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchangers) that may be critically involved in the calcification process. Here, special attention will also be dedicated to the ability of PMCs to re-absorb the larval skeleton close to metamorphosis, which is also likely associated with pH modulations in the PMC syncycium. Since pH regulation is ultimately linked to the biological precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the present work provides a first step toward characterizing ion-regulatory mechanisms in PMCs critical for biomineralization the sea urchin embryo.

Briefly, for IF larvae ware fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in filtered seawater for 15 min and postfixed in ice-cold methanol for 1 hr. The polyclonal primary antibody was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an internal region (LTRHRHHKQKKKKEPENKAYNKGRRKS) of the sea urchin SpSlc4a10 protein. The affinity chromatography purified antibody was diluted 1:250 and samples were incubated over night at 4°C. After washing, samples were incubated in the secondary antibody for 1 hr, and pictures were taken on a confocal microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss, Germany).</p><p>For WB, 250 larvae were collected, weighted and extracted by gentle pipetting in 1:10 wt/vol of Lämmli loading buffer. Proteins were fractionated by SDS PAGE on 6.5% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), using a tank blotting system (Bio-Rad). Blots were preincubated for 1 hr at room temperature in TBS-Tween buffer containing 5% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin. Blots were incubated at 4°C overnight in a 1:7500 dilution of the primary antibody (see previous section). After washing with TBS-T, the blots were incubated for 1 hr with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:14,000 in TBS-T. Protein signals were visualized with the ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) and photographed with a Gel Doc 2000 system equipped with a CCD camera (BioRad). For the peptide compensation assays used in whole mount IF and WB analysis, the primary antibody was pre-absorbed with the immunization peptide at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for 12 hr at 4°C.</p><p>Intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) measurements and ammonia pulse technique pH<sub>i</sub> determinations and ammonia pulse experiments were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). Control and morphant larvae were measured in an alternate mode and from each larva 4–5 cells were simultanously recorded and treated as one replicate (n = 1). Nigericin in combination with high external [K<sup>+</sup>] (150 mM) was used to calibrate pH<sub>i</sub> with our detected emission ratio of BCECF in living PMCs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stumpp et al., 2012</xref>). For the ammonia pulse experiments, all larvae were exposed to filtered sea water (NSW) followed by the 20 mM NH<sub>3</sub>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> prepulse (NSW +20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl). Acidosis was induced by washout using NSW or by using NSW containing different concentrations of 4,4´-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2´-disulfonic acid disodium salt (DIDS) or 0.1% DMSO as vehicle control, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium content determination</title><p>To investigate the calcium content of larvae subjected to different pH levels, 50 ml of water from the larval cultures with known larval density was collected and larvae were concentrated by centrifugation.

Larvae were quickly washed three times in distilled water and the supernatant was removed after the last centrifugation. Samples were dried for 24 hr at 37°C. The samples were dissolved in 10 M HCl for 15 min and samples were analyzed using a flame photometer (EFOX 5053, Eppendorf). Calcium concentrations were normalized per larva and expressed as nmol larva<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calcein pulse-chase experiments</title><p>Late gastrula stage larvae (2dpf) were used for calcein labeling experiments. Control and MO injected larvae were bathed in filtered seawater (NSW) containing 160 µM calcein (Sigma) for 3 hr. For inhibitor experiments, larvae were additionally exposed to different DIDS concentrations (0, 10 and 100 µM) in the calcein solution. Vehicle controls contained 0.1% of DMSO. After 3 hr of incubation, larvae were washed four times by centrifugation and replacement of the calcein containing NSW by fresh NSW with the respective DIDS or DMSO concentration. Larvae were further incubated for 4 hr to remove calcein caught in the extracellular matrix of the larvae. Life larvae were mounted to microscope slides using synthetic cotton filaments (30–50 µm diameter) as spacers and covered with a coverslip. 5 Z-stacks images with a section thickness of 10 µm were aquired for every larva using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510) and fluorescence intensities were determined using the associated Zeiss imaging software (ZEN).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were tested for normality and homogeneity and significance levels were analyzed using paired t-tests. For the analyses of gene expression in CO<sub>2</sub>-treated larvae as well as comparisons of calcein fluorescence intensities in morphants and DIDS-treated larvae one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test was used. Regression analyses were performed on log transformed data using linear models. ANCOVA followed by the Holm-Sidak method was performed to test for sigificant diffrences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> content under different CO<sub>2</sub> treatments. Statistical analyses were conducted using Sigma Stat 13 (Systat Software).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank M Thorndyke for constructive comments and discussions on this work.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Tresguerres (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, should the authors address the concerns raised by the reviewers with respect to experimental controls and specificity, we would entertain a revised paper in the future. This would take the form of a new submission, linked to the previous one within the system and would be assessed by the same experts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study attempted to characterize the involvement of the bicarbonate transporter <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> in sea urchin larvae calcification. The hypothesis was that <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> is preferentially expressed in primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), which are responsible for calcification, where it alkalanizes intracellular pH (pHi) to promote calcification. The study also addressed the potential involvement of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> under ocean acidification (OA)- like conditions.</p><p>The topic is important and timely because information about molecular and cellular calcification mechanisms in marine organisms is scarce, and because this is essential for understanding and predicting potential effects of OA.

In addition, those larvae had significant NHE downregulation (which would also explain the results). It is likely that mRNA levels for other ion transporting proteins that were not examined were also up or downregulated. This makes it impossible to attribute the effects to <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic>.</p><p>Morpholinos should be validated in some of the following ways:</p><p>The gold standard would be to determine protein abundance using validated antibodies; <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> protein level should be reduced.

While it is true this drug inhibits bicarbonate transporters, it is very broad so it will inhibit all bicarbonate transporters (not just <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic>). Furthermore and even more worrying is that DIDS has multiple and significant off-target effects, which explains why cutting-edge biomedical research has stopped using DIDS at least a decade ago. For example, DIDS inhibits the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase at concentrations as low as 1μM (Sugita, et al. 1999).</p><p>One way to circumvent this problem would be to assess the effect of DIDS on cells from sea urchin larvae morphants (which should not be sensitive to DIDS).</p><p>Moreover, the effects of DMSO (the vehicle for DIDS) on pHi should be determined.</p><p>Unless these issues are resolved, I will not provide further feedback about the experiments or conclusions.

The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. The manuscript supports a key role of the bicarbonate transporter <italic>slc4a10</italic> in pH regulation and biomineralization processes in developing sea urchin. The only real problem with the manuscript is a logical gap as to why the research has chosen to focus on <italic>slc4a10</italic> as opposed to any other bicarbonate transporter of sea urchins?

We spent a lot of time and efforts to carefully address and resolve all issues raised by reviewer #1, which has significantly increased the quality and scientific value of this work.</p><p>We were able to generate and validate an antibody raised against the sea urchin SpSlc4a10 protein. Using this antibody we validated our MO-knock-down by western blot analysis and could confirm our in situ hybridization experiments demonstrating that also the protein of SpSlc4a10 is exclusively located in PMCs. We performed additional experiments using scrambled morpholinos to demonstrate that skeletal defects can be specifically attributed to the SpSlc4a10 MO. In addition, in the context of another project, we are currently working with several other MOs targeting proteins expressed in the endoderm of the sea urchin larva. Using these MOs we found no skeletal defects making us very confident that skeletal deformations and reductions in calcification seen in this study can be attributed to the specificity of our SpSlc4a10 MO. We also explained the rationale for choosing DIDS in our pharmacological experiments and the implications of these observations for the research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, this study has one major flaw in that the specificity and efficacy of SpSlc4a10 morpholino knockdown was not validated.</p><p>Figure 2D shows a 4-fold upregulation of SpSlc4a10 mRNA, however this is not a reliable validation.

According to the reviewer´s suggestion we now included additional experiments to validate the specificity of our <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> knock-down by demonstrating that protein levels are decreased in <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants. We generated a polyclonal antibody designed against AA205-231 (LTRHRHHKQKKKKEPENKAYNKGRRKS) of the <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> protein of the purple sea urchin (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpurtus</italic>). Western blot analyses demonstrate specific immunoreactivity of our <italic>SpScl4a10</italic> antibody with a 130 KDa protein which is in the predicted size range, and which is similar to the molecular weight of the mammalian <italic>Slc4a10</italic> orthologue. <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> protein levels are significantly reduced by 70% (normalized to ß-actin) in morphants compared to control larvae. Immunocytological analyses demonstrate high concentration of this protein in primary mesenchyme cells and associated filopodia. The protein is localized in cellular membranes as well as in the cytosol (vesicles). We added this data as a new figure (Figure 3) to the revised manuscript and added the respective paragraphs to the manuscript describing and discussing these new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In any case, control &quot;scrambled morpholino&quot; should be used and those larvae must be used for at least some of the key experiments.

We added a new supplemental figure to this work comparing primary rod-length in KCL and “scramble-MO” injected larvae (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, using other MOs (at the same concentration) targeting endodermal genes we did not find skeletal defects underlining the specificity of skeletal deformations in our <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic> morphants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is the use of DIDS.

There are two main purposes why we used DIDS in addition to our specific knock-down of <italic>Slc4a10</italic>. First, this inhibitor has been used in studies addressing the formation of the larval sea urchin skeleton (Yasumasu et al. 1986 Exp Cell Res 159:80-90). These studies demonstrated skeletal deformations and the authors concluded the involvement of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport in the biomineralization process with the underlying mechanisms remaining unresolved. In this way the present work helps demonstrating that DIDS affects pHi regulatory abilities that are likely responsible for skeletal defects in the sea urchin larva. Second, based on our previous studies demonstrating that pH regulation in PMCs is HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> dependent, we used DIDS to provide a complete chain of evidences (Na+, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> manipulations, pharmacology and morpholino knock-down of <italic>SpSlc4a10</italic>) demonstrating the importance of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport in pHi regulation.</p><p>In addition we added a paragraph discussing potential off-target effects of DIDS mentioned by reviewer #1: “These reductions in calcification rates are accompanied by decreased pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory abilities under DIDS treatment. […] Accordingly, it remains unresolved whether decreased pH<sub>i</sub> regulatory abilities under DIDS treatment can be attributed to an inhibition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or H<sup>+</sup> transport.”</p><p>In our controls we always added the vehicle (DMSO) at the same concentration as in the ones with DIDS. We have this information in the Materials and methods section as well as in the respective figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unless these issues are resolved, I will not provide further feedback about the experiments or conclusions.
