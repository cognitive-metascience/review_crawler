caused by the abnormal processing of somatosensory input. Synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn plays a key role in that processing. Mechanical allodynia – the misperception of light touch as painful – occurs when inhibition is compromised. Disinhibition is due primarily to chloride dysregulation caused by hypofunction of the potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2. Here we show, in rats, that excitatory neurons are disproportionately affected. This is not because chloride is differentially dysregulated in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but, rather, because excitatory neurons rely more heavily on inhibition to counterbalance strong excitation. Receptive fields in both cell types have a center-surround organization but disinhibition unmasks more excitatory input to excitatory neurons. Differences in intrinsic excitability also affect how chloride dysregulation affects spiking. These results deepen understanding of how excitation and inhibition are normally balanced in the spinal dorsal horn, and how their imbalance disrupts somatosensory processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>allodynia</kwd><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>disinhibition</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>KCC2</kwd><kwd>spatial summation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-153161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prescott</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The flow of somatosensory information through the spinal dorsal horn is regulated by synaptic inhibition, which acts upon excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, but the former are especially prone to disinhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropathic pain results from damage to or dysfunction of the nervous system. It affects ~10% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Hecke et al., 2014</xref>) and is notoriously difficult to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woolf, 2010</xref>). Hypersensitivity to tactile stimulation is a troubling feature of such pain. This so-called mechanical allodynia can be acutely reproduced by blocking synaptic inhibition at the spinal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miraucourt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sivilotti and Woolf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sorkin and Puig, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sorkin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yaksh, 1989</xref>). Numerous other studies have shown that synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn is reduced after nerve injury (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prescott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Price et al., 2009</xref>). Disinhibition can result from reduced activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> or glycine receptors, or from reduced current flow through activated receptors. The former has several possible causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeilhofer et al., 2012</xref>) but the latter stems uniquely from dysregulation of intracellular chloride due to KCC2 hypofunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coull et al., 2003</xref>). Enhancing KCC2 function reverses injury-induced allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gagnon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavertu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mapplebeck et al., 2019</xref>), thus demonstrating that chloride dysregulation contributes significantly to injury-induced disinhibition.</p><p>Knowing the molecular mechanism through which disinhibition occurs is important for devising therapeutic interventions, but the effects of disinhibition must also be considered at the circuit level to explain how sensory processing is disrupted (or conversely, to infer how disinhibition arises based on observable/reportable sensory changes that reflect circuit function). Indeed, selective disinhibition of inhibitory or excitatory dorsal horn neurons would likely yield opposite effects. Chloride dysregulation has been shown to occur in dorsal horn neurons with different spiking patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coull et al., 2003</xref>), but circuit operation (and sensory processing) depends on how much inhibition each cell type normally experiences and how much is lost under pathological conditions.</p><p>Disinhibition is known to unmask low-threshold input to projection neurons that normally respond exclusively to noxious input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavertu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miraucourt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miraucourt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torsney and MacDermott, 2006</xref>). Low-threshold input is conveyed polysynaptically to projection neurons via excitatory interneurons (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peirs and Seal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prescott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takazawa and MacDermott, 2010b</xref>). The disproportionate effect of disinhibition on low-threshold input (resulting in allodynia) suggests that excitatory interneurons are disinhibited; greater effects on noxious input (resulting in hyperalgesia) would be expected if disinhibition occurred selectively in projection neurons, that is after the convergence of low- and high-threshold inputs. Separate work indicates that excitatory interneurons are necessary for mechanical allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malmberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibitory neurons also receive inhibitory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takazawa and MacDermott, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>), and could, therefore, also become disinhibited, but whether the resultant increase in GABAergic/glycinergic transmission enhances inhibition depends on the degree of chloride dysregulation in postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prescott et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, despite many advances, many questions remain about the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input to different dorsal horn neurons and how this E-I balance becomes pathologically altered.</p><p>Beyond ‘gating’ sensory input in the spinal dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melzack and Wall, 1965</xref>), synaptic inhibition plays an important role in organizing receptive fields (RFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>). As originally described in retinal cells by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuffler (1953)</xref>, many neurons have an RF with an excitatory center and inhibitory surround. This includes dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hillman and Wall, 1969</xref>). A center-surround organization has important implications for sensory processing and for how that processing is disrupted by disinhibition. Notwithstanding other explanations, reduced two-point discrimination in patients with neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pleger et al., 2006</xref>) is consistent with increased RF overlap that could occur if surround inhibition is lost and RFs expand. Animal studies have demonstrated that RFs expand after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behbehani and Dollberg-Stolik, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cumberbatch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devor and Wall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tabo et al., 1999</xref>). This will affect the spatial summation of diffuse (broadly distributed) stimuli – moreso than for punctate (spatially restricted) stimuli – and is liable to affect dynamic mechanical allodynia, which is commonly provoked by clothes touching the skin.</p><p>The present study began with an exploration of how chloride dysregulation affects the RFs of superficial dorsal horn neurons. To this end, we blocked spinal KCC2 in vivo while monitoring the responses of neurons to tactile stimulation of the hind paw. Beyond RFs expanding, we found that unmasked excitatory input from the original RF surround became the predominant source of excitation. In vivo recordings also revealed two distinct cell types: units identified by their adapting spike pattern during tactile stimulation correspond to excitatory neurons whereas non-adapting units correspond to inhibitory neurons. In vitro patch clamp recordings showed that chloride regulation did not differ between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and in vivo application of BDNF verified that both cell types experience chloride dysregulation under pathological conditions. That said, adapting and non-adapting cells responded differently to equivalent chloride dysregulation in part because of differences in intrinsic properties and in part because of differences in E-I balance at the circuit level. Most notably, inhibitory neurons were found to receive weak excitation counterbalanced by weak inhibition, whereas excitatory neurons receive strong excitation counterbalanced by strong inhibition. Because excitatory neurons rely more heavily on inhibition, they are disproportionately affected by disinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disinhibition causes cutaneous receptive fields to expand</title><p>For a RF with center-surround organization, disinhibition is expected to expand the RF by unmasking excitatory input originating from the surround (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This will enhance spatial summation, which is critical for diffuse stimuli – like the rubbing of clothes – that typically provoke dynamic allodynia. Compared with the punctate allodynia evoked by stimuli like von Frey hairs, dynamic allodynia is more troubling for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansson, 2003</xref>). Dorsal horn neuron RFs have been reported to change on a short timescale (minutes), consistent with an RF shaped by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory input rather than being ‘hard wired’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cook et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubuisson et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laird and Cervero, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McMahon and Wall, 1984</xref>). We therefore set out to determine how the RF size of spinal lamina I-II neurons depends on chloride regulation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disinhibition causes receptive fields to expand.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicts how narrowly tuned excitation combined with broadly tuned inhibition produces a receptive field (RF) with an excitatory center and inhibitory surround.

KCC2 blockade had a significant effect on brush-evoked firing (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,62</sub> = 17.78, p&lt;0.001, two-way repeated measures ANOVA). Results of Wilcoxon tests are reported on graphs. Firing rates were stably elevated for at least 20 min, thus allowing for other effects of disinhibition (e.g. on RF size) to be measured.

The RF measured under normal (baseline) conditions was labeled the RF <italic>center</italic>; by definition, areas outside the RF center evoked negligible spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> left). After blockade of KCC2 by intrathecal DIOA, stimulation in the RF center evoked larger responses and stimulation outside the RF center evoked vigorous spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right). The RF was re-mapped and the additional area was labeled the RF <italic>surround</italic>. KCC2 blockade significantly increased firing evoked by stimulation in the RF center or surround (<italic>Z</italic> = 4.79, p&lt;0.001 and <italic>Z</italic> = 4.72, p&lt;0.001 respectively; Wilcoxon tests) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Firing rate histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> include all spikes but the spontaneous firing rate preceding each stimulus was subtracted from firing during stimulation to focus on evoked firing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>.</p><p>Next, we compared the enhanced excitatory drive from the RF center with the unmasked excitatory drive from the RF surround by plotting the average area for each RF zone against the average firing rate evoked by stimulation in that zone. This defines a rectangle whose area is proportional to the total excitatory drive contributed by that RF zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By multiplying the area of each RF zone with the corresponding firing rate for each unit (i.e. calculating the area of the aforementioned rectangle on a cell-by-cell basis), we found that KCC2 blockade significantly increased drive from both the RF center and surround (<italic>Q</italic><sub>21</sub> = 3.60, p=0.015 and <italic>Q</italic><sub>21</sub> = 18.54, p&lt;0.001, respectively; post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls [SNK] tests). Excitatory drive from the RF surround was (by definition) significantly less than from the RF center under baseline conditions (<italic>Q</italic><sub>21</sub> = 5.91, p&lt;0.001), but the inverse was true after disinhibition (<italic>Q</italic><sub>21</sub> = 3.42, p=0.022) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Hence, after disinhibition caused by KCC2 blockade, neurons were driven more strongly by unmasked excitatory input from the RF surround than by enhanced input from the RF center.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Units recorded in vivo comprise two distinct groups</title><p>Over the course of these experiments we noticed that some units had a monophasic spike waveform whereas others had a biphasic waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The former exhibited spike rate adaptation during sustained tactile stimulation with a von Frey (VF) filament whereas the latter did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The adaptation time constant measured from exponential-rise-to-maximum fits of the cumulative probability distribution of spike times from each unit differed significantly between units classified by their spike waveform (<italic>T</italic><sub>23</sub> = 8.58, p&lt;0.001; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> inset). The difference in adaptation argues that units with distinct spike waveforms represent distinct cell types rather than, for example, somatic and axonal recording from the same population of neurons. The two cell types are henceforth referred to as <italic>adapting</italic> and <italic>non-adapting</italic>. In subsequent experiments, we found that approximately 80% of units responsive to light tactile stimulation could be readily classified by their adaptation pattern; unclassified units were excluded from subsequent analysis.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Units recorded in vivo can be divided into two groups.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spike waveforms were separated according to their monophasic (blue) or biphasic (red) shape.

The number of pairs is reported on each panel. Primary afferents were classified as rapid-adapting (RA, left) or slow-adapting (SA, right); rasters show sample responses to 1 s-long 10 g von Frey stimulation (top). Adapting units displayed an increased probability of spiking after RA spikes (top left) but not after SA spikes (top right) whereas non-adapting units displayed a large increase in spike probability after SA spikes (bottom right) and a modest increase after RA spikes (bottom left). In other words, adapting units receive input exclusively from RA afferents whereas non-adapting units receive input preferentially from SA afferents.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata1"><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Numerical values for data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-49753-fig2-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49753-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Analysis of additional response properties support the classification based on adaptation pattern.

Mechanosensitive afferents were subdivided into rapid-adapting (RA) and slow-adapting (SA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</xref>). We calculated cross-correlograms by measuring the probability of a spinal unit firing at different times relative to each spike in a simultaneously recorded primary afferent with overlapping RF. According to this analysis, adapting units receive tactile input exclusively from RA afferents whereas non-adapting units receive tactile input preferentially from SA afferents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Differences in adaptation during evoked firing may be due to differences in primary afferent input and feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), but differences in spontaneous spiking (see ) suggest that adapting and non-adapting spinal units also differ in their intrinsic excitability. Indeed, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> may reflect differential responsivity of spinal units rather than differential connectivity per se: Neurons operating as coincidence detectors respond preferentially to synchronous inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ratté et al., 2013</xref>) that are likely to arise from RA afferents whose spikes occur synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lankarany et al., 2019</xref>), whereas neurons operating as integrators also respond to asynchronous inputs that are likely to arise from SA afferents whose spikes occur asynchronously. Natural tactile stimuli will co-activate both types of spinal neurons, but may do so in different proportions depending on stimulus characteristics. Recent efforts using optogenetics to identify which type of low-threshold mechanoreceptors mediate allodynia after nerve injury are interesting in this regard: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhandapani et al. (2018)</xref> showed that activating TrkB-ChR2-positive neurons – which include D-hair (Aδ) and RA afferents – provokes allodynia whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamessian et al. (2019)</xref> showed that activating Vglut1-ChR2-positive neurons – which include RA and SA afferents – does not. The discrepancy suggests that activation of RA <italic>but not</italic> SA afferents produces allodynia, which implies that spinal circuits implement a NIMPLY logic gate. This is consistent with our data and supports combinatorial coding over labeled lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prescott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prescott and Ratté, 2012</xref>).

We identified an additional 27 units that responded to tactile stimulation only after KCC2 blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> right). These units presumably receive low-threshold input via polysynaptic pathways normally blocked by inhibition.

Rather than compare nerve-injured and control animals, in which other changes induced by nerve injury might compromise our classification scheme, we compared responses for each unit before and after intrathecal BDNF, and re-tested again after applying acetazolamide (ACTZ), which selectively reverses effects of chloride dysregulation by reducing bicarbonate efflux through GABA<sub>A</sub>/glycine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Prescott, 2015</xref>).

The RF (black) is defined by the summation of spatially distributed excitatory (purple) and inhibitory (gray) input; RF size is highlighted by black arrows while net excitatory drive is proportional to the area of the black region. However, this version of the model incorrectly predicts that disinhibition (<bold>i</bold>) increases drive from the RF center more in adapting units than in non-adapting units (green arrows) and (ii) causes a greater increase in drive from the RF center than from the RF surround (see D). (<bold>D</bold>) The two discrepancies identified in C were resolved through changes to the spatial distribution of excitatory input.

The RF at baseline is shown in black; after disinhibition, the RF expands to fill the area under the purple curve. This simple model predicts that adapting units receive more inhibition in the RF center than do inhibitory neurons. To test this, we compared the firing rate evoked by brush stimulation in the RF center before and after KCC2 blockade or BDNF application (using data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>, respectively).

These results argue that both cell types experience a similar enhancement of input from the RF center following disinhibition, contrary to what our model predicted. Contrary to data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, this model also predicted that disinhibition unmasks greater excitation from the RF center than from the RF surround. We therefore asked if and how our initial model could be revised to resolve these discrepancies. Adding a broad component to the excitatory RF for both cell types and slightly narrowing the original excitatory RF for adapting units was sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, this revised model correctly predicts that increased input from the RF surround relative to increased input from the RF center is about twice as large for adapting units than for non-adapting units. The broadly tuned excitatory input whose inclusion improved upon the original model may reflect the ungating of polysynaptic circuits, but this and other aspects of the model require additional testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Chloride dysregulation has emerged as an important mechanism by which synaptic inhibition can be compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyon et al., 2016</xref>). It is now well established in dorsal horn neurons that intracellular chloride levels become elevated after nerve injury, that disrupting chloride regulation (e.g. by KCC2 blockade) produces mechanical allodynia, and that restoring chloride regulation reverses the mechanical allodynia caused by nerve injury (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prescott, 2015</xref>). Recent work has verified that these findings apply equally to male and female rodents despite sex-differences in neuroimmune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mapplebeck et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies have revealed the diversity of cells types in the dorsal horn and how they connect to form circuits (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peirs and Seal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Todd, 2017</xref>). But many unknowns remain; for instance, without knowing which cell types experience chloride dysregulation and how their spiking is affected, one cannot predict how chloride dysregulation affects circuit function or, in turn, how altered circuit function produces allodynia. Though informative, manipulations targeting a specific cell type fail to address how changes occurring concurrently in different cell types interact at the circuit level. Moreover, the concept of gating, though invaluable in guiding pain research for over 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melzack and Wall, 1965</xref>), is too simplistic to account for complex sensory changes. More detailed investigation of phenomena like spatial and temporal summation is imperative (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fitzgerald and Jennings, 1999</xref>), hence the impetus for the current study and its focus on RF structure.</p><p>Our results show that dorsal horn neuron RFs are dramatically enlarged by disinhibition, so much so that after KCC2 blockade, neurons receive more excitatory input from the RF surround than they receive from the RF center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Though not an initial goal of our study, we were able to separate the majority (~80%) of the units recorded in vivo into two groups that were readily distinguished by their spiking response to tactile stimulation, though several additional features (spike waveform, spontaneous spiking, etc.) also differed between the groups. Pharmacological testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as well as the concordance between in vitro and in vivo testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) argue that adapting and non-adapting units correspond to excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively. Both cell types experience chloride dysregulation under pathological conditions, modeled here with BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but certain effects manifest differently.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effects of disinhibition on spontaneous spiking</title><p>KCC2 blockade (as well as BDNF and SST) increased spontaneous spiking selectively in inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) whereas none of those manipulation, nor DHPG, caused spontaneously spiking in excitatory neurons. Differential modulation of spontaneous spiking was reproduced qualitatively in vitro using dynamic clamp, where virtual disinhibition increased the firing rate gain of both cell types but increased spontaneous spiking (reflected in the <italic>y</italic>-intercept) selectively in inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Differences in intrinsic excitability likely explain the differential effects. First, because of voltage-gated currents, subthreshold depolarization is actively amplified and drives repetitive spiking in tonic-spiking inhibitory neurons but is actively attenuated and fails to drive repetitive spiking in single- and delayed-spiking excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prescott and De Koninck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ratté et al., 2014</xref>). Second, inhibitory neurons are subject to strong tonic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gradwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takazawa and MacDermott, 2010a</xref>). Glycine receptor blockade did not increase spontaneous spiking in inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) but a strong tonic chloride conductance would make the resting membrane potential of inhibitory neurons very sensitive to KCC2 blockade. Alone or together, these factors render inhibitory neurons prone to spontaneous spiking when chloride is dysregulated.</p><p>Excitatory neurons did not spike spontaneously under normal conditions, and so the absence of (increased) spontaneous spiking after KCC2 blockade might be ascribed to a floor effect. However, excitatory neurons responded vigorously to weak tactile stimulation, which means that they do not operate far from spike threshold, contrary to what a floor effect would imply. Moreover, if non-adapting units are indeed inhibitory neurons, the continued lack of spontaneous firing in adapting units after KCC2 blockade argues that GABA/glycinergic transmission does not become paradoxically excitatory, which is consistent with past computational work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prescott et al., 2006</xref>) and with past experiments showing that only a small minority of neurons ever exhibit GABA-evoked spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coull et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of disinhibition on evoked spiking</title><p>The effect of chloride dysregulation on evoked spiking is more difficult to interpret because of the many additional factors involved, including the type of primary afferent input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and the relative strength of excitation and inhibition triggered by that input, which depends on the circuit. Intrinsic neuronal excitability, reflected in the spiking response to somatic current injection, has also been shown to influence the response to cutaneous stimulation or an in vitro facsimile thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2007</xref>). At the circuit level, E-I balance depends on where the stimulus occurs relative to the neuron’s RF, which changes over time as a dynamic stimulus moves across an RF. The spatiotemporal characteristics of natural tactile stimuli are not readily reproduced with electrical or optogenetic stimulation. By stimulating different parts of the RF alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), our results demonstrate that spatial summation is altered by chloride dysregulation. The consequences of this for sensory processing will depend on the spatial extent of the stimulus on the skin.</p><p>A stimulus that extends beyond the RF center and into the RF surround normally engages surround inhibition, causing fewer spikes than if the stimulus was restricted to the RF center. This runs counter to intuition that a broader stimulus will cause greater spatial summation and elicit a bigger response, but it is entirely consistent with experiments in the visual system showing that broader stimuli evoke greater inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vinje and Gallant, 2002</xref>). However, when disinhibition occurs, not only is the surround inhibition lost, so too is subliminal excitatory input unmasked. This means that a stimulus extending into the RF surround will engage more total excitation (and drive stronger spiking) than a stimulus limited to the RF center. Furthermore, beyond one neuron being more strongly activated, more neurons will be activated as their expanded RFs encroach on the area of stimulation. For a projection neuron receiving convergent input from excitatory interneurons, these effects of disinhibition compound – more input from each excitatory interneuron and input from more excitatory interneurons – plus reduced inhibition to the projection neuron itself.</p><p>Dynamic allodynia provoked by light brushing of the skin is a far greater clinical problem than the allodynia provoked by punctate stimuli or pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansson, 2003</xref>). In individuals with neuropathic pain, dynamic allodynia is commonly provoked by clothes moving against the skin, which is precisely the sort of stimulus for which spatial summation is important. That said, preclinical testing of mechanosensitivity relies almost exclusively on von Frey stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mogil, 2009</xref>). Moreover, different forms of mechanical allodynia subserved by different primary afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koltzenburg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ochoa and Yarnitsky, 1993</xref>) and differences in central processing have also been uncovered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al. (2017)</xref> recently found that dynamic allodynia required a set of neurons defined by the co-expression of VGLUT3 and Lbx1, whereas hypersensitivity to von Frey stimulation persisted after those neurons were ablated. Having tested with both brush and von Frey stimuli, our results show that disinhibition caused by chloride dysregulation affects responses to both types of stimuli, which is consistent with most (if not all) neurons being under inhibitory control. Additional work, including behavioral testing, is required to assess how changes in spatial summation due to chloride dysregulation contributes to allodynia. Human psychophysical testing that extends beyond the standard battery of quantitative sensory tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sommer, 2016</xref>) would also be informative. It should be mentioned here that nerve injury or other insults leading to neuropathic pain cause changes beyond chloride dysregulation in spinal neurons, and that the chloride dysregulation triggered by nerve injury may be more modest than modeled here by KCC2 blockade or intrathecal BDNF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effects of disinhibition on E-I balance</title><p>By co-stimulating the RF center and surround and comparing the evoked response with responses to stimulation of the RF center alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), our study also revealed that E-I balance differs between putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Specifically, we found that excitatory neurons receive strong excitation that is counterbalanced by strong inhibition, whereas inhibitory neurons receive weak excitation that is counterbalanced by weak inhibition. In other words, both cell types appear to receive similar relative levels of excitatory and inhibitory input, but the absolute levels of each input are greater in excitatory neurons. Because excitatory neurons rely on strong inhibition to counterbalance their strong excitatory input, they are more affected than inhibitory neurons by a loss of inhibition. This observation could not have been made through targeted manipulations (e.g. ablation) of a specific cell type, as is now common in many studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). That said, our results are fully consistent with excitatory interneurons playing a critical in allodynia. Consistent with earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torsney and MacDermott, 2006</xref>), our results argue that disinhibition of those excitatory neurons is key.</p><p>The disproportionate disinhibition of excitatory neurons is interesting for two reasons. First, the differential effect is due to circuit organization, that is the amount of excitatory and inhibitory input received by each cell type. Indeed, we did not observe any difference in chloride regulation between cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, sensory processing might not be disrupted if the evoked responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons were equivalently affected by disinhibition. That said, the disproportionate disinhibition of excitatory neurons is liable to be less evident (or consequential) with punctate stimulation, for which spatial summation is minimal. In contrast to the changes in evoked firing, changes in spontaneous firing may indicate that inhibitory neurons experience stronger tonic inhibition and are disproportionately disinhibited in the absence of stimulation. This may be important for understanding spontaneous pain.</p><p>In summary, this study has explored the consequences of chloride dysregulation in superficial dorsal horn neurons. Our results show that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons experience chloride dysregulation but respond differently because of differences in their intrinsic excitability and because of circuit-level differences in E-I balance. Additionally, we demonstrated that dorsal horn neuron RFs have a center-surround organization, and that loss of surround inhibition unmasks substantial excitatory drive, especially in excitatory neurons. Loss of surround inhibition and the unmasking of subliminal excitatory input dramatically alters spatial summation, which may contribute significantly to dynamic allodynia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Hospital for Sick Children and were performed in accordance to guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Briefly, the rat (100–200 g) was anesthetized with 4% isoflorane and perfused intracardially with ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) sucrose-substituted artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 252 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 5 kynurenic acid; pH 7.35. The rat was decapitated, the spinal cord was removed by hydraulic extrusion, and 300–400 μm-thick sections were cut from the lumbar enlargement in the parasagittal plane. Slices were kept in normal oxygenated ACSF (126 mM NaCl instead of sucrose and without kynurenic acid) at room temperature until recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings</title><p>Slices were transferred to a recording chamber constantly perfused at ~2 ml/min with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) ACSF. Visually identified neurons in lamina I and II were patched in the whole cell configuration with &gt;70% series resistance compensation using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI) and were filled with one of two intracellular solutions. For dynamic clamp experiments, the solution comprised (in mM): 125 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, 0.4 GTP as well as 0.1% Lucifer Yellow; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. For chloride extrusion measurements, KCl was increased to 25 mM and KMeSO<sub>4</sub> was reduced to 115 mM. Recordings were at room temperature (22–26°C). Traces were low-pass filtered at 2 KHz, digitized at 20 KHz using a CED 1401 computer interface (Cambridge Electronic Design), and analyzed offline. Membrane potential (after correction for the liquid junction potential) was adjusted to −65 mV through tonic current injection. Based on responses to series of 500 ms-long current steps, spiking patterns were classified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prescott and De Koninck, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Chloride extrusion measurements</title><p>Spiking pattern was determined in current clamp mode immediately after rupturing the membrane.

After allowing at least 15 min for the chloride from the pipette solution to dialyze, the cell was voltage clamped at different holding potentials while short (5–10 ms-long) puffs of GABA (1 mM prepared in HEPES-buffered pipette solution) were applied ~5 μm from the soma using a puff pipette (5 MΩ resistance) attached to a picospritzer (Toohey Company, Fairfield, NJ).

An appropriate non-parametric test was applied when the normality (Shapiro-Wilk) test failed. Paired tests were used in all cases where responses from the same cell were measured before and after a manipulation. Unpaired tests were used for between-group comparisons. All tests were two-sided. Once a recorded neuron was classified based on its spiking pattern (see Results) and was included or excluded on the basis of that pattern, no data were excluded for any other reason. Sample sizes are evident on the figures, which show data from individual cells, and from the degrees of freedom reported with statistical tests. Sample sizes were not computed because we did not have any prior knowledge of the expected effect size or variance; instead, experiments were continued until we collected &gt;<italic>n</italic> cells of each type for each experiment, where <italic>n</italic> = 5 for in vitro experiments and <italic>n</italic> = 10 for in vivo experiments (because variability is typically greater in vivo). The only exception is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, where data collected for analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were re-analyzed after classification described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The total number or type of cells recorded from each rat is unpredictable, but cells comprising each data set come from ≥5 rats in all cases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Y De Koninck and MW Salter for their feedback on an early version of this manuscript.

your article &quot;Excitatory neurons are more disinhibited than inhibitory neurons by chloride dysregulation in the spinal dorsal horn&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Claire Wyart as a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Qiufu Ma (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study by Lee et al. explores how KCC2-mediated chloride dysregulation impacts on putative spinal excitatory neurons (ENs) and inhibitory neurons (INs) located in the dorsal horn, whose identification was based on differential adaption patterns and distinct firing patterns. In depth analysis on how dysfunction of this chloride transporter alters neuronal activity will contribute for a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms behind neuropathic pain. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro recordings the authors conclude block of KCC2 function has significantly larger effect in excitatory neurons than in inhibitory ones. The authors show first that ENs and INs showed circuit-level difference in E-I balance, with ENs showing stronger excitatory inputs balanced with stronger inhibition, and INs showing weaker excitation balanced with weaker inhibition; as such, disinhibition following KCC2 inhibition leads to larger unmasked excitation in ENs. They also revealed that both ENs and INs show center excitation-surround inhibition, and KCC2 inhibition leads to the recruitment of surround excitatory inputs, which is particularly prominent for ENs; as such, KCC2-mediated chloride dysregulation could lead to a form of spatial summation and subsequent manifestation of dynamic allodynia in response to tactile stimuli across a large skin area.</p><p>The question addressed is relevant and the work performed is of high quality. Although the findings are interesting, several important issues need to be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 4 it would be important to investigate if the δ increase in the slope by KCC2 block is different between adapting and non-adapting neurons. In the dynamic clamp experiment, the increase in slope between excitatory in inhibitory neurons was qualitatively replicated but quantitatively it looks likes that the increase in slope was smaller in the dynamic clamp experiment for inhibitory neurons than the one obtained in vivo with KCC2 block. If this is true it needs to be reported and discussed by the authors.</p><p>Furthermore, the differential inputs to ENs and INs by rapid-adapting (RA) and slow-adapting (SA) afferents are interesting, and the authors should provide some discussion based on current knowledge of the roles of these afferents in mediating allodynia.</p><p>2) Why there is no effect of DHPG in spontaneous firing of adapting cells? Could this be due to the relatively low firing rate of this cells (floor effect)? This is important since it could help understanding why KCC2 block did not impact spontaneous firing on excitatory cells.</p><p>3) Why did the authors use a shift in the anion reversal potential from -70 mV to -45mV when the experiment reported in Figure 5 suggest a significantly smaller shift? This needs to be justified/discussed.</p><p>4) In the dynamic clamp the difference in spontaneous firing between excitatory and inhibitory cells is relatively small compared to the KCC2 to the data. This needs to be commented.</p><p>5) The authors suggest that non-adapting cells receive less excitation as well as less inhibition than adapting neurons (according to the scheme in Figure 8C). However, in Figure 2 the RF area is different between adapting and non-adapting cells. Could this affect the interpretation of Figure 8B? Is it possible that more inhibition in present in the RF center in inhibitory neurons? What was the impact of KCC2 block in the firing of adapting and non-adapting neurons in the center of the RF?</p><p>6) The impact of chloride dysregulation on putative ENs and INs was revealed via intrathecal delivery of KCC2 inhibitors or BDNF. While such manipulations allowed the investigators to record the same neurons before and after treatments, they were unable to reveal potential differential KCC2-mediated chloride dysregulation in ENs versus INs that naturally occurred following nerve injury (e.g., only a subset of ENs neurons might have chloride dysregulation). The authors need to point out this caveat in the Discussion.</p><p>7) SST has been reported to cause inhibition via activation of sst<sub>2a</sub> in dynorphin+ inhibitory neurons, which in turn leads to sensitisation of itch transmission ENs. Surprisingly, the authors claimed an activation by SST in non-adapting neurons, which were considered as INs in this study. Further clarification is needed.</p><p>8) There are reported conflicts regarding the behavioural outcomes following intrathecal injection of BDNF; the authors mentioned allodynia development in a separate submitted manuscript. During revision and in responses to reviewers' comments, the authors should present the behavioural data in their response to reviewers, particularly the dynamic allodynia that is more relevant for this study, to help to understand the BDNF data described in current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49753.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 4 it would be important to investigate if the δ increase in the slope by KCC2 block is different between adapting and non-adapting neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>For in vivo data in Figure 4B, we now report in the figure legend that the effect of KCC2 blockade does not depend on cell type (i.e. the interaction is not significant; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,31</sub> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.71) but we acknowledge that larger changes were observed amongst adapting units.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the dynamic clamp experiment, the increase in slope between excitatory in inhibitory neurons was qualitatively replicated but quantitatively it looks likes that the increase in slope was smaller in the dynamic clamp experiment for inhibitory neurons than the one obtained in vivo with KCC2 block.

We explain that the operating mode – coincidence detection vs. integration – may play an important role in dictating how different spinal neurons respond to afferent input. Our results suggest that sustained pressure will engage more inhibition than dynamic touch, which is consistent with gate control theory – you apply pressure rather than tickle a sore area to reduce pain. Our results also relate to efforts to identify which afferent type is sufficient to mediate mechanical allodynia by expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in specific cell types and then selectively photoactivating those cells after nerve injury. The discrepancy between recently published studies suggests that activation of RA <underline>but not</underline> SA afferents causes allodynia, which would correspond to downstream spinal circuits implementing an NIMPLY logic gate, consistent with our results. This new discussion is included in the aforementioned subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why there is no effect of DHPG in spontaneous firing of adapting cells? Could this be due to the relatively low firing rate of this cells (floor effect)? This is important since it could help understanding why KCC2 block did not impact spontaneous firing on excitatory cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We now point out that DHPG does not affect spontaneous spiking (subsection “Adapting and non-adapting units correspond to excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively”, second paragraph) and direct readers to the Discussion, where spontaneous spiking and its modulation are discussed at some length (see section entitled “Effects of disinhibition on spontaneous spiking”). We now mention that DHPG did not cause spontaneous firing in excitatory neurons.</p><p>We believe that the lack of effect reflects the tendency of adapting units not to spike spontaneously (i.e. in response to slow onset, sustained depolarization) because of their intrinsic excitability rather than a floor effect (see subsection “Effects of disinhibition on spontaneous spiking”, last paragraph). Our Discussion explains that compared with non-adapting units, adapting units do not spike spontaneously after KCC2 blockade, DHPG, or BDNF, despite exhibiting increased evoked spiking under each of those conditions. In our experience with dorsal horn neuron recordings in vitro, tonic-spiking (inhibitory) neurons spike spontaneously if modestly depolarized whereas single- or delayed-spiking (excitatory) neurons do not. Tonic inhibition may also play a role. We believe that our existing discussion does a good job in summarizing and interpreting the spontaneous activity (or lack thereof) under various conditions; directing readers to this discussion when presenting the DHPG data will, we hope, address the reviewers’ concerns and help readers interpret our results.</p><p>It is also worth considering that Hu and Gereau, 2011, showed that mGluR5 activation decreases the A-type K current. Because this current activates during abrupt depolarization (as during AMPA receptor-mediated excitation) but inactivates during slow depolarization, the A current preferentially reduces evoked spiking and its downregulation should, therefore, preferentially enhance evoked spiking. This is consistent with more recent work by Zhang et al., 2018, which is now mentioned in the subsection “Adapting and non-adapting units correspond to excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why did the authors use a shift in the anion reversal potential from -70 mV to -45mV when the experiment reported in Figure 5 suggest a significantly smaller shift? This needs to be justified/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments in Figure 5 were designed to sensitively measure differences in chloride extrusion capacity, not the natural value of <italic>E</italic><sub>inh</sub>. This is now explained in the figure legend. Applying a high chloride load via the patch pipette reveals how well KCC2 can counteract a chloride load, but that maneuver deliberately disrupts <italic>E</italic><sub>inh</sub>. Indeed, one tries to “clamp” intracellular chloride concentration and determine how much the measured value of <italic>E</italic><sub>inh</sub> deviates from the predicted value because of KCC2-mediated chloride extrusion. Please see Doyon et al., 2016, for a complete explanation. With KCC2 intact, the chloride load causes an <underline>in</underline>complete collapse of the chloride gradient, hence the relatively small change in <italic>E</italic><sub>inh</sub> pre- vs. post-blockade of KCC2.</p><p>For our dynamic clamp experiments, we used published values of <italic>E</italic><sub>inh</sub> measured by perforated patch (Coull et al., 2003). As now explained in the subsection “Excitatory and inhibitory neurons are differentially affected by equivalent chloride dysregulation”, we used a value at the top of the published range for simulations since pharmacological blockade of KCC2 strongly reduces chloride extrusion capacity. We now also point out that nerve injury may cause subtler changes in <italic>E</italic><sub>inh</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the dynamic clamp the difference in spontaneous firing between excitatory and inhibitory cells is relatively small compared to the KCC2 to the data.

The basis for this difference is unclear but presumably reflects a failure to fully recapitulate in vivo conditions in our in vitro experiments. This is now explained in the last paragraph of the subsection “Excitatory and inhibitory neurons are differentially affected by equivalent chloride dysregulation” alongside changes made in response to comment #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest that non-adapting cells receive less excitation as well as less inhibition than adapting neurons (according to the scheme in Figure 8C). However, in Figure 2 the RF area is different between adapting and non-adapting cells. Could this affect the interpretation of Figure 8B?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important observation and prompted us to improve Figure 8C, and to evaluate it more carefully, leading to the addition of a new panel as Figure 8D (see our last response to point 5). The average RF of non-adapting units is about twice as large as the RF of adapting units at baseline (Figure 2C); The corresponding change in RF diameter is now depicted by the widths of the base of the RFs on the cartoon (see black arrows). The total drive is comparable for each cell type, which is depicted by the total area of the black region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible that more inhibition in present in the RF center in inhibitory neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>The model in Figure 8C actually predicts (see green arrows) that more inhibition is present in the RF center of excitatory neurons (adapting units). This is now described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Surround inhibition is greater, and disinhibition more consequential, for adapting units”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What was the impact of KCC2 block in the firing of adapting and non-adapting neurons in the center of the RF?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the prediction identified in (b) by analyzing the response to stimulation of the RF center before and after disinhibition by KCC2 blockade or BDNF. The results, now explained in the subsection “Surround inhibition is greater, and disinhibition more consequential, for adapting units”, revealed that adapting and non-adapting units experienced an equivalent increase in firing. This caused us to re-evaluate our initial model. Indeed, that model also predicted that disinhibition would cause a greater increase in drive from the RF center than from the RF surround, contrary to data presented in Figures 1E and 2D.</p><p>We therefore created a revised model, now shown as Figure 8D. In this version, the total drive at baseline is equivalent between adapting and non-adapting units, though the RF is wider for the latter, like in Figure 8C. The crosshatched and hatched areas show the disinhibition-mediated increase in drive from RF center and surround, respectively. The increase in drive from the RF center is equivalent between cell types, but increased drive from the RF surround relative to that from the RF center is about twice as large for adapting units, consistent with Figure 2D. The RF sizes after disinhibition are equal between adapting and non-adapting units, consistent with Figure 2C. The model also depicts the stronger excitatory and inhibitory input to adapting units, consistent with Figure 8B. Overall, we think our revised model does an excellent job accounting for several data sets and we thank the reviewers for posing incisive questions that led us to make these improvements. The improved model is now described in the text and figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The impact of chloride dysregulation on putative ENs and INs was revealed via intrathecal delivery of KCC2 inhibitors or BDNF.

Further clarification is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The preferential effect of SST on non-adapting neurons is consistent with our predictions but the directionality of the effect is opposite to expectations. Specifically, SST has been shown to hyperpolarize sst<sub>2a</sub>-expressing (dynorphin+) neurons whereas we observed an excitatory effect. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but as now discussed in the third paragraph of the subsection “Adapting and non-adapting units correspond to excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively”, the high dose of SST that we applied in vivo may cause receptor internalization, which could in turn reduce normal sst<sub>2a</sub> receptor signaling. Notably, Kardon et al., 2014, used octreotide rather than SST for in vivo experiments. It is also interesting that the effects of SST reported in early studies were quite variable, probably due to variations in the precise agonist and its concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There are reported conflicts regarding the behavioural outcomes following intrathecal injection of BDNF; the authors mentioned allodynia development in a separate submitted manuscript.

The citation has been updated to reflect the publication of this paper. The collaborator who conducted behavioral testing did not test dynamic allodynia. Indeed, those experiments were conducted prior to publication (Cheng et al., 2017) highlighting the importance of stimulus type. Repeating costly BDNF experiments with brush stimulation was not considered since the type of allodynia was not a focus of our Cell Reports paper.</p><p>We are unaware of conflicts regarding the behavioral outcomes of intrathecal BDNF. Several studies have shown that intrathecal BDNF reduces the paw withdrawal threshold (Coull et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2015; Geng et al., 2010; Richner et al., 2019). To our knowledge, the main controversy about BDNF relates to its natural source (microglia vs. primary afferent neurons), which is not critical for our study.
