To test the roles of responses to environmental cues and sexual behaviors in longevity regulation, we examined <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> male lifespan under solitary, grouped, and mated conditions. We find that neurons and the germline are required for male pheromone-dependent male death. Hermaphrodites with a masculinized nervous system secrete male pheromone and are susceptible to male pheromone killing. Male pheromone-mediated killing is unique to androdioecious <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>, and may reduce the number of males in hermaphroditic populations; neither males nor females of gonochoristic species are susceptible to male pheromone killing. By contrast, mating-induced death, which is characterized by germline-dependent shrinking, glycogen loss, and ectopic vitellogenin expression, utilizes distinct molecular pathways and is shared between the sexes and across species. The study of sex- and species-specific regulation of aging reveals deeply conserved mechanisms of longevity and population structure regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23493.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23493.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23493.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many animals, different sexes have different life expectancies. This holds true for a roundworm species called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that has commonly been used to study aging and lifespan. Unlike some related <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> roundworm species (which consist of male and female worms), <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms are predominantly hermaphrodites and reproduce by self-fertilization. <italic>C. elegans</italic> males are normally rare. However, under stressful conditions the number of males increases to reduce inbreeding and so help the worm population to adapt to the environment.</p><p>Investigations into the factors that affect the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> have mostly studied hermaphrodites. For example, one recent study showed that mating shortens the lifespan of hermaphrodites. Another study showed that pheromones – hormones that change the behavior of other worms – also shorten hermaphrodite lifespan. The male pheromone is produced by males and sensed by both males and hermaphrodites. But does mating and male pheromone affect the lifespan of male roundworms?</p><p>Shi et al. have now studied <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> worms of different species and sexes to investigate how sexual behaviors and male pheromone regulate the lifespan of male roundworms. The results of the experiments revealed two distinct mechanisms of male death. Firstly, mating caused the males of many different <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species to shrink and die, and also killed females and hermaphrodites. Secondly, the males of hermaphroditic species – and only these males – could also be killed by male pheromone.</p><p>The results suggest that death from mating may be an unavoidable cost of reproducing that is seen across all sexes and species of roundworm. In contrast, death by male pheromone may be a way of culling the male population in hermaphroditic species, for example, after stressful conditions have caused a sudden increase in the number of male worms.</p><p>Further work is now needed to investigate the finer details of the mechanisms by which mating and male pheromone cause death. Ultimately, this work in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> could be extended to help us to understand how other animals regulate their lifespan and maintain an optimum ratio of the sexes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23493.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23493.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>male</kwd><kwd>Caenorhabditis</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>mating</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1 GM119167-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Runnels</surname><given-names>Alexi M</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007388-39</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Runnels</surname><given-names>Alexi M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholars Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Coleen T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Male <italic>C. elegans</italic> die through two distinct mechanisms – mating-induced germline activation, and potent male pheromone toxicity – but the latter is unique to males of androdioecious species (made up of hermaphrodites and males).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Males and females differ in many aspects of biology, including longevity. Sex differences in lifespan are common in animals across great evolutionary distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austad and Fischer, 2016</xref>). For example, women live longer than men in almost every country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">WHO, 2016</xref>). Moreover, interventions in longevity also display sex-specific patterns in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austad and Fischer, 2016</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms of sex differences in longevity and responses to aging interventions, and the degree of evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms, are still largely unknown.</p><p>Interactions between the sexes influence an individual’s longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler and Partridge, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gems and Riddle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Partridge and Farquhar, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Voorhies, 1992</xref>). Sex-specific longevity patterns also exist in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>: males live significantly shorter when maintained in groups, whereas the longevity of hermaphrodites is not influenced by population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gems and Riddle, 2000</xref>). What causes this sex-specific longevity pattern remains mysterious. Although worm studies have contributed significantly to our general understanding of longevity mechanisms, how <italic>C. elegans</italic> male lifespan is regulated is poorly understood, because nearly all lifespan experiments are performed using only hermaphrodites. Analysis of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> males’ longevity not only allows us to test whether known longevity mechanisms are conserved between the sexes, but also provides an opportunity to reveal novel longevity mechanisms. The lifespan of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> females is shortened after mating through receipt of male sperm and seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), and separately by exposure to male pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maures et al., 2014</xref>). However, previous studies reported contradictory results on the influence of mating on male lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gems and Riddle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Voorhies, 1992</xref>). Thus, whether and how male lifespan is affected by prolonged exposure and interactions with females, as well as the effect of pheromone on male lifespan, is unknown.</p><p>In their natural environments, animals must not only find food, but also avoid competitors, identify appropriate partners, and mate; the effects of these behaviors on lifespan are not well understood. Some of these behaviors are mediated by ascaroside-based pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ludewig and Schroeder, 2013</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> females secrete pheromones that attract males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chasnov et al., 2007</xref>), while <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites modify their pheromone profile according to their sperm status, becoming more attractive to males once they have used up their own sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleemann and Basolo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morsci et al., 2011</xref>). Male ascaroside pheromones can directly affect the reproductive system of hermaphrodites, aiding recovery from heat stress and delaying the loss of hermaphrodite germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2016</xref>).</p><p>The diversity of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species allows us to evaluate male lifespan regulation from an evolutionary perspective. The <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus consists of both androdioecious (male and hermaphrodite) and gonochoristic (male and female) species. In androdioecious species such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the population is dominated by hermaphrodites, which reproduce by self-fertilization. Males are usually very rare (less than 0.2% for the standard lab strain N2) and are produced through spontaneous X chromosome nondisjunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chasnov and Chow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodgkin, 1983</xref>). Under stressful conditions, more oocytes undergo chromosome non-disjunction; thus androdioecious species may periodically experience male population explosions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chasnov and Chow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodgkin, 1983</xref>). The existence of males in androdioecious species reduces inbreeding and facilitates adaptation to changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, gonochoristic species such as <italic>C. remanei</italic> (50% male, 50% female) require mating for reproduction. How males in androdioecious and gonochoristic species cope with these different mating situations remains poorly understood. Moreover, the utility of killing females by exposure to male pheromone in gonochoristic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maures et al., 2014</xref>) is not obvious.</p><p>Here we have found that male-specific population density-dependent death in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is due to the perception of male pheromone as a toxin; that is, while male pheromone itself is not a general poison to all worms, its perception by <italic>C. elegans</italic> males leads to death and to male-specific reproductive decline. <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites, while still susceptible, are less sensitive to this toxic aspect of male pheromone. Masculinization of the hermaphrodite nervous system not only increases their sensitivity to male pheromone, but also is sufficient to induce male density-dependent death in these hermaphrodites, suggesting that neurons are key for the male pheromone killing mechanism. We found that the germline of the recipient male is also required for male pheromone-mediated death. This phenomenon is also present in two other independently-evolved androdioecious <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, suggesting a role for male pheromone killing of males in otherwise hermaphroditic species; by contrast, neither males nor females of three gonochoristic <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species succumb to male pheromone killing. Mating-dependent death and germline-dependent shrinking, by contrast, are shared between all sexes and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, suggesting deep conservation. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the shared vs. sex- and species-specific mechanisms that regulate lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Male-specific density-dependent lifespan decrease is largely due to male pheromone</title><p>When <italic>C. elegans</italic> males are housed together, they live shorter than solitary males, and the death rate increases with the number of males in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gems and Riddle, 2000</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> male lifespan is very sensitive to male density: just two males together significantly reduced each individual’s lifespan, and grouping eight males decreases lifespan by more than 35%, whereas the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites is not affected by population density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Mating induced ectopic expression of VIT-2::GFP in the anterior intestine of males, confirming our gene expression data.

Three main Gene Ontology groups emerged from these comparisons: innate immunity and defense responses, metal ion/cadmium response, and glycoprotein metabolism. Notably, this pattern of gene expression was very different from that of mated males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; Pearson correlation = −0.0594 for the whole transcriptome). Specifically, upregulation of vitellogenin genes was not a signature of male pheromone-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), also supporting the notion that the two pathways act through distinct molecular mechanisms. While fat is reduced in males after mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), MCP treatment caused no significant changes in fat metabolism gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or Oil Red O staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We showed previously that osmotic stress resistance correlates well with shrinking in mated hermaphrodites, whereas fat loss does not account for such shrinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>). Likewise, we found that mated wild-type worms lost about 30% of their glycogen stores post-mating in a germline-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The mating-induced glycogen storage decrease and subsequent shrinking is conserved between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), while glycogen stores are not affected by male pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Previously identified gene expression patterns of longevity pathways did not appear in our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tepper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakhina et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting a novel pathway for lifespan shortening in the presence of male pheromone.

In a fraction of Day four unmated solitary males, the transition zone (marked by crescent shaped nuclei) disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), and the meiotic region expanded to the distal arm, evidenced by the presence of sperm before U-shaped turn (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating the loss of mitotic proliferating cells in the germline. Shrinking of the transition zone was observed significantly less in mated animals, but no significant differences were apparent in MCP-treated males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that mating causes an increase in the number of mitotically proliferating cells, whereas an unknown signal from the germline, rather than an obvious morphological change, may be responsible for the lifespan shortening effects of male pheromone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Mating-induced male death is evolutionarily conserved and unavoidable</title><p>Previously, we found that <italic>C. remanei</italic> females, like <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites, shrink and die faster after mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), suggesting that these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved in females.

In order to better mimic conditions in which worms would be exposed to male pheromone their entire lives, we placed <italic>fog-2</italic> eggs on male pheromone conditioned plates, and measured developmental rates, lifespan, mating rates, and brood size.

Masculinization of neurons in hermaphrodites not only increases their sensitivity to male pheromone, but also is sufficient to induce the production of male-like toxic pheromone, suggesting that neurons play two major and distinct roles in this type of killing.

As we found previously for mated females and hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> males also experience germline-dependent shrinking, glycogen loss, and death after mating. Germline up-regulation also leads to ectopic expression of vitellogenins, which contributes to the post-mating lifespan decrease in males. Previously, these yolk protein precursors were only reported to be expressed in hermaphrodites, where vitellogenin proteins are taken up by oocytes; vitellogenin production in males does not have an obvious purpose. Mating also induces significant overexpression of <italic>vit</italic> genes in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DePina et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that vitellogenin expression is closely coupled with mating-induced germline up-regulation in both sexes. Such coupling may be strong enough to overcome the normal repression of male vitellogenin expression. Germline-dependent body shrinking, glycogen loss, and ectopic vitellogenin expression contribute to male post-mating death, which is conserved between the sexes. The striking similarity of germline-dependent post-mating changes in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> males and females suggests that this mechanism is largely conserved between sexes, and may represent an unavoidable cost of reproduction as a result of mating.</p><p>Germline-dependent lifespan shortening appears to be conserved across species over large evolutionary distances, as it occurs in all <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species we tested.

The preponderance of males in a 50:50 population, as in the case of <italic>C. remanei,</italic> makes the use of pheromone as a toxin less likely, as it would cause too much off-target death to be useful for sperm competition purposes. The toxic effect of pheromone may not be due to the pheromone itself, but rather to a perception of pheromone as a toxin, with a greater effect in males than in hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodite death at high male pheromone concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maures et al., 2014</xref>)—which might happen rarely in nature – might simply be collateral damage, as hermaphrodites are far less sensitive than males to male pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) toxin. The lack of significant changes observed in the developmental rates of either males or hermaphrodites, or on the brood size of hermaphrodites, indicates that the primary effect of male pheromone might be on male reproductive capacity.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species might utilize pheromones in such different ways due to their different modes of reproduction. Androdioecious species males do not appear to use pheromones efficiently as chemical messengers to facilitate mating, since they are less able to distinguish hermaphrodites’ pheromone from other species’ female or male pheromone; in fact, <italic>C. elegans</italic> males are slightly attracted to their own male pheromone, in part explaining their clumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chasnov et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), despite the fact that male pheromone is very toxic to <italic>C. elegans</italic> males. In the androdioecious species such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, males are normally rare (0.2%), so the chance that any worm he encounters will be an appropriate mating partner is very high; thus, there may be less selection pressure to evolve pheromones as chemical messengers to identify mates. By contrast, <italic>C. remanei</italic> uses pheromone to distinguish males from females, an important requirement for mating in 50:50 mixed populations. <italic>C.remanei</italic> males are slightly repelled by male pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chasnov et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), but are extremely attracted to <italic>C. remanei</italic> female pheromone, while <italic>C. remanei</italic>, as well as both males and females from other gonochoristic species, are immune to male pheromone toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Thus, gonochoristic species use pheromones primarily as chemical cues to identify mates, rather than to kill males.</p><p>The fact that male pheromone toxicity is present in three distantly-related and separately evolved hermaphroditic <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiontke et al., 2004;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>) suggests an important role for male pheromone killing. Periodic explosions of male populations in androdioecious species (e.g., under stressful conditions) allow outcrossing and ensure genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). After this beneficial period, however, males are more costly to maintain, and there may be pressure to return to a primarily hermaphroditic population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). It is notable that because <italic>C. elegans</italic> males are XO, rather than XY, males may have no selfish drive to maintain their own chromosomes. Using male pheromone as a dose-dependent toxin may be an effective way to cull the male population and ensure that the species returns to the self-reproduction mode when the stressful condition has passed, aiding the return to hermaphroditism. Because a high fraction of males can only be produced by mating (mating produces 50% males, while male production rates from hermaphroditic selfing is 0.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chasnov and Chow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodgkin, 1983</xref>]), the combination of decreased mating efficacy and decreased progeny production might be expected to specifically affect the number of males produced each generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Male pheromone alone could effectively drive the population back to a primarily hermaphroditic state after several generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Previous experiments showed that the average time for males to disappear in N2 strain is 12–20 days (i.e. 4–7 generations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wegewitz et al., 2008</xref>). The discrepancy between our modeling (~15 generations) and the previous experimental result may indicate that multiple factors, including increased hermaphroditic progeny production and decreased mating rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wegewitz et al., 2008</xref>), decreased copulation performance in aging males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>), and hermaphrodites’ response to males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleemann and Basolo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morsci et al., 2011</xref>]) could act in tandem with pheromone-dependent killing of males to cull the male population and thus promote a return to hermaphroditism. Male-specific culling occurs in species such as <italic>Drosophila bifasciata,</italic> in which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection leads to the killing of male embryos, suggesting that sex ratio can be controlled through male-killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stevens et al., 2001</xref>). Mathematical modeling shows that selection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> favors low populations of males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stewart and Phillips, 2002</xref>), and our model provides a mechanism for how this might be achieved.</p><p>In summary, germline-dependent early death after mating is conserved between sexes and perhaps even across great evolutionarily distances, and is likely due to an unavoidable cost of mating, the result of mated animals ramping up germline proliferation and subsequently exhausting their own resources as quickly as possible to produce the next generation of progeny. The differential use of pheromones as toxins or chemical messengers by males in androdioecious and gonochoristic species, respectively, demonstrates that they adopt different strategies to compete, mate, and maintain optimal sex ratios.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>N2 (wild type)</p><p>CB4108: <italic>fog-2(q71) V</italic></p><p>CB4037: <italic>glp-1(e2141) III</italic></p><p>DR476: <italic>daf-22(m130) II</italic></p><p>RB711: <italic>pqm-1(ok485) II</italic></p><p>RT130: pwIs23 [vit-2::GFP]</p><p>PB4641: <italic>Caenorhabditis remanei</italic></p><p>PB2801<italic>: Caenorhabditis brenneri</italic></p><p>AF16: <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic></p><p>JU1422: <italic>Caenorhabditis nigoni</italic></p><p>JU1373<italic>: Caenorhabditis tropicalis</italic></p><p>6699 EG4389: <italic>him-5(e1490) V; lin-15(n765ts)X; oxEx860[P(rab-3)::fem-3(wt)::mCherry(worm)::unc-54, pkd-2::gfp(S65C), lin-15(+)]</italic> (gift from the Jorgensen Lab)</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Individual male mating lifespan assays</title><p>All lifespan assays were performed at room temperature (~20–21°C), except for <italic>glp-1</italic> male lifespan assays (performed at 25–26°C). 35 mm NGM plates were used for all the experiments in this study. 20 µl of OP50 was dropped onto each plate to make a bacterial lawn of ~10 mm diameter.

The summary of all lifespan experiments is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Grouped males</title><p>35 mm NGM plates were used for all the experiments in this study. 20 µl of OP50 was dropped onto each plate to make a bacterial lawn of ~10 mm diameter. The next day, eight synchronized late L4 males were transferred onto each plate. (Two or four males per plate for experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.) One late L4 male of the same age and genotype was transferred onto the control plates. Males were transferred onto fresh plates every two days, when the males were lost or dead, males from other plates were transferred together to make the size of the group stable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Male-conditioned plates (MCP) setup</title><p>Male-conditioned plates for lifespan assays were prepared similar to the previous description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maures et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, 60 µl of OP50 was dropped onto each 35 mm NGM plate to make a bacterial lawn of ~25 mm diameter. Young Day 1 wild-type males (<italic>fog-2</italic> males) were transferred onto each plate. Two days later, they were removed and worms for lifespan assays were immediately transferred onto these male-conditioned plates (MCP). These male-conditioned plates were prepared throughout the course of the lifespan assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) to ensure fresh MCP plates were available. The number of wild-type males used for conditioning is stated in the text and labeled in the figures. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <italic>glp-1</italic> mutant males as well as the wild-type males were used for conditioning at 25°C for 2 days. For MCP treatment from egg onward, 30 Day 1 wild-type males were used to condition plates for 2–3 days. Males were removed and about 15 Day 1 mated <italic>fog-2</italic> hermaphrodites were picked onto these MCP plates for 4–5 hr, allowing them to lay 60–80 eggs. Two days later, L4 males were individually transferred onto MCP plates (conditioned by 8 males, as previously described) for the lifespan assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Body size measurement</title><p>Images of live males on 35 mm plates were taken daily for the first week of adulthood with a Nikon SMZ1500 microscope. Image J was used to analyze the body size of the worms. The middle line of each worm was delineated using the segmented line tool and the total length was documented as the body length of the worm. T-test was performed to compare the body size differences between groups of males in the same day. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> for summary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>FUdR experiment</title><p>FUdR was added to the NGM media to the final concentration of 50 µM. Late L4 males and hermaphrodites were transferred onto NGM+FUdR plates seeded with OP50. Worms were transferred every two days, and were kept on FUdR plates for different period of time (3 days, 6 days or lifetime as indicated by text).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DAPI staining and analysis of male germline</title><p>Worms were stained according to Bio-protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bio-protocol.org/wenzhang.aspx?id=77">http://www.bio-protocol.org/wenzhang.aspx?id=77</ext-link>) using VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Images were taken with a Nikon Ti. The mitotically proliferating germline region was determined by the crescent shape of DAPI-stained nuclei in the transition zone. Z-series of pictures were taken and the numbers of cells in the mitotically proliferating germline region were counted manually. We scored the germline morphology as ‘1’ (clear transition zone marked by crescent shaped nuclei and sperm after U turn of the germline), ‘2’ (no clear transition zone), and ‘3’ (sperm appear before U turn of the germline). Nonparametric comparison between each treatment group was performed using Prism Graphpad. Mann Whitney test was used to determine the statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Oil Red O staining and quantification</title><p>Oil Red O staining was adapted from the published protocol for staining of a small number of worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wählby et al., 2014</xref>). About 20 worms per treatment were imaged with Nikon Ti. Oil Red O quantification was also performed as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Rourke et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, the color images were split into RGB monochromatic images in Image J. The Oil-Red-O staining arbitrary unit (a.u.) was determined by mean gray value within the worm region by Image J (Intensity in the Green channel was used as the signal, adjusted by the intensity in the Red channel as the background). T-test analysis was performed to compare the fat staining of different groups of worms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Glycogen staining</title><p>Glycogen staining was performed according to the published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frazier and Roth, 2009</xref>). Mating of males was set up as previously described. Right before staining, live males of the same group were picked into an M9 droplet with 1M sodium azide on a 3% agarose pad. Immediately after the liquid was dry, the pad was inverted over the opening of a 50g bottle of iodine crystal chips (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 min. After the color stained by iodine vapor on the pad disappeared (non-specific staining), the worms (about 20 worms per treatment) were immediately imaged by a Nikon microscope. Due to uncontrollable differences, it is hard to compare the staining performed at different times. Thus, worms from the groups of comparison were mounted onto the same pad (using a separate M9 droplet if there is no visible difference). Image J was used to compare the mean intensity of iodine staining after the background was subtracted. T-test was performed to compare the staining between different groups (on the same pad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>GFP intensity quantification</title><p>10–20 worms of each group were imaged by Nikon Ti. Image J was used to measure the mean and the maximum GFP intensity of the whole body area.

As a control, solitary males were collected at the same time. About 150 males (on 150 individual 35 mm plates) were collected for each condition and replicate. Three biological replicates were performed. RNA was extracted by the heat-vortexing method. Two-color Agilent microarrays were used for expression analysis; detailed steps and analysis were performed as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title><italic>daf-22</italic> grouped males microarrays</title><p>Synchronized late L4 <italic>daf-22</italic> males were picked on to 35 mm plates (control and MCP). 30 males per plate, 150 males in total were used for each biological replicate.

The supernatant solutions were then used for the pheromone chemotaxis assay. 60 mm NGM plates (no food) were used for the chemotaxis assay. Two destination spots (supernatant and M9 control) were separated by about 45 mm; the distance from the origin spot to either destination spot is 30 mm. Two 1 µl drops of 1M sodium azide were first applied to the destination spots. When dry, a drop of 1 µl M9 or supernatant was separately added onto the destination spots. Then, over 10 young adult (Day 2) males were placed at the origin spot, transferring as little bacteria as possible. After 60 min, the paralyzed male worms were scored based on their location. The chemotaxis index was calculated as: (#worms at supernatant destination - #worms at control destination)/(#total worms - #worms at origin). The chemotaxis assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> was also modified from established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chasnov et al., 2007</xref>). 10 Day 5 hermaphrodites of either N2 or 6699 EG4389 were put in 100 µl of M9 buffer at room temperature overnight with shaking. Two destination spots were 3 mm apart. The origin spot was in the middle. 20 Day 1 <italic>fog-2</italic> males were used in each assay; two replicates were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Male fertility assay</title><p>Males from the control plates and MCP plates were individually paired with one virgin Day 1 <italic>fog-2</italic> hermaprhodite at various time points on a seeded 35 mm NGM plate for 24 hr. About 20 pairs were set up for each group in each biological replicate. The percent fertile was calculated from the number of plates with eggs/progeny divided by the total number of plates set up for this group. Each mated hermaphrodite was numbered and was transferred individually onto a new seeded NGM plate every day to count the total progeny/male number.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) and E Jorgensen for strains, Z Gitai and N Wingreen for valuable discussions, and members of the Murphy laboratory for critically reading the manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mating and Male pheromone kill <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> males through distinct mechanisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andrew Dillin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: L René García (Reviewer #2); Maureen M Barr (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The article &quot;Mating and male pheromone kill <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> males through distinct mechanisms&quot; explores how male secretions and copulation shortens a <italic>C. elegans</italic> male's lifespan relative to a male that is reared in isolation. We find the research topic very interesting and especially novel, since so very few <italic>C. elegans</italic> labs study male <italic>C. elegans</italic> development, behavior and physiology. The authors incorporate life span quantification along with gene profiling analyses, which they have used extensively in their past studies involving hermaphrodites, to describe anatomical and physiological changes that occur in aging adult <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> sp. Males. The authors investigate life history traits in males that are chronically exposed to male secretions (which includes but is not limited to ascaroside blends) and to hermaphrodite/female mates.</p><p>While all reviewers are in favor of publication of this body of work, we all think that the discussion and use of the term &quot;toxin&quot; to describe male pheromone needs to be tempered and explained better.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the Introduction, the authors immediately introduce the male secretions as a toxin. Throughout the article, the authors convincingly show that chronic exposure to male conditioned media has toxic properties, but immediately calling the male secretions a toxin requires the concept to be developed further. The connotation of a &quot;toxin&quot; is that it has a deterministic role to induce deleterious physiological effects that ultimately aids in the fitness of the organism. The experiments presented in this paper do not directly address any organismal fitness benefits for the conditioned media's toxic properties. Although in the Discussion (subsection “Male pheromone-induced killing may be a strategy to selectively reduce the male population”), the authors speculate that the N2 male secretions would cull males from the population, details of how this scenario would occur needs to be explained further.</p><p>Finally, the authors should also incorporate into their Discussion how copulatory behaviors rapidly decline in early adulthood and how this could affect reproduction of males in their prime.</p><p>Male copulation performance declines between day 2 to day 5, and this behavioral decline does not change whether the male is reared in isolation or in large groups (i.e. the male secretions has no obvious deleterious effect on the young male's copulatory motor execution or fecundity). Thus, if male secretions are made to cull out males, then its role is to cull out males past their reproductive prime, but this scenario should not change the generation of new males from cross-fertilization, if male pheromone started killing off young virile males. The reduction of new males in hermaphroditic population over time is more likely due to inefficient male copulatory motor execution, relative to hermaphroditic selfing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23493.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] While all reviewers are in favor of publication of this body of work, we all think that the discussion and use of the term &quot;toxin&quot; to describe male pheromone needs to be tempered and explained better.</italic></p><p><italic>In the last paragraph of the Introduction, the authors immediately introduce the male secretions as a toxin.

Our previous experiments were all aimed at testing adult lifespan effects, and in order to distinguish those from developmental effects, the application of worms to male pheromone plates was performed as adults. Therefore, our results would not include any effects that would be caused by egg or larval exposure to male pheromone. We have now found that when eggs are placed onto male pheromone, the adult males are less fertile, with fewer successful matings, and lower brood sizes from those matings, in addition to an even shorter lifespan. (We confirmed that there was an age-related decrease in male fertility, as previously reported (Chatterjee et al. 2013; Guo, et al. 2012), and under our conditions, male pheromone seems to have exacerbated this effect.) Together, the impact of decreased male fertility and decreased brood sizes, while hermaphrodite brood size was unaffected by MCP, might reduce the male fraction of the population over several generations. We have added a simple model of this effect to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
