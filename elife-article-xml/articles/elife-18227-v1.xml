In bacteria, one of the major pathways for high fidelity repair of breaks is homologous recombination initiated by RecBCD, AdnAB or AddAB complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wigley, 2013</xref>) that process the broken ends via a number of steps to eventually produce a RecA-coated 3’-tailed filament that initiates strand invasion.</p><p>In addition to a role in repair of double-strand DNA breaks, RecBCD is an important player in controlling infection by bacteriophages, the significance of which is exemplified by proteins produced by phages that specifically target RecBCD. The phage lambda protein Gam, works by competing with DNA binding to RecBCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Court et al., 2007</xref>), while the phage P22 protein Abc2, works by inducing a ‘Chi-like state’ for RecBCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Murphy, 2000</xref>). Most recently, a role for RecBCD in providing DNA fragments for CRISPR arrays demonstrates a connection to the other major pathway known to provide resistance to phage infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The RecBCD/AddAB complexes are highly processive helicase/nuclease machines that digest DNA from the broken end until they encounter a crossover hotspot instigator (Chi) sequence. At this point their activities are modulated to produce a 3-tailed duplex onto which RecA is loaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wigley, 2013</xref>). Crystal structures of a variety of intermediates on the AddAB-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Saikrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krajewski et al., 2014</xref>), together with biochemical and single molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gilhooley and Dillingham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gilhooley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carrasco et al., 2013</xref>), now provide a reasonable understanding of the molecular details of this process.</p><p>Although there has been considerable study of RecBCD at the biochemical and single molecule level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wright et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Taylor and Smith, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Spies et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2007</xref>), our understanding of the molecular details for the RecBCD mechanism are less advanced due to a lack of high resolution structural information. To date, this has been limited to the initiation complex, with the protein interacting with a broken DNA end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>), and some DNA substrates representing partially unwound substrates that represent the very initial stages of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). The nuclease activity of RecBC is very much lower than that of RecBCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1997</xref>) so it was initially presumed that the nuclease must be a part of the RecD subunit. However, it was shown instead that the nuclease domain is actually a C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit, the activity of which is regulated by RecD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). The structure of the initiation complex revealed this is due to an α-helix that sits in the nuclease active site, thus blocking access to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>). It is evident that this helix must be displaced to activate the nuclease, but the mechanism and trigger for this release was unknown.</p><p>In order to understand how the RecD subunit is able to activate the nuclease domain of RecB, we have now determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of RecBCD bound to a forked DNA substrate with an extended 5’-tail that spans the entire RecD subunit. This interaction induces a series of conformational changes that eventually result in release of the nuclease-blocking linker helix, which then re-docks at an alternative location thus opening the nuclease active site for access by the ssDNA tails of the unwound fork. A critical role for a rare bacterial SH3 domain in the RecD subunit is also revealed in the structure, and raises possibilities for a mechanism of further regulation after recognition of Chi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination by cryoEM</title><p>Fork DNA substrates containing ten residues on the 5’-tail could be crystallised in the same crystal form as the blunt hairpin substrate used for the initiation complex reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</xref>), and the structures of the protein components were essentially the same. However, just a single base addition on the 5’-tail beyond ten residues resulted in loss of crystallisation and we were unable to obtain suitable crystals despite extensive screening. This was the first indication that the additional base on the 5’-tail induces a conformational change in the protein. Consequently, despite the relatively small size of the RecBCD/DNA complex (350KDa), we turned instead to cryoEM to determine a high resolution structure of the complex. Data were collected on a Titan Krios microscope with Gatan K2 detector at the UK EM facility at Diamond. EM processing statistics are presented in the Materials and methods section, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Electron density corresponding to the most important areas described in this manuscript is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Data processing revealed a major class that constituted about half of the particles and this is what is described in detail below. We utilised a DNA fork substrate with a 25 base pair duplex region, capped at one end with a five base hairpin and at the other with unpaired 3’ and 5’-tails (3 and 12 thymidine residues, respectively). The DNA and all domains of the three proteins were accounted for in the reconstruction derived from this major class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In one of the other classes, density corresponding to the RecB nuclease domain was missing (18%), although other features for the rest of the protein were very similar to the main class. This class may constitute some proportion of the complex in which the flexible linker connecting the nuclease domain to the helicase domains of the RecB subunit has been cleaved or, alternatively, may be due to release of the nuclease domain from its usual binding surface observed in the initiation complex. In the latter instance, we do not see any evidence for a potential docking site for the nuclease domain anywhere else on the complex such as that proposed from SAXS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). This second class was therefore of limited interest so we confine the discussion of the results to the dominant class of particles that appears to represent an intermediate on the catalytic pathway.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18227.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Refinement of the final model.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18227.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18227.002</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Final particles</td><td valign="top">74656</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CC (whole map)</td><td valign="top">0.838</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CC (around atoms)</td><td valign="top">0.875</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">R.m.s. deviations</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bond lengths (Å)</td><td valign="top">0.01</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bond angles (°)</td><td valign="top">1.04</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ramachandran</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Favoured (%)</td><td valign="top">94.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Outliers</td><td valign="top">8/2874</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Rotamers</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Favoured (%)</td><td valign="top">99.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Outliers</td><td valign="top">1/2426</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18227.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CryoEM structure of RecBCD/DNA complex at 3.8 Å resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the RecBCD complex within a transparent surface showing the electron density.

However, the conformation of the conserved helicase motif IV is in a conformation that suggests nucleotide is bound to the subunit, albeit at low occupancy (Panel A). Comparison with the RecD2 structures (Panel B) reveals the 1A and 2A domains to be most similar in conformation to that of the protein without bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, these structures also suggest that a steric clash with the RecB subunit would prevent the RecD subunit from sliding along the ssDNA in response to ATP-binding as seen for RecD2.

These structures also revealed that the SH3 domain interacts with the ssDNA tail in a location different to that normally occupied by a peptide in canonical eukaryotic SH3 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Saikrishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saksela and Permi, 2012</xref>), thus retaining the potential to bind peptide at the same time as the ssDNA tail. The 2B domain of the RecD subunit is visible in our current EM structure and confirms the fold of this domain is similar to that of the SH3 fold observed for RecD2. It also confirms the location and mode of DNA binding observed in RecD2. However, the domain also contacts a helix within the 2B domain of RecB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This interaction utilises a surface that is in a similar location to that used by other SH3 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saksela and Permi, 2012</xref>) but the mode of interaction is very different to other SH3 domains. Most SH3 domains bind an extended peptide (usually a sequence rich in proline residues) across a groove on the protein surface. By contrast, the SH3 domain of RecD binds an α-helix in this region. In addition, some of the regions that constitute the contact surfaces in canonical eukaryotic SH3 domains, such as in Abl kinase, are utilised in a different manner in the RecD SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The RT and N-Src loops are pulled back from their usual locations through interactions with the ssDNA tail and a part of the RecD 2A domain, respectively. This opens up the typical narrow peptide-binding groove that opens up the surface to interact with an α-helix in the RecB subunit. Therefore, this appears to represent a novel interaction mode for a SH3 domain.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18227.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SH3 fold in RecD.</title><p>Inset: location of the close ups shown in this figure relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

This led to the so-called RecD ejection hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stahl et al., 1990</xref>). However, subsequent single molecule data have shown instead that RecD becomes inactivated rather than being lost from the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Handa et al., 2005</xref>). If it were to act in a conventional SH3 mode (i.e. canonical peptide binding) then it is plausible that conformational changes in response to Chi recognition might cause this domain to relocate and bind to another part of the protein complex to lock RecD in a conformation that can no longer function as a helicase/translocase, without being lost from the complex. This could either involve a similar region to that we observe in the current structure or a different one following another conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conformational changes in response to extension of the 5’-tail</title><p>In previous structures of RecBCD, the RecD subunit adopted an open conformation but in the current structure the protein closes around and clamps the 5’ ssDNA tail.

The crystal structure of the initiation complex of RecBCD suggested why this is the case because the nuclease requires ssDNA to be fed into it by the helicase activities of the complex. Furthermore, the structure revealed a mechanism for inhibition of the nuclease activity in which an α-helix (residues 913–922) within the linker region (residues 870–940) of RecB, that connects the C-terminal nuclease domain to the N-terminal helicase domains, sits in the nuclease active site thus blocking access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>). This suggested an obvious mechanism for activation in which this helix would be displaced to allow access of the ssDNA tails to the nuclease site although how this might be brought about was not evident from the structure. The EM structure now reveals the details of this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>).</p><p>Interaction between the 2B domain of RecD and the RecB subunit has a number of consequences. First, several domains of the RecC subunit also undergo a change in conformation. This change alters the interaction between the 1A domain of RecC and the nuclease domain of RecB. In the initiation complex, the α-helix that blocks the nuclease active site is stabilised by stacking contacts with another α-helix (residues 602–627) from the 2B domain of RecC. This interaction is altered as a consequence of the conformational changes in the RecC subunit that shift the position of the RecC helix, breaking the contacts with the nuclease-blocking helix of the RecB linker, resulting in release of this helix from the nuclease active site, for which there is now no electron density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This change opens up the nuclease site and allows access of DNA. Furthermore, weak electron density suggested an alternate path for the linker region compared to the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the density was too weak to build the loop accurately, it was modelled as poly-alanine to define the overall pathway for this re-docked polypeptide. The path takes the linker along the edge of the RecD 2A domain including a short region that precedes the SH3 domain. Thus the entire linker is relocated away from the nuclease domain, relieving the block and providing access to the nuclease active site. The conformational changes are illustrated by movies created by morphing from one structure to the other (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). A cartoon representing the steps on the RecBCD activation pathway is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18227.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cartoon summarising the conformational changes that proceed from the initiation complex to nuclease activation.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18227.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18227.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-18227-fig5-v1"/></fig></p><p>The activity of a highly processive helicase/nuclease could be very deleterious to a cell if unchecked. Consequently, RecBCD has evolved regulatory mechanisms that suppress activity unless the enzyme complex is bound to a <italic>bona fide</italic> DNA substrate (i.e. a broken DNA end). The structure we present here demonstrates the molecular basis for one such regulatory mechanism and, together with our previous structural studies, describes a pathway for this activation process. Initial binding of RecBCD to a broken end induces unwinding of up to six base pairs of DNA in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wong et al., 2005</xref>). The function of this unwinding is to fill up the ssDNA-binding site on the RecB subunit. ATP binding and hydrolysis now allow unwinding of the DNA duplex to begin, at first driven by just the RecB subunit. At this stage the nuclease active site is blocked by the linker helix and activity of the domain is attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Saikrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). As the RecB subunit begins to unwind the duplex, the 5’-ssDNA tail that is produced passes along a channel through the RecC subunit towards the motor domains of the RecD subunit. Once the tail exceeds ten bases, the RecD subunit responds with a large conformational change that converts it to an active helicase/translocase conformation and in this process also transmits this change to the nuclease active site via the RecC and RecB subunits. At this point the enzyme is bound to a DNA substrate that it recognises as being initiated from a broken DNA end (or restriction enzyme digested phage genome) so can proceed to processively and rapidly digest the DNA and search for a Chi sequence. If the enzyme encounters a Chi sequence then it pauses and alters its activities to prepare the DNA end for RecA loading. RecBCD then loads the RecA protein so that homologous recombination can initiate and the repair process proceeds. For phage DNA that lacks Chi sequences, the DNA degrading machine is unregulated and continues to digest the phage genome, thereby eliminating the phage from the cell, but also at the same time providing a molecular memory of the infection via the CRISPR system to further evade future infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levy et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein and DNA preparation</title><p>A nuclease-dead <italic>E.coli</italic> RecBCD mutant (D1080A in RecB) was used in this work to prevent digestion of the single-stranded tails of the DNA substrate.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanism for nuclease regulation in RecBCD&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Stewart Shuman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this work, Wigley and colleagues extend their highly informative structural studies of bacterial helicase-nucleases by reporting the cryo-EM structure of RecBCD engaged with a forked DNA substrate in which the 5' single strand tail is long enough to traverse the RecD subunit. This new structure reveals conformational changes underlying the requirement for RecD to activate the nuclease activity inherent to the C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit. This entails the movement of a nuclease-occluding protein helix observed in an earlier crystal structure of RecBCD. The EM structure highlights a key role for an SH3 domain in the RecD subunit in this transition, whereby SH3 (which was disordered in the RecBCD initiation complex crystal structure) interacts with the 5' ssDNA and RecB. This is an important addition to our specific understanding of RecBCD function and its regulation, and more generally an excellent example of the sophisticated internal dynamics of a DNA-processing machine.</p><p>I summarize below the relatively minor comments that you need to take into account in your revision. Also note that <italic>eLife</italic> expects papers to refer to the organism system in either the title or Abstract so I would propose you add an appropriate statement in the Abstract stating that is <italic>E. coli</italic> RecBCD that is under study.</p><p>1) The simulations in the videos are very informative, but please check them carefully since one reviewer had the opinion that the <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> file was corrupted, although I was not aware of a problem. Could the nuclease active site be indicated in the videos, such as by overlaying one of the metal ions?</p><p>2) In our opinion, the figures could be improved, not least because the difficulty in distinguishing colors and relating one figure to another. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> the green (1A) domain is either hidden or difficult to distinguish from the yellow.</p><p>From the way the figures are presented, it is difficult to understand the conformational changes that lead from the binding of the RecD-SH3 domain to the 5'-tail, to the exposure of the nuclease active site. This is in part due to the changes in orientation used for the close-up views (such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which are difficult to relate back to the starting view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The videos show these changes very well, but many readers will just look at the figures. I am not sure what the best solution is, but one could consider having two full structures shown side by side for the two complexes (present structure and previous &quot;pre-initiation&quot; structure), in the orientation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. It would be helpful if all of the key parts that participate in the conformational changes (nuclease active site, RecB linker, etc.) could be labeled or indicated on each figure. At a minimum, it would be helpful if the nuclease active site could be indicated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – one should be able to see that it is buried in the pre-initiation complex and exposed in the present structure, which is the main point of the paper, but is not clearly shown anywhere. It would be better if the close-up views that show the detailed interactions, could be in a similar orientation as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, if at all possible, ideally on the same panel with boxes on the full structure indicating each expanded region. I realize that this is difficult however, and I like how the overlays with the gray structure show the actual domain movements.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – please indicate the location of the nuclease active site. Furthermore, it would be nice if the domain structure of each subunit could be defined in a linear sequence cartoon (color coded like the structural figures). With so many different domains and subdomains, it would be nice to have a legend to show where the different domains are in the linear sequence.</p><p>Since much of the text and figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) have to do with the ATP sites. It would be helpful if the previous structures that were determined were described more fully (such as in the introduction), with regard to the occupancy of the two ATP sites. It wasn't clear if the occupancy of the ATP sites, and the conformational changes around them, had anything to do with the nuclease activation, or if this was just a side note of the paper. Since the main point of the paper has to do with nuclease activation, are the parts about the ATP sites a bit off-track, although I understand that they are still informative? If there is in fact a connection between the ATP sites and nuclease activation, it should be made clearly.</p><p>The authors might also consider the value of introducing a cartoon of the pathway from DNA loading to nuclease action, chi recognition etc. that takes into account the structural work here and previously; this could be very useful for the general reader.</p><p>3) Correct and check for typos (some of which include 'These' to 'This' [end of subsection “Structure determination by cryoEM”]; insert 'the' before 'overall' [subsection “Mechanism of nuclease activation”, second paragraph]; 'collected' not coleted' [subsection “Cryo-electron microscopy grid preparation and data collection”, last paragraph]; no title on He et al. ref in citations. Also the authors should carefully examine their revised manuscript for accuracy, particularly the Methods section.</p><p>4) In the Abstract and first paragraph of the Introduction, it would be appropriate to cite AdnAB (the mycobacterial helicase-nuclease) along with AddAB and RecBCD as exemplary bacterial DSB-processing machines.</p><p>5) In the second paragraph of the Introduction. The authors cite both RecCD and AddAB as antagonists of bacteriophage infection, and then cite several cases in which phages encode proteins that neutralize RecBCD. Yet, they cite no example of AddAB having an antiviral effect. is there such evidence? If not, then AddAB ought to be deleted from the sentence.</p><p>6) In the second paragraph of the subsection “Mechanism of nuclease activation”, please find better phrasing than &quot;activates activity&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18227.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>I summarize below the relatively minor comments that you need to take into account in your revision.

We also include insets on subsequent zoomed in figures to help readers to locate the detailed regions in the overall structure. As suggested, we have also included a coloured bar to represent the linear sequence of the proteins.
