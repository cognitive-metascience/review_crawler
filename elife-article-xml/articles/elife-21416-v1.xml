In a mouse model of chronic social isolation, a known risk factor for depressive illness, we show that 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus are less responsive to stimulation. Probing the responsible cellular mechanisms pinpoints a disturbance in the expression and function of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels and reveals an important role for both SK2 and SK3 channels in normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability. Chronic social isolation renders 5-HT neurons insensitive to SK2 blockade, however inhibition of the upregulated SK3 channels restores normal excitability. In vivo, we demonstrate that inhibiting SK channels normalizes chronic social isolation-induced anxiety/depressive-like behaviors. Our experiments reveal a causal link for the first time between SK channel dysregulation and 5-HT neuron activity in a lifelong stress paradigm, suggesting these channels as targets for the development of novel therapies for mood disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21416.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21416.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21416.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Major depressive disorder is a common and debilitating disease that interferes with the afflicted person’s everyday life. While some patients do benefit from antidepressant treatments, these medications need to be taken for several weeks before they become effective. Still, a large proportion of patients do not recover fully and some do not respond at all to the existing treatments. As a result, there is a need to find new and more effective treatments for depression.</p><p>The most widely used antidepressant drugs target the chemical messenger or neurotransmitter called serotonin. The majority of nerve cells that produce serotonin are located in a region deep in the brain known as the dorsal raphe nucleus. When active, these nerve cells release serotonin; this in turn controls the cells’ own activity as well as the activity of a large number of connected nerve cells located throughout the brain. Any disruption in this system will have a widespread impact and can potentially increase the risk of disturbed moods. However, it was not exactly clear what alters the activity of serotonin-producing nerve cells in depression.</p><p>Now, Sargin et al. have identified a previously unknown mechanism that underlies changes to the activity of serotonin-producing nerve cells. Keeping mice isolated for a prolonged period elicits the symptoms of depression. Sargin et al. found that serotonin-producing nerve cells were dramatically less active in isolated mice and that a specific type of ion channel protein (the SK3 channel) was more abundant in these nerve cells. A higher amount of this channel inhibits the activity of nerve cells. Blocking these inhibitory SK3 channels (using a drug that can be obtained from bee venom) restored normal activity in the serotonin-producing cells. Moreover, this treatment alleviated the depressive symptoms of the isolated mice.</p><p>The findings of Sargin et al. suggest a new way to treat the symptoms of depression. Yet to translate them into an accessible treatment for patients, future work will be required to develop drugs that can specifically and potently target the affected channel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21416.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21416.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dorsal raphe</kwd><kwd>serotonin neurons</kwd><kwd>social isolation</kwd><kwd>calcium-activated potassium channels</kwd><kwd>SK3</kwd><kwd>depressive-like behaviors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambe</surname><given-names>Evelyn K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Research Chair in Developmental Cortical Physiology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambe</surname><given-names>Evelyn K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Province of Ontario, Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Researcher Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambe</surname><given-names>Evelyn K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serotonin neurons in chronically isolated mice become less responsive to excitatory stimulation, but inhibiting a distinctive calcium-activated potassium channel can restore both neuronal activity and behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depression is a prevalent and debilitating disease for which standard treatments remain ineffective.

Identification of changes in the activity of these neurons may uncover novel therapeutic targets for depression and anxiety disorders.</p><p>Here, we show that chronic social isolation leads to a reduction in the excitability of DRN 5-HT neurons. Their firing activity to optical, electrophysiological, and neuromodulatory stimulation are all reduced after social isolation. Specifically, we have identified that the reduction in the firing activity of 5-HT neurons results from alterations in the function and expression of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels. Furthermore, inhibition of SK channels normalizes the activity of 5-HT neurons and restores the behavioral deficits observed after chronic social isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Social isolation reduces excitability of 5-HT neurons</title><p>To examine how chronic social isolation affects DRN 5-HT neurons, we performed whole-cell electrophysiology on acute slices from mice expressing ChR2-EYFP under <italic>Tph2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To examine whether chronic social isolation perturbs the firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons in response to excitatory neuromodulation, we investigated the effects of orexinB and phenylephrine, which act respectively on hypocretin2 and α1-adrenergic receptors. Application of orexinB or phenylephrine on slice depolarized the majority of 5-HT neurons to threshold and elicited action potentials. Quantification of spike frequency revealed a significant suppression in the peak orexinB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>) and the peak phenylephrine effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B,D</xref>) in 5-HT neurons of single-housed mice. These differences in neuromodulator-elicited excitability do not appear to reflect altered efficacy of the receptors nor channel effectors, since upon voltage-clamp examination both neuromodulators produced robust inward excitatory currents comparable between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–H</xref>).

We found that the peak and area of rheobase AHP were significantly larger for the single-housed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>).

The discrete contribution of each subtype to 5-HT neuron excitability is not known. Both subtypes are sensitive to apamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>); but SK2 can be blocked selectively with a novel toxin Lei-Dab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shakkottai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aidi-Knani et al., 2015</xref>).

This work provides the first direct link between a chronic social isolation paradigm and functional alterations in 5-HT neurons themselves. We also reveal that SK2 contributes to normal regulation of 5-HT neuronal excitability but ceases to modulate these neurons significantly after chronic stress. Behavioral analysis showed that chronic social isolation increases anxiety/depression-like behaviors, which can be normalized upon inhibition of SK channels by acute systemic apamin.</p><p>In humans, polymorphisms on the gene encoding the SK3 channel have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by emotional dysregulation including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anorexia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grube et al., 2011</xref>).

Our work demonstrates for the first time that social isolation, a major risk factor for depression and anxiety, results in reduced 5-HT neuronal activity due to upregulated SK3 channel function in the DRN. Moreover, we show that systemic treatment with apamin, an inhibitor of SK channels improves behavioral deficits induced by chronic social isolation. Consistent with studies that have implicated SK channel function in neuropsychiatric conditions, our current findings suggest that SK channel modulation is a promising therapeutic target for disorders of emotional disturbance such as depression and anxiety. Apamin however has been reported to have adverse side effects in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van der Staay et al., 1999</xref>) close to the beneficial dose in the current mouse study. The diverse expression of SK channels in different tissue types and the lack of tissue/subtype specific modulators or inhibitors are currently the limiting factors for therapeutic interventions targeting SK channels. Further research focused on understanding the differential regulation, modulation and function of SK channel subtypes may shed light on the development of effective disease treatment strategies. Importantly, development of more specific drugs targeted at inhibiting SK3 function may have significant implications for treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>All experiments were performed in Tg(Tph2-COP4*H134R/EYFP)5Gfng mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:014555">IMSR_JAX:014555</ext-link>) that express channelrhodopsin EYFP fusion protein driven by the <italic>Tph2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), in accordance with animal protocols approved by the University of Toronto (20010374, 20011622, 20011733).

Membranes were then blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4<sup>o</sup>C with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-SK3, 1:1000, Alomone, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2040130">AB_2040130</ext-link>; rabbit anti-SK2, 1:1000, Alomone, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2040126">AB_2040126</ext-link>; rabbit anti-5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R, 1:1000, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_805421">AB_805421</ext-link>; mouse anti-β-actin, 1:5000, Sigma, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476744">AB_476744</ext-link>). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using HRP-coupled secondary antibodies by ECL detection methods (Bio-Rad). Band intensities were analyzed using Bio-Rad Image Laboratory software and calculated relative to β-actin as the loading control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>To assess anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, the novelty suppressed feeding, tail suspension, and sucrose preference tests were performed. Each test was separated by a minimum of 3 days. Mice were habituated to the testing room for at least 30 min. Apamin (0.3 mg/kg dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, Alomone Labs) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) 30 min before each test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van der Staay et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Novelty suppressed feeding test</title><p>Following food deprivation for 18 hr, mice were provided with a single food pellet placed in the middle of a dimly lit plastic (45 x 45x 20 cm) box. The floor of the box was covered with bedding 2 cm deep. The latency to start feeding in a 5 min assay was measured by an observer blinded to the groups/treatment. Following the test, each mouse was returned to its homecage and the amount of food consumed within 5 min was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Tail suspension test</title><p>Mice were individually suspended by their tails within a three-walled plastic box (45 x 25 x 25 cm) using adhesive tape securely attached to the tip of the tail. The test lasted for 6 min and the behavior of each mouse was videotaped. The amount of time spent immobile per minute was measured by an observer blinded to the groups and treatment and expressed as the cumulative immobility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Sucrose preference test</title><p>Mice were habituated to drinking 2% sucrose from two bottles prior to the test. In order to assess the drinking amount, group-housed mice were housed in pairs or singles for a period of 3 days. Mice were given a choice of 2% sucrose or water in their homecage for 2 days. Water and sucrose intake were measured daily and the position of the bottles were changed after the first day. Drugs were administered on both days of the test. Data were expressed as the ratio of sucrose to water consumed and the average of both days were taken.</p><p>Z-scoring methodology was used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilloux et al., 2011</xref>) to assess the overall emotionality score for each mouse that ran through all the behavioral tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological responses were calculated as changes in membrane potential or holding current resulting from manipulations such as 473 nm light exposure or the bath application of drugs and analyzed by Clampfit (Molecular Devices) software. Spike frequencies for input-output curves were measured by counting the number of spikes in response to 500 ms depolarizing current steps. Spike frequencies for optogenetic and electrophysiological stimulations were determined by counting the number of spikes over a 2 s stimulation period. For illustrative purposes, averaged traces showing current responses and AHPs were compiled using Axograph software. Quantification of AHP potentials was performed by detecting action potentials automatically with a derivative threshold of 20 mV/ms by Axograph software. AHP area (mVxs) is measured as the area under the AHP between the midpoint of each spike (taken as time=0) and the 100 ms time point corresponding to the medium AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sah, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faber and Sah, 2003</xref>). The maximum negative value of the AHP within this time window is determined as the peak AHP (mV). Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5 software. For electrophysiology experiments, the numbers (n) that represent the number of neurons were obtained from at least 3 mice per group. For western blots, numbers (n) represent the number of mice (averages of 2 replicates per mouse). Data were analyzed using unpaired student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, two-way ANOVA or repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was performed when appropriate. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by grants to EKL from the Canadian Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Canada Research Chairs Program, and the Early Researcher Award from the Province of Ontario.

For example, one reviewer noted (during the reviewer discussion) that &quot;a more recent paper used a somewhat similar model in mice (Neuropsychopharmacology. 2014 Dec; 39(13):2928-37. doi: 10.1038/npp.2014.162) and doesn't seem to see much on the anxiety tests; they did voltammetry measures of 5-HT release in different conditions, and rather see a trend for increased rather than decreased 5-HT release (see their table1). &quot; While it would be feasible with significant additional work to shore up the present results with additional behavioral studies (e.g. demonstrating that social isolation produces specific behavioral effects which can be normalized by normalizing the excitability of DRN neurons), this would likely take several months to complete and it is the journal policy to reject manuscripts which cannot be accepted without work that could be completed in 1-2 months at most. In this case, however, we would be willing to consider a new manuscript on the same topic, provided it addressed the issue of behavioral relevance. But the reviewer and reviewing editor felt that in its present state the manuscript would be more appropriate for a more specialized journal.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors show that social isolation results in reduced excitability of serotonergic neurons in the mouse dorsal raphe, perhaps explaining the impact of social isolation on depression related symptoms. The experiments demonstrate concisely and convincingly that the decreased excitability is due to an increased afterhyperpolarization (AHP) associated with increased expression of the SK3 subtype of small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels. Interestingly, polymorphisms of the SK3 gene are known to be risk factors for psychiatric disease.</p><p>The paper is short and to the point, and the experiments are well done and clearly illustrated.</p><p>I had only minor suggestions for clarifying the physiological results presented in the manuscript. However, after discussion with the other reviewer, I am persuaded that there is still an open question as to the behavioral relevance, and hence the general interest, of the results. Although it is clear that social isolation is a risk factor for depressive symptoms and anxiety, it is not clear whether the observed change in DRN excitability plays a causal role in this.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The work nicely demonstrates that rearing mice in social isolation lowers the excitability of serotonin raphe neurons, by modifying the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) responses of the 5-HT neurons, a biophysical property that is controlled by SK channels; they find that SK3 channel expression is increased in the raphe of single-reared mice and that pharmacological blockade of SK3 normalizes AHP and raphe neuron excitability. The paper is well done, but without addition of behavioral data, it remains limited in its conclusions and does not address the possible behavioral correlates of SK3 changes (nor the possible upstream mechanisms that induce SK3 up regulation). Thus, although presenting an interesting novel observation in the field, the results seemed somewhat too preliminary to conclude on the potential relevance of SK3 up regulation for the effects of stress on mood disorders.</p><p>Specific remarks</p><p>1) Antagonist rescues hypoactivity of the 5-HT neurons. What about behaviour? There are no behavioural data to show that the protocol of social isolation really changes behaviour, nor how SK3 antagonism could modify them. This is difficult to predict from the published literature since SK3 overexpression was found to cause learning deficits but no anxiety phenotypes (Grube et al., 2011), while SK3-KO appear to have increased anxiety (Jacobsen et al., 2008).</p><p>2) Increased of SK3 is shown with western blots, however this shows an unequal signal among cases; thus dot plots would be preferable to histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. Further, SK3-immunolabelling (such antibodies are characterized in Jacobsen et al.2008) would be a nice addition, to show more specifically an SK3 increase in the 5-HT neurons.</p><p>3) In the Results section the authors claim that difference in excitability did not result from changes in GABA tone mentioning data not shown. It would be important to show these data since there is literature showing that stress affects excitability of GABA neurons but not 5-HT neurons (e.g. Challis et al., 2013).</p><p>4) When measuring AHP amplitudes and areas, at which frequency were the cells firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>)? The authors report the same current step for all cells (25pA); because neurons from single-housed are hypoexcitable we can infer that the frequency is lower. This would bias the measures. Measures of medium AHP are normally taken after a depolarizing current step has been applied, and selecting the current step showing the same number of action potentials for all cells.</p><p>5) Because of the heterogeneity of the dorsal raphe neurons, the authors need to specify more precisely the localisation of their recordings.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chronic social isolation reduces 5-HT neuronal activity via upregulated SK3 calcium-activated potassium channels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers: Sacha B Nelson (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and Patricia Gaspar (Reviewer #2). The evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors nicely demonstrate that rearing mice in social isolation lowers the excitability of serotonin raphe neurons, by modifying their afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), a biophysical property that is controlled by small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium (SK) channels. They go on to show that isolation also impacts behaviors associated with anxiety and depression in rodents and that these changes are reversed by inhibiting SK channels.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The requested revisions are minor and this should not need to go back for another round of review. The full text of the reviews is given below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have now added three behavioral tests to support the idea that the changes in DRN SK3 activity they see following social isolation has effects on feeding and the anxiety/depression related behavior of immobility following tail suspension. The results and some other minor fixes add confidence that the observed changes in the excitability of serotonergic neurons are more likely to have a behavioral impact. There is some concern of course that changes elsewhere (e.g. in the gut) could have affected the feeding behaviors, but this concern is difficult to address.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns concerning the validation of the social isolation model in mice, by adding behavioral experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of their protocol to induce anxiety-like phenotypes. Moreover they indicate a causal link between SK3 upregulation and these phenotypes by showing a partial rescue of the behavioral phenotype with Apamin. Finally methodological precisions and complementary explanations were added to the text as requested.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In their rebuttal, the authors explain the difference of their results with the Dankovski 2014 paper as a difference in protocol. However all the other supporting papers they cite have been done in rats (and they do not cite the Dankovski paper). If this is the first time the social separation model could be valuably transferred to mice, this would be worth mentioning more explicitly for future studies in mice.</p><p>2) In this regard, information about the mouse strain/gender of mice used in the different experiments is important; I could not find this info in the new version of the manuscript.</p><p>3) Results, subsection “Social isolation reduces excitability of 5-HT neurons”, first paragraph: explain what picrotoxin and CGP52432 are doing (as in the Methods).</p><p>4) Results, subsection “Systemic apamin treatment normalizes anxiety- and depressive-like 160 behaviors in socially isolated mice”, last paragraph: to see how the z-score was calculated, I went to &quot;Lin and Sibille 2015&quot;; this was a waste of time as the Methods only refers to Guilloux 2011. Suggestion is to keep only the useful reference.</p><p>5) Conclusion - It is interesting that SK channels are a druggable compound for depression. Since this is not entirely new, as it had already been put forth and tested - to some extent - by Crespi in 2010, it may be useful to add a sentence as to why no one has really followed this up. Are there issues of toxicity? A need for more selective agents?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21416.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Although the topic of the experiments is interesting and the results presented are convincing, the reader is left unsure of the behavioral impact of the changes in excitability observed and as to whether this is indeed as suggested a &quot;promising therapeutic target for disorders of emotional disturbance such as depression and anxiety.&quot; It remains possible that SK channels are too broad a target to be useful, and even that these changes in excitability are consequences of, but not causally related to, the effects of social deprivation.

We isolate mice at the age of postnatal (P) day 21 upon weaning and this social isolation continues for more than 7 weeks. Our behavioral work in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates that this paradigm elicits robust anxiety- and depressive-like effects.</p><p>Indeed, it has been shown in various studies that there is a critical developmental window for isolation rearing experiments in rodents and that single-housing after this critical developmental window does not lead to the same robust behavioral effects (Einon and Morgan, 1977; Fone and Porkess, 2008).</p><p>In the above-mentioned paper by Dankoski et al. 2016, mice were socially isolated later, starting at adolescence (P35-42), for a relatively brief period of 3 weeks. In this model, single-housed mice did not show robust behavioral changes compared to the paired controls. Although single- housing mice in adolescence may certainly have stressful effects (Wallace et al., 2009), the Dankoski et al. model likely represents a milder stress than ours. Still interestingly, citalopram-induced facilitation of serotonin release was blocked in this model of social isolation suggesting that even milder stressful conditions may have an impact on serotonin release under challenge.</p><p>Our electrophysiological findings that serotonin neurons become less responsive to stimulation upon chronic social isolation beginning at P21 are consistent with previous reports showing decreased release of 5-HT in postsynaptic areas after single-housing rodents starting at this developmentally-sensitive time (Jaffe et al., 1993; Bickerdike et al., 1993; Heidbreder et al., 2000; Muchimapura et al., 2002; Muchimapura et al., 2003).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] I had only minor suggestions for clarifying the physiological results presented in the manuscript. However, after discussion with the other reviewer, I am persuaded that there is still an open question as to the behavioral relevance, and hence the general interest, of the results. Although it is clear that social isolation is a risk factor for depressive symptoms and anxiety, it is not clear whether the observed change in DRN excitability plays a causal role in this.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the point with respect to the behavioral relevance of our findings. We have now performed the behavioral experiments showing that this chronic social isolation paradigm elicits significant differences on anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrate that this group difference can be rescued with SK channel blockade by apamin used at a dose shown to enhance the excitability of raphe neurons in vivo (Crespi, 2009).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Specific remarks</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Antagonist rescues hypoactivity of the 5-HT neurons. What about behaviour? There are no behavioural data to show that the protocol of social isolation really changes behaviour, nor how SK3 antagonism could modify them. This is difficult to predict from the published literature since SK3 overexpression was found to cause learning deficits but no anxiety phenotypes (Grube et al., 2011), while SK3-KO appear to have increased anxiety (Jacobsen et al., 2008).</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the valuable feedback with respect to the requirement of behavioral experiments. We used male mice for our experiments. Jacobsen et al., 2011 reported an antidepressant-like phenotype in SK3 deficient male mice (reduced immobility in tail suspension and forced swim tests), which supports our findings in this study.</p><p>With the suggestion of the reviewer, we now conducted the necessary behavioral experiments and added them into the manuscript. A new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> highlight the striking behavioral differences observed in our chronically socially isolated male mice compared to group- housed littermate controls, as well as the normalization of these measures upon acute administration of apamin to block a portion of SK channels.</p><p>Interestingly, Jacobsen et al., 2011 reported an anxiety-like effect in one of the tests (zero maze) in SK3 deficient female mice. Whether sex differences exist in our model is an interesting point and will be important to follow up in a future study.</p><p><italic>2) Increased of SK3 is shown with western blots, however this shows an unequal signal among cases; thus dot plots would be preferable to histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. Further, SK3-immunolabelling (such antibodies are characterized in Jacobsen et al. 2008) would be a nice addition, to show more specifically an SK3 increase in the 5-HT neurons.</italic> </p><p>We now included the dot plots instead of the histograms for the western blot data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. SK3 expression is reported to be predominantly in serotonergic neurons of dorsal raphe (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000). Serotonergic neurons characteristically have a prominent medium duration apamin-sensitive AHPs (Scuvée-Moreau et al., 2004) that do not exist to the same extent in other neuronal subtypes such as GABAergic neurons in dorsal raphe. Moreover, systemic apamin injections were shown to increase the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in vivo and resulted in a subsequent increase in 5-HT release in postsynaptic regions (Crespi, 2009) suggesting that serotonergic neurons are specifically sensitive to apamin. SK channel blockade in vivo has also been shown to increase burst firing specifically in serotonergic neurons (Rouchet et al., 2008; Crespi, 2009). These effects of apamin persisted in the presence of GABAA and GABAB receptor blockers (Rouchet et al., 2008). Together with our work, these experiments suggest that serotonergic neurons would contribute disproportionately and be most sensitive to alterations in the expression of SK channels in this region.</p><p><italic>3) In the Results section the authors claim that difference in excitability did not result from changes in GABA tone mentioning data not shown. It would be important to show these data since there is literature showing that stress affects excitability of GABA neurons but not 5-HT neurons (e.g. Challis et al., 2013).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We have now included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Blockade of GABA-A and GABA-B receptors respectively with picrotoxin and CGP52432 did not attenuate the significant difference in the responsiveness of serotonin neurons between the single- and group-housed conditions. Note, it is essential to use picrotoxin instead of bicuculline for these experiments, since the latter has a known nonspecific effect of blocking SK channels (Khawaled et al., 1999).</p><p><italic>4) When measuring AHP amplitudes and areas, at which frequency were the cells firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>)? The authors report the same current step for all cells (25pA); because neurons from single-housed are hypoexcitable we can infer that the frequency is lower. This would bias the measures. Measures of medium AHP are normally taken after a depolarizing current step has been applied, and selecting the current step showing the same number of action potentials for all cells.</italic> </p><p>To measure AHP amplitudes and areas, we selected the minimal depolarizing current step required to elicit action potentials in these cells. We calculated the AHPs from the first spike generated in response to the rheobase current. The frequency of firing at this point is similar between the groups (group-housed; 5.8 ± 0.2 Hz, single-housed; 5.4 ± 0.2 Hz, two-tailed t-test p = 0.2). Of note, we found the frequency differences between the groups in response to stronger depolarizing current steps (&gt;250pA).</p><p><italic>5) Because of the heterogeneity of the dorsal raphe neurons, the authors need to specify more precisely the localisation of their recordings.</italic> </p><p>We now included this in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The requested revisions are minor and this should not need to go back for another round of review. The full text of the reviews is given below.</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) In their rebuttal, the authors explain the difference of their results with the Dankovski 2014 paper as a difference in protocol. However all the other supporting papers they cite have been done in rats (and they do not cite the Dankovski paper). If this is the first time the social separation model could be valuably transferred to mice, this would be worth mentioning more explicitly for future studies in mice.</italic> </p><p><italic>We thank the reviewer for noticing the requirement of additional references for mouse studies on social isolation. We now included additional references in the Introduction.</italic></p><p> <italic>2) In this regard, information about the mouse strain/gender of mice used in the different experiments is important; I could not find this info in the new version of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>We used only male mice in our study. The gender and the background of our mice are included in the Methods section.</italic></p><p> <italic>3) Results, subsection “Social isolation reduces excitability of 5-HT neurons”, first paragraph: explain what picrotoxin and CGP52432 are doing (as in the Methods).</italic> </p><p><italic>We added this information to this subsection.</italic> </p><p> <italic>4) Results, subsection “Systemic apamin treatment normalizes anxiety- and depressive-like 160 behaviors in socially isolated mice”, last paragraph: to see how the z-score was calculated, I went to &quot;Lin and Sibille 2015&quot;; this was a waste of time as the Methods only refers to Guilloux 2011. Suggestion is to keep only the useful reference.</italic> </p><p><italic>The Lin and Sibille 2015 reference is no longer included.</italic> </p><p> <italic>5) Conclusion - It is interesting that SK channels are a druggable compound for depression. Since this is not entirely new, as it had already been put forth and tested - to some extent - by Crespi in 2010, it may be useful to add a sentence as to why no one has really followed this up. Are there issues of toxicity? A need for more selective agents?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We now included in the Discussion what additional steps/approaches are required for targeting SK channels for treatment of depression. Including these points also gave us a chance to explain the translational aspect of our study with the goal of finding better treatment strategies for depression and anxiety.</p></body></sub-article></article>
