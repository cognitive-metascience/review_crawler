Here, we show that the antibiotic minocycline increases lifespan and reduces protein aggregation even in old, SSP-deficient <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> by targeting cytoplasmic ribosomes, preferentially attenuating translation of highly translated mRNAs. In contrast to most other longevity paradigms, minocycline inhibits rather than activates all major SSPs and extends lifespan in mutants deficient in the activation of SSPs, lysosomal or autophagic pathways. We propose that minocycline lowers the concentration of newly synthesized aggregation-prone proteins, resulting in a relative increase in protein-folding capacity without the necessity to induce protein-folding pathways. Our study suggests that in old individuals with incapacitated SSPs or autophagic pathways, pharmacological attenuation of cytoplasmic translation is a promising strategy to reduce protein aggregation. Altogether, it provides a geroprotecive mechanism for the many beneficial effects of tetracyclines in models of neurodegenerative disease.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

While the exact mechanism(s) of neuronal death in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and related maladies remain elusive, there is compelling genetic evidence for an age-associated collapse of proteostasis that contributes to protein aggregation and degenerative phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>). Most longevity mechanisms crucially depend on the ability to activate stress signaling pathways (SSPs) and proteostatic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steinkraus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tullet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henis-Korenblit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>). For example, a comprehensive study in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> by Shore et al. showed that the induction of SSPs is central and necessary for inducing longevity by 160 different RNAis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shore et al., 2012</xref>). Others have shown that as animals age, their ability to respond to stress dramatically declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dues et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence, longevity pathways whose mechanisms depend on the activation of SSPs can be predicted to become nonresponsive with aging.</p><p>Indeed, most longevity mechanisms, like the reduction of insulin/IGF signaling or a reduction in electron transport chain activity, do not extend lifespan when initiated past day 5 of <italic>C. elegans</italic> adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dillin et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dillin et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rangaraju et al., 2015</xref>). Proper timing is also required in Ames Dwarf mice, where growth hormone deficiency during the first 6 weeks of pre-pubertal development is critical for longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panici et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Ideally one would like to be able to enhance proteostasis capacity and to extend life- and healthspan by pharmacologically treating older organisms at the first appearance of neurodegenerative symptoms or disease biomarkers (e.g. protein aggregates). Fortunately, some longevity mechanisms such as dietary restriction or rapamycin treatment remain responsive later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weindruch and Walford, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). However, little is known about what distinguishes timing-specific longevity mechanisms from longevity mechanisms that remain responsive throughout life.</p><p>In this study, we identified minocycline, a drug known to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitra et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Festoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seabrook et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noble et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferretti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Obici et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013</xref>), to extend lifespan and to reduce protein aggregation even in old <italic>C. elegans</italic> that have lost their capacity to activate SSPs. Subsequent elucidation of the mechanism of action (MOA) shows minocycline to attenuate cytoplasmic translation independently of the integrated stress response (ISR), but mimicking its beneficial effects. We propose that the neuroprotective and aggregation-preventing effects of minocycline, observed in preclinical mouse models as well as in human clinical trials, are explained by its attenuation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis. Reducing the concentration of newly synthesized aggregation-prone proteins relieves demands on the proteostasis network even in older individuals in which SSPs and protein degradation pathways have already been compromised due to advanced age.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Minocycline extends <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan in both young and old animals</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the capacity for <italic>C. elegans</italic> to respond to stress declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bansal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). To expand on previous studies and to define the age at which major SSPs lose their capacity to respond to stress, we exposed transcriptional GFP-reporter strains that respond to oxidative stress (<italic>gst-4p::GFP</italic>) or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (<italic>hsp-4p::GFP</italic>, UPR<sup>ER</sup>), in the mitochondria (<italic>hsp-6p::GFP</italic>, UPR<sup>mt</sup>), or in the cytosol (<italic>hsp-16.2p::GFP</italic>) to their respective stressors -arsenite, tunicamycin, paraquat or heat- at increasing ages. On the first day as reproductive adults, herein defined as day 1, stressors increased GFP expression relative to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Recording dose response curves we determined an EC<sub>50</sub> of 22 μM and an optimal concentration of 50 – 100 μM, as compared to therapeutic concentrations measured in patient serum of 5 – 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agwuh and MacGowan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013</xref>).

This prediction was tested in two ways. First, we repeated the GFP reporter-based stress response activation experiments, pretreating day-5-old adults for 2 hr with minocycline before subjecting them to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, minocycline alone did not induce any SSP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Unexpectedly, pretreatment with minocycline suppressed stressor-induced activation of all SSP reporters compared to stressor alone. This was particularly surprising as previous studies have shown that treating larvae with minocycline activates the <italic>hsp-6p::GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houtkooper et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, in adults, minocycline inhibited the activation of all SSPs. Minocycline-induced inhibition of SSPs did not result in an increased susceptibility to stress. Minocycline-treated adults survived heat stress (35°C) much better than untreated adults, with 60% of the minocycline-treated animals still alive when nearly all control animals had died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, minocycline-treated adults were also much more resistant to paraquat-induced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that minocycline also protects neuronal-like rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells from paraquat-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).

Minocycline treatment caused a pronounced increase in the 80S monosome peak (M) indicative of stalled translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). It further showed a disproportionally strong reduction in the heavy polysome fraction (P), suggesting that minocycline reduced ribosomal load, the number of ribosomes per mRNA, of highly translated mRNAs. Thus, the observed reduction of ribosomal load by minocycline results in a substantial attenuation of highly translated mRNAs. The preferential effect on the heavy polysome fraction (P) provided a potential explanation for the greater inhibitory effect of minocycline on highly expressed proteins that we observed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> metabolic labeling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Upon heat shock, polysome-mediated translation allows cells to quickly synthesize large quantities of chaperones like HSP60 and HSP70. If minocycline attenuates polysome-mediated translation it should substantially suppress the heat shock-induced expression of HSP60 and HSP70 at the protein but not at the mRNA level. To test this, we pretreated HeLa cells with water or minocycline and subjected them to heat shock to measure HSP60 and HSP70 protein expression levels by western blot. As expected, HeLa cells strongly induced expression of HSP60 and HSP70 in response to a heat shock while pretreatment with minocycline dramatically reduced it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, minocycline only reduced HSP60 and HSP70 expression at the protein level and had no effect on the induction of their mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similarly, we revisited <italic>C. elegans</italic> and confirmed that minocycline suppressed the activation of <italic>hsp-16.2p::GFP</italic> at the protein but not at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, minocycline-treated cells activate stress responses at the level of mRNA but are unable to rapidly translate them into proteins as minocycline strongly attenuates polysome-mediated translation.</p><p>To extend these results to other stress responses such as the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, we repeated these experiments using HEK293<sup>DAX</sup> cells. HEK293<sup>DAX</sup> cells allow ligand-induced activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> in the absence of stress, as they express the UPR<sup>ER</sup> transcriptional activator ATF6 fused to mutant destabilized dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Because the DHFR domain is largely unfolded, the ATF6-DHFR fusion protein is continually degraded by the proteasome. The addition of trimethoprim (TMP) stabilizes the ATF6-DHFR fusion, leading to a dose-dependent expression of the chaperone BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, TMP treatment dramatically induced BiP expression that was completely suppressed by minocycline co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Using the aggregation-specific dye ProteoStat, we measured protein aggregation in HeLa cells before and after a 1 hr heat shock. The protein aggregate-induced fluorescence only increased in control cells upon heat shock (~12%), but not in minocycline-pretreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, as already observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, minocycline treatment protects from heat-shock-induced protein aggregation despite suppressing activation of the heat-shock response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Minocycline attenuates translation independent of the ISR</title><p>SSP activation leads to the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α, globally inhibiting translation initiation of all but a few mRNAs, generally referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). Minocycline could either attenuate translation through activation of the ISR or by directly targeting the cytoplasmic ribosome to interfere with translation. To distinguish between those possibilities, we made use of the ISR inhibitor ISRIB that prevents eIF2α phosphorylation-mediated translational inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). If minocycline activates the ISR to attenuate translation, co-treatment with ISRIB should restore normal translation even in the presence of minocycline. HeLa cells were treated with ISRIB, minocycline or both agents. Monitoring translation by [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine/cysteine incorporation showed that co-treatment with ISRIB did not impair the ability of minocycline to attenuate translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

By measuring protein concentrations by Bradford assay in young adults, prior to the generation of eggs, we further confirmed the independence of the two mechanisms. In <italic>rsks-1</italic> mutants, protein concentration was reduced by 18% (±8%) compared to N2. Treatment of <italic>rsks-1(ok1255)</italic> mutants with minocycline had an additive effect and further reduced protein concentration by an additional 26%, resulting in a total reduction of 44% (±8%, p=0.0018, Dunett) compared to N2.

However, two aspects of the dose-response curves were unexpected. First, minocycline increased lifespan by an average of more than 60% and up to 98% in the already long-lived <italic>rsks-1</italic> mutant. Second, the dose-response curves for all three strains started to decline between 100 and 200 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To identify such mechanisms, we searched for a geroprotective compound capable of extending lifespan and improving proteostasis in post-stress-responsive <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Using an unbiased chemo-proteomic approach, we identified the MOA by which minocycline extends lifespan and enhances proteostasis. Our ABPP data show that minocycline targets the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to attenuate translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), preferentially reducing polysome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), mimicking the protective effects of the ISR without working through this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

While the effect on longevity in old organisms is similar between minocycline and rapamycin, our epistasis analysis shows that minocycline differs with regards to some genetic requirements. Inhibition of mTOR signaling or S6 phosphorylation does not extend lifespan of TFEB/<italic>hlh-30</italic> mutants and requires the <italic>hsf-1</italic>-mediated heat-shock response to extend lifespan and to prevent protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seo et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, minocycline extends lifespan of <italic>hlh-30(tm1978)</italic> and of <italic>hsf-1(sy441</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and prevents protein aggregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells despite inhibiting the activation of the heat-shock response by <italic>hsf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prahlad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steinkraus et al., 2008</xref>). These differences raise the question on how translation attenuation by minocycline extends longevity independently from SSPs that are required for other translation-related mechanisms. A likely explanation stems from the way minocycline attenuates translation. Any mechanism that targets the 18S rRNA, the catalytic site of the ribosome, must non-selectively attenuate translation. In contrast, many other well-investigated interventions target translation initiation, which in principle allows for selective attenuation of translation of subgroups of mRNAs. For example, knock down of eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> has been shown to lead to a general attenuation of translation but also to a selective increase in translation of SSP-related mRNAs, which play a role in the protective effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, whether or not interventions lower translation selectively or non-selectively and thus involve SSPs is likely to depend on whether they target translation initiation or aspects of peptide bond formation. Previous studies used cycloheximide to show that blocking translation by interfering with the translocation step protects from protein aggregation, as newly synthesized proteins are the main protein species susceptible to damage and to collateral misfolding under stress. An obvious testable prediction of our minocycline data is that the protective effect of cycloheximide should also be independent of any SSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). If minocycline acts non-selectively, how is its effect greater on polysomes than on monosomes? Any single ribosome slowed down by minocycline will negatively affect all subsequent ribosomes on the same mRNA, thus amplifying the effect in a manner dependent on ribosome number. Future studies will be necessary to precisely elucidate these details.</p><p>Similar to minocycline, Smith et al. have shown that bacterial deprivation initiated in day-8-old <italic>C. elegans</italic> also extends lifespan, even as much as when initiating it at day 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Although not directly measured in this study, bacterial deprivation is also likely to dramatically reduce cytoplasmic translation, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steinkraus et al. (2008)</xref>. From a therapeutic perspective, mechanisms that prevent protein aggregation independently of the activation of the HSF1 network are especially interesting as the presence of pathological protein aggregates during disease already suggests an overtaxed protein folding machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balch et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Attenuation of translation is a core cellular protection mechanism. In response to stress, SSPs activate the ISR, which, through phosphorylation of eIF2α, selectively attenuates translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). Attenuation of translation provides the cell with a recovery period to restore proteostasis before translation resumes after dephosphorylating eIF2α. Recovery after stress is marked by intense translation of chaperone mRNAs like HSP70 or BiP that involves the formation of polysomes, taxing the preexisting proteostasis network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Novoa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2015</xref>). Commencing translation after a stressful event, before proteostasis is restored, results in the production of ROS and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2013</xref>). By attenuating translation, minocycline prolongs the period for proteostasis to recover similar to what has been observed for the PPP1R15A inhibitor Sephin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2015</xref>). By preferentially reducing polysome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), minocycline generally reduces peak load on the proteostasis network while still allowing for sufficient translation to maintain cellular function. Our discovery of the MOA of minocycline confirms the previous predictions made by Han et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2013</xref>) that limiting protein synthesis should protect from protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choe et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our proposed MOA also explains why the geroprotective effect of minocycline remains inducible into later age compared to many other mechanisms. Longevity mechanisms like reduced insulin/IGF signaling elicit geroprotective effects through the activation of SSPs. As SSPs are no longer inducible in post-stress-responsive adults, their geroprotective effects can no longer be activated in older animals, excluding the possibility that minocycline extends lifespan when initiated in post-stress responsive adults by directly inhibiting mitochondrial translation and the subsequent activation of the mitochondrial UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dillin et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dillin et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rangaraju et al., 2015</xref>). Minocycline bypasses the activation of SSPs or the ISR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to attenuate translation, eliciting geroprotective effects by lowering the concentration of newly synthesized, aggregation-prone proteins, aligning proteostatic load with the lower proteostasis network capacity in older adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Plate et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While it is not known whether minocycline extends lifespan in mammals, its geroprotective effects reduce age-associated protein aggregation and inflammation as evidenced by numerous preclinical and clinical studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The multitude of seemingly unrelated effects has been used to argue that tetracyclines act by a wide variety of distinct MOAs. Excitement about several clinically relevant findings was dampened by the lack of a clear MOA necessary to design eukaryote specific derivatives of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Metz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lampl et al., 2007</xref>). Our results shed new light on these observations. Translation attenuation by reducing ribosomal load as an MOA provides a simple and compelling explanation for these seemingly unrelated beneficial effects.</p><p>For example, minocycline reduces inflammation in peripheral tissues as well as in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferretti et al., 2012</xref>). Initiation of the inflammatory cascade is similar to the initiation of other stress responses and leads to the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP1 that induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α or nitric oxide synthase (NOS). While it has been previously suggested that the anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline are achieved by the inhibition of MMP9, translational attenuation of pro-inflammatory factors provides a compelling alternative. Similarly, the beneficial effects of minocycline in treating fragile X syndrome could also be explained by translational attenuation, as fragile X is caused by the failure to properly express the translational repressor FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>However, it is also important to note that minocycline showed some detrimental effects in a trial of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>). As expected from an antibiotic, minocycline-treated patients showed more adverse gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Whether or not minocycline was detrimental for ALS patients was later questioned on the basis that the used dosage was too high, exacerbating the negative side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leigh et al., 2008</xref>). Given that ALS patients show a hypermetabolic phenotype, the gastrointestinal adverse side effects may have masked beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jésus et al., 2018</xref>), making a minocycline-like compound that lacks the antibiotic activity highly desirable.</p><p>Repurposing FDA-approved drugs such as minocycline using phenotypic screens reveals promising effects outside the primary indication (antibiotic) of minocycline and inevitably leads to promising new drug target(s) and MOAs. Our data suggest that the antibiotic activity of minocycline compel a minocycline structure-activity relationship (SAR) campaign to improve eukaryotic translational attenuation while eliminating antibiotic and other activities. In summary, our studies on minocycline shed light on the plasticity of longevity mechanisms upon aging and reveal an MOA for minocycline that explains its geroprotective effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> <break/><italic>elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:N2_">WB-STRAIN:N2_</ext-link>(ancestral)</td><td>wild-type (Bristol)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>CL2166</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:CL2166">WB-STRAIN:CL2166</ext-link></td><td><italic>dvIs19 [(pAF15)gst</italic> <break/><italic>-4p::GFP::NLS]</italic> III</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>SJ4005</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:SJ4005">WB-STRAIN:SJ4005</ext-link></td><td><italic>zcIs4 [hsp-4::GFP</italic>] V</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>SJ4100</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:SJ4100">WB-</ext-link> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:SJ4100">STRAIN:SJ4100</ext-link></td><td><italic>zcIs13 [hsp-6::GFP]</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>CL2070</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:CL2070">WB-STRAIN:CL2070</ext-link></td><td><italic>dvIs70 [hsp-16.2p::GFP + rol-6(su1006)]</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>SJ17</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:SJ17">WB-S</ext-link> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:SJ17">TRAIN:SJ17</ext-link></td><td><italic>xbp-1(zc12) III;

Animals were collected on day 8, washed 3x with cold DPBS (Gibco, cat # 14190 – 136) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 50 μl 1.4 mm zirconium oxide beads (Precellys, cat # 03961-1-103) and 50 μl 0.5 mm glass beads (Precellys, cat # 03961-1-104) were added to each sample and animals were lysed using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer. Bradford assay (Bio-rad, cat # 5000002) was used to determine protein concentration for each sample for normalization. Proteome sample (1 mg) was treated with 100 mM IA-alkyne probe by adding 5 ml of a 10 mM probe stock (in DMSO). The labeling reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr, after which the samples were conjugated to isotopically labeled, TEV-cleavable tags (TEV tags) by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuACC or ‘click chemistry’). Heavy click chemistry reaction mixture (60 ml) was added to the water-treated control sample, and light reaction mixture (60 ml) was added to the minocycline-treated sample. The click reaction mixture consisted of TEV tags [10 ml of a 5 mM stock, light (minocycline-treated) or heavy (water treated)], CuSO4 (10 ml of a 50 mM stock in water), and tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl) amine (30 ml of a 1.7 mM stock in 4:1 tBuOH/DMSO), to which tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine (10 ml of a 50 mM stock) was added. The reaction was performed for 1 hr at room temperature. The light- and heavy-labeled samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C to harvest the precipitated proteins. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 500 ml of cold methanol by sonication, and the heavy and light samples were combined pairwise. Combined pellets were then washed with cold methanol, after which the pellet was solubilized by sonication in DPBS with 1.2% SDS.

This incubation was followed by the addition of 10% (by volume) of 1 mM iodoacetic acid (IAA) and a 30 min incubation at 30° in the dark. A total of 5 μg of trypsin was added to each sample and incubated overnight at 37°. Trypsinized samples were then cleaned up for mass spectrometry using PepClean columns (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s directions. Clean samples were dried in a speed vacuum and then resuspended in 10 μl of 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.

Conditions on the ABSCIEX 5600 were as follows: The source gas conditions were optimized for each experiment and were generally set to GS1 = 8–12, GS2 = 0, and curtain gas = 25. The source temperature was set to 150°. Information dependent acquisition experiments were run with a 2 s cycle time, with 0.5 ms accumulation time in the MS1 scan and up to 20 candidate ions per MS/MS time period. The m/z range in the MS1 scans was 400 – 1250 Da, and 100 – 1800 Da for the MS/MS scans. Target ions were excluded after two occurrences for 12 s to increase sequencing coverage.

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Translation attenuation by minocycline enhances longevity and proteostasis in old post-stress-responsive organisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Matt Kaeberlein as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Aric Rodgers (Reviewer #2) and Jan Gruber (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All of the reviewers are quite enthusiastic about the importance of this work and quality of the data. No major concerns were identified, although several minor concerns about interpretation and overstating the data were noted. The authors are encouraged to consider these referee comments and revise the text accordingly.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Solis et al. present a compelling model for the late life pro-longevity effects of minocycline: that it acts to selectively reduce translation of highly expressed, aggregation prone proteins, thereby delaying proteostatic collapse in aged cells and animals. The experiments appear to be well-conducted and there are several interesting and cool observations here that move the field forward. I have only relatively minor suggestions.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) It is mentioned that CR and rapamycin can both extend lifespan when initiated late in life in mice. It would be worth noting in the Discussion that this has also been shown to be true for bacterial deprivation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Smith et al., <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>2008) where initiating food deprivation at day 8 extends lifespan as much as initiating the treatment at day 4 or day 2. This could conceivably work via a similar mechanism to minocycline as complete food deprivation is almost certain to dramatically reduce cytoplasmic translation.</p><p>2) It is perhaps an overstatement to say that minocycline &quot;did not result in an increased susceptibility to stress&quot;, when this is only shown for heat stress. Were other stressors tested? If not, then perhaps qualify this statement a bit.</p><p>3) Figure 2—figure supplement 1C is missing the legend.</p><p>4) The interpretation of the autophagy experiments may also be a bit overstated. Unless you are working with autophagy null mutations, the fact that minocycline can still extend these mutants can't be definitively interpreted. Perhaps better to say that the data are consistent with the model that the MOA for minocycline does not act through autophagy. If you really want to strengthen this, you could look for induction of autophagy via a variety of methods.</p><p>5) I would soften the statement in the Discussion that the &quot;MOA of minocycline is clearly distinct from other interventions targeting translation&quot;. While I agree that the genetic epistasis data support this model, they do not rule out the possibility that there are overlapping but partially distinct mechanisms at play. It is also possible that some interventions require HSF-1 and/or HLH-30 for indirect reasons without those factors being causally downstream in the mechanism of lifespan extension.</p><p>6) I would be careful about saying that mechanisms like &quot;the UPRmt elicit geroprotective effects through the activation of SSPs&quot;. Multiple labs have now shown that the UPRmt (or at least induction of all the factors commonly referred to as the UPRmt) is not in fact geroprotective.

It would be worth noting in the Discussion that this has also been shown to be true for bacterial deprivation in C. elegans (Smith et al., 2008) where initiating food deprivation at day 8 extends lifespan as much as initiating the treatment at day 4 or day 2.

Were other stressors tested? If not, then perhaps qualify this statement a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, which was also raised by reviewer #3 (second point), we have added additional data. We have now included an experiment showing minocycline protects from paraquat-induced oxidative stress despite blocking the stress reporter response to paraquat. After 24 hour 100mM PQ treatment, 75% of 100 μm minocycline-treated animals are still alive compared to 44% in control animals. We have also provided additional references in the literature with examples of minocycline protecting from paraquat-induced cell death.</p><p>Amended text inserted into the Results section:</p><p>“Furthermore, minocycline-treated adults were also much more resistant to paraquat-induced oxidative stress (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).

Unless you are working with autophagy null mutations, the fact that minocycline can still extend these mutants can't be definitively interpreted. Perhaps better to say that the data are consistent with the model that the MOA for minocycline does not act through autophagy.</p></disp-quote><p>To remedy our overstatement we changed the text describing the results as follows:</p><p>“Despite the severe behavioral and morphological phenotypes observed in the <italic>unc-51(e369)</italic> mutants, the mutation did not reduce the ability of minocycline to extend lifespan. Minocycline also extended the lifespan of <italic>hlh-30(tm1978)</italic> mutants, but less than the 45% observed in N2. These genetic results, and the previous finding that activation of autophagy in already old <italic>C. elegans</italic> is likely to be (Wilhelm et al., 2017) are consistent with a mechanisms of minocycline that acts in part independently of the activation of autophagy. However, as <italic>unc-51</italic> is essential, the residual activity remaining in the <italic>unc-51(e369)</italic> mutants does not allow us to draw a definitive conclusion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I would soften the statement in the Discussion that the &quot;MOA of minocycline is clearly distinct from other interventions targeting translation&quot;. While I agree that the genetic epistasis data support this model, they do not rule out the possibility that there are overlapping but partially distinct mechanisms at play. It is also possible that some interventions require HSF-1 and/or HLH-30 for indirect reasons without those factors being causally downstream in the mechanism of lifespan extension.</p></disp-quote><p>All three reviewers had similar concerns regarding the relation of the mechanism of minocycline to other translation-related mechanisms. After some considerations we agree that minocycline is likely to act on a mechanism that overlaps with previous mechanisms. The observed differences are likely the result of whether translation is inhibited during the initiation step or during the elongation/translocation steps during peptide bond formation. Targeting the initiation step can conceivably lead to selective inhibition of translation that allows translation of stress response factors as shown for <italic>igf-1</italic> while targeting the peptide bond formation with drugs such as minocycline or cycloheximide will be non-selective. We have replaced the previous section with a longer, and hopefully more nuanced explanation. We amended the passage as follows:</p><p>“While the effect on longevity in old organisms is similar between minocycline and rapamycin, our epistasis analysis shows that minocycline differs with regards to some genetic requirements. Inhibition of mTOR signaling or S6 phosphorylation does not extend lifespan of TFEB/<italic>hlh-30</italic> mutants and requires the <italic>hsf-1</italic>-mediated heat shock response to extend lifespan and to prevent protein aggregation (Robida-Stubbs et al., 2012; Lapierre et al., 2013; Seo et al., 2013). In contrast, minocycline extends lifespan of <italic>hlh-30(tm1978)</italic> and of <italic>hsf-1(sy441</italic>) mutants (Figure 2)and prevents protein aggregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells despite inhibiting the activation of the heat shock response by <italic>hsf-1</italic> (Figure 2B-D; Figure 4C-F) (Prahlad et al., 2008; Steinkraus et al., 2008). These differences raise the question on how translation attenuation by minocycline extends longevity independently from SSPs that are required for other translation-related mechanisms. A likely explanation stems from the way minocycline attenuates translation. Any mechanism that targets the 18S rRNA, the catalytic site of the ribosome, must non-selectively attenuate translation. In contrast, many other well-investigated interventions target translation initiation which in principle allows for selective attenuation of translation of subgroups of mRNAs. For example, knock down of eIF4G/ <italic>ifg-1</italic> has been shown to lead to a general attenuation of translation but also to a selective increase in translation of SSP-related mRNAs, which play a role in the protective effect (Rogers et al., 2011). Thus, whether or not interventions lower translation selectively or non-selectively and thus involve SSPs is likely to depend on whether they target translation initiation or aspects of peptide bond formation. Previous studies used cycloheximide to show that blocking translation by interfering with the translocation step protects from protein aggregation, as newly synthesized proteins are the main protein species susceptible to damage and to collateral misfolding under stress. An obvious testable prediction of our minocycline data is that the protective effect of cycloheximide should also be independent of any SSPs (Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008). If minocycline acts non-selectively, how is its effect greater on polysomes than on monosomes? Any single ribosome slowed down by minocycline will negatively affect all subsequent ribosomes on the same mRNA, thus amplifying the effect in a manner dependent on ribosome number. Future studies will be necessary to precisely elucidate these details.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I would be careful about saying that mechanisms like &quot;the UPRmt elicit geroprotective effects through the activation of SSPs&quot;. Multiple labs have now shown that the UPRmt (or at least induction of all the factors commonly referred to as the UPRmt) is not in fact geroprotective. Indeed, the UPRmt (or at least induction of all the factors commonly referred to as the UPRmt) is neither necessary nor sufficient to extend lifespan. I realize that the Dillin and Auwerx labs choose to ignore these data and propagate their own &quot;alternative facts&quot; rather than address the gaping holes in their model, but perhaps you want to pick a different example stress response pathway for this particular phrase.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern by amending the sentence as follows:</p><p>“Longevity mechanisms like reduced insulin/IGF signaling elicit geroprotective effects through the activation of SSPs.”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results in Figures 1E and 2B are quite remarkable and the study is of high interest.

See reviewer #1 point 5. The major point that we have to concede that we cannot knock out, or even mutate the 18S rRNA (there are over 100 copies), to show that when missing, minocycline fails to protect. We have increased the 18 rRNA level using the <italic>nCl<sup>-</sup>1</italic> mutant to show that the dose response curve shifts to the left. This constitutes a quantitative prediction which few models are able to make. Our current, long-term strategy is to generate new compounds that attenuate translation like minocycline but are non-antibiotic, but this is well beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>Translational suppression per se is protective: We completely agree that stress reduces translation and that this is a major part of the cells protective response. We respectfully disagree on the notion that there is little evidence that inhibition of translation per se improves protein folding. The following papers show that newly synthesized proteins are the ones most susceptible to damage and protein aggregation, and thus, that reducing de-novo synthesis per se will reduce protein aggregation.</p><p>The earliest paper we are aware of is from A. Goldberg’s group that shows that stressors like heat or paraquat lead to the preferential degradation of newly-synthesized proteins that are less than 1 hour old. If degradation of newly-synthesized proteins upon stress is prevented, they aggregate. Older proteins (&gt; 1 hr old), despite being measurably damaged by fore example paraquat, do not tend to aggregate. This finding reveals that for a protein, being newly-synthesized contributes more to the propensity to aggregate than being damaged. Pretreatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of new proteins and thus protein aggregation, clearly showing that inhibition of translation per se prevents protein aggregation. (Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008). Later, Borchelt’s group came to the same conclusions using in mammalian cells (Xu et al., 2016) by showing again that pretreating HEK293 and other cells with cycloheximide prevents protein aggregation. These results cannot be explained by any model requiring a selective translation of, for example, chaperone mRNAs, as cycloheximide indiscriminately blocks translation directly within the ribosome and because only newly synthesized proteins are affected. These studies provide clear evidence that newly synthesized proteins are the ones mostly prone to aggregation and that reducing protein synthesis per se is protective. To extend the data regarding minocycline we now provided a new figure that shows that minocycline not only increases resistance to heat but also to paraquat as was shown in the Goldberg study. Protection from paraquat is achieved despite the data in Figure 2 that show that minocycline inhibits the oxidative stress response and the response to paraquat directly. It is also remarkable that minocycline reduces protein aggregation, despite also reducing proteasome activity, which clearly should increase the formation of aggregates.</p><p>While this has not been shown in the above cited papers, our data would predict that cycloheximide would also block activation of the heat shock and oxidative stress responses. Work by Rong Li’s lab goes one step further and suggests that reducing protein synthesis not only protects from protein aggregation by reducing the folding load but that protein aggregation requires new polypeptide synthesis (Zhou et al., 2014). Additional studies to that effect come from Bertolotti and colleagues (Das et al., 2015) and Kaufman and colleagues (Han et al., 2013). These previous studies by multiple different labs clearly confirm the notion that inhibition of translation per se is protective.</p><p>Selective vs. non-selective inhibition of translation: As we outlined in the new paragraph (see reviewer #1 point 5), a likely explanation on how the longevity genetics of interventions that target translation differ, is that targeting initiation factors can lead to a selective attenuation of translation as shown for <italic>ifg-1</italic>, while targeting the peptide forming machinery directly does not (minocycline, cycloheximide). Interventions directly targeting the peptide-forming activity within the ribosome, as we suggest for minocycline, cannot depend on the activation of a stress response, as the stress response factors will not be expressed at the protein level. Any model that requires the induction of a pathway and hence protein synthesis can be excluded as the mechanism of action for inhibitors that directly target the catalytic site of the ribosome.</p><p>We agree however that it is counterintuitive that inhibition of translation per se directly at the ribosome is protective. While this can be explained easily for short-term interventions like the use of cycloheximide, long-term use is certainly more problematic. We show that a well tolerated FDA-approved drug that is known to have beneficial effects in aggregation diseases in humans in clinical trials acts by such a mechanism and that directly targeting the ribosome may be a valuable therapeutic strategy, provided that it attenuates translation and does not shut it down completely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible that mino helps prevent aggregation directly? Perhaps this could be tested in vitro?</p></disp-quote><p>In principle this could be tested, but for what protein? To prevent heat shock-induced protein aggregation for all proteins, as shown in Figure 4F, one would have to postulate that minocycline selectively binds any misfolded protein and then restores folding. The much simpler explanation, especially since reviewer #2 agrees that minocycline attenuates translation, is that minocycline prevents protein aggregation in the same manner as was shown for cycloheximide, by preventing de novo protein synthesis as newly synthesized proteins are the ones most prone to aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Its ability to extend lifespan in a sick (hsf-1) mutant is especially provocative. Is its function somehow bypassing the need for some HSF-1 gene targets? The possibility that the mechanism involved is simply preventing de novo synthesis of aggregation-prone proteins is not convincing. Where is the evidence for that? Select changes in protein synthesis (i.e., differential translation) pointed to selective depletion of factors for ribosome biosynthesis (Figure 3) as well as other highly translated factors according to polysome status (Figure 4). Is that what is meant by &quot;aggregation prone proteins?&quot; I suppose that is one way of characterizing them (and a lot of other factors). All of this should be more thoroughly argued in the manuscript.</p><p>Results show near-instantaneous protection (2 hour treatment with minocycline), so why measure proteome after 3 days of treatment? If protection is conferred so rapidly, what is the point at reading the proteome 3 days after treatment? Rapid (2 hour) protection from unfolded protein stress is highly unlikely to be proteome based unless it is through post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation). This should be more thoroughly addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-written a part of the Discussion (see also reviewer #1 point 5), highlighting previous findings that show that blocking translation protects from protein aggregation. In mammalian cells, even a 30 min pretreatment with cycloheximide confers the same near instantaneous protection from protein aggregation as we see with minocycline because newly-synthesized proteins are the protein species most susceptible to damage, misfolding and protein aggregation (Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008; Xu et al., 2016). Blocking protein synthesis per se by cycloheximide is protective because it is the newly synthesized proteins that have a much larger propensity to aggregate. Minocycline and cycloheximide target the catalytic center of the ribosome, making it difficult to envision how such an effect could lead to selective translation. The pronounced effect on polysomes is caused by a collateral effect in which a single slow ribosome slows all subsequent ribosomes thus amplifying any effect in a manner dependent on the number for ribosomes per mRNA.</p><p>Different timings: To test if minocycline generally inhibits translation we used a 2 hr incubation (Figure 2, GFP and Figure 4, <sup>35</sup>S) to mirror image the experiments previously done with cycloheximide. However, in Figure 3 we also considered the existence of selective translation and whether there are proteins whose translation is not inhibited by minocycline. Even if changes in translation are instantaneous, to be able to detect changes using proteomics depends on translation and degradation rates and thus the differences will take much longer to become detectable. Because of the near proteome-wide reduction of translation, which could have been the result of a normalization problem, a serious difficulty regarding all experiments in which translation is inhibited globally, we asked if the effect of minocycline depends on the translation rates of the animals. From our previous work and work by others we knew that translation rates are substantially reduced by day 5 of adulthood. Thus, if minocycline acts on translation, it must take longer to detect effects on the proteome in older animals (low translation) than in younger animals (high translation), which is what we observed. It is also noteworthy that the few proteins that show higher levels in minocycline-treated animals, like RPS-15, are negatively associated with lifespan, in that they extend lifespan when their expression is lowered (Rodrigues et al., 2012;). The three proteasome-related factors that showed an increase in expression had no functional consequence since measuring proteasomal activity was reduced (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). While this needs experimental confirmation, the higher levels of these factors are more likely to be result of the reduced proteasome activity resulting from minocycline treatment. To clarify this, we have added the following paragraph to the manuscript:</p><p>“These data were largely inconsistent with a model in which minocycline selectively reduced translation, as has been shown for <italic>ifg-1</italic>. The few factors that showed higher expression levels in minocycline-treated animals had no known link to stress resistance or were shown to increase lifespan when knocked down by RNAi.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Given that minocycline is inhibiting translation, it may be better to measure transcription of stress response pathway genes directly as opposed to using transcriptional reporters (Figure 1), which depend on translation to produce fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. In the previous version of the manuscript we have only done this for the cell culture experiments but in the revised version we have now measured transcriptional levels of a panel of heat shock proteins. These are all activated in response to heat shock as shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C. While we have not verified the expression of these factors upon heat shock on the protein level, the proteomic data suggest that in the un-induced state all “hsp-” proteins are expressed at a lower level in minocycline-treated animals than in untreated animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;growth&quot; is misspelled, end of the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the catch, corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is important to consider differential translation and de novo synthesis when doing western blots to look at changes in HSPs in a system that suppresses total cellular translation.

However, our results showing that minocycline acts independently of any of the known major stress response transcription factors strongly argues against the selective translation of stress response factors and clearly favors the model in which reduced translation per se is protective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic regulatory agency-approved for the treatment of acne&quot;.

We therefore decided to show the middle, representative experiment in Figure 1 (+81%). However, the table should have said +159%, + 81% and +100%.

This enhanced extension suggests that minocycline not only extends lifespan as in N2 but also rescues some of the defects associated with mutated <italic>hsf-1(sy441)</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion, it may be worthwhile to re-iterate the observation that rapamycin also has benefits in aged animals and relate this to the role of rsks<sup>-1</sup> on translation downstream of mTOR.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our revised paragraph in the Discussion starting with:</p><p>“While the effect on longevity in old organisms is similar between minocycline and rapamycin, our epistasis analysis…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, looking at minocycline and its use in humans, in addition to the protective / beneficial effects listed in Table 1, there are some reports of detrimental effects, especially in the context of some auto-immune diseases. Maybe it would be worth discussing evidence (if any) whether these may be related to the effect on translation, its antibiotic efficacy or are completely unrelated. I appreciate that nothing may be known about this, but it strikes me as a point worth touching on when discussing translational potential.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for this point. As an example for problematic effects we chose to discuss the ALS trials with minocycline that actually showed some detrimental effects:</p><p>However, it is also important to note that minocycline showed some detrimental effects in a trial of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Gordon et al., 2007). As expected from an antibiotic, minocycline-treated patients showed more adverse gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Whether or not minocycline was detrimental for ALS patients was later questioned on the basis that the used dosage was too high, exacerbating the negative side effects (Leigh et al., 2008). Given that ALS patients show a hypermetabolic phenotype, the gastrointestinal adverse side effects may have masked beneficial effects (Jesus et al., 2018), making a minocycline-like compound that lacks the antibiotic activity highly desirable.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may be worth comparing the doses used here (e.g. in tissue culture) to typical therapeutic concentrations in humans (e.g. in plasma).</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentence was added to the manuscript:</p><p>“Recording dose response curves we determined an EC<sub>50</sub> of 22 μM and an optimal concentration of 50-100 μM, as compared to therapeutic concentrations measured in patient serum of 5-10 μM (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) (Agwuh and MacGowan, 2006; Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
