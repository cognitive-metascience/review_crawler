GTPases and co-assemble into hetero-oligomers and cytoskeletal filaments. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, five septins comprise two species of hetero-octamers, Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1. Slow GTPase activity by Cdc12 directs the choice of incorporation of Cdc11 vs Shs1, but many septins, including Cdc3, lack GTPase activity. We serendipitously discovered that guanidine hydrochloride rescues septin function in <italic>cdc10</italic> mutants by promoting assembly of non-native Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1 hexamers. We provide evidence that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cdc3 guanidinium occupies the site of a ‘missing’ Arg side chain found in other fungal species where (i) the Cdc3 subunit is an active GTPase and (ii) Cdc10-less hexamers natively co-exist with octamers. We propose that guanidinium reactivates a latent septin assembly pathway that was suppressed during fungal evolution in order to restrict assembly to octamers. Since homodimerization by a GTPase-active human septin also creates hexamers that exclude Cdc10-like central subunits, our new mechanistic insights likely apply throughout phylogeny.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a cell to work and perform its role, it relies on molecules called proteins that are made up of chains of amino acids. Individual proteins can join together like pieces in a puzzle to form larger, more complex structures. How the protein subunits fit together depends on their individual shapes and sizes.</p><p>Many cells contain proteins called septins, which can assemble into larger protein complexes that are involved in range of cellular processes. The number of subunits within these complexes differs between organisms and sometimes even between cell types in the same organism. For example, yeast typically have eight subunits within a septin protein complex and struggle to survive when the number of septin subunits is reduced to six. Whereas other organisms, including humans, can make septin protein complexes containing six or eight subunits. However, it is poorly understood how septin proteins are able to organize themselves into these different sized complexes.</p><p>Now, Johnson et al. show that a chemical called guanidinium helps yeast make complexes containing six septin subunits. Guanidinium has many similarities to the amino acid arginine. Comparing septins from different species revealed that one of the septin proteins in yeast lacks a key arginine component. This led Johnson et al. to propose that when guanidinium binds to septin at the site where arginine should be, this steers the septin protein towards the shape required to make a six-subunit complex.</p><p>These findings reveal a new detail of how some species evolved complexes consisting of different numbers of subunits. This work demonstrates a key difference between complexes made up of six septin proteins and complexes which are made up of eight, which may be relevant in how different human cells adapt their septin complexes for different purposes. It may also become possible to use guanidinium to treat genetic diseases that result from the loss of arginine in certain proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>septins</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>guanidine</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM086603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIRGD-12-241119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rare Genomics Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BeHEARD Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMurray</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INSB-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertin</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LBX-0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertin</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1615138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Anum</given-names></name><name><surname>Galdfelter</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A naturally-occurring small molecule acts as a chemical chaperone in vivo to alter the folding of a budding yeast septin and promote an oligomerization pathway that was lost during evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Septin proteins are found in nearly every eukaryotic lineage, with the exception of land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auxier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishihama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Onishi and Pringle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pan et al., 2007</xref>). In most extant organisms studied to date, multiple septin proteins co-assemble into linear, rod-shaped hetero-oligomers with at least some potential to polymerize into filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oh and Bi, 2011</xref>). Septin hetero-oligomers are now known to contribute functionally to a wide variety of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dolat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saarikangas and Barral, 2011</xref>). A number of human diseases and disorders, ranging from cancer to male infertility, have been linked to septin dysregulation or mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dolat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saarikangas and Barral, 2011</xref>), but within our understanding of septin roles in cellular function one common theme emerges: the ability to assemble into quaternary complexes is key.</p><p>All distinct septins share clear homology, but phylogenetic analysis reveals septin groups and subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pan et al., 2007</xref>) that can accurately predict which septin occupies which subunit position within hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakahira et al., 2010</xref>). However, the subtleties of the distinctions between septins that drive assembly of hetero-oligomers with precise subunit organization remain incompletely understood. Moreover, the oligomerization interfaces have not diverged drastically from the ancestral form, as nearly all septins retain the ability to homo-oligomerize in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Versele et al., 2004</xref>) whether or not they do so in vivo. How cells assemble specific septin hetero-oligomers to meet functional demands represents a major focus of septin research. More generally, septins provide a powerful model to study the mechanisms by which multisubunit complexes are assembled with high efficiency and fidelity in living cells.</p><p>Septins clearly evolved from an ancestral GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leipe et al., 2002</xref>) but multiple septins subsequently lost the ability to hydrolyze GTP. Unlike the building blocks of polymers of the other cytoskeletal NTPases actin and tubulin (and their prokaryotic counterparts), in native septin hetero-oligomers most, if not all, of the septin nucleotide-binding pockets are buried within an oligomerization interface, called the G interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>). Particularly for septin complexes in budding yeast, where hetero-octamers polymerize into filaments via the other, so-called ‘NC’ septin-septin interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>), burial of GTP in G interfaces within highly stable complexes severely limits the potential for cycles of GTP binding, hydrolysis, and exchange to modulate the assembly and disassembly of septin filaments. Nonetheless, most septins retain sequences clearly corresponding to regions/motifs in other small GTPases that contact bound nucleotide and/or change conformation upon GTP hydrolysis. These include the G1/Walker/P-loop, residues of which contact each of the three phosphates; the G2/Switch I and G3/Switch II loops, which are in proximity to the γ phosphate when it is present but are in distinct locations when it is absent; and the G4 motif, which contacts the base and dictates specificity for guanosine nucleotides. The question of what roles GTP binding and hydrolysis play in septin biogenesis and function has been a major focus in septin research for over two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchison and Field, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The baker’s yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, has been at the forefront of septin research, for a number of reasons. The repertoire of septin proteins expressed in yeast (seven) is much simpler than that of humans (13). Two yeast septins are expressed and function specifically during the process of sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Virgilio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fares et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heasley and McMurray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pablo-Hernando et al., 2008</xref>), a version of gametogenesis, leaving five septins expressed in nearly stoichiometric amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>) in mitotically dividing cells: Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1. Yeast septin localization during the mitotic cell division cycle is primarily restricted to the cortex, where septins take the form of filamentous rings at the mother-bud neck that undergo a series of discrete structural transitions as the bud emerges and grows and cytokinesis and cell separation take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oh and Bi, 2011</xref>). Septin filament assembly is essential for proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McMurray et al., 2011</xref>), hence defects in septin folding and oligomerization translate into clear defects in yeast colony/culture growth. A combination of molecular genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iwase et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McMurray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nagaraj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Versele et al., 2004</xref>), biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Versele et al., 2004</xref>), and structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bertin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sirajuddin et al., 2007</xref>) approaches have demonstrated that two kinds of hetero-octamers co-exist, with a linear hexameric core of the order Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3–Cdc12 ‘capped’ at each end with either Cdc11 or Shs1. While the functional basis for yeast octamer diversity remains largely unknown, at the level of quaternary structure septins are best understood in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>We are most interested in the mechanisms of assembly of septin hetero-oligomers, and previously used mutants isolated in unbiased genetic screens to elucidate roles in this process for nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weems et al., 2014</xref>) and interactions with cytosolic chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>), including the fungal disaggregase Hsp104, a hexameric AAA+ ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sweeny and Shorter, 2016</xref>). Here we report that the function of specific septin mutants is affected in unexpected ways by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), a small molecule used for decades to inhibit Hsp104 ATPase activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Derkatch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung and Masison, 2001</xref>). Our findings reveal important roles for specific residues and structural motifs in septin hetero-oligomer assembly, suggest a series of key events during fungal septin evolution that enforced incorporation of Cdc10 subunits in hetero-oligomers, and provide what is, to our knowledge, the first evidence that guanidinium (Gdm) has the potential to functionally replace Arg residues in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GdnHCl restores high-temperature septin function to <italic>cdc10</italic> mutants in an Hsp104-independent manner</title><p>We previously reported interactions between an ATPase-dead mutant of Hsp104 and a temperature-sensitive (TS) mutant of Cdc10, in which overexpression of the mutant Hsp104 inhibited the proliferation of <italic>cdc10(D182N)</italic> cells at an otherwise permissive low temperature (27°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>).

Indeed, even at temperatures permissive in the absence of GdnHCl for septin ring incorporation of Cdc10(D182N)-GFP, in the presence of 3 mM GdnHCl the fluorescence of Cdc10(D182N)-GFP was restricted to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). WT Cdc10-GFP continued to localize to the bud neck despite the presence of GdnHCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, in diploid cells co-expressing Cdc10-mCherry and Cdc10(D182N)-GFP, the addition of GdnHCl specifically eliminated Cdc10(D182N) incorporation in septin rings, with no obvious effect on WT Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Our results suggest that when mutations within the Cdc10 G interface perturb the ability of Cdc10 to acquire a conformation that binds tightly to Cdc3, GdnHCl allows other Cdc3 molecules to outcompete the mutant Cdc10 proteins for occupancy of the Cdc3 G interface, ultimately co-assembling with Cdc11, Cdc12, and Shs1 into Cdc10-less hexamers capable of robust septin functions. As predicted from this model, GdnHCl was unable to rescue <italic>cdc10∆</italic> growth when Cdc3 carried a mutation (W364A) previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McMurray et al., 2011</xref>) to block Cdc3 homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GdnHCl promotes Cdc10-less filament assembly in vitro by purified, recombinant complexes</title><p>Yeast septin function is regulated (in poorly defined ways) by a large number of pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Longtine and Bi, 2003</xref>), which might be altered by GdnHCl to indirectly promote Cdc3 homodimerization. GdnHCl might also alter other properties of Cdc10-less yeast cells to promote septin function despite inefficient Cdc3 homodimerization.

At 22°C, 0.375 mM of any single drug had no noticeable effect on growth; slight growth inhibition of both WT and mutant cells was observed when the total concentration of GdnHCl plus derivative was 0.75 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

It is also possible that yeast cells are less permeable to these GdnHCl derivatives. Urea did not rescue at all, possibly because it cannot form a cation.

To begin to understand the molecular mechanism by which Gdm at this position promotes Cdc3 homodimerization, we first examined 13 available septin crystal structures and asked which other residues are nearby the residue in the position equivalent to Thr302. The only non-α4-helix residue within 5 Å in every structure was a highly conserved His (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) residing in a loop at the end of the β4 strand previously dubbed the ‘<italic>trans</italic> loop 1’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weirich et al., 2008</xref>), the same His predicted by our in silico modeling to contact bound Gdm in Cdc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The Gdm moeity of SEPT2 Arg198 (residue corresponding to Thr302 in Cdc3) is also within ~ 3 Å of the backbone amide carbonyl of His158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and thus is equally well located to position His158. In CrSEPT and SEPT9•GTPγS, the Arg198 equivalent instead contacts the Glu202 equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus in some but not all septins the Gdm moiety of the α4 Arg is ideally positioned to contact the <italic>trans</italic> loop 1 His and thereby potentially bias partner choice during septin G dimerization. By contacting His262, Gdm bound near Thr302 in Cdc3 could bias Cdc3 towards homodimerization and away from heterodimerization with Cdc10.</p><p>To look for additional evidence in support of this model, we next asked which other residues are located in the vicinity (≤5 Å) of the <italic>trans</italic> loop 1 His in 13 available septin crystal structures.

Apart from the α4 helix, the Switch II loop, and adjacent <italic>trans</italic> loop 1 residues, residues within 5 Å of the His fell within only two other regions: the P-loop and the Switch I loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These are precisely the regions wherein we found non-conservative G interface substitutions between fungal species that tolerate <italic>CDC10</italic> deletion and those that do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In that study, we showed that a Switch II mutation in Cdc12 is sufficient to bias partner choice. In an independent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weems et al., 2014</xref>), we found that a spontaneous mutation (D210G) in the equivalent Switch II residue in Cdc3 restores the ability of Cdc3 to interact with a nucleotide-free mutant Cdc10 at high temperatures.

Our model predicts that in <italic>cdc3(D210G)</italic> cells Gdm should be less able to exclude the mutant Cdc10 than in cells expressing WT Cdc3, because the mutant Cdc3 Switch II will be unable to accomplish the molecular contact(s) with the Cdc3 <italic>trans</italic> loop 1 that Gdm promotes.

In fact, there was a perfect correlation between the presence of the catalytic Thr (or Ser) and the α4 Arg whose Gdm group is presumably mimicked by Gdm in Cdc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Analogous to our model of Cdc12 G-partner choice via slow GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weems and McMurray, 2017</xref>), we reasoned that in a species with an active ‘Cdc3’ GTPase, a transient ‘Cdc3’•GTP molecule might prefer to dimerize with ‘Cdc10’ in that species, and ‘Cdc3’•GDP might prefer to form a homodimer, bypassing ‘Cdc10’ incorporation into septin complexes.</p><p>According to this model, because <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, <italic>Ashbya</italic>, and <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> species express catalytically dead Cdc3 molecules, only Cdc3•GTP exists in these cells, and only Cdc10-containing hetero-octamers are made. In <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic>, on the other hand, the Cdc3 homolog, AspB, possesses the catalytic Thr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), and this species is known to produce a mix of octamers containing AspD (the Cdc10 homolog) and AspD-less hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hernández-Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>). We replaced the GTPase domain of ScCdc3 (residues 95–341) with that of AspB (residues 6–234; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and assessed Cdc10 incorporation into complexes by measuring the ratio of Cdc10-mCherry to Shs1-GFP in septin rings of living cells. Consistent with our model, Cdc10-mCherry incorporation was markedly reduced compared to cells with WT Cdc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), indicating that the GTPase properties of AspB were sufficient to confer <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-like pathways of septin hetero-oligomer assembly, that is, frequent bypass of Cdc10 incorporation.</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells expressing the Cdc3-AspB chimera as the only source of Cdc3 were unable to proliferate at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We hypothesized that this defect reflects misfolding at high temperature of the Cdc3-AspB chimera to a conformation incapable of interacting with itself or with Cdc10, and searched for spontaneous suppressors of the TS phenotype. We obtained a suppressor in which proliferation at 37°C was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Sequencing the coding region of Cdc10 revealed a single nucleotide change causing the amino acid substitution Q265H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>); the Cdc3-AspB chimera was unchanged. In most septin structures, His in this position makes a critical contact across the G interface with a highly conserved Trp residue in the ‘Sep4’ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pan et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), the same Trp we mutated in the <italic>cdc3(W364A)</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Since Gln replaces His here in ScCdc10 (and in the other fungal species with putatively GTPase-dead Cdc3 homologs; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), the Cdc3•GTP–Cdc10•GDP interface must involve a different kind of interaction. We interpret these findings as evidence that stable association of Cdc10•GDP with GDP-bound Cdc3-AspB, rather than the Cdc3•GTP with which Cdc10 co-evolved, requires His–Trp contacts between Sep4 motifs of the sort found in other dimers between two GDP-bound septins. Indeed, incorporation of Cdc10-mCherry into septin rings was partially restored in <italic>cdc3-aspB cdc10(Q265H)</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Finally, Gdm was unable to fully rescue the TS phenotype of the <italic>cdc3-aspB CDC10<sup>+</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), as expected if the site of Gdm action is occluded by the α4 Arg present in the Cdc3-AspB chimera. These data provide further support for the idea that during evolution ScCdc3 lost the ability to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and, consequently, the option of assembling septin complexes without a central Cdc10 homodimer.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Co-variation among fungal species of the “catalytic Thr” in Cdc3 homologs and His in the Cdc10 trans loop 1.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th><italic>Species</italic></th><th><italic>Amino acid at position <break/>corresponding to ScCdc3 Lys181</italic></th><th><italic>Amino acid at position <break/>corresponding to ScCdc10 Lys155</italic></th><th><italic>Amino acid at position corresponding <break/>to ScCdc10 Gln265</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></td><td>Lys</td><td>Lys</td><td>Gln</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>A. gossypii</italic></td><td>Lys</td><td>Lys</td><td>Gln</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>K. lactis</italic></td><td>Lys</td><td>Lys</td><td>Gln</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>C. albicans</italic></td><td>Ser</td><td>Gln</td><td>Gln</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>A. nidulans</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>C. cinerea</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>U. maydis</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>N. crassa</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>M. oryzae</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>F. graminearum</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>C. neoformans</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><italic>S. pombe</italic></td><td>Thr</td><td>His</td><td>His</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The GTPase domains of Cdc3 and AspB are &lt; 50% identical, and differ at many more positions than the five identified by our phylogenetic analysis as co-varying with the α4 Arg and the catalytic Thr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ask if those five differences are sufficient to direct Cdc10 bypass during septin assembly, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to cut the endogenous <italic>CDC3</italic> coding sequence and, via homologous recombination, replace most of it with a ‘recoded’ gene encoding the same polypeptide sequence but using numerous synonymous codons, or with a similarly ‘recoded’ gene additionally encoding the five substitutions (P127E D128S K181T T302R Q306D). Recoding allowed us to obtain transformants in which recombination occurred at the ends of our donor templates, rather than in sequences immediately flanking the cut site, thus promoting incorporation of all five substitutions. We also obtained a transformant in which only two substitutions were incorporated, T302R Q306D, and we included this strain in our subsequent analysis. The recoded control strain and the <italic>P127E D128S K181T T302R Q306D</italic> and <italic>T302R Q306D</italic> mutant strains were indistinguishable from the parental <italic>CDC3<sup>+</sup></italic> strain in terms of growth at all tested temperatures, and also with regard to the relative amounts of Cdc10-mCherry incorporated into septin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that recoding with synonymous codons alters Cdc3 co-translational folding in some way that masks effects of the amino acid changes we introduced, it appears that additional sequence changes are needed to ‘reverse evolution’ and restore the ability of Cdc3 to homodimerize robustly in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Septin G dimer partner selection by ‘tuning’ the <italic>trans</italic> loop 1 His via α4 Arg or Gdm</title><p>We propose that Gdm binding adjacent to ScCdc3 Thr302 provides molecular contacts that position His262 to interact in trans with an Asp residue from a septin Switch II loop in a ‘GTP state’, such as that provided by another Cdc3•GTP.

Val in this position probably also ‘tunes’ the configuration of His262 to favor Cdc3 homodimerization via interaction with Cdc3 Asp201. Specific configurations of the Switch II loop clearly dictate G dimer partner choice, as mutating the residue corresponding to Cdc3 Asp210 promotes both stable Cdc3 heterodimerization with nucleotide-free Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weems et al., 2014</xref>) and biased selection of Shs1 by Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weems and McMurray, 2017</xref>). Mutating a nearby Asp in the Switch II loop of human SEPT7 also allows homodimerization when only a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zent and Wittinghofer, 2014</xref>). ‘Tuning’ by Gdm via <italic>cis</italic> interactions presumably occurs prior to G dimerization and is likely a transient event: once the <italic>trans</italic> loop 1 His has engaged either the Switch II Asp or nucleotide (or nearby where nucleotide normally binds, in the case of nucleotide-free mutant Cdc10), the Arg–His interaction probably need not persist post-dimerization. It follows that Gdm may not remain bound to Cdc3 following G dimerization, and thus falls under a broad definition of a ‘pharmacological’ or ‘chemical’ chaperone.</p><p>Since in otherwise WT cells Gdm promotes bypass of mutant Cdc10 molecules with substitutions in various locations in the G interface and nucleotide-binding pocket, but not WT Cdc10, additional contacts between WT Cdc10•GDP and Cdc3•GTP likely favor Cdc3–Cdc10 heterodimerization over Cdc3 homodimerization despite the presence of Gdm.

Bound nucleotide itself may provide the key contacts that distinguish WT Cdc10 from the mutants, with Cdc10(G44D) subunits being more successful than the other mutants at binding nucleotide. At moderate temperatures (22–27°C) Cdc3 molecules carrying the G365R substitution are slow to acquire the conformation competent for interaction with Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schaefer et al., 2016</xref>). Our observation that GdnHCl exacerbated the TS phenotypes of <italic>cdc3(G365R)</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) thus provides further evidence of a bias imposed by Gdm on Cdc3 toward conformations that are suboptimal for interaction with Cdc10, the effects of which are masked in WT cells but become obvious when combined with additional folding biases like the G365R substitution.</p><p>Whereas Gdm was unable to drive Cdc10 bypass in WT cells, swapping the GTPase domain of Cdc3 for that of AspB was sufficient to promote bypass of WT Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), consistent with the idea that Cdc3•Gdm only partially mimics the ancestral homodimer configuration. Introducing into Cdc3 the five residues (including the catalytic Thr and α4 Arg) that are found in Cdc3 homologs in species that tolerate loss of the Cdc10 homolog was unable to drive exclusion of Cdc10 from septin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cdc12 natively possesses four of these five residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), yet forcing septin hexamer assembly via non-native Cdc12 homodimers (by deleting <italic>SHS1</italic> and <italic>CDC11</italic>) results in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells that, like <italic>cdc10∆</italic>, cannot proliferate at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McMurray et al., 2011</xref>).

This effect requires high protein concentration (0.15 mg/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>). Even higher protein concentration (1 mg/mL) bypasses the need for Cdc3 mutations and some extrinsic cofactors, though excess GTP is still critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farkasovsky et al., 2005</xref>). These observations support a ‘conformational ensemble’ model of Cdc3 folding, in which at any given time a small proportion of Cdc3 molecules adopt the homodimerization-competent conformation.

Our unbiased identification of the <italic>cdc10(Q265H)</italic> mutation in cells expressing the Cdc3-AspB chimera provided one example of how Cdc10 adapted to interacting with a Cdc3 subunit ‘fixed’ in the GTP-bound state.

If the residue in this position acts to promote interaction with a G dimer partner in a specific nucleotide state, this may explain why Lys in this position is shared by AgCdc10 and KlCdc10, but not any of the Cdc10 homologs in the fungal species in which the Cdc3 homolog retains the ‘catalytic Thr’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Co-variation of these residues likely reflects co-evolution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref> illustrates a possible pathway of such changes during septin evolution.</p><p>Were Cdc10-less hexamers specifically selected against during evolution of a fungal lineage? Compared to other closely-related fungi, <italic>Ashbya</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> share little in common with regard to the cellular functions in which septins are known to operate, such as polarity, morphogenesis, cytokinesis, or sporulation. Hence it is hard to imagine how losing septin hexamers could provide a specific selective advantage to a common ancestor, though this may reflect our incomplete understanding of what septin hexamers do differently than septin octamers. On the other hand, the assembly of hexamers liberates the Cdc10 subunits to act elsewhere, and specific functions of ‘free’ Cdc10 homologs could represent an evolutionary pressure point to maintain GTPase activity in Cdc3 homologs. Indeed, in <italic>U. maydis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Tabarés and Pérez-Martín, 2010</xref>) and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hernández-Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>) the Cdc10 homologs are found in distinct cellular structures independently of the other septins, where they may function independently, as well.</p><p>Many human cell types also natively produce both septin hexamers and octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sellin et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sellin et al., 2011b</xref>). Incorporation of a subunit from the SEPT3 group (SEPT3, SEPT9, or SEPT12) appears to confer functions to human octamers that hexamers lack, such as microtubule bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2013</xref>), vesicle trafficking in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karasmanis et al., 2018</xref>), directing proper spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuo et al., 2015</xref>), and membrane abscission at the end of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estey et al., 2010</xref>). Human and yeast septin octamers were thought to differ in where within the complex the ‘extra’ subunits incorporate, with SEPT3-group septins like SEPT9 occupying the ‘terminal’ positions at both octamer ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). However, two recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mendonça et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Soroor et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that in fact SEPT3-group septins form a central homodimer flanked by SEPT7, with SEPT6 and SEPT2 occupying the penultimate and terminal positions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McMurray and Thorner, 2019</xref>). In this ‘revised’ organization, the GTPase-dead subunit position (the SEPT6 group) corresponds to that of Cdc12, and the Cdc3 position is occupied by SEPT7, an active GTPase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, a mutation (S63N) that doubles SEPT7 GTPase activity in vitro shifts assembly in vivo from primarily hetero-octamers to smaller complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with our model that septins in the GDP-bound state are prone to homodimerization across the G interface and exclusion of intervening subunits.</p><p>SEPT9 and SEPT3 are active GTPases and, like Cdc10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Versele and Thorner, 2004</xref>), as monomers they hydrolyze GTP faster than other septins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Macedo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zent and Wittinghofer, 2014</xref>). We previously proposed that rapid GTP hydrolysis by monomeric Cdc10 allows it to homodimerize prior to interacting with Cdc3, such that Cdc10•GDP encounters Cdc3•GTP during hetero-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weems and McMurray, 2017</xref>). If human septins assemble similarly, then hexamers lacking SEPT3-family subunits are not made by eviction of central homodimers from pre-existing hetero-octamers. Instead, the outcome of hexamer or octamer is decided upon de novo assembly and depends upon the phosphorylation state of the nucleotide bound by SEPT7. Indeed, induced overexpression of tagged SEPT3-family septins in human K562 cells demonstrated that preexisting hexamers gradually disappeared by dilution during cell division and were replaced by newly-made octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>). In that study, the ‘excess’ SEPT9 persisted for days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>). Given subsequent results pointing to a role for ‘free’ SEPT9 in vesicle trafficking in mouse hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karasmanis et al., 2018</xref>), in specific cellular circumstances slow SEPT7 GTP hydrolysis may be crucial for generating ‘free’ SEPT3-family septins that perform independent functions.</p><p>Cdc10 and SEPT9 fall into one ancient evolutionary clade, whereas Cdc3, Cdc12, SEPT6 and SEPT7 all appear to have distinct origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auxier et al., 2019</xref>). Thus the loss of septin GTPase activity occurred multiple times independently. By demonstrating that GTPase activity facilitates promiscuity during dimerization, and thereby expands the repertoire of septin hetero-oligomers, our findings provide the first molecular rationale for the evolution of GTPase-dead septins: to narrow the variety of building blocks available for higher-order assemblies. A similar logic may explain the most famous example of loss of GTPase activity of a cytoskeletal protein, that of the α subunit of the tubulin heterodimer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Chemical rescue by guanidine hydrochloride in vivo</title><p>The ability of Gdm to occupy vacancies created by the mutation of Arg residues is well documented in vitro for a wide variety of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baldwin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barnett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boehlein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dugdale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goedl and Nidetzky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guillén Schlippe and Hedstrom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lehoux and Mitra, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Phillips et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rynkiewicz and Seaton, 1996</xref>), but effects of GdnHCl on living cells were limited to Gdm binding at sites in WT proteins or nucleic acids: in the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp104 and its relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeymer et al., 2013</xref>), in the intracellular pore of voltage-gated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalia and Swartz, 2011</xref>), in the enteroviral 2C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sadeghipour et al., 2012</xref>), and, most recently, in bacterial riboswitches that sense intracellular Gdm and induce a cellular response to detoxify it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>). The function of a rationally-designed Arg-mutant kinase can be rescued in vitro by GdnHCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Williams et al., 2000</xref>), and the same mutant is rescued by imidazole in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Qiao et al., 2006</xref>), but our findings that GdnHCl can functionally replace an Arg in Cdc3 represent the first documented case of ‘chemical rescue’ by GdnHCl in vivo.</p><p>The apparent requirement for GdnHCl to be present during Cdc3 folding illustrates how our case of GdnHCl mimicry of a ‘missing’ Arg is fundamentally distinct from the other examples of ‘chemical rescue’ by GdnHCl. In the other cases, a protein that had evolved to adopt a specific conformation was mutated at a single Arg in order to perturb this conformation (or, in many cases, interaction with a substrate molecule), and Gdm was able to restore the native fold/interaction. In those prior studies, the mutated protein was already near the native conformation and only a small effect of GdnHCl was required to achieve the native conformation. In our case, a WT protein that had evolved to avoid a particular conformation was induced to reach that non-native conformation only when GdnHCl was present during its folding. During Cdc3 folding in the absence of Gdm, other intramolecular interactions drive acquisition of the low-energy native conformation that disfavors homodimerization. Gdm would have to act early, in a manner equivalent to how canonical chaperones direct the folding pathways of their clients. The ability of the T302R mutation to block, but not to mimic, the effect of GdnHCl could be explained by an ability of Gdm to make intramolecular contacts within Cdc3 that, because it is tethered to the polypeptide backbone, the Gdm moiety of an Arg side chain cannot. Our findings do not exclude the possibility that additional Gdm molecules bind elsewhere in Cdc3 and contribute to Cdc3 folding, with occupancy of the site near Thr302 being necessary but not sufficient.</p><p>In yeast cells cultured in 1 mM GdnHCl the intracellular concentration is ~ 20 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2003</xref>). Thus in the conditions in which we observed <italic>cdc10</italic> rescue Gdm likely binds to hundreds or thousands of proteins, with few adverse effects. Indeed, GdnHCl is approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA for use in humans, and at low doses has few serious side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oh et al., 1997</xref>).

Finally, given the evidence that bacteria evolved ways to manage intracellular Gdm (including actively exporting it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kermani et al., 2018</xref>]), Gdm may, like the naturally occurring osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012</xref>) and the chaperone Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindquist, 2009</xref>), influence evolution by buffering against the phenotypic consequences of mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fungal strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast were transformed using the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo Research).

The presented insights will be of interest to a general biological audience because they advance our understanding of the regulation of septin filament assembly and the role of septin GTPase activity in this process.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Guanidine hydrochloride reactivates an ancient septin hetero-oligomer assembly pathway in budding yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marian Farkasovsky (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a neat example of how a fortuitous discovery – rescue of a septin Cdc10 mutant with GdnHCl – can lead to fundamental insights into the role of the GTPase activity in septin assembly. Aside of the evolutionary implications of the work, the findings of this manuscript provide a major mechanistic explanation on how GTPase activity drives the selection and exclusion of specific septin paralogs from higher assembly. This is particularly exciting as it provides a conceptual framework for understanding how a subset of septin paralogs may localize and function as non-canonical &quot;free&quot; homomers independently of their cognate partners, as it has been reported for Cdc10 in some fungi and SEPT9 in mammalian cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Unbiased in silico modeling and phylogenetic analysis point to Thr302 as the site of Gdm binding in Cdc3”: All species with Arg mutation seems to belong to <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> clade, adding fungal phylogenetic tree might be valuable to the manuscript for better illustration of this point (maybe as a figure supplement).</p><p>2) There is some published evidence that subdenaturing concentrations of GdnHCl can stabilize protein (e.g. DOI: 10.1529/biophysj.104.044701). It will be useful to discuss this point in a few sentences. Did the authors test higher concentration of GdnHCl (0.1-0.4M)? Maybe higher concentration can &quot;reactivate&quot; the Cdc10-less septin complex expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and isolated in the absence of GdnHCl.</p><p>3) Another point which should be mentioned is the concentration of the protein. Formation of the Cdc3-Cdc11-Cdc12 filaments in vitro has been described (Farkasovsky et al., 2005). In that study, the authors used higher concentration of protein (1mg/ml) and protein dialysis in contrast to protein dilution. Assembly of Cdc3-Cdc11-Cdc12 filaments might be the question of concentration of properly folded complex. The authors should briefly mention this in the Discussion.</p><p>4) Did the authors see different elution profile in the presence of GdnHCl?</p><p>5) The implications of the findings for mammalian septins in light of the new order of assembly are quite exciting. The authors devote roughly a page, but it's worth expounding a bit more on SEPT9 occupying the central position in the hetero-octamer. They reference data of a SEPT7 mutation, which enhances the GTPase rate with concomitant shift from hetero-octamers to smaller complexes. It would be interesting to know what the authors think about the GTPases activity of SEPT9, which has been reported to be significantly faster than other septins, and the fact that SEPT9 and Cdc10 fall into the same ancient evolutionary clade. SEPT9 homo-dimerizes though the NC interface and hetero-dimerizes with SEPT7 through the G interface. How will the GTPase activities of SEPT9 and SEPT7 influence the apposing G interfaces and how would it be possible for SEPT9 to crash out of the hetero-octamer as potentially a free homomer? It would be interesting and useful to the septin community if the authors can comment with any insights into this possibility.</p><p>6) It would be helpful to describe the EM results in Figure 3 more quantitatively or at least give the readers a clear sense how efficiently the recombinant Cdc3, Cdc12, Cdc11 formed trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers in the presence of GdnHCl.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54355.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Unbiased in silico modeling and phylogenetic analysis point to Thr302 as the site of Gdm binding in Cdc3”: All species with Arg mutation seems to belong to Saccharomyces clade, adding fungal phylogenetic tree might be valuable to the manuscript for better illustration of this point (maybe as a figure supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>An excellent suggestion. Indeed, the fungal species in which the Arg was lost all fall in the family Saccharomycetaceae. We created a phylogenetic tree based on Cdc3 protein sequence and also included in it the broader taxonomic differences, to highlight the reviewer’s point, and added this panel to Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is some published evidence that subdenaturing concentrations of GdnHCl can stabilize protein (e.g. DOI: 10.1529/biophysj.104.044701).

Most interestingly, the literature suggests that both urea and GdnHCl operate via the same mechanism at subdenaturing concentrations to non-specifically stabilize proteins. The failure of urea to rescue <italic>cdc10</italic> mutants in vivois consistent with a more specific mechanism for GdnHCl, such as the model we propose of binding near Thr302 in Cdc3. We added wording to this effect to the section in the Results section. With regard to testing higher concentrations of GdnHCl on Cdc10-less septin complexes in vitro, we are intrigued by the idea, but if such experiments did indeed show a “reactivation” effect, this might represent a distinct mechanism unrelated to that responsible for <italic>cdc10</italic> rescue in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another point which should be mentioned is the concentration of the protein. Formation of the Cdc3-Cdc11-Cdc12 filaments in vitro has been described (Farkasovsky et al., 2005). In that study, the authors used higher concentration of protein (1mg/ml) and protein dialysis in contrast to protein dilution. Assembly of Cdc3-Cdc11-Cdc12 filaments might be the question of concentration of properly folded complex. The authors should briefly mention this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that fits well with other related concepts. We added a paragraph to the Discussion that explains how various factors can contribute to filament formation in vitro by increasing the concentration of properly folded complex and includes the point mentioned by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did the authors see different elution profile in the presence of GdnHCl?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. In the presence of GdnHCl a “new” SEC elution peak appeared between the aggregates found in the void volume and the trimers and dimers found in the absence of GdnHCl. It was this peak that formed filaments upon dilution to low salt, which fits with the idea that this fraction contained the hexamers that were competent to form filaments. We have now added these data to Figure 3 and mention of these findings to the body text, and we thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The implications of the findings for mammalian septins in light of the new order of assembly are quite exciting.

It would be interesting and useful to the septin community if the authors can comment with any insights into this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to expound upon this line of reasoning. In the models we favor (which are admittedly biased by our prior work with Cdc10), SEPT9 cannot “crash out” of a hetero-octamer, because it hydrolyzes GTP prior to incorporation into a hetero-oligomer, and is catalytically inactive thereafter. The choice by SEPT9 of septin hetero-oligomerization or not would, according to our models, depend more upon the nucleotide state of SEPT7 during de novo assembly, which is supported by existing data from the literature. We added a paragraph to this effect in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It would be helpful to describe the EM results in Figure 3 more quantitatively or at least give the readers a clear sense how efficiently the recombinant Cdc3, Cdc12, Cdc11 formed trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers in the presence of GdnHCl.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a histogram/frequency distribution of particle lengths that illustrates the efficiency of assembly/stability of complexes formed in the presence and absence of GdnHCl.</p></body></sub-article></article>
