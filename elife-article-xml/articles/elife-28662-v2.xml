Transcallosal pathways represent a promising therapeutic target, but their role in post-stroke recovery remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the contralesional cortex exerts an enhanced interhemispheric inhibition over the perilesional tissue after focal cortical stroke in mouse forelimb motor cortex. Accordingly, we designed a rehabilitation protocol combining intensive, repeatable exercises on a robotic platform with reversible inactivation of the contralesional cortex. This treatment promoted recovery in general motor tests and in manual dexterity with remarkable restoration of pre-lesion movement patterns, evaluated by kinematic analysis. Recovery was accompanied by a reduction of transcallosal inhibition and ‘plasticity brakes’ over the perilesional tissue.

There is obviously great interest in developing new interventions that stimulate neuroplastic processes thus enhancing functional recovery. The standard approach for stroke rehabilitation is physical therapy, which can be delivered either by a therapist or via mechatronic devices. In particular, robots represent a valid approach to increase the amount and repeatability of the exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klamroth-Marganska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinkensmeyer et al., 2016</xref>), allowing for highly standardized therapeutic protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Loureiro et al., 2011</xref>), with competitive costs compared to conventional therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, they collect objective and quantitative data about the performance of each patient, characterized by different kinetic and kinematic parameters (i.e. force exerted by the subject, smoothness of the movement, etc., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinkensmeyer et al., 2016</xref>). It is also increasingly recognized that physical rehabilitation should be combined with ‘plasticity-stimulating’ or neuromodulatory interventions that render the spared CNS networks more susceptible to experience-dependent modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zeiler and Krakauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Straudi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this context, plasticity in the injured hemisphere plays a major role in post-stroke motor recovery and is a primary target for rehabilitation therapy. Indeed stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex, especially when paired with motor training, facilitates plasticity and functional restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dodd et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the role of the contralesional hemisphere remains highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dancause et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Talelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buetefisch, 2015</xref>). Attempts to promote stroke recovery by inhibiting the contralesional hemisphere are based on the interhemispheric competition model, which posits an enhanced transcallosal inhibition exerted by the healthy side over the spared perilesional tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dancause et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silasi and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boddington and Reynolds, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mansoori et al., 2014</xref>). However, direct electrophysiological measures of the evolution of interhemispheric inhibition post-stroke are not yet available. Second, inactivation of the healthy hemisphere via either low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or cathodal (inhibitory) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has yielded some positive yet variable effects in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lefaucheur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Plow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Volz et al., 2017</xref>). This variability in outcome may depend on the extent of damage: interhemispheric competition dominates in patients with limited damage in the affected hemisphere, while after large lesions the contralesional side appears to vicariate the lost functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bradnam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>For these reasons, there is a pressing need for a deeper understanding of the basic physiology of interhemispheric interactions and their role in motor recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vallone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boddington and Reynolds, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Volz et al., 2017</xref>). This requires validated animal models of stroke which allow well-controlled experimental conditions, and the possibility to perform detailed investigations about the mechanisms underlying post-stroke recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ward, 2017</xref>). Mice and rats are widely employed for this purpose, and several quantitative measures of motor function have been developed in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the marked similarities in kinematic parameters of skilled reaching between humans and rodents indicates that mice can be used in pre-clinical studies with excellent translation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, it should be noted that, unlike primates and humans, rodents do not have direct cortico-motoneuronal connections as the fastest pyramidal connections are dysinaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alstermark and Ogawa, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alstermark and Pettersson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this manuscript, we define a rehabilitation protocol to promote ‘true’ recovery of motor function (i.e., the restoration of pre-lesion movement patterns) after focal cortical stroke in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). First, we demonstrate that the healthy, contralesional hemisphere exerts an increased transcallosal inhibition over the spared perilesional tissue. To counteract such inhibitory influences, we employed a reversible inactivation of the healthy, contralesional motor cortex. Silencing of the contralesional cortex was coupled with training in a robotic device, the <italic>M-Platform</italic> (designed on the basis of one of the first human rehabilitation robots, the ArmGuide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinkensmeyer et al., 2000</xref>) that allows intensive and highly repeatable exercises of the mouse forelimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spalletti et al., 2014</xref>). Such combined treatment normalized transcallosal inhibition and promoted recovery in general motor tests and in manual dexterity (i.e. skilled reaching) with a remarkable restoration of pre-lesion movement patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of interhemispheric functional connectivity after stroke</title><p>A focal ischemic lesion was induced in the primary motor cortex (M1) of mice, targeting the caudal forelimb area (CFA) by means of Rose Bengal-induced phototrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2016</xref>).

We used optogenetic stimulation of the contralesional RFA in Thy1-ChR2 mice expressing the light-activated cation channel ChR2 mainly in layer V pyramidal neurons. We recorded Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and Multi Unit Activity (MUA) in the ipsilesional RFA of ischemic and sham animals. Extracellular recordings were performed with 16-channel silicon probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). In deep layers, single-pulse stimulation evoked a FP with two main components: (i) an early negative wave, peaking between 17 and 26 ms after stimulation and (ii) a late positive component, peaking between 40 and 60 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>, black trace). Pharmacological dissection of the two components indicated that the early negative-going FP is due to direct transcallosal excitation, while the late positive peak corresponds to disynaptic inhibition of target neurons via local GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Restani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, local delivery over the cortex of the GABA-B antagonist CPG55845 in naïve mice had no significant effect on the negative-going FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>) but substantially reduced the positive-going component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,c</xref>), consistent for a role of GABA-B signaling in interhemispheric inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Irlbacher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>).Topical application over the cortex of CNQX, a blocker of glutamatergic transmission, completely abolished the responses, confirming the post-synaptic origin of the recorded FPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>, blue trace). Altogether, these data demonstrate that the first phase of the evoked potential corresponds to a volley of transcallosal excitation in the RFA which leads to local activation of GABAergic cells and subsequent GABA-B dependent inhibition of cortical neurons (i.e. outward currents resulting in late positive peaks in the FPs).</p><p>We next quantified changes in the evoked FPs in sham and stroke animals (5 and 30 days after stroke) to determine the evolution of interhemispheric functional connectivity. Analysis of the initial, negative component demonstrated that the FP amplitude was dramatically dampened in stroke animals at 5 days (two way ANOVA, followed by Holm-Sidak test, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>), possibly due to connectional diaschisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carrera and Tononi, 2014</xref>). Despite this reduced transcallosal volley, there was a trend for enhanced amplitude of positive-going FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,f</xref>). At 30 days after stroke, the main negative wave was partly reinstated, but still significantly lower with respect to sham controls (two way ANOVA, followed by Holm-Sidak test, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). Quantification of the late positive component showed greater amplitudes in stroke animals at 30 days, with difference maximized in the central-deep layers (two way ANOVA, followed by Holm-Sidak test, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Altogether these data demonstrate an imbalance in interhemispheric connectivity early after stroke, with weaker direct excitation but paradoxical enhancement of transcallosally mediated inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reduced excitation and enhanced inhibition from the intact to the stroke hemisphere</title><p>We went on to further characterize the changes in interhemispheric interactions at 30 days after the infarct. Determination of input/output curves (i.e. amplitude of the negative-going FP vs. intensity of stimulation) established that the amplitude of the response progressively increased with light intensity in both healthy and stroke mice.

To strengthen this conclusion we quantified MUA activity in RFA of healthy and stroke animals following stimulation of the contralateral homotopic area. The analysis revealed robust stimulus-evoked response at a depth corresponding mainly to cortical layer V in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top). This activity was substantially reduced in stroke mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom).</p><p>To confirm an asymmetry of interhemispheric communication after stroke, in a subset of ischemic mice (n = 5) we performed recordings in both RFAs after stimulation of the contralateral side. The results showed that the evoked FP in the contralesional RFA of stroke animals was remarkably distinct from the response recorded in the injured RFA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In particular, the negative and positive components were always higher and lower, respectively, in the contralesional RFA than in the perilesional RFA of individual stroke mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>; paired T test, negative component p=0.003 and positive component p=0.012). In naïve controls, the amplitude of the two FP components was comparable in the two hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>; paired T test, negative component p=1 and positive component p=0.06). These data demonstrate directional differences in interhemispheric processing between premotor areas following a localized cortical infarct in the CFA. The robust asymmetry between the FP response recorded in the ipsilesional and contralesional cortex after transcallosal stimulation suggests that the alterations in interhemispheric communication are caused by plastic rearrangements after stroke and not by direct callosal damage.</p><p>We next focused on the stroke-induced enhancement of transcallosal inhibition in the ipsilesional side. As expected, local delivery over the cortex of the GABA-B antagonist CPG55845 potently reduced the positive-going FP 30 days after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>), while the early negative wave was slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that the late outward, hyperpolarizing currents (see CSD analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) should short-circuit the excitatory input carried by a second, closely spaced stimulus leading to paired-pulse depression (PPD). Indeed, using two optogenetic stimuli delivered at Inter-Stimulus Intervals (ISIs) of 50, 100 and 200 ms, we observed in healthy animals a decrease in the magnitude of the synaptic response to the second stimulus, indicating PPD which was maximal at 50 ms (n = 5 animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus we compared the Paired Pulse Ratio (PPR), that is, the ratio of the second to the first postsynaptic response at an ISI of 50 ms in control and stroke mice at 30 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The PPR was significantly lower in stroke animals with respect to controls, consistent with enhanced transcallosal inhibition in ischemic vs. sham animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The field PPR results were confirmed by performing the same analysis with MUA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, in sham animals (n = 5) we observed a depressed response to the second stimulus with respect to the first but the depression was enhanced after stroke (n = 5).

This neurotoxin is known to block neurotransmission preferentially in excitatory terminals by SNAP-25 cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Costantin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caleo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the spread of toxin activity in the motor cortex, we injected a group of 5 naïve mice into the CFA and we sacrificed them 2 days post injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caleo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonucci et al., 2010</xref>) for tissue processing.

Based on these evidences, we designed a combined treatment involving transient inactivation of the healthy hemisphere and intensive sessions of exercises guided by a robotic device. This combinatorial strategy was remarkably effective to improve general forelimb motor function in tasks and, importantly, to restore pre-lesion motor patterns in a skilled forelimb test, thus avoiding the development of compensatory, possibly maladaptive, motor strategies. These ameliorations in functional outcomes were accompanied by a significant reduction in interhemispheric inhibition and by downregulation of specific ‘plasticity brakes’ in perilesional tissue, such as GABAergic markers, confirming a treatment-induced cortical disinhibition.</p><p>Data from both humans and animal models demonstrate that the ischemic event is followed by extensive changes in cortical excitability involving not only the perilesional tissue but also other connected brain areas in the same hemisphere or in the contralesional one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marshall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ward et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clarkson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carmichael, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dijkhuizen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vallone et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, the role of the healthy hemisphere in post-stroke recovery remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caleo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dancause et al., 2015</xref>). Recent evidences propose a direct relationship between the extent of the lesion and the role of the healthy hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grefkes and Ward, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, following small strokes it is generally believed that loss of the mutual interhemispheric control leads to an excessive inhibition exerted by the undamaged hemisphere over the spared perilesional tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biernaskie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nowak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silasi and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boddington and Reynolds, 2017</xref>). To firmly set this point, we used a well characterized mouse model of focal ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vallone et al., 2016</xref>) to study neural mechanisms underlying interhemispheric inhibition in a standardized and controlled way. We used optogenetic stimulation to characterize transcallosal transmission between the two homotopic RFAs. We found that the first phase of the evoked potential corresponds to a volley of transcallosal excitation in the RFA, which drives local GABAergic neurons with consequent GABA-B dependent inhibition of cortical neurons (corresponding to the late positive peak in the FP). These data are consistent with neuroanatomical observations indicating that the corpus callosum consists almost entirely of excitatory fibres, which implies that interhemispheric inhibition arises from the activation of local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>). We went on to demonstrate that stroke affects interhemispheric transmission, starting from the acute phase. In particular, the negative, depolarizing volley of the FP was reduced while the late positive component was enhanced. The reduction in the negative-going FP and stimulus-induced spiking after stroke can be simply explained by a dampened excitatory drive of pyramidal neurons in the ipsilesional hemisphere.The increased inhibition is consistent with the significant enhancement of PPD in stroke animals, pointing to a stronger post-synaptic GABAergic inhibition that short-circuits the excitatory input carried by a second stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rozas et al., 2001</xref>). It is well established that transcallosal neurons provide interhemispheric inhibition over the target hemisphere by contacting local interneurons, such as neurogliaform (NGF) cells in layer I. NGF cells are known to exert GABAergic inhibitory effects over the dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons, as demonstrated in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>). Two non-mutually exclusive possibilities may explain the increased interhemispheric inhibition following stroke: (i) a structural reorganization of callosal fibres, with enhanced innervation of NGF cells and, possibly, a retraction of inputs onto the dendrites of local pyramidal cells; (ii) an enhanced synaptic transmission between transcallosally-driven interneurons and cortical pyramids. In keeping with this idea, previous studies have shown a robust and early upregulation of GABA-B receptors in peri-infarct areas which suggest augmented responsiveness to GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Que et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Based on the results obtained in optogenetic experiments, we decided to test the effects of a transient inactivation of the healthy hemisphere on general forelimb function. We used BoNT/E to block neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission by cleaving SNAP-25, a main component of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Costantin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caleo et al., 2007</xref>). This approach resulted in slightly improved outcomes in general forelimb motor tests (Gridwalk and Schallert Cylinder test) but its effect was not stable throughout our observation period. One interpretation is that silencing of the contralesional motor area stimulates plastic reorganization in perilesional tissue, but the enhancement of plasticity without the guide of an appropriate motor rehabilitation regime is not sufficient to achieve a complete recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">García-Alías et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the last years, robotics has received an increasing attention as a promising tool for improving repeatability, motivation and data collection in clinical stroke neurorehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lo et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, these devices offer the possibility to provide highly repeatable and customable sessions of exercises and to obtain quantitative information about the kinetics and the kinematics of the motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caleo, 2015</xref>). The latest randomized studies have demonstrated that robotic therapy is at least as effective as intensive conventional rehabilitation to improve motor functions, even in chronic patients with moderate-to-severe paresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klamroth-Marganska et al., 2014</xref>), and thanks to its advantages relative to costs and amount of work it is successfully used also in low- and middle-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bustamante Valles et al., 2016</xref>). Here we employed the <italic>M-Platform</italic>, a mechatronic device for mouse forelimb training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spalletti et al., 2014</xref>) that mimics a robot for upper limb rehabilitation in humans, the ‘Arm-Guide’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinkensmeyer et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spalletti et al., 2014</xref>), daily training on the robot restores task-related parameters to pre-lesion values, indicating a specific motor recovery. However, robotic rehabilitation per se was not able to generalize recovery to untrained motor tasks (Gridwalk and Schallert Cylinder test). This indicates that the execution of daily controlled, repeatable and targeted exercises with the affected limb ameliorates strength and motor control but only for those movements that are practiced. This is consistent with previous results in clinical literature, showing only task-specific improvements with little generalization after robotic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kwakkel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panarese et al., 2012</xref>). For these reasons, we coupled the BoNT/E-mediated suppression of activity in contralesional hemisphere with daily robotic training.</p><p>Timing of the therapeutic treatments is known to be critical for functional post-stroke outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wahl et al., 2014</xref>). The early imbalance in interhemispheric connectivity following stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) suggested us a prompt inactivation of the contralesional cortex via BoNT/E, which requires at least 24 hr to become fully active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antonucci et al., 2008</xref>). For robotic training, we chose to start the physiotherapy at day 5, since it is known that early exercise may exacerbate brain injury, via excitotoxicity and generation of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kozlowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it is widely believed that priming the brain with a ‘plasticity-stimulating’ treatment before the beginning of a rehabilitative treatment improves motor performance after brain lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schäbitz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Starkey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wahl et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these considerations, BoNT/E was delivered at the time of stroke while robotic training was started 5 days later in the combined therapy group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, this combined strategy was able to generalize the effects of robotic training with significant improvements in general motor coordination in Gridwalk and Schallert Cylinder tests. Improvements outlasted the window of treatment as indicated by the stable follow-up outcomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d</xref>). We also evaluated the effect of the combined therapy in the Skilled Reaching test, a cortically dependent task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Starkey et al., 2012</xref>) that requires a fine forelimb motor control. We already demonstrated a spontaneous post-stroke amelioration in the percentage of exact reachings but not in the kinematic parameters of movement extracted by a custom-made algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). These results clearly point to the development of compensatory motor strategies during post-stroke evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caleo, 2015</xref>). We found that the combined treatment improves skilled forelimb abilities, not only in terms of end-point measures but, more importantly, in terms of kinematic parameters. Indeed the speed, smoothness and shape of the reaching trajectories significantly recovered towards pre-lesion baseline. Importantly, we demonstrated that the combined treatment is able to significantly decrease the excessive interhemispheric inhibition from the healthy homotopic area over the perilesional tissue. Indeed, the late positive component of the FP, corresponding to outward, hyperpolarizing currents in the CSD, was reduced in rehabilitated animals across all the cortical layers. Moreover, analysis of PPD confirmed the normalization of interhemispheric GABAergic inhibition after the combined rehabilitative treatment. Accordingly, in rehabilitated animals we also found an increased cortical plasticity in perilesional tissue, as shown by the diminished expression of at least three important plasticity ‘brakes’ such as SOM+ and PV+ inhibitory interneurons and MBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bavelier et al., 2010</xref>). The decrease in PV+ and SOM+ interneurons could be due either to cell degeneration or to a down-regulation of their markers, potentially related to an impairment in their normal physiology.In particular, the decrease in GABAergic interneurons is compatible with a local disinhibition induced by the treatment. Reduction of these markers has already been associated with improved motor outcomes triggered by motor rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zeiler et al., 2013</xref>) and to the reopening of cortical plasticity that allows network reorganization and restoration of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Coupling physical rehabilitation with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques has been amply exploited in the clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Straudi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yozbatiran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chisari et al., 2014</xref>). This approach has been tested in the context of constraint-induced movement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolognini et al., 2011</xref>) and robotic rehabilitation but with mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hesse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Giacobbe et al., 2013</xref>), possibly depending on stroke size and different timings/protocols used. Studies in patients have highlighted a significant but generally small effect of physical rehabilitation combined with inhibitory NIBS applied to the contralesional cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lefaucheur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tedesco Triccas et al., 2016</xref>). One possible explanation for the remarkable effectiveness of robotics combined with BoNT/E silencing in the present study may be the sustained and focal inhibition of activity in the healthy hemisphere which allows a tonic downregulation of inhibitory transcallosal input. Along this line, portable and implantable devices capable of delivering continuous tDCS in stroke patients might be envisaged.</p><p>The effect of our combined treatment was not limited to task-specific motor performance but generalized to other and skilled forelimb tests. This is a key result for potential application of a combined rehabilitation in clinical practice where it is crucial to assure a motor recovery that translates to a broad spectrum of motor activities. The translational value of our study is also enhanced by the results of the combined treatment on the skilled reaching test. In humans, the kinematic analysis of skilled reaching is used in clinical practice to provide objective and quantitative information about forelimb motor function after injury. Despite different behavioral specializations, skilled reaching in humans shares many components with rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, <italic>ArcLen</italic>, <italic>Mean Speed</italic> and <italic>Smoothness</italic> parameters extracted from our analysis show important similarities with observed trajectories in stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cirstea and Levin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panarese et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Overall, in this manuscript we have defined a rehabilitative protocol that is highly effective in obtaining a complete ‘true recovery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zeiler and Krakauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinkensmeyer et al., 2016</xref>) of motor function. Importantly, we showed treatment efficacy in kinematic parameters of reaching that may generalize to patient populations. The results point to a synergistic effect of contralesional activity downregulation and robotic training after small ischemic infarcts in motor cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">21B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1- <break/>ChR2/EYFP)18Cfng/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">IMSR_JAX:007612</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">NeuN</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11205592">AB_11205592</ext-link></td><td valign="top">MILLIPORE:ABN90 <break/>Guinea Pig polyclonal;

A total of 63 C57BL6J mice were used (22–27 g, age 8–10 weeks). We estimated the minimum number of animals required to measure an improvement in the motor outcomes, based on the results of our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2016</xref>). From data represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al. (2016)</xref>, we estimated an effect size of 1.75 that was used to calculate the minimum number of animals necessary for this study to obtain a power &gt;80%. We calculated that a number of 5 animals per group was enough to have a power of ≈ 81% so we considered a minimum of 5 animals per treatment group. Because of the high number of groups in the study, we organized different experimental sessions with different cohorts of mice. In each cohort we tested the homogeneity of the baseline performance and randomly assigned the animals to the different experimental groups. The randomization was performed through a computerized random numbers procedure and conducted independently of the study investigators. To ensure internal control, we have included at least two stroke untreated animals to be used as controls in each cohort. Power calculations were performed with G Power Software (version 3.1.5).</p><p>In order to investigate interhemispheric connectivity after stroke, B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1-ChR2/EYFP)18Cfng/J (Jackson Laboratories, USA) were used for electrophysiological recordings following optogenetic stimulation in the opposite hemisphere (Sham group n = 7, Stroke 30 days n = 9, Stroke 5 days n = 5, Robot+BoNT n = 5). For pharmacological assessment of CGP55845 effect on wild type mice, additional n = 7 Sham and n = 7 Stroke untreated Thy1-ChR2 mice were recorded, for a total number of 40 B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1-ChR2/EYFP)18Cfng/J mice.</p><p>To assess the impact of rehabilitative treatments on post-stroke recovery, a pool of 42 C57 BL6/J mice was tested in the Gridwalk and Schallert cylinder tests to establish a pre-injury baseline performance. All of these animals underwent a surgical procedure but n = 5 mice received a sham surgery while n = 37 received a stroke in CFA and then were randomly assigned to the four different groups: untreated stroke group (n = 11), Robot group (n = 10), BoNT group (n = 5), Robot+BoNT group (n = 11) and tested at day 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 post-lesion in Gridwalk and Schallert Cylinder test. For the follow-up experiment, n = 5 Robot and n = 5 Robot+BoNT animals were kept untreated for 10 days after day 30 behavioral assessment and tested again in Gridwalk and Schallert Cylinder test at day 40 post-lesion.</p><p>Before undergoing the ischemic lesion, a subgroup of these animals were trained for two weeks in a custom-made skilled reaching apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>) until the performance showed a plateau, to collect at least three baseline sessions. Mice that reached criterion performance were divided in two groups (n = 6 stroke untreated and n = 5 Robot+BoNT). These animals were tested after lesion or sham treatment in the reaching apparatus for end point and kinematic analysis at the same time points (see below for details about behavioural tests).</p><p>At the end of the experiment (30 days post surgery), all animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical analyses of plasticity markers with additional n = 2 Sham animals which did not perform behavioural tests.</p><p>Finally, to test the effectiveness of Botulinum Neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) injection, a total number of 19 mice were used for Western blotting (n = 9), immunohistochemical analysis (n = 5) and behavioural tests (n = 5).</p><p>All the behavioural and electrophysiological analyses were conducted as blinded, randomized experiments.

Briefly, animals were anesthetized with Avertin (20 ml/kg, 2,2,2 tribromoethanol 1.25%; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. After a midline scalp incision, the bone was carefully dried and cleaned. Rose Bengal (0.2 ml of a 10 mg/ml solution in PBS; Sigma Aldrich) was injected intraperitoneally. After 5 min, the brain was illuminated through the intact skull for 15 min using a cold light source (ZEISS CL 6000, Germany) linked to a 20X objective that was positioned 0.5 mm anterior and 1.75 mm lateral from Bregma, that is, in correspondence with the caudal forelimb area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tennant et al., 2011</xref>). Sham animals underwent scalp incision and Rose Bengal injection but no light irradiation. For consistency, the cortical lesion was always induced in the right hemisphere and the same hemisphere was used in sham animals as control.At the end of the surgery, the skin was sutured and mice were allowed to awaken from anaesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings after contralateral light stimulation</title><p>For electrophysiological analyses of interhemispheric coupling, we used Thy1-ChR2 Transgenic mice (B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1-ChR2/EYFP)18Cfng/J, Jackson Laboratories, USA) that express the gene encoding for ChR2 under the Thymus cell antigen-1 (Thy-1) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hira et al., 2013</xref>). Sham and stroke mice at 30 days were anesthetized with an initial cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) that was supplemented with additional doses to maintain the plane of anesthesia. Each animal was then placed in a stereotaxic apparatus and a midline incision was made to expose the skull and the sutures.</p><p>A 3 × 3 mm craniotomy centered at 2 mm anterior and 1.2 mm lateral to Bregma (corresponding to the RFA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tennant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vallone et al., 2016</xref>) was performed in both hemispheres of the anesthetized animal. The dura mater was left intact and a recording chamber of dental cement (Ivoclar Vivadent Inc., USA) was made to preserve and moisten the tissue with saline or for local drugs application. The ground electrode was positioned in an additional small craniotomy over the cerebellum. The tip of the optic fiber was positioned stereotactically over the dura mater of the RFA in one hemisphere and just leaned over the tissue.</p><p>Optogenetic stimulation was delivered by means of PlexBright Optogenetic Stimulation System (PlexonInc, USA) with a PlexBright LD-1 Single Channel LED Driver (PlexonInc, USA) and a 456 nm Table-top LED Module connected to a 200 <italic>μ</italic>m Core 0.39 NA optic fiber (ThorlabsInc, USA). The maximum emission power of the fiber optic was assessed before each experiment with PlexBright Light Measurement Kit; for each experiment the maximum emission power was about 10 mW (79.55 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). A safe range for in vivo experiments is about 75 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for short pulses (0.5–50 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cardin et al., 2010</xref>), so we never delivered optogenetic stimuli over 31.82 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (40% of maximum emission power). Stimulation parameters were controlled by a custom-made software developed in LabWindows/CVI (National Instruments, USA) through a USB DAQ board (NI USB-6212 BNC, National Instruments, USA).</p><p>Neuronal activity was recorded in the other hemisphere by means of 16 channels linear probes (NeuroNexus, USA), connected to the OmniPlex D Neural Data Acquisition System (PlexonInc, USA). Wide Band (WB) signals were acquired at 40,000 Hz, amplified 1K, and band-pass filtered (0.03–12,000 Hz). Local Field Potentials (LFP) and continuous spike signals (SPKC) were computed online by band-pass filtering the WB signals (0.03–300 Hz and 300–10,000 Hz, respectively) and referred to the ground electrode in the cerebellum. Multi-unit activity (MUA) was computed offline by further processing the SPKC signals, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stark and Abeles (2007)</xref>. Briefly, MUA was estimated by computing the sample-by-sample RMS. LFPs from the 16 channels were used to compute and plot inverted current source density (CSD) with step method, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pettersen et al. (2006)</xref> using the MATLAB toolbox CSDplotter. With this configuration, we first recorded neuronal activity at increasing stimulation powers, from values that were under threshold until reaching a plateau of neural response. Stimulations were repeated 15 times for each power intensity, spaced by 5 s. For all of the animals in each group, the quantification of the evoked FP and MUA was performed following stimulation with single light pulses at 3 mW (23.865 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 30% of maximum emission intensity) power. For the double-pulse protocol, a common tool to investigate short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">David-Jürgens and Dinse, 2010</xref>), we set on the stimulation power that corresponded approximately to the 75% of the neuronal response in terms of amplitude of the FP. The double-pulse protocol consisted of 2 light pulses delivered with the same power amplitude, lasting 1 ms each and spaced by the following Inter Stimulus Intervals (ISI): 50, 100, 200 ms. Stimulations were repeated 15 times for each ISI, spaced by 5 s. In order to verify the post-synaptic nature of the recorded FP, the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 1 mM; Tocris, UK) was topically applied over the craniotomy, without removing the electrode. Likewise, to identify the receptor subtypes involved in the interhemispheric inhibition in stroke animals, the selective GABA-B antagonist CGP 55845 (10µM, Tocris, UK) was applied. Neural signals were acquired at regular time intervals up to 30 min to verify the effect and the penetration of the drug in the cortical layers.</p><p>At the end of the experiment the animal was sacrificed and, eventually, its brain was taken for histological analyses.</p><p>Data were analyzed offline with Offline Sorter and NeuroExplorer software (PlexonInc, USA) and with custom made Matlab User Interfaces (Matlab, Matworks). Specifically, for the analysis of the single-pulse FP, we quantify separately the amplitude of the negative- and positive-going components by measuring the baseline-to-peak value. For the PP analysis, based on previous reports in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) we analyzed the peak-trough amplitude, i.e. to avoid any interference of the altered baseline preceding the second stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Silencing of the healthy hemisphere with Botulinum Neurotoxin E</title><p>Toxin injections were performed in the same surgical session of photothrombotic lesions; after 15 min of illumination that caused the Rose Bengal activation, the dura mater was exposed over the CFA in the non-injured hemisphere by means of a dental drill. We injected 500 nl of BoNT/E (80 nM) or vehicle divided in two separate injections of 250 nl at (i) + 0.5 anteroposterior, +1.75 mediolateral and (ii) + 0.4 anteroposterior, +1.75 mediolateral by means of heat pulled glass micropipettes (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at 700 μm cortical depth. After toxin infusion, the micropipette was left in place for at least 5 min. After surgery animals were sutured and treated with paracetamol (100 mg/kg) in drinking water for four post-operation days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Robotic rehabilitation</title><p>Mice were trained by means of a robotic platform, the <italic>M-Platform</italic>, as we showed in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spalletti et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the robotic device comprises a linear actuator, a 6-axis load cell, a precision linear slide with a controlled friction system and a custom-designed handle that was fastened to the left wrist of the animal. One end of the handle was screwed on the load-cell for lossless transfer of the forces to the sensor, whereas the other end formed a support for the animal wrist. The animal was kept in a U-shaped restrainer, and its head was stabilized by means of a cemented post. The daily training consisted in the execution of 10–15 sessions of forelimb retraction performed by the animals. First, the linear motor pushed the handle and extended the mouse forelimb by 10 mm (full upper extremity extension). Then, the motor decoupled from the slide and the mouse could initiate the task. If able to overcome a force threshold of 0.2 N, i.e. static friction, the animal voluntarily pulled the handle back (i.e. forelimb flexion back to the starting position). Upon successful completion of the task, the animal was given access to a liquid reward, i.e. 10 µl of sweetened condensed milk, before starting a new session. All of the experimental sessions were recorded by a video camera placed parallel to the coronal plane of the mouse. Position and speed signals were subsequently extracted from the video recordings and synchronized with the force signals recorded by the load-cell. From these kinematic and kinetic signals, a series of parameters were automatically computed to describe detailed motor performance on the platform including the t-target (i.e., the time spent by the animal to accomplish a single retraction task) and the number of attempts to move the handle, with ‘attempts’ defining the force exerted by the mouse not sufficient to overcome the static friction. The computation and statistical analysis of these parameters were performed using custom-made algorithms developed in Matlab (Mathwork, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spalletti et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Before the lesion mice were allowed let free to explore the platform and gradually habituated to be restrained and to receive the reward. In the same surgery of the photothrombotic lesion, a metal post (length 8 mm, diameter 2 mm, weight 0.2 g) was placed on the occipital bone and fixed by means of dentistry cement (Super Bond C and B, Sun Medical Company, Japan). Since the surgery was minimally invasive, mice recovered in 24 hr. Thus, on the following day, mice were already head restrained on the platform, with their wrist positioned in the handle while regular rewards were provided. Thanks to this habituation phase, mice did not show stress or fear behaviour and easily get used to head restraining.</p><p>The day after, that is, 2 days post lesion, they were tested again in behavioural tests and kinematic values were acquired. After these tests, mice were restrained again on the platform and only few sessions of retraction task were performed. The animals started the daily rehabilitative treatment at day five post lesion and continued it until day 30 (4 weeks), performing 10–15 forelimb retraction sessions for 4 days a week. For the follow-up experiment, after behavioral assessment at day 30, the robotic therapy was interrupted until day 40 when animals were tested again in the Gridwalk and Schaller Cylinder tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Motor tests</title><p>Motor performance of all the experimental groups was assessed in baseline condition and then once a week at days 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 post-lesion (with the additional day 40 time point for the follow-up experiments) using two classical behavioral tests, Gridwalk and Schallert Cylinder test. A sub-group of animals (see above) were also tested in the Skilled Reaching Test, followed by kinematic analysis of the paw trajectories.</p><p><italic>Gridwalk Test:</italic> animals were allowed to walk freely for 5 min on an elevated grid (32 × 20 cm, with 11 × 11 mm-large openings) and the task was video-recorded. The video recordings were analyzed off-line by means of a custom-designed Graphical User Interface implemented in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>), to assess correct steps and foot-faults, that is, steps not providing body support, with the foot falling into grid hole, blind to the experimental group. The percentage of foot faults for each limb was then calculated, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>Schallert Cylinder Test:</italic> animals were placed in a Plexiglas cylinder (8 cm diameter, 15 cm height) and recorded for five minutes by a video-camera placed below the cylinder. Videos were analyzed frame by frame and the spontaneous use of both forelimbs was assessed during exploration of the walls, by counting the number of contacts performed by the paws of the animal. The experimenter was blind to the experimental group. For each wall exploration, the last paw that left and the first paw that contacted the wall or the ground were assessed. In order to quantify forelimb-use asymmetry displayed by the animal, an Asymmetry Index was computed, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al. (2015)</xref>.</p><p><italic>Skilled Reaching Test and Kinematic Analysis:</italic> The percentage of correct movements and the kinematic analysis of the whole reaching movements were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, animals (food deprived for 15 hr) were placed in a testing chamber with plastic walls and trained to perform a skilled reaching task with their preferred paw, which had to pass through a small frontal rectangular aperture (0.5 × 1.3 cm) to grasp and retrieve food pellets. The task was recorded by a high frame-rate video camera (120 frames per second, Hero 3, GO-Pro, USA), placed on the side of the testing chamber thus allowing for a sagittal view of the animal.</p><p>The number of correct (i.e., a reach and grasp movements ending with pellet eating) and incorrect movements (i.e., when the mouse passed by the frontal window and reached the pellet but either missed it or dropped the pellet after grasping it) were manually assessed. Then the percentage of incorrect grasping was calculated on the total attempts, defined as every time that the paw crossed the frontal window.</p><p>Off-line reconstruction of paw trajectories was performed by a semi-automated algorithm based on colour contrast analysis, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al. (2015)</xref>. Briefly, the algorithm tracked the trajectories of the preferred paw on the sagittal (<italic>x, y</italic>) plane by identifying the position of the paw previously painted with a green non-toxic dye (Stabilo Boss, Stabilo, Germany). To ensure consistency, only trajectories from successful trials (i.e. correct movements) were considered. Changes in the trajectories were quantified by the length of the whole trajectory (ArcLen), by the area enclosed by the reaching and retracting movement (Area Under the Curve, AUC), by the average value of the tangential velocity profile (Mean Speed) and by the number of peaks in the tangential velocity profile (Smoothness). A detailed description of kinematic parameters is provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai et al. (2015)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>For immunohistochemical analysis of plasticity markers, animals were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were cut using a sliding microtome (Leica, Germany) to obtain 50 μm thick coronal sections that were used for immunostaining of NeuN (1:1,000, Millipore, Germany), Parvalbumin (1:300, Synaptic Systems, Germany), Somatostatin (1:400, Millipore, Germany) and Myelin Basic Protein (1:500, Millipore, Germany). The number of Parvalbumin- and Somatostatin-positive neurons was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a 10x objective, counting in a 200 µm wide cortical column drawn at the medial and lateral edge of the ischemic tissue by Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, USA). Three sections per animal were analyzed. For MBP analysis, images were acquired using a 10x objective and analyzed offline drawing 200 µm wide columns at the lateral edge of the ischemic lesion using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, USA) and measuring mean fluorescence for each column. To evaluate the effect of BoNT/E injected into the motor cortex, we stained cortical sections with antibodies recognizing either the intact or BoNT/E-truncated forms of SNAP-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caleo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antonucci et al., 2010</xref>). The analysis was performed 2 days after BoNT/E injections and three sections per animal were analyzed. To quantify the lesion volume, 1 out of every six sections was stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The ischemic region was contoured using Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, USA) with a 10x objective and its area measured. The lesion volume for each animal was calculated by summing up all damaged areas and multiplying the number by section thickness and by 6 (the spacing factor). A total infarction volume in mm<sup>3</sup> is given as the mean ± standard error of all analyzed animals (n = 4 stroke untreated and n = 4 Robot +BoNT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical tests were performed using SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software Inc, USA) and the free software statistical environment ‘R’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">R Development Core Team, R. F. F. S. C, 2008</xref>).</p><p>For behavioural tests (Gridwalk test, Schallert Cylinder test and skilled reaching test) One-Way and Two Way Repeated Measures ANOVA were used, followed by a Tukey test. For comparison between groups, Two-Way ANOVA was used, followed by a Tukey test. For electrophysiological data and kinematics parameters, Two Way ANOVA was used followed by Tukey test, while paired Ttest was used to evaluate FPs before and after CGP application. For immunohistochemical analysis T test was used. All statistical analyses were performed on raw data (alpha value 0.05). No samples were excluded from analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Thomas Binz (Hannover, Germany) for the kind gift of BoNT/E.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Heidi Johansen-Berg (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors tested the effects of combining robotic training and inactivation of the contralesional healthy cortex on recovery after experimental stroke in mice. They hypothesized that this strategy would release transcallosal inhibition of the perilesional sensory/motor cortex, resulting in enhanced motor recovery after stroke. The paper presents an impressive series of experiments, involving behavioral testing, electrophysiological recordings and immunohistochemical analyses, in which different factors were systematically investigated. Results demonstrate that inactivation of the contralesional cortex leads to disinhibition of the ipsilesional cortex, which in combination with rehabilitation treatment, significantly improved recovery of motor functions. These findings support the reasoning behind clinical studies that apply inhibitory TMS or tDCS to the unaffected hemisphere, combined with rehabilitation treatment, to promote recovery in stroke patients.</p><p>Despite the large amount of acquired data, some important aspects were not detailed or discussed. In order to judge whether the conclusions of the paper hold, the reviewers require responses to fairly extensive revisions, detailed below. Responses to some of these issues, relating to study design, lesion type, and statistical analyses, will determine whether or not we wish to proceed with the paper at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study relies on the concept of an interhemispheric imbalance after stroke, but this concept may not always apply and conflicting results have been reported (see reviews by Di Pino et al., (2014) and Boddington and Reynolds, (2017)). The rationale to target transcallosal pathways therefore requires more explanation. Would this be more promising or effective in comparison to facilitatory ipsilesional stimulation strategies?</p><p>2) Sample sizes were 'determined by previous behavioral experiments and pilot experiments'. This needs to be clarified in more detail. Also, the authors report that animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups. How was randomization executed and is this the reason that group sizes are not equal (e.g. spontaneous group: n=11; robot group: n=5; BoNT group: n=5; Robot+BoNT group: n=6 (subsection “Experimental design”))?

The rationale to target transcallosal pathways therefore requires more explanation. Would this be more promising or effective in comparison to facilitatory ipsilesional stimulation strategies?</p></disp-quote><p>We have better introduced the concept of interhemispheric imbalance and the rationale to target transcallosal pathways vs. stimulating the ipsilesional side (Introduction). Plasticity in the lesioned hemisphere plays a major role in post-stroke motor recovery and is a primary target for rehabilitation therapy. Indeed, stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex, especially when paired with motor training, facilitates plasticity and functional restoration (Allman et al., 2016; Dodd et al., 2017). On the other hand, the role of the contralesional hemisphere remains highly controversial (Dancause et al., 2015; Talelli et al., 2012; Buetefisch, 2015). Attempts to promote stroke recovery by inhibiting the contralesional hemisphere are based on the interhemispheric competition model, which posits an enhanced transcallosal inhibition exerted by the healthy side over the spared perilesional tissue (Silasi and Murphy, 2014; Boddington and Reynolds, 2017; Plow et al., 2016). However, direct electrophysiological measures of the evolution of interhemispheric inhibition post-stroke are not yet available. Second, inactivation of the healthy hemisphere via either low-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or cathodal (inhibitory) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has yielded some positive yet variable effects in clinical trials (Kim et al., 2010; Lefaucheur et al., 2014; Di Pino et al., 2014, Plow et al., 2016). This variability in outcome may depend on the extent of damage (Di Pino et al.; 2014). Indeed, interhemispheric competition appears to dominate in patients with limited damage in the affected hemisphere, while after large lesions the contralesional side vicariates the lost functions (Bradnam et al., 2012; Di Pino et al., 2014). Based on these premises, here we demonstrated directly an enhanced interhemispheric inhibition after focal ischemic lesions, and showed that suppressing contralesional activity combined with robotic training improves forelimb motor function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Sample sizes were 'determined by previous behavioral experiments and pilot experiments'. This needs to be clarified in more detail. Also, the authors report that animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups. How was randomization executed and is this the reason that group sizes are not equal (e.g. spontaneous group: n=11; robot group: n=5; BoNT group: n=5; Robot+BoNT group: n=6 (subsection “Experimental design”))? Sample sizes in a treatment study should be based on an appropriate power calculation. Absence of a priori power calculation would be a serious shortcoming of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and we now report a more detailed description of our power analysis. Since the primary outcome of the study was the efficacy of the treatment in the motor outcomes, we estimated the minimum number of animals based on the results of our previous paper (Alia et al., 2016), where we demonstrated that a systemic treatment acting on the inhibitory system was able to ameliorate performance in the Gridwalk test. Here, we supposed our treatment could lead to similar or even better performance in the motor outcome. From data represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panel A (Alia et al., 2016), we estimated an effect size of 1.75 that was used to calculate the minimum number of animals necessary for this study to obtain a power &gt; 80%. We calculated that a number of 5 animals per group was enough to have a power of ≈81% so we considered a minimum of 5 animals per treatment group. Because of the high number of groups in the study, we organized different experimental sessions with different cohorts of mice. In each cohort we tested the homogeneity of the baseline performance and randomly assigned the animals to the different experimental groups. The randomization was performed through a computerized random numbers procedure and conducted independently of the study investigators. To ensure internal control, we have included at least two stroke untreated animals to be used as controls in each cohort, and this is why the sample size of the spontaneous group is higher. To respond to the request for a follow-up effect of the treatment, for this revision we made additional cohorts of animals and now the number of mice for robot and Robot+BoNT groups is increased and so is the power of the analysis. Power calculations were performed with G Power Software (version 3.1.5).</p><p>Power analysis and randomization are now better described in Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Disturbed transcallosal signal transmission may also be explained by direct injury to the corpus callosum.

In about 25% of the cases, we found limited damage in the dorsal aspect of the corpus callosum (myelin basic protein – MBP – labelling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It is unlikely that the alterations in interhemispheric communication are due to direct callosal damage (Results section), as we found a robust asymmetry between the Field Potential (FP) response recorded in the ipsilesional and contralesional cortex after transcallosal stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, while FPs recorded in the contralesional side were comparable to those evoked in healthy animals, FPs in the ipsilesional side were robustly affected, pointing to synaptic changes in peri-infarct zone. Based on the indication of the reviewers, we showed examples of the lesion in histological sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The effect of any type of treatment is strongly dependent on the time after stroke.

This is relevant because an interhemispheric imbalance after stroke may not be a static phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>To establish the temporal evolution of interhemispheric functional connectivity after stroke, we recorded FPs evoked by optogenetic stimulation of callosal afferents at an early time point (5 days) following the cortical infarct. We found that the initial, negative component of the evoked FP was dramatically reduced in the perilesional RFA, while there was a trend for enhanced amplitude of positive-going FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d-f</xref>). These findings demonstrate an early imbalance in interhemispheric connectivity early after stroke (Results section), and support the choice of a prompt inactivation of the contralesional cortex with BoNT/E, which requires at least 24 hr to become fully active (Antonucci et al., 2008). For robotic training, we chose to start the physiotherapy at day 5, since it is known that early exercise may exacerbate brain injury, via excitotoxicity and generation of reactive oxygen species (Kozlowski et al., 1996; Li et al., 2017). Moreover, it is well established that priming the brain with a “plasticity-inducing” treatment before the beginning of a rehabilitative treatment improves motor performance after brain lesions (Schäbitz et al., 2004; Starkey et al., 2012; Wahl et al., 2014). These issues are now discussed in subsection “Robotic Rehabilitation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is important to know if positive effects of rehabilitative treatments last beyond the treatment period.

Accordingly, we have now provided evidence for a persistent effect of the treatment beyond the completion of the rehabilitation protocol. To this aim, two additional cohorts of Robot+BoNT and Robot mice (n = 5 per group) were tested at 40 days, i.e. after a follow-up period of 10 days during which robotic training was suspended. We found that functional gains in the Robot+BoNT group were maintained at 40 days, while no improvements could be detected in the animals undergoing only robotic rehabilitation. The difference between the two groups remained highly significant at 40 days. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref> and discussed in subsection “Robotic Rehabilitation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Throughout the paper statistical tests appear to have been only made within group.

We agree that comparisons between the different groups (stroke untreated, BoNT, Robot and Robot+BoNT) are crucial to establish the effectiveness of the combined therapy vs. the separate treatments. Accordingly, we have now shown the comparisons between groups in the behavioural tests and electrophysiological analyses, and we have plotted the motor performances in the Gridwalk and Schallert cylinder tests at the completion of treatment (30 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the Gridwalk test, Robot+BoNT group was superior to Robot and untreated stroke but statistically comparable to BoNT/E only. In the Schallert cylinder test, mice receiving the combined therapy displayed markedly improved performances with respect to all the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and Results section). Altogether, these data indicate that the combined treatment yields better results that the separate therapies.</p><p>For the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, we have now compared Robot+BoNT vs. stroke untreated and the statistical analysis reveals that several electrophysiological parameters (amplitude of the late positive FP component, paired pulse depression ratio) are indeed rescued by the combined treatment (see Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is unclear how to interpret the evoked potential.

We have used CNQX and GABA-B blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to demonstrate that the first phase of the evoked potential corresponds to a volley of transcallosal excitation in the RFA, which leads to local activation of GABAergic cells and subsequent GABA-B dependent inhibition of cortical neurons. These data are consistent with neuroanatomical observations indicating that the corpus callosum consists almost entirely of excitatory fibers, which implies that interhemispheric inhibition arises from the activation of local interneurons (such as neurogliaform cells located in layer I; Palmer et al., 2012). These issues are discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It seems worth modelling the two phases to show what is GABAB and what is the initial volley of excitation.

A description of the waveforms and effects of CNQX/GABA-B blockers is now presented at the beginning of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In stroke, it seems that both the first and the second phase of the evoked potential is modified. How do the authors interpret this? Is there also weaker excitation?</p></disp-quote><p>The electrophysiological data (field potentials and multi-unit activity) indicate weaker direct transcallosal excitation accompanied by an increase in interhemispheric inhibition. The reduction in the negative-going FP and stimulus-induced spiking after stroke may be simply explained by a dampened excitatory drive of pyramidal neurons in the target hemisphere (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Importantly, callosal fibres also contact inhibitory neurons (such as neurogliaform cells in layer I) which in turn synapse on cortical pyramids. Two non-mutually exclusive possibilities may explain the increased interhemispheric inhibition following stroke: (i) a structural reorganization of callosalfibers after ischemia, with enhanced innervation of layer 1 interneurons, possibly accompanied by a retraction of inputs onto the dendrites of pyramidal cells; (ii) an enhanced synaptic transmission between transcallosally-driven interneurons and cortical pyramids, due to either presynaptic or post-synaptic mechanisms. In particular, previous studies have shown a robust and early upregulation of GABA-B receptors in peri-infarct areas that suggest augmented responsiveness to GABA release. These microcircuit changes are discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did they look at GABAB blockers in the healthy condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed electrophysiological recordings on a group of 7 healthy, naive mice before and after application of the GABA-B blocker CPG55845 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B,C</xref>), and the results indicate a significant decrease of the late positive component of the FP with no impact on the early negative wave (see Results section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
