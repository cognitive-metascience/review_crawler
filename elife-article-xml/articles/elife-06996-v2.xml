physiological signaling by primary cilia depends on the specific targeting of particular receptors to the ciliary membrane, but how this occurs remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that D1-type dopaminergic receptors are delivered to cilia from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane by a mechanism requiring the receptor cytoplasmic tail, the intraflagellar transport complex-B (IFT-B), and ciliary kinesin KIF17. This targeting mechanism critically depends on Rab23, a small guanine nucleotide binding protein that has important effects on physiological signaling from cilia but was not known previously to be essential for ciliary delivery of any cargo. Depleting Rab23 prevents dopamine receptors from accessing the ciliary membrane. Conversely, fusion of Rab23 to a non-ciliary receptor is sufficient to drive robust, nucleotide-dependent mis-localization to the ciliary membrane. Dopamine receptors thus reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of ciliary receptor targeting and functional role of Rab23 in promoting this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06996.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06996.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06996.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Slender structures called primary cilia protrude from the outer membrane of nearly every human cell. Each cell generally has one cilium, which helps the cell to sense its environment and respond to the signaling molecules sent to the cell to influence its behavior. Proteins called receptors, which are embedded in the surface of the cilia, bind to these molecules and help to transmit information about these signals into the cell.</p><p>The receptor proteins are not made in the cilia. So far, two broad ways of transporting the receptors to the cilia have been established: some receptors are carried through the interior of the cell inside small membrane-enclosed compartments, and some are pulled from another part of the cell's membrane. However, the exact steps and molecules involved in transporting different receptor types are not fully known.</p><p>One type of receptor that is commonly found in the cilia of many different cells interacts with a signaling molecule called dopamine. Leaf and Von Zastrow tagged the dopamine receptor with a fluorescent protein that allowed its movement through a cell to be followed under a microscope. This revealed that the dopamine receptor slides into cilia from another part of the cell's membrane. To do so, the dopamine receptor binds to a pair of proteins known to help move receptors around the cell. A third protein called Rab23 then acts as a gatekeeper that allows the dopamine receptor to pass into the cilia. Reducing the amount of Rab23 in a cell prevented dopamine receptors from entering the cilia. Furthermore, Leaf and Von Zastrow found that other receptor proteins incorrectly moved into the cilia if they were bound to Rab23.</p><p>Rab23 was already known to play a role in controlling signaling in cilia, and mutations in the Rab23 gene cause disease in humans, but Rab23 was not known to be necessary for delivering receptors to cilia. Future studies to further reveal how Rab23 directs receptors to cilia, and to determine which other ciliary proteins might use this transportation process, will lead to a better understanding of the normal structure and activity of primary cilia. This could lead to new strategies for treating the human diseases that involve defective cilia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06996.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06996.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA010154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>predoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leaf</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA010711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA012864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Von Zastrow</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanism of signaling receptor delivery to primary cilia involves a specific cellular role of a Rab protein that is critical for vertebrate development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based protrusions of the plasma membrane that support a wide range of specialized receptor-mediated signaling functions. Physiological signaling from cilia critically depends on the selectivity of receptor targeting to the ciliary membrane, and disturbances in this targeting are thought to underlie a variety of pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsiao et al., 2012</xref>). The remarkable specificity of ciliary membrane targeting is clear among G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Some members of this large receptor family robustly accumulate in the ciliary membrane while others, including closely related homologues, are found throughout the extra-ciliary plasma membrane but are effectively excluded from cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marley and von Zastrow, 2010</xref>). Understanding how particular GPCRs localize to primary cilia with such exquisite selectivity is a fundamental problem with broad physiological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emmer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The ciliary membrane compartment is separated from the surrounding extra-ciliary plasma membrane by a transition zone complex that impedes lateral exchange of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilula and Satir, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chih et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). This can explain how GPCRs are retained in cilia once delivered, but not how they are delivered in the first place. Two basic routes of ciliary membrane delivery have been described: first, receptors can originate from an intracellular source, through fusion of post-Golgi transport vesicles with the ciliary membrane in or near the transition zone. A number of membrane proteins are targeted to cilia by this route, and molecular machineries supporting it have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deretic and Papermaster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mazelova et al., 2009</xref>). Second, receptors can originate from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane. This route, first described in a seminal study of flagellar agglutinins in <italic>Chalmydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunnicutt et al., 1990</xref>), contributes to ciliary targeting of the atypical seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milenkovic et al., 2009</xref>) in mammalian cells. Is the lateral delivery route relevant to ciliary localization of conventional GPCRs?</p><p>Molecular mechanisms that underlie specific ciliary delivery pathways also remain incompletely understood. A number of proteins are already known to play a role, including the BBSome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berbari et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2010</xref>), Tulp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2013</xref>), Arf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deretic et al., 2005</xref>), ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B and IFT-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keady et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crouse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuzhandaivel et al., 2014</xref>). Are there additional machineries not yet identified that function in targeting specific GPCRs to cilia?</p><p>We addressed these questions through study of the D1-type dopamine receptor (D1R), a conventional GPCR that robustly localizes to cilia in diverse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marley and von Zastrow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domire et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that D1Rs are delivered to the cilium from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane. Further, we show that the D1R cytoplasmic tail is both necessary and sufficient to direct receptor targeting to the ciliary membrane, and this requires a distinct set of cellular proteins including the anterograde IFT-B complex and ciliary kinesin, KIF17. Moreover, we identify an essential role of the small GTP-binding protein, Rab23, in the ciliary targeting mechanism. Rab23 is not only necessary for D1R access to cilia, it is also sufficient to drive strong ciliary localization of a non-ciliary GPCR. D1Rs thus reveal a discrete route and mechanism of ciliary GPCR targeting in which Rab23 plays an unprecedented and essential role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>D1Rs are robustly targeted to the primary cilium</title><p>The D1R is a cilia-localized GPCR whose mechanism of targeting to the cilium is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marley and von Zastrow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). We investigated this question using recombinant receptors expressed in inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells. Using an N-terminal Flag tag on the D1R to label the overall surface pool, D1Rs were visualized throughout the plasma membrane and highly enriched in cilia marked by acetylated tubulin (AcTub) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), like the cilia-localized somatostatin-3 receptor (SSTR3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">HÃ¤ndel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berbari et al., 2008a</xref>).

Second, because cilia scored as receptor-positive varied in degree of apparent receptor concentration, we determined average fold-enrichment of receptors on the cilium relative to the extra-ciliary plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To distinguish these possibilities, we fused the D1R to photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (Flag-D1-PAGFP) and investigated mobility by live cell imaging coupled to local photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We verified appropriate ciliary localization of engineered receptors by anti-Flag Alexa555 surface labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top row). Locally photoactivated D1Rs were distributed non-uniformly on cilia immediately after the 405-nm illumination pulse and then equilibrated throughout the cilium within seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; whole-cell images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, there was no visible spread of labeled receptors outside of the cilium on this time scale. Consistent with this, total PA-GFP fluorescence intensity integrated over the ciliary length remained unchanged throughout an 80-s interval after local photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

If new receptors enter the cilium from an internal membrane pool during the 30-min incubation period (depicted in center, â30 minâ), they contribute neither Alexa555 nor PA-GFP signal, so the fluorescence ratio is unchanged from the initial condition (PA/555 = 1). After the subsequent 405-nm test pulse (depicted at right, â30 min + PAâ), the PA-GFP signal increases without any change in Alexa555 signal, elevating the fluorescence ratio above the initial condition (PA/555 &gt; 1). If new receptors enter the cilium from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane pool, they contribute Alexa555 but not PA-GFP signal during the 30-min incubation, reducing the fluorescence ratio from the initial condition (PA/555 &lt; 1). The subsequent 405-nm pulse restores the fluorescence ratio to the initial value (PA/555 = 1). (<bold>H</bold>) Experimental results from the strategy depicted in panel <bold>G</bold>.

We sought to measure this delivery by taking advantage of the irreversible nature of PA-GFP photoactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2003</xref>). Multiple 405-nm light pulses were delivered in rapid succession to photoactivate the majority of D1Rs present in the cilium. We then assessed the effect of administering a subsequent 405-nm pulse at a later time. We reasoned that, because D1Rs delivered from outside the cilium would not have been previously photoactivated, their arrival in the cilium would result in an increment in the ciliary PA-GFP signal elicited by a subsequent 405-nm pulse. This was indeed the case: when a subsequent 405-nm pulse was administered shortly (â¼30 s) after the initial photoactivation series, little (â¼15%) increase of ciliary PA-GFP fluorescence was observed, consistent with a small residual fraction of D1Rs escaping photoactivation in the initial pulse series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left bar). However, when the subsequent 405-nm pulse was administered 30 min after the initial series, the increment of ciliary PA-GFP fluorescence was markedly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right bar). Additionally, the degree of the PA-GFP fluorescence increment increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and we verified that the PA-GFP fluorescence increment was negligible when measured in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These results directly verify active delivery of D1Rs to the ciliary membrane compartment and provide a rough estimate of the rate of this delivery, on the order of â¼1% of the total ciliary D1R pool per min.</p><p>D1Rs delivered to the cilium could originate from an internal vesicular pool or from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deretic and Papermaster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milenkovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). To distinguish these possibilities, we further elaborated the sequential photoactivation technique by taking advantage of dual labeling of surface D1Rs using anti-Flag conjugated to Alexa555, whose fluorescence was not affected by the 405-nm pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). If D1R delivery originates from an internal membrane pool, we expected (1) unchanged PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio over the 30-min incubation after initial photoactivation because receptors delivered during this interval would not contribute fluorescence in either channel and (2) increased PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio above the initial value after the subsequent photoactivation pulse because newly delivered receptors would contribute PA-GFP but not Alexa555 signal. On the other hand, if ciliary D1R delivery originates from a plasma membrane pool, we expected (1) decreased PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio during the 30-min incubation after initial photoactivation because newly delivered D1Rs would be labeled with Alexa555 but lack PA-GFP signal and (2) return to the initial value after the subsequent 405-nm pulse because newly delivered D1Rs would then contribute both Alexa555 and PA-GFP signal. We observed precisely the latter result: PA-GFP/Alexa555 decreased by approximately 50% during the 30-min incubation after initial photoactivation and returned to a value close to the initial ratio after the subsequent photoactivation pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; example images from separate fluorescence channels shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). These observations indicate that D1Rs are delivered to the ciliary membrane compartment primarily from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane pool. Supporting the validity of this fluorescence ratio determination, bleaching of both fluorophores was negligible after sequential image acquisitions exceeding the number required for this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>), and there was negligible bleed-through from the 488 channel into the 555 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ciliary targeting of D1Rs is directed by the receptor's cytoplasmic tail</title><p>To begin to explore the biochemical mechanism of D1R ciliary targeting, we searched for structural determinants within the receptor that are required for ciliary localization. Previous studies of other cilia-localized receptors have identified targeting determinants located either in a cytoplasmic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berbari et al., 2008a</xref>) or the cytoplasmic tail (C-tail; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deretic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>). Progressive truncation of the D1R C-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) strongly reduced ciliary localization of receptors. Truncating the distal end had no effect (e.g., D1-415T; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but removing a larger portion strongly reduced ciliary receptor localization (D1-382T; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Fusion of the entire D1R C-tail to DOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) conferred robust ciliary localization. However, fusion of a shorter fragment of the D1R C-tail was not sufficient to confer ciliary localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3HâJ</xref>; whole-cell images for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>), even though it contained the necessary 381â395 sequence, and chimeras exhibited similar levels of overall surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, we found that fusion of a smaller region of the D1R C-tail that also contains residues 381â395 (Flag-DOR-D1(379â400)) was not sufficient to confer ciliary localization on DOR. 23 out of 23 cells expressing the chimeric receptor had no visible enrichment of receptor in the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the structural information required for D1R ciliary targeting is contained in the receptor's C-tail and requires residues 381â395 for full activity.

To ask if IFT57 interaction with D1R is directly congruent with ciliary targeting activity, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis comparing HA-IFT57 pull-down with wild-type Flag-D1R and FlagD1Î381-395. Deletion of resides 381â395 of the D1R C-tail, a mutation that profoundly impairs ciliary targeting, did not reduce IFT57 co-IP. To the contrary, the co-IP signal was significantly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). This suggests that the D1R C-tail, while both necessary and sufficient for ciliary receptor targeting, likely functions in a more complex manner than can be explained by a single interaction surface with IFT-B.</p><p>IFT-B is known to associate with KIF3A (kinesin-II, a heterotrimeric kinesin-2) and KIF17 (a homodimeric kinesin-2), plus end-directed kinesins that mediate anterograde cargo movement toward or within cilia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>). KIF3A is required for delivery of axonemal components and overall ciliogenesis, while KIF17 is not essential for ciliogenesis and is proposed to have more specialized cargo transport functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). We verified the presence of KIF17-IFT57 complexes in IMCD3 cells, as reported previously by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Insinna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howard et al., 2013</xref>), by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that KIF17 may function as a specific motor supporting D1R delivery to cilia. To test this, we introduced a point mutation in the KIF17 motor domain at a conserved residue in the switch II region (KIF17-G234A) that is essential for kinesin motor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rice et al., 1999</xref>). D1Rs were visible on cilia in essentially all cells expressing the motor-defective HA-KIF17-G234A, but the degree of ciliary receptor enrichment was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, expression of wild-type KIF17 did not visibly affect D1R ciliary localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; whole-cell images verifying HA-KIF17-G234A and HA-KIF17 expression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Verifying this, KIF17-G234A, but not KIF17, selectively reduced the fold-enrichment metric while having little effect on the fraction of receptor-positive cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). As an independent assessment of the role of KIF17 on D1R ciliary localization, we examined the effect of expressing a different dominant negative KIF17 construct (HA-KIF17-DN) containing only the cargo-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>). Expression of HA-KIF17-DN also significantly reduced D1R ciliary enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Further, this effect was specific to D1Rs because KIF17-G234A did not reduce ciliary enrichment of SSTR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>; whole-cell images verifying HA-KIF17-G234A expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Remarkably, activated Rab23 drove robust ciliary localization of DOR (DOR-Rab23-Q68L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7FâI</xref>; whole-cell images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). While fusion of Rab23-Q68L to the mutant D1R increased overall receptor surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>), the opposite was observed for fusion to DOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7âfigure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that the ciliary targeting activity of Rab23 is separable from its effects on overall surface receptor expression. Moreover, this ciliary targeting activity was specific for Rab23 because fusion of an activated allele of the closely related Rab paralogue, Rab11 (DOR-Rab11-Q70L), or of Rab8 (DOR-Rab8-Q67L) that is known to localize to cilia, failed to drive detectable ciliary targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). The ability of activated Rab23 to confer ciliary localization on a non-ciliary GPCR was not limited to DOR. Fusion of activated Rab23 to the C-tails of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and beta-2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR), which are normally excluded from cilia, conferred robust ciliary localization on both receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Together, these results support the hypothesis that Rab23 plays a key role in determining the specificity of ciliary receptor targeting.</p><p>We next sought to investigate if the identified protein components required for D1R ciliary targeting function in an integrated pathway. As noted above, disrupting KIF17 motor activity strongly reduced ciliary enrichment of the wild-type D1R. In contrast, ciliary enrichment driven by direct fusion of the activated Rab23 to the D1R (D1Î381-395-Rab23-Q68L) was unaffected by this manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâC</xref>; whole-cell images verifying HA-KIF17-G234A expression are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, full ciliary enrichment of D1Î381-395-Rab23-Q68L remained in the presence of IFT172 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting that fusion to activated Rab23 can also override the IFT-B requirement. We also noted that Rab23 knockdown did not prevent or reduce D1R association with IFT-B, as estimated by co-immunoprecipitation of IFT57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). To the contrary, Rab23 knockdown tended to increase the IFT57-D1R co-IP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In contrast to its clear effect on the ciliary concentration of D1Rs, disrupting KIF17 motor activity did not prevent Rab23 localization to cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results suggest that IFT-B/KIF17 and Rab23 are all required for efficient targeting of D1Rs to cilia and may indeed function in an integrated pathway.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06996.040</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Evidence IFT-B, KIF17, and Rab23 function in an integrated ciliary delivery pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images showing the effect of motor domain-mutant KIF17 (+KIF17-G234A) on Flag-tagged wild-type D1R localization to the cilium (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

We identified a discrete mechanism of ciliary receptor targeting through study of the D1R.</p><p>Past work has focused primarily on receptor delivery from a post-Golgi membrane source. In contrast, we found that D1Rs are delivered to cilia from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane. We also found that ciliary D1R delivery is directed by the receptor C-tail. However, we were unable to find any sequence in the D1R C-tail conforming to a previously defined ciliary targeting motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deretic et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berbari et al., 2008a</xref>). Also, our mutational studies suggest that the structural determinant required for ciliary D1R targeting is a relatively extended structure. We identified a distinct set of trans-acting proteins important for ciliary targeting of D1Rs. We were unable to detect a requirement for TULP3 or BBSome components, although these are essential for ciliary localization of SSTR3 and MCHR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berbari et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>). We also did not detect a requirement for Arf4, ASAP1, or Rab11, which are essential for rhodopsin delivery to the rod outer segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deretic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, D1Rs add to a growing appreciation that there exist receptor-specific differences in mechanisms of ciliary membrane targeting.</p><p>Nevertheless, some similarities are evident. The present results are consistent with IFT-B functioning in anterograde cargo delivery to the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silverman and Leroux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</xref>). Several IFT-B components (IFT20, IFT57, and IFT140) have been implicated in rhodopsin delivery to the rod outer segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krock and Perkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keady et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crouse et al., 2014</xref>), and IFT172 was recently implicated in Smo localization to primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuzhandaivel et al., 2014</xref>). The present finding that IFT57 and IFT172 are required for ciliary D1R targeting provides further evidence that IFT-B contributes to ciliary delivery of select membrane cargoes.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with KIF17 functioning as an ancillary motor supporting ciliary cargo delivery. KIF17 is necessary for ciliary localization of an olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>), but to our knowledge, KIF17 has not been shown previously to function in localizing a GPCR to cilia. Our results identify a specific role of KIF17, and of KIF17 motor activity, in promoting ciliary concentration of the D1R but not the SSTR3. Further supporting the proposed role of KIF17 as an anterograde transport motor for D1Rs, we found that D1Rs specifically co-IP IFT57 from intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and verified IFT57 association with KIF17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Insinna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howard et al., 2013</xref>). An interesting related observation is that deletion of residues 381â395 in the D1R tail, a manipulation that inhibits D1R ciliary targeting, did not disrupt the D1R-IFT57 interaction, but rather, increased it. This supports the idea that ciliary targeting of D1Rs is likely a complex process.</p><p>A remarkable finding in the present study is that Rab23 is an essential component of the D1R ciliary targeting mechanism. To our knowledge, this represents the first evidence that Rab23 is required for ciliary localization of any signaling receptor or membrane cargo. Previous studies of other cilia-localized membrane proteins, such as polycystin-2 and Smo, have not observed such a requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eggenschwiler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehlke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffmeister et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we think it likely that Rab23's function in ciliary membrane targeting is specific to a subset of cilia-localized cargoes. We note that ciliary localization of SSTR3 is also sensitive to Rab23 knockdown, even though, in contrast to D1R, its ciliary targeting is insensitive to manipulation of KIF17 motor activity. This provides further support for the existence of receptor-specific differences in the ciliary targeting mechanism.</p><p>Altogether, the present findings support the conclusion that D1Rs are targeted to the cilium from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane through a complex mechanism involving IFT-B, KIF17, and Rab23. Our results support the hypothesis that these components function together in an integrated ciliary delivery pathway and suggest that they have distinguishable functional effects in the delivery pathway. First, disrupting KIF17 motor activity strongly reduced ciliary D1R enrichment without affecting the fraction of receptor-positive cilia. This is potentially consistent with KIF17 motor activity promoting cililary D1R concentration, but not being essential for ciliary D1R access. Second, direct fusion of activated Rab23 to the D1R C-tail can promote ciliary targeting in a manner that is apparently insensitive to KIF17 motor activity. Third, Rab23 knockdown did not disrupt the D1R/IFT-B interaction as estimated by co-immunoprecipitation. These results also support the idea that the lateral delivery mechanism is complex, but additional studies are required to further delineate the precise functions of each of these identified components.</p><p>The present results raise a number of interesting questions for future study. First, given that receptor accumulation in the ciliary membrane is dependent on Rab23 nucleotide state, an important next question is how this nucleotide state is controlled. A second question, which may be related to the first, is how selective cargo engagement with the ciliary delivery mechanism is determined. The present data strongly suggest a functional interaction between Rab23 and the D1R ciliary targeting determinant, but we have been unable, so far, to establish direct physical interaction between the D1R and Rab23. It is conceivable that IFT-B links D1Rs and Rab23, or that unidentified additional protein(s) explain the functional interaction observed. A third question is to ascertain precisely how Rab23 directs receptor delivery to the ciliary membrane. Based on precedent of other Rab protein functions, we speculate that there is a specific effector of Rab23 that operates at or near the ciliary diffusion barrier. A fourth question is what broader physiological significance the discrete, Rab23-dependent ciliary targeting mechanism has. We note that a mutation in Rab23 produces excessive Hedgehog signaling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eggenschwiler et al., 2001</xref>). One possibility is that this reflects a disruption of ciliary signaling normally mediated by a Rab23-dependent receptor. Thus, further investigation of the receptor-specific ciliary targeting mechanism identified here may provide fundamental insight into the role of primary cilia as physiological signaling devices and toward understanding pathologies associated with ciliary defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>IMCD3 cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM/Ham's F-12 Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (UCSF Cell Culture Facility, San Francisco, California, USA).</p><p>Flag-D1R, Flag-DOR, Flag-MOR, and Flag-B2AR constructs were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vickery and von Zastrow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanowitz and Von Zastrow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).

Cells were imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon TE-2000 with Yokogawa confocal scanner unit CSU22) using a 100Ã NA 1.45 objective. To photoactivate Flag-D1-PAGFP specifically in the cilium, 405-nm laser illumination was directed through a second light path via a single-mode fiber and focused in the image plane. Photoactivation was achieved by delivering brief (100 ms) pulses of 405-nm illumination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microscope image acquisition</title><p>For epifluorescence microscopy of fixed cells, images were acquired using a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments MicroMax) with illumination and exposure times adjusted to remain in the linear range of the camera. For spinning disc confocal microscopy of live cells, images were collected at 37Â°C using an electron multiplying CCD camera (Andor iXon 897) operated in the linear range. Images were processed at full bit depth for all analysis and rendered for display by converting to 8 bit format using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) and a linear lookup table.</p><p>To measure the receptor fluorescence in the cilium, a region of interest (ROI) was manually created by outlining the cilium in the image. To correct for background fluorescence, the ROI was moved to a region outside the cell to measure representative fluorescence. This value was subtracted from the ciliary fluorescence. To measure the D1-PAGFP diffusion in cilium, the total PAGFP fluorescence was measured and normalized to the Flag-555 label to account for accumulation of receptor or focal plane (orientation) of the cilium.</p><p>To estimate lateral mobility of receptors in the cilium, the 405-nm laser spot was positioned so that it illuminated the center of the cilium but not the ends. A single photoactivation pulse was delivered with continuous confocal imaging at 0.5 Hz to monitor changes in the distribution of photoactivated Flag-D1-PAGFP in the cilium over time. To estimate new receptor delivery to the cilium, three 405-nm pulses were delivered over 10 s, determined empirically to photoactivate the majority of Flag-D1-PAGFP present in the cilium. We then acquired a subsequent GFP image, delivered another (single) 405-nm pulse, and acquired the GFP image again. This sequential âimage-photoactivate-imageâ sequence was applied either immediately (approximately 30 s) after the initial 405-nm pulse series or 30 min after. New delivery was estimated by the increment of integrated PA-GFP fluorescence intensity measured after the subsequent 405-nm pulse minus before, normalized to the integrated fluorescence intensity measured after. The anti-Flag Alex555 channel (unaffected by 405-nm pulses) was used to optimize focus on the cilium and to verify that the specimen did not move significantly between the âbeforeâ and âafterâ images. To assess the source of Flag-D1-PAGFP delivery to the cilium, we used a similar strategy as described above but quantified in the photoactivation series both PA-GFP and Alexa555 channels and determined their ratio. New receptor delivery from internal relative to plasma membrane sources was distinguished by changes in the PA-GFP/Alexa555 ratio, based on selective labeling with Alexa555 of only the plasma membrane pool, as discussed in text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis and statistical analysis</title><p>For line scan analysis, a straight line was drawn on the cilium, and the PlotProfile tool in ImageJ was used to determine the fluorescence intensity along the line. For integrated fluorescence determinations, the rectangular ROI tool was used. Results are displayed as mean of results from each experiment involving imaging of multiple specimens and cilia (specified in the figure legends). Error bars represent standard error of the mean based on at least n = 3 independent experiments done on different days unless noted otherwise. The statistical significance between conditions was analyzed using Student's unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, calculated using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc) and applying the Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. The threshold for significance was p &lt; 0.05 with exact p value ranges indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence flow cytometry</title><p>Surface-accessible Flag immunoreactivity was quantified by fluorescence flow cytometry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsao and Von Zastrow, 2000</xref>). Briefly, cells were dissociated from culture dishes, labeled in suspension 4Â°C with anti-Flag M1 conjugated to Alexa 647, and analyzed using a FACS-Calibur instrument (Becton Dickenson). In each experiment, mean fluorescence intensity was determined from 10,000 cells and averaged over triplicate determinations for each construct. For all conditions shown, experiments were performed in triplicate, on separate days and from separate transfections. Error bars represent SEM across the experimental days. For determination of mutant receptor surface expression, transiently transfected cells were analyzed 48 hr after transfection. For evaluation of the effects of siRNA knockdown, stably transfected cells were analyzed 72 hr after transfection with the indicated siRNA duplex.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Aaron Marley for assistance at an early stage of this project and for generating the Flag-D1R stable cell line used in this study.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work from the von Zastrow laboratory investigates targeting of the D1-type dopaminergic receptor (D1R) to the primary cilium of IMCD3 cells. Although protein trafficking to the cilium is well studied, this study indicates that new insights remain to be uncovered. The authors report that D1R has a unique cytoplasmic C-terminal sequence that appears to be required for targeting D1R; the C-terminal can induce ciliary targeting of the non-ciliary delta opiod peptide receptor (DOR). Using a small siRNA screen and dominant negative constructs, the authors report that D1R targeting also requires IFT-B, KIF17 and Rab23, and they show some data they interpret as a hierarchical regulation of these additional components. Overall, this is an interesting and well documented study that may be of broad interest. However, there are a number of criticisms that need addressing.</p><p>The reviewers were confused about what story the authors want to tell. On the one hand, the title of the manuscript indicates that the paper is about âRab23 as a gatekeeper of ciliary entryâ yet the data only implicate Rab23 in trafficking of D1R. On the other hand, the manuscript is about ciliary targeting of D1R and the roles of its targeting sequence and known ciliary transport factors such as IFT and KIF17.</p><p>With respect to the idea that Rab23 is a âgatekeeper of cargo delivery to ciliaâ, in the Discussion, the authors cite papers that Rab23 is not required for ciliary localization of polycystin-2 or Smo. Thus the idea that Rab23 is a âgatekeeperâ doesn't seem to hold. The fact that Rab23 is not required for ciliary localization of Smo also indicates that Rab23 is not specialized for regulating lateral entry of membrane proteins but it would probably be good if the authors looked at Smo localization directly. Is it that Rab23 plays a role in ciliary localization of receptors with D1R-type targeting sequences? What about its role in ciliary localization of other receptors with known targeting sequences (e.g. SSTR3, MCHR1)?</p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt that the evidence for a âgate-keeperâ role for Rab23 was weak, and that the authors should concentrate on D1R ciliary targeting mechanisms.</p><p>A) Molecular mechanisms of D1R targeting.</p><p>1) Based on a C-terminal truncation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the authors state that a short sequence (top page 9) is the ciliary targeting signal for D1R (aa 381-395). However, they then state that chimeras comprising DOR and the C-terminal of D1R caused DOR localization in the cilium, except when the C-terminal D1R sequence was truncated but still contained this putative DIR targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is unclear, therefore, how the authors can draw the conclusion that aa 381-395 is a ciliary targeting signal. Is the signal more complex, and involve a folded structure, part of which is regulated through by aa 381-395? Did the authors examine ciliary targeting of D1R that contained only aa 381-395 from the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain? Resolution of this problem has important relevance to other studies that used a deletion of this sequence, but not this sequence explicitly.</p><p>2) The authors should attempt to map the IFT-B-binding determinants on D1R and check whether they are congruent with the D1R CTS. Given that the authors have all the D1R truncations, the mapping of the interaction should be straightforward and will be informative. It would also be interesting to test interaction of IFT57 with known ciliary GPCRs.</p><p>3) With respect to the mechanisms by which D1R is targeted to the cilium, the reviewers liked the assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>, but were concerned that assumptions regarding the photokinetics properties of of PAGFP could be misleading.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> assumes that photoactivation of PA-GFP is complete and irreversible. While the photokinetics properties of PA-GFP in the test tube or other specific cellular environment do support the author's assumption, an independent verification that ciliary D1R-PAGFP is fully and irreversibly converted after 405 nm pulsing is essential. One possibility is that a fraction (e.g. 30%) of fluorophores enter a reversible dark state after the laser pulses. It should be straightforward to conduct the same experiment as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> in fixed cells or after ATP depletion. This is an important point as reversible photoactivation and no transport within the 30 min time frame would account for the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>.</p><p>The two predictions for a receptor that is delivered from a PM pool [1) a ratio PA/555 &lt;1 at data point â30 minâ and 2) a recovery to ratio PA/555 =1 at data point â30 min + PAâ] could be obtained if the receptor was delivered from an internal pool and the PAGFP proportionally bleaches faster than the 555. The reviewers requested that more of the original data is shown with separate fluorescence channels. And some controls with no Flag antibody or unrelated 555 antibody.</p><p>In addition, a concern with the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is the possibility of photo-damage to the transition zone by the repeated pulses at 405 nm. Photo-damage of the TZ may cause a rupture of the diffusion barrier thus allowing molecules to enter from the PM into the CM. This could cause the rather high recovery rate of D1R, compared to the GPCRs tested by others. There are assays for testing the functional integrity of the TZ by assaying exclusion of large (&gt;200 kDa) proteins into cilia.</p><p>B) Roles of RAB23, Kif17 and IFT-B</p><p>1) Experiments fusing Rab23 to the D1R deficient in ciliary targeting. The reference about the G234A mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rice et al. 1999</xref>) refers to a G234A mutant of conventional kinesin. Does mutation of G234A in KIF17 also result in a lack of ATP hydrolysis? Also, the work with the G234A mutant of conventional kinesin used recombinant homodimers of G234A whereas the G234A mutant KIF17 is over-expressed in cells that contain endogenous KIF17. How does this impact the ability of G234A KIF17 to work in cells? Do you get the same targeting defect upon knockdown of KIF17 or expression of a dominant negative motor?</p><p>2) The surface level of D1RÎ381-395-Rab23 is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>) while the cilia/PM ratio is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), indicating that the overall expression level of the protein is higher than the control (D1R). This should be discussed. To add weight to their model concerning the order of events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), it would be good to show that GFP-Rab23-Q68L and/or Rab23 WT still localize to the cilium when Kif17-G234A is expressed. Also, can fusion of the WT or Q69L Rab23 protein to D1R rescue the trafficking effect upon knockdown of IFT or KIF17?</p><p>3) The Rab23-D1Rdelta[381-395] fusion is difficult to interpret: it is extremely artificial and suggests that combining two proteins that weakly localize to cilia can create a protein that strongly localize to cilia. Assigning a sequence of action of Rab23 based on this fusion seems like a stretch. To add weight to their model concerning the order of events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), it would be good to show that GFP-Rab23-Q68L and/or Rab23 WT still localize to the cilium when Kif17-G234A is expressed or when KIF17 is depleted by siRNA.</p><p>4) The effect of KIF17 dominant negative are intriguing but somewhat difficult to interpret. For example, it is possible that over-expression of KIF17[G234A] interferes with IFT entry into cilia. Whitely authors could test the ciliary levels of various proteins (e.g. IFT88, ARL13B, BBS5, GPR161) in cells over-expressing KIF17[G234A], a better experiment would be to deplete Kif17 by siRNA.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) All knockdown studies should be performed with 2 different siRNAs.</p><p>2) Whole cell views need to be shown for every ciliary image and surface expression being quantified. And all expressed proteins need to be accounted for (e.g. is KIF17 or KIF17-G234A even expressed in the cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>?).</p><p>3) All blots need to be quantified within the linear range. It seems possible that more IFT57 is co-precipitated with D1R in the Rab23 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) but it is not possible to know without quantification across multiple experiments.</p><p>4) In general it is better to show large panels for fluorescence images and make the graphs small since these are easier to see.</p><p>5) The schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6 fig7">Figure 3, 6, and 7</xref> would be easier to understand if the schematic included the whole protein and not just the C-terminal tail.</p><p>6) The inclusion of asterisks describing all significance levels in each of the figure legends is confusing as I was looking for asterisks in figures that did not contain them.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Curve fitting would represent the line scans better than scattered data points.</p><p>8) The scale bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> seems to have moved to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. There are no scales bars for any of the fluorescence images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 2-8</xref>.

Given new findings added to the present revision (see below), we do not think Rab23âs function is restricted to the D1R. However, we do not know how wide-ranging this requirement is for other membrane proteins. In considering the reviewersâ comments, we have changed the title in an effort to avoid implying a more general function than we can presently support. The new title is âDopamine receptors reveal an essential role of IFT-B, KIF17, and Rab23 in delivering specific receptors to primary cilia.â We have taken the word âgatekeeperâ out of the title, but we still find it to be a useful term for explaining our results. However, we do not want to imply that Rab23 is a gatekeeper for all cargoes. Therefore, in the revised text (Abstract and Discussion), we have clarified the proposal that Rab23 is acting as a gatekeeper for select ciliary receptor cargoes.</p><p><italic>With respect to the idea that Rab23 is a âgatekeeper of cargo delivery to ciliaâ, in the Discussion, the authors cite papers that Rab23 is not required for ciliary localization of polycystin-2 or Smo.

We focused on SSTR3 because its ciliary delivery is well-documented, and because we used SSTR3 to assess the role of KIF17 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-F</xref>). Using the same strategy that is used to assess ciliary localization of D1R, we found that SSTR3 localization to cilia was similarly sensitive to Rab23 depletion. We have included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G-I</xref> and in the subsection âA discrete and essential function of Rab23 in the ciliary targeting mechanismâ. Therefore, we are now confident that Rab23 function in cargo delivery to cilia is not restricted to the D1R, and we find this particularly interesting with regard to SSTR3, because ciliary localization of this GPCR is apparently KIF17-independent. While it is tempting to speculate about convergent mechanisms, we have not done so in the present study and intend to investigate more broadly the role of Rab23 in membrane cargo delivery to cilia in future studies. For the present study, as suggested by the reviewers, we have stepped back from making any statement on Rab23 generality and focus on D1R ciliary targeting mechanisms.</p><p><italic>A) Molecular mechanisms of D1R targeting.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Based on a C-terminal truncation analysis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>), the authors state that a short sequence (top page 9) is the ciliary targeting signal for D1R (aa 381-395). However, they then state that chimeras comprising DOR and the C-terminal of D1R caused DOR localization in the cilium, except when the C-terminal D1R sequence was truncated but still contained this putative DIR targeting sequence (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>). It is unclear, therefore, how the authors can draw the conclusion that aa 381-395 is a ciliary targeting signal. Is the signal more complex, and involve a folded structure, part of which is regulated through by aa 381-395? Did the authors examine ciliary targeting of D1R that contained only aa 381-395 from the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain? Resolution of this problem has important relevance to other studies that used a deletion of this sequence, but not this sequence explicitly.</italic></p><p>The reviewers asked how we can draw the conclusion that aa 381-395 is a ciliary targeting determinant and that our data suggest that the ciliary targeting determinant is a more complex or extended structure. We wholeheartedly agree and did not mean to imply that aa 381-395 is the complete targeting determinant. Rather, our data indicate that aa 381-395 is an essential part of the determinant. We agree that the receptor chimera data suggests that the D1R ciliary targeting determinant is indeed more extensive, including residues in the proximal region of the D1R C-terminal tail. In response to the reviewer critiques, we have included specific evidence showing that fusion of a smaller sequence containing these essential residues (aa 379-400) is not sufficient by itself to drive ciliary localization of the non-ciliary DOR. These new data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>. We have noted this result in the subsection âCiliary targeting of D1Rs is directed by an extended structural determinant located in the receptorâs cytoplasmic tailâ and we have attempted to make this important distinction clearer in the revised manuscript. We changed the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to âThe D1R cytoplasmic tail is required for ciliary receptor targeting and does not resemble previously defined ciliary targeting determinants.â</p><p><italic>2) The authors should attempt to map the IFT-B-binding determinants on D1R and check whether they are congruent with the D1R CTS. Given that the authors have all the D1R truncations, the mapping of the interaction should be straightforward and will be informative. It would also be interesting to test interaction of IFT57 with known ciliary GPCRs.</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a reasonable hypothesis. To address this, we carried out additional experiments in which we examined the ability of the D1R C-terminal tail mutant, Flag-D1Î381-395, which has reduced ciliary localization, to co-immunoprecipitate IFT57. This mutation did not prevent IFT57 co-IP and, to our surprise, it significantly increased the co-IP signal. Therefore, the functional activity of the D1R CTS is not directly congruent with IFT57 association. This is consistent with our multi-step model (accumulation of an intermediate), and we believe this provides evidence for a more complex operation of the D1R CTS. These new data, including quantification in the linear range, are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F-G</xref> and referred to in the revised text in the subsection âCiliary targeting of D1Rs is promoted by IFT-B complex proteins and KIF17â.</p><p>We have also carried out additional experiments testing whether DOR fused to the entire D1R C-terminal tail (DOR-D1(338-446)) is able to physically associate with IFT57. We have observed a positive co-IP in some experiments but not consistently. We think this may indicate a weak interaction, but we are not comfortable making a definitive statement one way or the other in the present study.</p><p><italic>3) With respect to the mechanisms by which D1R is targeted to the cilium, the reviewers liked the assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2"><italic>Figures 1 and 2</italic></xref><italic>, but were concerned that assumptions regarding the photokinetics properties of of PAGFP could be misleading</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref> <italic>assumes that photoactivation of PA-GFP is complete and irreversible.

However, we do not think this is the case in the present experiments. In the revised manuscript, we have included data showing fluorescence intensities in both channels over a series of 28 consecutive acquisitions. This number of acquisitions is in excess of the number of acquisitions used in the experimental setup described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-H</xref> (typically 12 acquisitions in total). We do not see any significant photobleaching of either fluorophore under these conditions. These new data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref> and noted at the end of the subsection âD1Rs are mobile in the ciliary membrane and accumulated by continuous delivery from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane poolâ.</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we have included representative examples of primary image data for the experimental setup in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>.

The concern is that this could cause an inappropriately high delivery rate.</p><p>We agree, in principle, that rupture of the diffusion barrier could confound our experiments. However, in practice, PA-GFP photoactivation requires a much lower light dose than GFP FRAP. Further, if the diffusion barrier was disrupted, we would expect D1Rs concentrated in the cilium to diffuse out, equilibrating by mass action with the extra-ciliary plasma membrane pool. This is clearly not the case. As part of the new data added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref><bold>,</bold> one can see ciliary D1R concentration is maintained for 30 min after the photoactivation and multiple image acquisitions. Additionally, we now include new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>) showing that the PA-GFP fluorescence increment increases with time after the initial photoactivation series (noted in the subsection âD1Rs are mobile in the ciliary membrane and accumulated by continuous delivery from the extra-ciliary plasma membrane poolâ). This further argues against rupture of the diffusion barrier and supports the conclusion that PA-GFP fluorescence increment is due to time-dependent delivery of new (i.e. from outside the cilium) D1Rs.</p><p><italic>B) Roles of RAB23</italic>, <italic>Kif17 and IFT-B</italic></p><p><italic>1) Experiments fusing Rab23 to the D1R deficient in ciliary targeting. The reference about the G234A mutation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41"><italic>Rice et al. 1999</italic></xref><italic>) refers to a G234A mutant of conventional kinesin. Does mutation of G234A in KIF17 also result in a lack of ATP hydrolysis? Also, the work with the G234A mutant of conventional kinesin used recombinant homodimers of G234A whereas the G234A mutant KIF17 is over-expressed in cells that contain endogenous KIF17. How does this impact the ability of G234A KIF17 to work in cells? Do you get the same targeting defect upon knockdown of KIF17 or expression of a dominant negative motor?</italic></p><p>In considering the reviewerâs question, we recognize that we failed to specify the nature of the motor domain mutation. The mutation is in switch II, the ârelayâ domain that is essential for kinesin movement. While kinesin motor domains are quite variable in other regions, switch II is highly conserved. In fact, switch II in KIF17 and kinesin-1 are identical, and G234 corresponds to precisely the critical residue for motor movement that was defined previously through study of kinesin-1. We clarify in the text of the revised manuscript in subsection âCiliary targeting of D1Rs is promoted by IFT-B complex proteins and KIF17â and include sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The reviewers make a good suggestion to examine the effect of the KIF17 knockdown. We attempted to do so and despite trying 4 independent siRNAs, we were unable to obtain successful knockdown of KIF17 as assessed by qPCR. Therefore, as an alternative approach to obtain independent evidence for KIF17âs role in D1R ciliary localization, we tested the effect of a different and previously described dominant negative KIF17 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenkins et al. 2006</xref>). We include this new data in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>) showing that expression of KIF17-DN decreases D1R ciliary enrichment.

However, the effects are strong and unambiguous. We showed in the original submission that Rab23QL fusion is also sufficient to confer ciliary localization on a distinct receptor, DOR, which is normally excluded from cilia altogether. In the revised manuscript we add new data showing the same effect for two other non-ciliary GPCRs, MOR and B2AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7âfigure supplement 5</xref>, explained in the subsection âA discrete and essential function of Rab23 in the ciliary targeting mechanismâ). Furthermore, we add new data establishing that this targeting effect is specific to Rab23. We already showed that Rab11 fusion does not confer ciliary localization. In the revised manuscript we add new data showing that fusion of Rab8 is also not sufficient to drive ciliary receptor localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F, G</xref> and explained in the aforementioned subsection). We think this highly significant because Rab8 by itself can clearly localize to cilia. Finally, we included the control experiment looking at Rab23-Q68L ciliary localization in the presence of KIF17-G234A (see above). We think that these four pieces of new data, taken together, add weight to our proposed model and, in particular, strongly support a specific ciliary targeting function of Rab23.</p><p><italic>4) The effect of KIF17 dominant negative are intriguing but somewhat difficult to interpret. For example, it is possible that over-expression of KIF17[G234A] interferes with IFT entry into cilia. Whitely authors could test the ciliary levels of various proteins (e.g. IFT88, ARL13B, BBS5, GPR161) in cells over-expressing KIF17[G234A], a better experiment would be to deplete Kif17 by siRNA</italic>.</p><p>We agree that a KIF17 dominant negative could, in principle, disrupt ciliary D1R targeting by blocking overall cargo entry, and that KIF17 knockdown would be useful. As noted above, we found KIF17 mRNA resistant to numerous duplexes. However, we are confident that the mutant KIF17 is not producing an overall entry defect because ciliary targeting of SSTR3 is unaffected by mutant KIF17. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>. It remains possible that one or more of the other ciliary proteins that the reviewer notes depend on KIF17, but the present SSTR3 results, we believe, rule out an overall cargo entry defect.</p><p><italic>Other points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) All knockdown studies should be performed with 2 different siRNAs</italic>.</p><p>We have done so by adding an additional siRNA for Rab23 and an additional siRNA for IFT57. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H-I</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Whole cell views need to be shown for every ciliary image and surface expression being quantified. And all expressed proteins need to be accounted for (e.g. is KIF17 or KIF17-G234A even expressed in the cells shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>?)</italic>.</p><p>We have done so. In the revised manuscript we have included whole cell image views as supplemental figures for every cilium shown. Additionally we show expression of KIF17 and KIF17-G234A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>. We show expression of IFT57 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) All blots need to be quantified within the linear range. It seems possible that more IFT57 is co-precipitated with D1R in the Rab23 siRNA (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8D</italic></xref><italic>) but it is not possible to know without quantification across multiple experiments</italic>.</p><p>We have quantified blots in the linear range, as the reviewer indicated, and from multiple experiments (n = 3 for each). Rab23 knockdown indeed increased the IFT57 co-IP signal (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), as the reviewer noticed from the single example shown. However, this effect was variable and did not reach significance in our data set. The new data added to investigate congruence between IFT57 co-IP and ciliary localization, however, did reveal a significant effect. Deletion of residues 381-395 in the D1R tail, although this reduced ciliary receptor localization, significantly increased IFT57 co-IP (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment that, as also discussed above, adds weight to our interpretation and supports the multi-step model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) In general it is better to show large panels for fluorescence images and make the graphs small since these are easier to see</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this.

There are no scales bars for any of the fluorescence images in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7 fig8"><italic>Figures 2-8</italic></xref><italic>. Some of the cilia look longer than others but it is impossible to know if this is real or an artifact of different image magnifications</italic>.</p><p>This is complete. We thank the reviewers for noticing this and in the revised manuscript we verified that all figures have scale bars.</p><p><italic>9) The reviewers found citations were missing</italic>:</p><p><italic>i) Introduction, no mention of the BBSome or IFT-A in intro about targeting of GPCRs to cilia despite those papers being cited later in the Results section</italic>.</p><p><italic>ii) Introduction, regarding lateral transport from the plasma membrane (PM) to the ciliary membrane (CM), the seminal paper from Hunnicutt, G.
