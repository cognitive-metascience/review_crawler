Type III systems exhibit a robust immune response that can lead to the extinction of a phage population, a feat coordinated by a multi-subunit effector complex that destroys invading DNA and RNA. Here, we demonstrate that a model type III system in <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> relies upon the activities of two degradosome-associated nucleases, PNPase and RNase J2, to mount a successful defense. Genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses reveal that PNPase promotes crRNA maturation, and both nucleases are required for efficient clearance of phage-derived nucleic acids. Furthermore, functional assays show that RNase J2 is essential for immunity against diverse mobile genetic elements originating from plasmid and phage. Altogether, our observations reveal the evolution of a critical collaboration between two nucleic acid degrading machines which ensures cell survival when faced with phage attack.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45393.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just as humans are susceptible to viruses, bacteria have their own viruses to contend with. These viruses – known as phages – attach to the surface of bacterial cells, inject their genetic material, and use the cells’ enzymes to multiply while destroying their hosts.</p><p>To defend against a phage attack, bacteria have evolved a variety of immune systems. For example, when a bacterium with an immune system known as CRISPR-Cas encounters a phage, the system creates a ‘memory’ of the invader by capturing a small snippet of the phage’s genetic material. The pieces of phage DNA are copied into small molecules known as CRISPR RNAs, which then combine with one or more Cas proteins to form a group called a Cas complex. This complex patrols the inside of the cell, carrying the CRISPR RNA for comparison, similar to the way a detective uses a fingerprint to identify a criminal. Once a match is found, the Cas proteins chop up the invading genetic material and destroy the phage.</p><p>There are several different types of CRISPR-Cas systems. Type III systems are among the most widespread in nature and are unique in that they provide a nearly impenetrable barrier to phages attempting to infect bacterial cells. Medical researchers are exploring the use of phages as alternatives to conventional antibiotics and so it is important to find ways to overcome these immune responses in bacteria. However, it remains unclear precisely how Type III CRISPR-Cas systems are able to mount such an effective defense.</p><p>Chou-Zheng and Hatoum-Aslan used genetic and biochemical approaches to study the Type III CRISPR-Cas system in a bacterium called <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. The experiments showed that two enzymes called PNPase and RNase J2 played crucial roles in the defense response triggered by the system. PNPase helped to generate CRISPR RNAs and both enzymes were required to help to destroy genetic material from invading phages.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that PNPase and RNase J2 are part of a machine in bacterial cells that usually degrades damaged genetic material. Therefore, these findings show that the Type III CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> has evolved to coordinate with another pathway to help the bacteria survive attack from phages. CRISPR-Cas immune systems have formed the basis for a variety of technologies that continue to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research. Therefore, along with aiding the search for alternatives to antibiotics, this work may potentially inspire the development of new genetic technologies in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Staphylococcus epidermidis</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas10</kwd><kwd>type III CRISPR</kwd><kwd>degradosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award, 5K22AI113106-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatoum-Aslan</surname><given-names>Asma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER Award, 1749886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hatoum-Aslan</surname><given-names>Asma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Degradosome-associated nucleases PNPase and RNase J2 are required for type III CRISPR immunity against diverse nucleic acid invaders originating from plasmid and phage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly all known <italic>archaea</italic> and about half of <italic>bacteria</italic> possess adaptive immune systems composed of clusters of regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). CRISPR-Cas systems utilize small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to recognize and destroy prokaryotic viruses (phages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>) and other mobile genetic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bikard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008</xref>). The CRISPR-Cas immune response occurs in three steps: adaptation, crRNA biogenesis, and interference (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klompe and Sternberg, 2018</xref>). During adaptation, Cas proteins capture short segments of foreign nucleic acids (24–40 nucleotides (nts) in length) and integrate them as ‘spacers’ into the CRISPR locus in between repeat sequences of similar lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mojica et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>) in order to record a molecular memory of past invaders. During crRNA biogenesis, the repeats and spacers are transcribed into a long precursor crRNA, which is subsequently processed to generate mature crRNAs that each contain a single spacer sequence. Mature crRNAs combine with one or more Cas proteins to form an effector complex, which during interference, senses and degrades ‘protospacers’, invading nucleic acids complementary to the crRNA. Although all CRISPR-Cas systems adhere to this general pathway, they exhibit striking diversity in their <italic>cas</italic> gene composition and corresponding mechanisms of action. Accordingly, the current classification scheme divides these systems into two classes, six types (I-VI), and dozens of subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koonin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>). Class one systems (types I, III, and IV) encode multi-subunit effector complexes, while Class two systems (types II, V, and VI) possess single subunit effectors. Although Class two systems have garnered significant attention over the past decade due to their versatile genetic applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klompe and Sternberg, 2018</xref>), Class one systems are more widespread in nature, and of these, type III systems are believed to be the most closely related to the common ancestor from which all other CRISPR types have evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohanraju et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> RP62a harbors a well-established model type III-A CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), here onward referred to as CRISPR-Cas10. This system encodes three spacers (<italic>spc</italic>) and nine CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas and Csm) that can prevent the transfer of a conjugative plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2010</xref>) and stave off phage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maniv et al., 2016</xref>). This system employs an elaborate transcription-dependent mechanism of defense that exerts exquisite spatial and temporal control over the immune response. Defense begins with crRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), during which the Cas6 endoribonuclease cleaves the precursor crRNA within repeat sequences to generate 71 nt intermediate crRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>). These intermediates are subsequently trimmed on their 3’-ends to generate mature species that range in length from 31 to 43 nts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>). Mature crRNAs combine with Cas10, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, and Csm5 to form the Cas10-Csm effector complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). During interference, this complex, in conjunction with the accessory ribonuclease Csm6, wage a two-pronged attack against foreign DNA and RNA. Interference is triggered by the binding of the crRNA to the targeted transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>), an event that leads to the activation of at least three nucleases: Cas10 cleaves the non-template (coding) DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samai et al., 2015</xref>), each Csm3 subunit slices RNA within the protospacer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staals et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>), and Csm6 degrades nonspecific transcripts in the vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). In related type III-A systems, target RNA binding has also been shown to trigger two additional functions of Cas10: the cleavage of non-specific single-stranded DNA by its HD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and the generation of cyclic oligoadenylates by its Palm polymerase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazlauskiene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niewoehner et al., 2017</xref>). The cyclic oligoadenylates act as second messengers which bind and further stimulate Csm6, thus accelerating its activity near the site of foreign nucleic acid detection. The combined activities of the Cas and Csm nucleases, together with the high tolerance for mismatches between the crRNA and protospacer pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pyenson et al., 2017</xref>), contribute to a particularly powerful immune response that can lead to phage extinction with a single targeting spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pyenson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45393.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Type III-A CRISPR-Cas defense in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> RP62a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (known as CRISPR-Cas10) encodes three spacers (colored squares), four repeats (white squares) and nine CRISPR-associated (<italic>cas</italic> and <italic>csm</italic>) genes. (<bold>B</bold>) During crRNA biogenesis, the repeat-spacer array is transcribed into a precursor crRNA, which is subsequently processed in two steps. First, the Cas6 endoribonuclease cleaves within repeat sequences to yield intermediate crRNAs that are ~71 nucleotides in length. These intermediates are then subjected to a second maturation step in which their 3’-ends are trimmed to generate mature crRNAs that range from 31 to 43 nucleotides in length. Mature crRNAs combine with Cas10, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, and Csm5 to form the Cas10-Csm complex. (<bold>C</bold>) Interference is triggered when the Cas10-Csm complex binds foreign transcripts that bear complementarity to the crRNA. During interference, invading DNA and RNA are destroyed--while RNA is shredded by each Csm3 subunit in the complex, the DNA coding strand is cleaved by Cas10. An accessory nuclease, Csm6, also participates in the immune response by degrading invader-derived transcripts.

Indeed, our previous work showed that the Cas10-Csm complex, when expressed in its native <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> host, co-purifies with several cellular nucleases in trace amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in a reconstituted system, Csm5 can bind and stimulate one of these nucleases, PNPase (polynucleotide phosphorylase), a highly-conserved enzyme that is responsible for the processing and degradation of cellular RNAs in bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2018</xref>). This observation lead us to propose a model wherein PNPase and other non-Cas nucleases are likely responsible for crRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). However, the extent to which the success of CRISPR-Cas10 defense relies upon the activities of these non-Cas nucleases remains unknown.</p><p>In bacteria, PNPase can act independently, or associate with other enzymes (including nucleases and helicases) to form an RNA degrading machine called the degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we posited the hypothesis that PNPase and other degradosome-associated nucleases are essential for CRISPR-Cas10 immunity. To test this, we deleted the genes encoding PNPase and Ribonuclease (RNase) J2, a second degradosome nuclease that co-purifies with the Cas10-Csm complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). The single and double mutants were then assayed for defects in crRNA biogenesis and interference. We discovered that PNPase is indeed required for efficient crRNA maturation, but RNase J2 is not. In contrast, while PNPase appears to be dispensable for CRISPR-Cas10 function, RNase J2 is essential to block the transfer of a conjugative plasmid and defend against two unrelated phages, therefore establishing a general requirement for RNase J2 in CRISPR-Cas10 immunity. We also used quantitative PCR to track the accumulation of nucleic acids during an active phage infection, and found that both PNPase and RNase J2 are required for the efficient clearance of phage-derived DNA and transcripts. It has been well documented by others that RNase J2 promotes cellular RNA degradation by binding and stimulating the ribonuclease activity of its paralog RNase J1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raj et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RNase J2 also promotes robust DNA degradation through this same mechanism. Altogether, our results support a model for CRISPR-Cas10 immunity in which two steps of the pathway, crRNA biogenesis and interference, rely upon the activities of degradosome-associated nucleases, thus revealing the evolution of a critical collaboration that ensures cell survival when faced with phage infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PNPase promotes crRNA maturation, but RNase J2 does not</title><p>PNPase is a processive exonuclease that degrades RNA and DNA in the 3’−5’ direction, and also catalyzes the reverse reaction in which nucleotide diphosphates are added back onto the 3’-end of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardenas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous work showed that in a purified system, Csm5 can bind to PNPase and stimulate its nucleolytic activity while repressing its polymerization function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Since the deletion of Csm5 leads to loss of crRNA maturation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2014</xref>), and since we were unable to locate a nucleolytic active site in Csm5 after extensive mutagenic and biochemical analyses, the observed physical and functional interactions between Csm5 and PNPase lead us to propose a model in which Csm5 recruits and stimulates the catalytic activity of PNPase to carry out crRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Here, to lend further support to this model, we created in-frame deletions of <italic>pnp</italic> in two <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>): RP62a, the native CRISPR-Cas10 containing strain, and LM1680 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>), a CRISPR-less derivative of RP62a that is more receptive to transformation and conducive to protein purification. To determine the impact of this mutation on crRNA maturation, the entire CRISPR-Cas system was introduced back into LM1680/<italic>Δpnp</italic> on plasmid p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>), which encodes a 6-His tag on the N-terminus of Csm2. We then purified Cas10-Csm complexes from the mutant and wild-type strains using Ni<sup>2+</sup> affinity chromatography, and extracted crRNAs bound to the complexes. While complex formation remained unaffected in the <italic>Δpnp</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we observed that the crRNA sizes associated with these complexes differed dramatically from the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>)—when purified from wild-type background, 6.2 (±2.4) % of complex-associated crRNAs exists in the intermediate state, whereas in the <italic>Δpnp</italic> mutant, intermediates represent 50.6 (±3.0) % of all crRNAs in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), indicating that PNPase is indeed required for efficient crRNA maturation.

In order to identify other maturation nuclease candidates, we consulted the short list of cellular nucleases that were previously found to co-purify with the Cas10-Csm complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Now, after having established a <italic>bona fide</italic> function for PNPase in crRNA maturation, two other co-purifying nucleases emerged as promising candidates: Ribonucleases J1 and J2. Since PNPase, RNase J1, and RNase J2 have all been found to work together as components of the degradosome in gram positive organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Redder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roux et al., 2011</xref>), the possibility exists that they might also be working together in the CRISPR-Cas10 immunity pathway. Additionally, the gene encoding RNase J2, <italic>rnjB</italic>, is located directly downstream of <italic>pnp</italic> in the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> genome, further hinting at a functional link. Ribonucleases J1 and J2 are paralogous enzymes that have been shown to form a complex in the cell and catalyze endonucleolytic and 5’−3’ exonucleolytic cleavage of RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raj et al., 2018</xref>). Although the dominant active site in the J1/J2 complex resides in RNase J1, RNase J2 has been shown to cause a synergistic stimulation of RNase J1’s nuclease activity through an allosteric mechanism. In order to determine the contribution of these ribonucleases toward CRISPR-Cas10 function, we sought to delete the genes that encode both enzymes. However, despite multiple attempts, we were unable to delete <italic>rnjA</italic>, the gene encoding RNase J1, suggesting this enzyme might be essential for <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> survival. Alternatively, our method for mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae and Schneewind, 2006</xref>), which requires cell growth at a range of temperatures, might be incompatible with the extreme temperature sensitivity that has been observed in a <italic>S. aureus ΔrnjA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, we were able to create an in-frame deletion of <italic>rnjB</italic>, the gene that encodes RNase J2, in both <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62a and LM1680 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test for defects in crRNA maturation in the LM1680/<italic>ΔrnjB</italic> mutant, we overexpressed and purified Cas10-Csm complexes from this strain and extracted and visualized the complex-associated crRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We observed that Cas10-Csm remains intact when expressed in the <italic>ΔrnjB</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and the crRNA size distribution is similar to that observed in the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), indicating that RNase J2 is unlikely to play a significant role in crRNA maturation. To confirm, we also created the <italic>ΔpnpΔrnjB</italic> double-mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and found that it exhibits a maturation defect similar to that observed in the <italic>Δpnp</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We noted that longer RNAs running between 43 and 71 nucleotides appear more prominently in the double mutant when compared to either single mutant—these species likely represent crRNAs that have undergone incomplete maturation. The more prominent appearance of these bands in the double mutant when compared to the <italic>∆rnjB</italic> single mutant may imply that RNase J2 plays a modest role in crRNA maturation, and its loss can be compensated by the presence of PNPase. However, since this partial defect in the double mutant does not lead to additional accumulation of the 71 nucleotide intermediate species, we hesitate to speculate further on the significance of these longer crRNAs. From these observations, it can be concluded that PNPase, but not RNase J2, is essential for efficient crRNA maturation, and that there exist other maturation nuclease(s) that have yet to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNaseJ2 is required for CRISPR-Cas10 mediated anti-plasmid and anti-phage immunity</title><p>We next wondered whether the activities of PNPase and/or RNase J2 are essential for CRISPR-Cas10 function.

In this system, <italic>spc1</italic> (the first spacer) targets the <italic>nickase</italic> gene in pG0400, therefore, a functional CRISPR-Cas10 system in the recipient strain is expected to lower the conjugation efficiency. Indeed, the controls behaved consistently with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatoum-Aslan et al., 2013</xref>), where the wild-type LM1680 strain bearing the empty vector (pC194) showed a conjugation efficiency in the 10<sup>−3</sup> range, while this same strain harboring p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> exhibited an efficiency in the 10<sup>−7</sup> range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, despite the maturation defect in <italic>Δpnp/</italic>p<italic>crispr-cas</italic>, this strain had a conjugation efficiency similar to that of the wild-type strain expressing the CRISPR-Cas10 system, suggesting that PNPase is dispensable for anti-plasmid immunity. In contrast, <italic>ΔrnjB</italic>/p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> exhibited a significant defect in immunity, with a conjugation efficiency similar to that of the negative control. Consistent with this result, <italic>ΔpnpΔrnjB</italic>/p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> also showed a significant defect in immunity. Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas10 appears to retain a modest level of anti-plasmid immunity in the double mutant, resulting in a conjugation efficiency that is an order of magnitude lower than that observed in the absence of <italic>pcrispr-cas</italic> (compare 2.2 × 10<sup>−4</sup> to 2.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). Importantly, complementation strains containing a copy of <italic>rnjB</italic> on p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> (a plasmid called <italic>pcrispr-cas-rnjB</italic>) exhibited conjugation efficiencies similar to those of the wild-type strain bearing p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These observations suggest that RNase J2 is essential for CRISPR-Cas10 anti-plasmid immunity.</p><p>To determine if this defect applies specifically to plasmid transfer, or if there is a more general phenotype, we tested CRISPR immunity against two unrelated phages. The first, CNPx, is a variant of CNPH82, a temperate phage belonging to the morphological family <italic>Siphoviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daniel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maniv et al., 2016</xref>). CNPx can infect <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680, and <italic>spc2</italic> in <italic>pcrispr-cas</italic> bears complementarity to its <italic>cn20</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). When dilutions of this phage are plated with the LM1680/pC194 negative control, many plaques, or zones of clearing in the bacterial lawn can be observed, approximately 10<sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units per milliliter (pfu/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). However, when the LM1680/p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> strain is challenged with CNPx, not a single plaque is visible, in agreement with the robust anti-phage immunity previously reported for this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pyenson et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, when we challenged the mutant strains with CNPx, we observed a significant defect, even more pronounced than that seen for anti-plasmid immunity: While the <italic>Δpnp</italic> strain appeared to perform like wild-type, the <italic>ΔrnjB</italic> and <italic>ΔpnpΔrnjB</italic> mutations abolished CRISPR-Cas10 function altogether. In addition, returning <italic>rnjB</italic> to these defective mutants on p<italic>crispr-cas-rnjB</italic> restored full immunity against CNPx.</p><p>Finally, we wanted to determine if the phenotypes observed thus far are specific to LM1680, or if they can also be seen in the wild-type RP62a strain. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> LM1680 was originally derived from RP62a as a CRISPR ‘escape’ mutant which harbors a ~ 258,000 nt deletion encompassing the CRISPR locus and flanking regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). We wondered if the immunity defect observed in LM1680 might be conditional upon the loss of the regions adjacent to the CRISPR-Cas system. To rule out this possibility, the RP62a <italic>Δpnp</italic>, <italic>ΔrnjB</italic>, and <italic>ΔpnpΔrnjB</italic> mutants were challenged with phage Andhra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cater et al., 2017</xref>) in the presence of the plasmid p<italic>crispr-spcA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bari et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Andhra is a lytic phage belonging to the morphological family <italic>Podoviridae</italic>, and <italic>spcA2</italic> targets its DNA polymerase (<italic>gp09</italic>) gene. It is important to note that this system relies upon the RP62a genome-encoded <italic>cas</italic> and <italic>csm</italic> genes, with only the Andhra-targeting spacer being overexpressed on the plasmid. As expected, without p<italic>crispr-spcA2</italic>, all strains are equally susceptible to Andhra, with plaque counts ranging between 10<sup>8</sup>–10<sup>9</sup> pfu/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). However, when transformed with p<italic>crispr-spcA2</italic>, only the wild-type and <italic>Δpnp</italic> strains gain complete immunity to Andhra, while the <italic>ΔrnjB</italic> and <italic>ΔpnpΔrnjB</italic> strains remain as sensitive to Andhra as the corresponding negative controls without the p<italic>crispr-spcA2</italic> plasmid. From these collective observations, we can conclude that while PNPase appears dispensable, RNase J2 is essential for CRISPR immunity against diverse mobile genetic elements originating from plasmid and phage. In addition, RNase J2 most likely acts in the CRISPR pathway at a step downstream of crRNA maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PNPase and RNase J2 promote the efficient clearance of phage-derived nucleic acids</title><p>Although CRISPR immunity appeared unperturbed in the <italic>Δpnp</italic> mutant, we wondered if a partial defect might be present which cannot be resolved by the functional assays. For example, a partial defect in anti-plasmid immunity might lead to a decrease in plasmid copy number instead of complete elimination, but the copy number reduction might be sufficient to prevent growth on the media that selects for transconjugants. Similarly, a partial defect in anti-phage immunity might result in the survival of a small number of phages, but too few to create a visible plaque in the lawn of bacteria. In order to detect such partial defects in immunity, we used qPCR and qRT-PCR (quantitative PCR and reverse-transcriptase PCR, respectively) to measure DNA and RNA accumulation during an active phage infection. Of the three systems for testing CRISPR function, the RP62a-Andhra system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) was selected for this assay for two reasons: First, RP62a is the original clinical isolate containing a single genomic copy of the CRISPR-Cas10 system, thus providing the closest approximation to what might naturally occur. Second, Andhra is strictly lytic and therefore expected to express all genes in a single infection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cater et al., 2017</xref>). The latter feature eliminates any gene-specific variations in CRISPR-Cas10 function that would otherwise occur using a temperate phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). In the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), early-log cells were challenged with Andhra in a 2:1 (bacteria:phage) ratio, and phages were allowed to adsorb to cells for 10 min. Infected cells were then washed with fresh media to remove any phages in suspension. A fraction of the cells was harvested immediately after adsorption (time = 0 min) and every ten minutes thereafter for up to 30 min. Importantly, the latent period for Andhra was previously determined to be 35 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cater et al., 2017</xref>), therefore the selected time points all occur within the timeframe of a single infection cycle before the first burst. Immediately after each harvest, cells were heat-killed to prevent any further changes in nucleic acid content, and then subjected to nucleic acid extraction. The RNA and DNA extracts were analyzed by qRT-PCR and qPCR, respectively, using two pairs of primers: Andhra-specific primers that flank the protospacer region within gene <italic>gp09</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and genome-specific primers that bind the <italic>gap</italic> gene (encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) for normalization.

To test this possibility, we conducted the same time course infection assay in the <italic>Δpnp</italic> and <italic>ΔrnjB</italic> mutants lacking p<italic>crispr-spcA2</italic> and tracked DNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). As expected, the RP62a wild-type control showed that by 30 min post-infection, phage DNA levels rose to ~35 times greater than that seen immediately following adsorption. Strikingly, <italic>Δpnp</italic> and <italic>ΔrnjB</italic> mutants accumulated over 400 and 1300 times more phage DNA, respectively, by this same time point. These data indicate that PNPase and RNase J2 facilitate the restriction of phage DNA amplification within the cell, even in the absence of a targeting CRISPR system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RNase J2 stimulates both RNase and DNase activities of RNase J1</title><p>The contributions of PNPase and RNase J2 toward the elimination of phage-derived nucleic acids can occur through multiple mechanisms. One possibility is that these enzymes indirectly prevent phage DNA accumulation by acting strictly as ribonucleases—their swift degradation of phage transcripts might deter the expression of the phage-encoded DNA polymerase, and thus prevent phage DNA replication. Another noncompeting possibility is that phage DNA is degraded directly by one or both of these enzymes. Although PNPase is most well-known for its ribonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hui et al., 2014</xref>), we and others have recently shown that bacterial PNPase homologs can also degrade DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardenas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that the efficient CRISPR-mediated clearance of phage nucleic acids is assisted by PNPase’s dual-cleavage of phage DNA and RNA. In contrast, studies on bacterial RNase J homologs have strictly reported ribonuclease activities in these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>). One exception seems to be in two archaeal RNase J homologs, which were shown to catalyze the cleavage of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levy et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore wondered whether one or both RNase J homologs in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> might act similarly against DNA substrates.</p><p>To test the nucleolytic activities of the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RNases J homologs, we overexpressed and purified recombinant RNase J1 and RNase J2 from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, since previous reports have indicated that the dominant active site in an RNase J1/J2 complex resides within RNase J1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>), we also purified a catalytically-dead variant of RNase J1 (denoted as dJ1) bearing H74A and H76A mutations. We first tested for metal-dependent RNase activity in these enzymes by combining them with a 31 nt RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) in the presence of various metals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>), we observed insignificant nuclease activity in RNase J2, and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ribonuclease activity in RNase J1 that leaves behind a single small cleavage product, implying 5’−3’ exonuclease activity. Furthermore, this function appeared more pronounced when RNase J1 was combined with RNase J2 in a 1:1 ratio. To examine the kinetics in more detail, we tracked substrate degradation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), and confirmed that when combined, RNases J1 and J2 act synergistically—whereas RNase J1 alone could only degrade 23 (±14) % of the substrate during a 20 min incubation period, the combined proteins eliminated 95 (±1) % of the substrate in the same amount of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

While we detected little/no nuclease activity from each enzyme alone, a striking Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DNase activity was observed when the enzymes were combined, which again resulted in a single small cleavage product indicative of a 5’−3’ exonuclease function. Additional experiments measuring DNA degradation over time revealed a synergistic activation of DNA cleavage even more pronounced than that observed for RNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). For example, while RNase J1 alone cleaved 17 (±8) % of the DNA substrate after 5 min, the J1/J2 complex had already degraded 99 (±1) % of the substrate in the same amount of time. In addition to 5’−3’ exonuclease activity, RNase J homologs have also been shown to catalyze endoribonuclease cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we also tested for endonuclease activity against DNA by combining the enzymes alone and in combination with circular DNA substrates, both single-stranded and double-stranded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). While cleavage of double-stranded circular or linear DNA could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), we observed degradation of the single-stranded circular DNA by RNase J1, an activity that is significantly stimulated when combined with RNase J2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Again, the catalytically-dead RNase J1 completely lost this function, indicating that the DNA endonuclease active site resides within RNase J1. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that RNase J2 stimulates both RNase and DNase activities of RNase J1, and therefore lend support to the possibility that these enzymes assist with CRISPR-Cas10 immunity by directly degrading phage DNA and RNA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Type III CRISPR-Cas systems rely upon multiple Cas proteins which interact with each other, and also have the potential to recruit and regulate other enzymes with relevant functions to ensure a successful defense. Here, we show that the degradosome-associated nuclease PNPase promotes crRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and is required for the efficient CRISPR-mediated clearance of invading DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also show that a second degradosome nuclease, RNase J2, is essential for CRISPR immunity against diverse mobile genetic elements originating from plasmid and phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although bacterial RNase J homologs have been strictly reported as ribonucleases, we present, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of DNA degradation by these enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Altogether, our results support a model for CRISPR-Cas10 immunity in which two of the three steps of the pathway, crRNA biogenesis and interference, rely upon the activities of these degradosome-associated nucleases. The possibility remains that PNPase and/or RNase J2 might play indirect roles in CRISPR-Cas10 function, wherein deletion of these degradosome subunits may impact the expression of other host factors that are required for CRISPR function. However, the direct physical interactions that we and others have observed between degradosome components with each other and with the CRISPR machinery (discussed in details below) help to support direct roles for these nucleases in CRISPR immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45393.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model for CRISPR-Cas10 immunity in which multiple steps in the pathway rely upon degradosome nucleases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During complex assembly, Csm5 recruits and stimulates PNPase, which trims the 3’-ends of intermediate crRNAs.

Since PNPase has been shown to bind RNase J1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roux et al., 2011</xref>), and since RNases J1 and J2 exist as a complex in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>), one possible mechanism for the recruitment of RNase J2 to the site of CRISPR interference could be through its connection with PNPase. However, if such an interaction were essential for RNase J2’s participation in immunity, then a <italic>pnp</italic> knockout should phenocopy the <italic>rnjB</italic> mutant—this was not the case. Therefore, there may be an additional, more direct interaction between RNase J2 and one or more of the CRISPR-associated proteins that has yet to be identified. Another compatible alternative is that RNase J2 and/or PNPase might locate and degrade phage-derived nucleic acids through a CRISPR-independent mechanism. In support of this notion, we observed that in the absence of a targeting CRISPR-Cas system, the deletion of <italic>pnp</italic> and <italic>rnjB</italic> enables significant phage DNA accumulation which exceeds phage DNA levels in the wild-type strain by 10–40 fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mechanism by which these degradosome-associated nucleases repress phage DNA replication in the absence of CRISPR interference remains unclear. Interestingly, there have been two reports of phage-encoded proteins that specifically inhibit RNase E, a central subunit of the degradosome in gram negative organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van den Bossche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>). These observations support the possible existence of a more direct antagonistic relationship between phages and the degradosome that undoubtedly deserves further investigation.</p><p>DNA endonuclease activity is particularly important for CRISPR function. In order for phage DNA to get degraded, there must be an initiating endonucleolytic cleavage event that exposes free ends, which are subsequently accessed and processively degraded by exonucleases. Thus far, of the CRISPR-associated nucleases characterized in type III systems, only one has been shown to degrade DNA: Cas10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samai et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Cas10 (SeCas10) cleaves only the coding DNA strand in the protospacer region, leaving the non-coding strand unharmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Although Cas10 homologs in related type III-A systems exhibit nonspecific DNA endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), this function in SeCas10 has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, our discovery that RNase J2 is essential for CRISPR-Cas10 immunity, combined with the fact that this enzyme is capable of promoting robust DNA endonuclease cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), opens the possibility that the RNase J homologs assist with CRISPR-Cas10 interference by catalyzing the initiating endonucleolytic cleavage on the non-coding DNA strand. It is worthwhile mentioning that while PNPase exhibits 3’−5’ exonuclease activity on DNA and RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardenas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>), RNase J homologs catalyze endonuclease activity, as well as 5’−3’ exonucleolytic activity, a function only recently thought to be non-existent in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathy et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the combined capabilities of these enzymes provide the full spectrum of nucleolytic activities that are necessary to shred DNA and RNA down to their base parts.</p><p>The reliance on non-Cas nucleases by a type III CRISPR-Cas system described herein adds to the sparse collection of similar observations that have been reported for diverse CRISPR-Cas types. The earliest example of such a collaboration was seen in a type II CRISPR-Cas system in <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, in which both the crRNA and the tracrRNA are processed by the host-encoded RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>). In a more recent example, a type III-Bv (variant) system in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803, which lacks a Cas6 homolog, was found to utilize the host-encoded RNase E to catalyze crRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behler et al., 2018</xref>). In yet a third example, a CRISPR-like element in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> devoid of its own <italic>cas</italic> genes, was shown to rely upon a type I CRISPR-Cas system and host-encoded PNPase for small RNA processing and interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sesto et al., 2014</xref>). From these seemingly disparate observations, perhaps a common theme is beginning to emerge in which diverse CRISPR-Cas types have independently evolved different mechanisms to tap into the arsenal of nucleolytic enzymes that bacteria utilize for routine functions, and channel their activities towards defense in the event of a phage infection. Indeed, such a strategy would help to minimize the energetic costs associated with maintaining dedicated nucleases, while also maximizing the likelihood of a successful defense.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The fraction of cleaved substrate was determined using the following equation: intensity of cleaved substrate signal ÷ sum of intensities of cleaved plus uncut substrate signals. Values are representative of at least three independent trials. The double-stranded DNA substrate pUC19 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) was linearized by digesting with PstI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) and purified using the EZNA Cycle Pure Kit. Circular or linear pUC19 (0.1 µg) was combined in nuclease buffer with 2 pmol of each nuclease alone and in combination. Circular ssDNA (M13MP18) substrate (0.5 µg, New England Biolabs, MA, USA) was combined with 4 pmol of each cellular nuclease alone and in combination, in nuclease buffer. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr (dsDNA) or 15, 30 and 60 min (circular ssDNA). Reactions were stopped by incubating on ice for 5 min and digesting with 1 µg of Proteinase K Solution (VWR, PA, USA) for 15 min at room temperature. DNA was resolved on a 0.7% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light using the FluorChemR system.

Average values were analyzed using a one-tailed t-test, and p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The following terms are used to describe the types of repetitions where appropriate in figure legends and source data files: technical replicate, independent trial, and biological replicate. Technical replicates refer to multiple measurements taken on a single cell line in a single experiment; independent trials refer to repetitions of the same experiment conducted at different times using the same cell lines; and biological replicates refer to independent trials conducted on different lines of cells in which each line comprises a transformant or mutant that was independently generated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AH-A would like to acknowledge funding for this project from the National Institutes of Health [5K22AI113106-02] and an NSF CAREER award [No. 1749886].</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45393.022</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>DNA oligonucleotides used in this study.</title><p>Already corrected in first full submission.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers, who have opted to remain anonymous, have recommended your paper for publication, pending minor revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this well-written manuscript, Lucy Chou-Zheng and Asma Hatoum-Aslan demonstrate that PNPase is required for efficient crRNA maturation in the type III-A system from <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and that both PNPase and RNase J2 play important roles in degrading foreign nucleic acids. While the function of Cas proteins in this system has received considerable attention, the importance of ancillary factors that complement CRISPR-Cas immune function have not been investigated with the same rigor. This paper adds considerable mechanistic insight and I anticipate that this work will inspire more careful examination of host factors in other immune systems. I have a few very minor suggestions.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: Consider adding Yosef et al., 2012. I think this was the first experimental evidence of Cas protein mediated acquisition.</p><p>Subsection “RNaseJ2 is required for CRISPR-Cas10 mediated anti-plasmid and anti-phage immunity”, last paragraph, second sentence: I think this sentence is missing a word (i.e., might conditional).</p><p>Figure 3 legend: I did not see and explanation for the dashed line in Figure 3D and F.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explore the synergistic activity of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system and the degradasome complex, which is required for RNA processing and degradation in bacteria. In prior work, the authors provided evidence that several degradasome nucleases (among others, PNPase, RNase J1 and RNase J2) associate with the Csm-Cas10 complex, which mediates type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity. Here, the authors demonstrate in <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> that degradasome nucleases are important for CRISPR RNA (crRNA) maturation and clearance of phage nucleic acids during CRISPR-Cas immunity.</p><p>The authors establish three <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains <italic>(∆pnp, ∆rnjB</italic> and <italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic>) in which either PNPase, RNase J2 or both are deleted (unfortunately the authors could not obtain a knockout of RNase J1, which may be an essential gene). They first tested the importance of these proteins for crRNA maturation and observed that crRNA intermediates accumulate in the absence of PNPase, while RNase J2 is dispensable for crRNA maturation. Next, the authors tested whether PNPase or RNase J2 are required for CRISPR-Cas-mediated immunity using both plasmid conjugation and phage challenge assays. They demonstrate that RNase J2 is required for efficient Csm-Cas10-mediated interference against plasmid conjugation. In a striking set of data, they also show that RNase J2 is required for Csm-Cas10-mediated immunity against phages, and that both PNPase and RNase J2 are required for efficient clearing of phage nucleic acids. Interestingly, they also show that both nucleases may be involved in clearing phage DNA (or in limiting the propagation of the DNA) even in the absence of the CRISPR-Cas system. To support the role of RNase J2, and its partner nuclease RNase J1, the authors performed in vitro RNA and DNA cleavage assays. They convincingly demonstrate that RNase J1 cleaves single-stranded DNA, and that this activity requires RNase J2. These data provide direct evidence to support a role for RNase J1/J2 in phage DNA clearance.</p><p>Overall, this is an exceptional study that demonstrates cooperation between a house-keeping complex and the specialized CRISPR-Cas machinery. Other studies have suggested that non-Cas nucleases, including RecBCD, RNase III and PNPase, may be involved in various steps of the immune system. This study provides further compelling evidence toward this emerging trend. The data are very well presented, the manuscript is easy to follow, and the results are reasonably interpreted. The experiments really present a tour-de-force, with the authors anticipating many of my questions. I have a few remaining questions that could likely be addressed through changes to the text.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 2B, different crRNA intermediates appear to accumulate in the <italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic> strain compared to the <italic>∆pnp</italic> strain (running between the 71 and 43 nt band). The authors do not comment on these products. Was this cleavage pattern observed in all replicates? Do the authors have an idea of what these products might be? Although it may be premature to speculate on the origin of these intermediates, the authors should at least note this difference between the two strains in the text, especially if it was reproducible.</p><p>2) There is an apparent discrepancy in the data shown in Figure 3 that the authors do not comment on. Conjugation efficiency in the <italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic> strain (2.2 x 10<sup>-4</sup>) did not recover to WT levels in the absence of the pCRISPR-Cas plasmid (2.6 x 10<sup>-3</sup>). This suggests that CRISPR-Cas activity is sufficient to provide a low level of plasmid interference (reduction of conjugation efficiency by an order of magnitude) even in the absence of PNPase and RNase J2. However, in the phage challenge assays, the ∆pnp∆rnjB strains displays similar phage sensitivity to strains lacking the CRISPR-Cas system, suggesting that the immune system is not sufficient to provide any immunity against phages in the absence of PNPase and RNase J2. The authors could comment on this apparent difference. Is this simply a consequence of differences in the two types of assays? Could this be related to the apparent CRISPR-independent activity of the degradasome nucleases against phage DNA shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1?</p><p>3) Although the authors data convincingly demonstrate that RNase J2 (and likely J1) cooperate with the CRISPR-Cas machinery, there remains a possibility that deletion of degradasome proteins affects expression of other host factors that may be involved in CRISPR-mediated immunity. The authors should address this possibility in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45393.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: Consider adding Yosef et al., 2012.

We believe the bands running between 43 and 71 nucleotides in the <italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic> strain may represent longer crRNA species that have undergone partial/incomplete maturation. The prominent appearance of these bands in the double mutant, but not the <italic>∆rnjB</italic> single mutant, may imply that RNase J2 plays a modest role in crRNA maturation which can be compensated by the presence of PNPase. We agree that it is worthwhile to note this observation. Accordingly, the following text has been added in the Results section:</p><p>“We noted that longer RNAs running between 43 and 71 nucleotides appear more prominently in the double mutant when compared to either single mutant – these species likely represent crRNAs that have undergone incomplete maturation. […] However, since this partial defect in the double mutant does not lead to additional accumulation of the 71 nucleotide intermediate species, we hesitated to speculate further on the significance of these longer crRNAs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is an apparent discrepancy in the data shown in Figure 3 that the authors do not comment on. Conjugation efficiency in the ∆pnp∆rnjB strain (2.2 x 10<sup>-4</sup>) did not recover to WT levels in the absence of the pCRISPR-Cas plasmid (2.6 x 10<sup>-3</sup>). This suggests that CRISPR-Cas activity is sufficient to provide a low level of plasmid interference (reduction of conjugation efficiency by an order of magnitude) even in the absence of PNPase and RNase J2. However, in the phage challenge assays, the ∆pnp∆rnjB strains displays similar phage sensitivity to strains lacking the CRISPR-Cas system, suggesting that the immune system is not sufficient to provide any immunity against phages in the absence of PNPase and RNase J2. The authors could comment on this apparent difference. Is this simply a consequence of differences in the two types of assays? Could this be related to the apparent CRISPR-independent activity of the degradasome nucleases against phage DNA shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1?</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed a difference in the functional assays, in which CRISPR-Cas10 appears to retain some level of anti-plasmid immunity in the <italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic> background (Figure 3B), whereas immunity against both phages is completely eliminated in this background (Figure 3D and F). Although it is tempting to speculate that this difference may be due to the CRISPR-independent activity of the degradosome nucleases against phage (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), we hesitate to compare directly between these functional assays due to their inherent differences. For example, immunity against the plasmid and the two phages relies upon different spacer sequences. Additionally, the plasmid and phages exhibit different modes of entry and mechanisms of replication. These variables might impact the efficiency of immunity in unexpected ways. Nonetheless, we agree that it is important to highlight the observed differences in the functional assays. To incorporate these observations, we have added/modified text in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“<italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic>/p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> also showed a significant defect in immunity. Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas10 appears to retain a modest level of anti-plasmid immunity in the double mutant, resulting in a conjugation efficiency that is an order of magnitude lower than that observed in the absence of p<italic>crispr-cas</italic> (compare 2.2 x 10<sup>-4</sup> to 2.6 x 10<sup>-3</sup>). “</p><p>“[…] we observed a significant defect, even more pronounced than that seen for anti-plasmid immunity: While the <italic>∆pnp</italic> strain appeared to perform like wild-type, the <italic>∆rnjB</italic> and <italic>∆pnp∆rnjB</italic> mutations abolished CRISPR-Cas10 function altogether.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the authors data convincingly demonstrate that RNase J2 (and likely J1) cooperate with the CRISPR-Cas machinery, there remains a possibility that deletion of degradasome proteins affects expression of other host factors that may be involved in CRISPR-mediated immunity. The authors should address this possibility in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree, and have added the following text in the Discussion:</p><p>“The possibility remains that PNPase and/or RNase J2 might play indirect roles in CRISPR-Cas10 function, wherein deletion of these degradosome subunits may impact the expression of other host factors that are required for CRISPR function. However, the direct physical interactions that we and others have observed between degradosome components with each other and with the CRISPR machinery (discussed in details below) help to support direct roles for these nucleases in CRISPR immunity (Figure 6).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
