<italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cells (ISCs) exhibit self-renewal potentials, maintain tissue homeostasis, and serve as an excellent model for studying cell growth and regeneration. In this study, we show that Brahma (Brm) chromatin-remodeling complex is required for ISC proliferation and damage-induced midgut regeneration in a lineage-specific manner. ISCs and enteroblasts exhibit high levels of Brm proteins; and without Brm, ISC proliferation and differentiation are impaired. Importantly, the Brm complex participates in ISC proliferation induced by the Scalloped–Yorkie transcriptional complex and that the Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway directly restricted ISC proliferation by regulating Brm protein levels by inducing caspase-dependent cleavage of Brm. The cleavage resistant form of Brm protein promoted ISC proliferation. Our findings highlighted the importance of Hpo signaling in regulating epigenetic components such as Brm to control downstream transcription and hence ISC proliferation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00999.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00999.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00999.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most tissues can generate new cells to repair damage or replace worn-out cells. The new cells are often generated from stem cells—cells that can either reproduce themselves or mature into other types of cells. In the fruit-fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for example, intestinal stem cells in the midgut are capable of producing more stem cells or they can differentiate to produce immature cells called enteroblasts that go on to become either enterocytes (the cells that line the gut) or enteroendocrine cells (which secrete hormones).</p><p>Researchers have identified a number of signalling pathways that are involved in the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in the midgut of fruit flies. These include the Hippo pathway, which is important for regulating both cell proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Activation of the Hippo protein triggers a cascade of signals that culminate in the regulation of many of the genes involved in cell proliferation, division and apoptosis.</p><p>Another process that is important for controlling the proliferation and differentiation of cells is chromatin remodelling. Chromatin is the ‘packaging’ that keeps DNA tightly wound within the cell nucleus, and remodelling refers to the structural changes that allow proteins called transcription factors to reach the genes and transcribe them into messenger RNA (which then leaves the nucleus to generate the protein).</p><p>Now, Jin et al. have explored how the Hippo pathway and chromatin remodelling work together to regulate of stem cells. Using a technique called RNA interference to block the expression of various genes in intestinal stem cells and enteroblasts, Jin et al. found that a protein called Brahma—which is an essential part of a chromatin-remodelling complex—must be present for the stem cells to multiply normally.</p><p>Jin et al. also showed how the Hippo signalling pathway interacts with chromatin remodelling. Activation of the Hippo pathway inhibits gene expression by preventing two other proteins, Yorkie and Scalloped, from forming a complex in the nucleus. The new work shows that Brahma interacts physically with the Yorkie and Scalloped proteins to regulate the proliferation of the intestinal stem cells. It also shows that the Hippo protein regulates the activity of the Brahma protein by inducing a process called caspase-dependent cleavage. Because many of the proteins involved in these pathways are evolutionarily conserved and expressed in a variety of tissues, these findings may have implications for stem cell function and tissue repair in many species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00999.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00999.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>brahma</kwd><kwd>midgut</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010CB912101, 2012CB945001, 2011CB943902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDA01010406, XDA01010405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31171394, 31371462, 31171414, 31371492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Brahma chromatin remodelling complex interacts with the Hippo signalling pathway to regulate the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central to the animal development is how chromatin assembly and regulation orchestrate cell-fate determination. Four epigenetic factors, DNA methylation, histone modifications, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and the recently discovered non-coding RNAs play major roles in epigenetic regulation at the chromatin level. The SWI/SNF family is one of the most-studied families of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which regulate gene expression by destabilizing nucleosome structures to alter the DNA accessibility for transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cairns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hargreaves and Crabtree, 2011</xref>). Studies have implicated diverse roles for the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in embryonic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. SWI/SNF complexes also function in neural, heart, and muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bultman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lickert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ho and Crabtree, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhan et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two SWI/SNF complexes, the Brahma (Brm)-associated proteins (BAP) complex and the polybromo-containing BAP (PBAP) complex. The BAP complex has a signature subunit Osa, while PBAP complex is defined by BAP170, Polybromo, and Syap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elfring et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>). Brm is a unique DNA-stimulated ATPase and common subunit for both BAP and PBAP complexes. Progress has been made in understanding the function of the Brm complex during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Treisman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins and Treisman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janody et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moshkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terriente-Felix and de Celis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neumuller et al., 2011</xref>), yet little is known about Brm complex functions in maintaining stem cell pluripotency of the epithelial tissues.</p><p>The simplicity of the structure and the multipotency of <italic>Drosophila</italic> posterior midgut make it an excellent model to study adult epithelial tissue homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). The midgut is composed of four cell types: enterocytes (ECs), enteroendocrine (ee) cells, intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and enteroblasts (EBs). The mature ECs are large polyploid cells of absorptive function and frame the midgut lining; ee and ISCs are the two types of diploid cells in the midgut that are less abundant. ISCs evenly locate at basal position underneath the ECs with a wedge-like morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2007</xref>) and are the only known cell type in the posterior midgut that proliferates. On cell division, ISCs undergo self-renewal or proliferation to become EBs, quiescent progenitor cells that ultimately differentiate to ECs or ee cells with the ratio 9:1 under the control of Delta (Dl) and Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). Since the active Dl expression is retained in self-renewed ISCs and is lost in the newly generated EBs, antibody against the active Dl is used as the specific and the only known marker for <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs are tightly controlled by Notch, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR), Hippo (Hpo), and Wingless signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The evolutionarily conserved Hpo pathway controls organ size by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irvine, 2012</xref>). Hpo is a serine/threonine Ste20-like kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harvey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pantalacci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Udan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2003</xref>) that directly phosphorylates and activates downstream nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) family protein kinase Warts (Wts). Wts activation mediated by Hpo requires scaffold proteins Salvador (Sav) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kango-Singh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tapon et al., 2002</xref>) and mob as tumor suppressor (Mats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lai et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these proteins inhibit Yorkie (Yki) nuclear translocation. In the absence of Wts-mediated suppression, Yki forms a complex with transcription factor(s) such as Scalloped (Sd) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goulev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) in the nucleus to regulate the expression of a plethora of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irvine, 2012</xref>). In addition, the Hpo pathway maintains tissue homeostasis by regulating the balance between <italic>diap1</italic> expression and basal levels of activated caspases via the control of Dronc (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Nedd-2-like caspase orthologous to human Caspase 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We present evidence that Brm is required for ISC proliferation in both normal and regenerating midguts, and it is required in ISCs for EC differentiation in normal midguts. In addition, we show that the Brm complex is physically associated with the Sd–Yki transcriptional complex in the nucleus and functions downstream of the Hpo pathway to regulate ISC proliferation. We also demonstrate that Brm is regulated by the Hpo pathway at the protein level through Hpo kinase-induced, caspase-dependent, cleavage of Brm at its D718 site. Altogether, as exemplified in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISCs, our study unravels a novel mechanism of the chromatin remodeling Brm complex in maintaining adult stem cell pluripotency of epithelial tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brm is required for ISC proliferation in midguts</title><p>To gain insights on homeostasis and proliferation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts, a small-scale screen searching for candidates that genetically alters the midgut regeneration and homeostasis was carried out. During the screen, <italic>escargot-Gal4</italic> (<italic>esg-Gal4</italic>) was used to drive RNAi expressions of different genes in ISCs and EBs in the presence of a temperature-sensitive Gal4 repressor, <italic>tubGal80</italic> (henceforth <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>). Adult <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> flies grown at the permissive temperature do not express GFP or RNAi in ISCs and EBs. Once shifted to the non-permissive temperature, RNAi expressions in ISCs and EBs are induced and simultaneously marked by <italic>esg-Gal4</italic>-driven GFP signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, among the RNAi lines, VDRC (37720) and Bloomington (31712) abolished the expression of Brm, the energy providing subunit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Brm complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neumuller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waldholm et al., 2011</xref>). On Brm RNAi expression, the number of GFP positive (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells in the adult posterior midgut decreased. Concomitantly, the number of phospho-histone3 positive (PH3<sup>+</sup>) cells also reduced, suggesting that ISC proliferation is affected (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,B′</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A′</xref>, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Immunostaining using an antibody against Brm 505–775 aa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elfring et al., 1998</xref>) confirmed that endogenous Brm protein can be efficiently knocked down in the cells of both wing imaginal discs and midguts that express Brm RNAi transgenes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–B′′,C–C′</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; and compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–E′′′</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–D′′′</xref>). In addition, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited a spherical shape in the absence of Brm compared with the angular shaped control cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,B′</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A′</xref>), suggesting that the attachment of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells to surrounding cells is disrupted. We further tested whether knockdown of Brm in ISCs/EBs affects the division of ISCs. On Brm RNAi expression, EBs in the intestinal epithelium labeled with the expression of the Suppressor of Hairless reporter (Su(H)-LacZ, a specific marker for EBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>) were detected (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–G′′</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–F′′</xref>). This piece of evidence suggests that EBs are still formed even when Brm expression is inhibited and ISC proliferation is blocked. Expression of Brm<sup>K804R</sup>, a dominant negative form of Brm defective for ATP hydrolysis activity without affecting the complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elfring et al., 1998</xref>), results in similar effects compared to Brm RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Interestingly, cotransfection of Brm and Hpo in S2 cells resulted in a lower Brm protein level, suggesting that Brm was destabilized in the presence of Hpo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result raised the concern that the Hpo pathway might regulate Brm activity by controlling its protein stability. Furthermore, Brm cleavage event in which a small protein band at about 100 kD was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) in the presence of Hpo upon MG132 treatment. To detect whether this small band represents a cleaved Brm fragment, we generated a Brm construct with a Flag tag at the N-terminus and a V5 tag at the C-terminus (referred to as Flag-Brm-V5). Using this construct, we were able to identify a Flag-tagged N-terminal cleavage product about 100 kD and a V5-tagged C-terminal cleavage product about 130 kD in the presence of Hpo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Considering that the molecular weight of full length Brm is about 230 kD, it is possible that Hpo regulates Brm stability by inducing Brm cleavage at only one site. We also found that this cleavage action depended on Hpo protein in a dose-dependent manner, since increasing the dose of Hpo plasmids resulted in an accumulation of the cleaved Brm product and a decrease in the full length Brm protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A truncation of Hpo without kinase activity (Hpo-C) did not induce such cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that Hpo kinase domain but not C-terminal regulatory domain induces Brm cleavage. In addition, Hpo-induced Brm cleavage was blocked in the presence of Yki–Sd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that it was regulated by downstream events of the Hpo signaling pathway.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00999.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Brm is cleaved at the D718 site by Hpo-induced caspase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flag-Brm-V5 was transfected with or without Myc-Hpo.

In fact, previous studies have implicated a role of the Hpo signaling pathway in caspase activation and cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). This function of Hpo was verified by detecting active caspase 3 expression in wing discs overexpressing Hpo or Hpo-KD (a kinase dead form of Hpo). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E′′′</xref>, the cleaved caspase 3, a functional read-out of initiator caspase activity, was detected only in Hpo overexpressed discs but not in the Hpo-KD overexpressed discs. Taken together, we speculated that Hpo-induced caspase activity might regulate the protein level of Brm.</p><p>To verify this idea, we used the unspecific caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, to test whether the activities of caspases are required for Hpo-induced Brm cleavage. We found that the 100 kD cleaved Brm product disappeared on the addition of Z-VAD-FMK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that the inhibition of caspase activities blocks Brm cleavage. Furthermore, it is known that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Diap1, which is a transcription product of the Hpo pathway target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), inhibits caspase activity. Diap1 was cotransfected with Brm and Hpo in S2 cells to inhibit caspase activity. Interestingly, we found that Diap1 cotransfection inhibited Hpo-induced Brm cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that the Hpo regulates Brm cleavage by inducing caspase activity.</p><p>To further study the function of caspases during Brm cleavage in details, Hpo and Brm were cotransfected in S2 cells in the presence of inhibitors of mammalian caspase 3, 8, 9, 10, respectively (no commercial <italic>Drosophila</italic> caspase inhibitors were available). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, the addition of inhibitor of caspase 3 or caspase 10 completely abolished Hpo-induced Brm cleavage, whereas the addition of other caspase inhibitors only partially affected the cleavage reaction as revealed by the presence of the 100 kD Brm protein fragment. Caspase 10 is an initiator in the extrinsic death-receptor-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wachmann et al., 2010</xref>), and caspase 3 is the effector caspase generally believed to carry out the cleavage of nuclear protein substrates. These results suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of caspase 3 and caspase 10 play important roles in Hpo-induced Brm cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>D718 site is required for Hpo-induced, caspase-dependent, Brm cleavage</title><p>In an attempt to identify the cleavage site of Brm, two Brm deletion forms, D1 (Δ601–800 aa) and D2 (Δ694–768 aa), were generated based on previous observations of N- and C-terminal cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). No cleavage reaction was detected for these two Brm deletion forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Although no canonical caspase 3 tetra-peptide cleavage site DEVD was found in this region, several aspartic acids that potentially serve as the caspase cleavage sites were identified. To validate these sites, individual aspartic acids were mutated to alanine separately. Interestingly, Brm mutant carrying aspartic acids to alanine mutation at D718 site (Brm<sup>D718A</sup>) does not undergo cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Taken together, these results indicate that Brm protein level is restricted by Hpo activity. Brm<sup>D718A</sup>, as an uncleavable form of Brm, bypasses the Hpo restriction to retain its ability to promote ISC proliferation.</p><p>To further understand how Brm<sup>D718A</sup> functions to promote proliferation in other tissues, we investigated the genetic relationship of Brm and Yki in adult eyes under the control of <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> driver.

Recently, the findings from several research reports based on the stem cell system reveal important roles of chromatin remodeling complex in stem cell state maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lessard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). Our study suggested that the chromatin remodeling activity of Brm complex was required for the proliferation and differentiation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISCs. Based on our findings, we propose that Brm is critical for maintaining <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). High levels of Brm in the ISC nucleus represent high proliferative ability and are essential for EC differentiation; low levels of Brm in the EC nucleus may be a response for homeostasis. Changes in Brm protein levels resulted in the disruption of differentiation and deregulation of cell proliferation. In line with previous findings in human, the cell-type-specific expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs BRG1 and BRM were also detected in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>). BRG1 is mainly expressed in cell types that constantly undergo proliferation or self-renewal, whereas BRM is expressed in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marenda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>). These observations indicate that Brm may act similarly as BRG1 and BRM in controlling proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>It is known that the Hpo pathway restricts cell proliferation and promotes cell death at least in two ways: inhibiting the transcriptional co-activator Yki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), and inducing activation of pro-apoptotic genes such as caspases directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, we identified a novel regulatory mechanism of the Hpo pathway in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. In this scenario, Brm activity is regulated by the Hpo pathway. In normal physiological conditions, under the control of Hpo signaling, the function of Yki–Sd to promote ISC proliferation is restricted and the pro-proliferation of target genes such as <italic>diap1</italic> that inhibits Hpo-induced caspase activity cannot be further activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Therefore, Hpo signaling normally functions to restrict cell numbers in the midgut by keeping ISC proliferation at low levels. Yki is enriched in ISCs, but predominantly inactivated in cytoplasm by the Hpo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karpowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Staley and Irvine, 2010</xref>). The knockdown of Yki in ISCs did not cause any phenotype in the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karpowicz et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that Yki is inactivated in ISCs under normal homeostasis. During an injury, Hpo signaling is suppressed or disrupted, Yki translocates into the nuclei to form a complex with Sd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karpowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shaw et al., 2010</xref>), which may allow Yki–Sd to interact with Brm complex in the nucleus to activate transcriptional targets. Of note, the loss-of-function of Brm resulted in growth defect of ISCs, suggesting that Brm is required for ISC homeostasis and possessing a different role of Brm from Yki in the regulation of ISCs. It is possible that the function of Brm on ISC homeostasis is regulated via other signaling pathways by recruiting other factors. Therefore, different phenotypes induced by the loss-of-function of Brm and Yki in midgut might be due to different regulatory mechanisms. Despite its unique function cooperating with Yki in midgut, that Brm complex is essential for Yki-mediated transcription might be a general requirement for cell proliferation. While this manuscript was under preparation, Irvine lab reported a genome-wide association of Yki with chromatin and chromatin-remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2013</xref>). These results support our model.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the interaction between Brm and Yki–Sd transcriptional complex is under tight regulation. The loss of Hpo signaling stabilizes Brm protein, whereas the active Hpo pathway restricts Brm levels by activating <italic>Drosophila</italic> caspases to cleave Brm at the D718 site and inhibiting downstream target gene <italic>diap1</italic> transcription simultaneously. In addition, overexpression of Brm complex components induces only a mild enhancement on midgut proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E,E′,G,G′,I,I′</xref>). One possibility is that overexpressing only one of the Brm complex components does not provide full activation of the whole complex; the other possibility is that due to the restriction of the Hpo signaling, as overexpressing Brm<sup>D718A</sup> mutant protein in ISCs/EBs exhibits a stronger phenotype than expressing the wild-type Brm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,G</xref>) and coexpression of Brm<sup>D718A</sup> completely rescues the impairment of Hpo-induced ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). D718A mutation blocks the caspase-dependent Brm cleavage and exhibits high activity in promoting ISC proliferation. We have defined a previously unknown, yet essential epigenetic mechanism underlying the role of the Hpo pathway in regulating Brm activity.</p><p>It is a novel finding that Brm protein level is regulated by the caspase-dependent cleavage. To focus on the function of Brm cleavage in the presence of cell death signals, we tried to examine the activities of the cleaved Brm fragments. Although in vivo experiments did not show strong activity of Brm N- and C-cleavage products in promoting proliferation of ISCs, the C-terminal fragment of Brm that contains the ATPase domain exhibits a relative higher activity than the N-terminal fragment in ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D,E,K</xref>). The cleavage might induce faster degradation of Brm N- and C-terminus, since it was difficult to detect N- or C-fragments of Brm by Western blot analysis without MG132 treatment. It reveals that the degradation events of Brm including both ubiquitination and cleavage at D718 site can be important for Brm functional regulation under different conditions. To this end, the intrinsic signaling(s) may balance the activity of Brm complex through degradation of some important components, such as Brm, to maintain tissue homeostasis. Of note, the cleavage of Brm at D718 is occurred at a novel DATD sequence that is not conserved in human Brm. It has been reported that Cathepsin G, not caspase, cut hBrm during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biggs et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that the cleavage regulatory mechanism of Brm is relatively conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals.</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that the Brm complex plays an important role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISC proliferation and differentiation and is regulated by multi-levels of Hpo signaling. Our findings indicate that Hpo signaling not only exhibits regulatory roles in organ size control during development but also directly regulates epigenetics through a control of the protein level of epigenetic regulatory component Brm. In mammals, it is known that Hpo signaling and SWI/SNF complex-mediated chromatin remodeling processes play critical roles in tissue development. Malfunction of the Hpo signaling pathway and aberrant expressions of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling proteins BRM and BRG1 have been documented in a wide variety of human cancers including colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reisman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, our study that implicated a functional link between Hpo signaling pathway and SWI/SNF activity may provide new strategies to develop biomarkers or therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks and genetics</title><p>The following fly stocks were used: <italic>UAS-yki</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>UAS-HA-Sd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>UAS-HA-SdGA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>BF33(16)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>UAS-Flag-Hpo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>esg-Gal4/UAS-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>), <italic>esg-Gal4/UAS-GFP;TubGal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>), <italic>Myo1A-Gal4/UAS-GFP;TubGal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>)<italic>, w;esgGal4 tubGal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> <italic>UAS-GFP; UAS-flp Act&gt;CD2&gt;Gal4</italic> (<italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>F/O,</italic> a gift from Dr Huaqi Jiang), <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>Su(H)Z</italic>, <italic>brm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (Bloomington 3619), <italic>FRT80 brm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, <italic>sd</italic> hypomorphic allele (<italic>sd</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>osa</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (a gift from Professor Asgar Klebes)<italic>, UAS-Brm RNAi</italic> (VDRC 37720, VDRC 37721, and Bloomington 31712), <italic>UAS-Bap60 RNAi</italic> (NIG4303R-1), <italic>UAS-Mor RNAi</italic> (VDRC 6969), <italic>UAS-Osa RNAi</italic> (VDRC 7810), <italic>hhBanGFP</italic>, <italic>UAS-Bap60</italic>, <italic>UAS-Mor</italic>, <italic>UAS-Osa</italic>, <italic>UAS-Brm-N</italic>, <italic>and UAS-Brm-C</italic>.

The beads were washed using 10 vol of Borate Buffer (Sodium Borate pH 9.0, 0.2 mM) twice. 10 μl aliquot of beads was stored on ice (sample 1). The rest of the beads were mixed with solid Dimethyl Pimelimidate Dihydrochloride (final concentration is 20 mM) on the rolling mixer for 30 min at room temperature. Another 10 μl aliquot of beads was collected as sample 2. The rest of the beads were washed twice by equal volume of Ethanolamine after discarding the supernatant. Equal volume of Ethanolamine was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr on the rolling mixer, then washed by PBS twice and mixed with the cell supernatant at 4°C for 1 hr on a rolling mixer respectively. The mixture was washed by lysis buffer for three times and stored at −20°C for left experiment.</p><p>The coupling of antibody to beads was checked by analyzing the sample 1 and 2 on a SDS gel. After checking the coupling efficiency, for Sd MS, two total samples (serum control and Sd IP sample) were sent for MS directly. For Yki MS, we ran an SDS-PAGE to separate the proteins of Yki IP sample, and then specific bands, which were absent in IgG IP control, were selected for further MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In-gel digestion</title><p>For MS fingerprinting, the gel slices were cut out of the preparative Coomassie blue-stained gels, destained with100 mmol/l NH4HCO<sub>3</sub>/30% ACN, and then dried completely by centrifugal lyophilization. The dried gel slices were rehydrated with a total of 25 ng of sequencing grade, modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) in 100 mmol/l ammonium bicarbonate at 4°C for 2 hr. After 20 ml of 50 mmol/l NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.3 was supplied, the gel slices were incubated at 37°C for 20 hr. The digest buffer was removed and saved. The gel pieces were then extracted with 200 ml of 60% ACN/0.1%TFA for 15 min with sonication, and the supernatant was removed. The extraction was repeated twice. The three extracts plus the first saved digest buffer were pooled and dried completely by centrifugal lyophilization. This in-gel digestion method was mainly performed according to the method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2005</xref>) with some modifications as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MS and protein identification</title><p>Peptide mixtures of each gel slice were redissolved in 0.1%TFA, then desalted and concentrated using Stage Tips as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>). Peptide solution was measured using a LTQ Deca XP system (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, California, United States). HPLC separation was performed with a capillary LC pump. The flow rate of the pump was at 250 μl/min and was about 2 μl/min after split. The mobile phases used for reverse phase were A: 0.1% formic acid in water, pH 3.0, B: 0.1% formic acid in ACN. Peptides were eluted using a 2–35%, 35–90% stepped linear gradient of solvent B in 60 min, 90 min following 90% solvent B in 10 min, and 2% solvent B in 30 min for balance. An ESIIT mass spectrometer (LTQ Deca XP; Thermo Finnigan) was used for peptide detection. The positive ion mode was employed, and the spray voltage was set at 3.4 KV. The spray temperature was set at 200°C for peptides. Collision energy is automatically set by the LTQ Deca XP system. After acquisition of a full scan mass spectrum, 10 MS/MS scans were acquired for the next 10 most intense ions using dynamic exclusion. Peptides and proteins were identified using Turbo Sequest software (Thermo Finnigan), which uses the MS and MS/MS spectra of peptide ions to search against the publicly available Uniport fly database (Version 2011-05-26). The protein identification criteria that we used were based on Delta (CN ≥ 0.1) and Xcorr (one charge ≥ 1.9, two charges ≥ 2.2, three charges ≥ 3.75).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Yingzi Yang, Dr Wei Du, and Dr Dangsheng Li for helpful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

While your article has been favorably peer reviewed by a Senior editor (K VijayRaghavan) and another reviewer, it will be essential for you to respond in full to the comments below as they point to substantive requirements for examining a resubmission.</p><p>The Senior editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Zhang et al. set out to show that “Brahma is essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cell proliferation and regulated by Hippo signaling.” There are many features of this paper that make it interesting, suggesting novel mechanisms underlying ISC proliferation. Aspects of this study are thorough with some of the major conclusions well supported by the data. Yet, in other parts, it falls short. A complete resubmission with substantial, robust, and (reasonably rapidly doable) additional experiments could make for an acceptable new submission, which will be examined to see if it retains novelty and whether the hypotheses stand up after examination of results from the experiments suggested.</p><p>The principal (potential) novelty and scientific importance of the current study come from the demonstration of the role of Brahma in intestinal stem cell (ISC) regulation and of mechanisms by which its action is regulated. SWI/SNF and Brahma's role has been studied in several other contexts including a variety of stem cell ones. The added value of this study will be if it shows how Brahma mechanistically functions downstream of specific signaling pathways in the ISC context.</p><p>The authors start by examining the role of Brm in ISC proliferation. They do this by using an Brm-RNAi under the control of a <italic>escargot-Gal4</italic> driver, conditionally expressed in the adult using a <italic>Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> system (the temperature shift timings should be clearly stated in the results and better detailed in the Materials and methods). The RNAi knockdown is stated in the text as being confirmed by antibody staining, but the relevant figure shows that the RNAi works in the imaginal disc: how do we know that the <italic>escargot-Gal4</italic> is as effective in the adult as the <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> is in the third instar disc? The RNAi phenotype is also averred to be similar to a dominant-negative phenotype: the figures presented do suggest a similarity, though how deep this is not evident from what is presented. The reduction of ISC cells is seen better in the MARCM experiment and this suggests that the RNAi could be effective as assumed. In sum, the conclusion of a role for Brm in ISC proliferation would have been stronger if an independent ISC antibody marker were used to verify the RNAi result. This important point needs to be addressed. As it stands, the principal assertion of the first figure is weak, thereby weakening the rest that follows.</p><p>The authors next go on to examine the role of Brm in damage induced midgut regeneration. A couple of points here are puzzling. First, the <italic>Gal80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> does not seem to be used here. Presumably then, the RNAi will be active throughout development. Does this not alter the possibilities for interpreting the data? Figure 1O and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> do not look similar. Can the authors address this? Could it not be that the ISCs are very few (as shown earlier) and that the absence of proliferation of these few ISC upon DSS induction is due to an earlier role for Brm rather than an additional later role on damage induced midgut regeneration?</p><p>Next, the authors examine if Brm is required for EC differentiation. They are led to this by the determination that in <italic>brm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutant clones they see “that <italic>brm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> clones only contained one small nuclear cell (Figure 1G–G').” Brm is expressed at low levels in ECs. The lineage trace method is not well explained anywhere in the text. Presumably they imply that this method allows the removal of even this low-level of Brm in early-ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>) and they then examine the effect on EC differentiation. This point needs to be clarified and clearly demonstrated. If, on the other hand (and this seems to be the case), they suggest that the ISC that are present (without Brm) do not proliferate and therefore there are fewer ECs as seen by the absence of PDM-1, then this suggests a role for Brm in ISCs and not necessarily in EC differentiation too. A clean way to examine the role of Brm in EC differentiation will be to down-regulate Brm specifically in early-ECs but not in ISCs. The authors could examine if this is feasible using conditional <italic>Gal4</italic> drivers.</p><p>The authors then go on to examine the interaction of Brm with the Yki-Sd complex. This is done in S2 cells using pull-down of endogenously expressed Yki or Sd proteins followed by MS. They also use over-expressed tagged proteins to show co-immunoprecipitation. This section, with respect to the main theme of the paper, raises concern. So far, we have epistasis showing that Brm is downstream of Yki-Sd. Now we are shown physical interaction in another very different context (S2) cells (similar results have also been recently published by the Ken Irvine Lab). These S2 results are also interpreted quantitatively and this interpretation transferred to an in vivo context: it is not clear how one can do this, coming as it does from a rather artificial and experimentally highly-manipulated cell-culture context. If the authors do not show in vivo interaction by high-resolution imaging methods they are not adding anything too much to what we have already from the Irvine lab paper. Just reporting this as an independent conformation of the Irvine lab results is confirmatory, but that can be stated in a less elaborate way. Similarly, the genetic interactions of Brm with Sd are very interesting from a genetic perspective, but other that hinting tantalizingly to a similar interaction in ISCs we do not know if this wing-blade interaction applies in this context. Indeed does the mild phenotype from Sd over-expression not suggest that Sd may not have a major role in ISC differentiation, although Yki does?</p><p>Again, the fact that the EGFR gain- and Notch-RNAi phenotypes are not altered by Brm loss of function does not necessarily mean that the EGFR and Notch pathways function independent of Brm. Several more gain and loss of function studies and colocalization (or otherwise) of effectors will be needed before any conclusion is reached. Indeed, by bringing in this section too the authors do not help themselves. Leaving it out will not change the main point they are trying to make.</p><p>Finally, the result that the Hippo-kinase activity regulates a caspase, which cleaves Brm and that the Cleavage resistant Brm illuminates a regulatory role for Brm is very interesting. Indeed this is the most valuable part of the paper. Unfortunately, it is not shown as being substantively related to the ISC context. This is a fundamental gap that needs to be filled. The authors need further evidence to address the significance of the Brm cleavage during ISC proliferation. The activity of Brm N and C terminus was mentioned as “data not shown”. It will be important to show them clearly and interpret them. The activity, in ISCs, of both cleaved products of Brm should be analyzed in wild-type, Brm null and Yki over-expression backgrounds. The Hippo dependence of cleavage in ISCs also needs demonstration. As presented, while these last sets of results (on Brm cleavage) are quite interesting from a Brm regulation viewpoint, they are not fundamental to the claims the paper starts out to make as they are not substantively demonstrated in ISCs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00999.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors start by examining the role of Brm in ISC proliferation.

To clarify the point that the Brm RNAi works efficiently in the ISCs/EBs, we stained the endogenous Brm protein in the control wild type <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> gut and <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>-Brm</italic> RNAi guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1 D-E”’</xref>). Compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1 D-D”’</xref>), Brm levels in the ISCs/EBs were efficiently reduced by Brm RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1 E-E”’</xref>). Of note, the weak signal of Brm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1E’</xref> is from the large nuclear ECs. Brm dominant-negative form K804R does not possess its ATPase activity, yet does not affect the complex assembly. We predict that it will have a weaker function than Brm RNAi. To verify the RNAi results, we had used Delta (Dl), which is a unique ISC marker, to mark ISC in <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup><italic>-Brm</italic> RNAi experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A’, B’</xref>).

Both gave similar results. In the previous manuscript, we showed the <italic>esgGal4</italic> data; to avoid misinterpretation of developmental difference, we now replaced the <italic>esgGal4</italic> data with the <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-F’</xref>). The old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> do not look similar due to: 1) the difference in GFP protein distribution for <italic>esgGal4</italic>-GFP (in both nucleus and cytoplasm) and <italic>esg80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>-GFP (mainly in the cytoplasm) and 2) different culture conditions and food conditions of these two experiments. The flies used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> were fed with normal food, but the flies used for DSS-treated experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D’</xref>) were fed with glucose and water in order to make the final concentration of DSS steady at 3%. During the experimental operation, we noticed that the guts expressing Brm RNAi from the DSS-treated experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-C’</xref>) were more fragile and much thinner than the guts from the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-B’</xref> using the same esg80<sup>ts</sup> driver. Therefore, based on these results, we believe that the DSS-induced midgut regeneration can be blocked by the loss of Brm, but not due to the earlier role of Brm knockdown in development.</p><p><italic>Next, the authors examine if Brm is required for EC differentiation.

The authors could examine if this is feasible using conditional</italic> Gal4 <italic>drivers</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we gave a description of the lineage trace method in the revised manuscript. To better understand the role of Brm in EC differentiation, we tried to find probable drivers for lineage tracing of early-ECs, but unfortunately, no suitable early-ECs specific conditional <italic>Gal4</italic> drivers is reported yet (Myo1A driver is also expressed in mature ECs (Jiang and Edgar, 2009)). Instead, we analyzed the function of Brm in ISCs division by detecting the Su(H)lacZ, a marker of EB cells. We found that Brm RNAi did not block EBs formation, and added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1F-G”</xref> with a description in the revised manuscript. Together with our esgF/O lineage tracing data, we speculated that, if Brm do not affect the differentiation from EBs to ECs, EBs expressing esgF/O-Brm RNAi will finally differentiate into ECs like control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-F’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-A’</xref>). However, we observed very few ECs in the Brm RNAi guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-E’, H-H’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C-C’</xref>) even though relatively a large number of EB cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1F-G”</xref>), indicating that the differentiation from EBs to ECs was affected. The other evidence that supports the conclusion is that Brm overexpression promotes precocious differentiation of ECs at day 2 after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-D’</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-C’</xref>), while the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in control group do not form EC at this time point.</p><p><italic>The authors then go on to examine the interaction of Brm with the Yki-Sd complex.

As suggested, we weakened this part in the revised manuscript. The function of Brm on cell proliferation may be a general requirement even though the regulation is cell type specific. In tissues other than guts, such as wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh et al., 2013</xref>), knockdown of Brm inhibits Yki-induced proliferation, suggesting that Brm is generally required for Yki activity. Knockdown of Yki in ISCs does not lead to any obvious phenotypes even though Yki protein is enriched in ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karpowicz et al., 2010</xref>); knockdown of Yki in tissues, like wing discs, blocks the growth of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). This piece of evidence suggests that distinct regulatory mechanisms exist in the ISCs to control Yki’s activity.</p><p>The genetic interactions of <italic>brm</italic> with <italic>sd</italic> in wings together with their physical interactions also suggested that Sd activity is generally regulated by Brm, which is novel. In midguts, when we generated <italic>sd</italic> null MARCM clones in guts, we found that, after 14 days of heat shock, the size of <italic>sd</italic> mutant clones were larger than the wild type control clones, suggesting that loss of Sd promotes proliferation of the gut cells in normal condition, a phenomenon not similar to that by Yki knockdown. When we overexpressed Yki in the <italic>sd</italic> MARCM clones, the clone size is much smaller than the Yki overexpressed clones. These data suggested that, Sd is involved in hyper-active Yki induced proliferation of ISCs, but it is also a default transcriptional repressor in normal condition, which is consistent with the findings recently published by DJ Pan’s lab (Koontz et al., 2013) and by our lab (Guo et al., 2013). We observed that SdGA (an active form of Sd) over-expression in ISCs/EBs had a mild phenotype (mono-layer) than Yki over-expression, suggesting that Yki plays a more extensive role in ISC proliferation through cooperation with other factors except Sd.</p><p><italic>Again, the fact that the EGFR gain- and Notch-RNAi phenotypes are not altered by Brm loss of function does not necessarily mean that the EGFR and Notch pathways function independent of Brm.

As suggested, we comprehensively analyzed the activity of the cleaved products of Brm in wild-type, Yki overexpression, and Brm null backgrounds, and added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>. In wild-type background, Brm-C induces ISC proliferation by increasing the number of ISCs/EBs and PH3<sup>+</sup> cells, but not as strong as Brm<sup>D718A</sup>, while Brm-N didn’t exhibit any obvious change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2A-E, 2K</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were also observed in Yki overexpression backgrounds. Compared with Yki overexpression in ISCs/EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2F</xref>), overexpressing wild type Brm or Brm<sup>D718A</sup> together with Yki further promoted the proliferation of ISCs and increased the PH3<sup>+</sup> cell number dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2 G, 2H, 2K</xref>). Brm-N and Brm-C were able to promote the Yki induced ISCs proliferation mildly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2I, 2J, 2K</xref>).</p><p>We overexpressed Brm, Brm<sup>D718A</sup>, Brm-N and Brm-C in <italic>brm</italic> null MARCM clones. After induction for 3 or 10 days, all of them were able to partially rescue the growth defect of <italic>brm</italic> null clones in different degrees, and formed larger clones containing more cells than the <italic>brm</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> clones. Brm<sup>D718A</sup> exhibited the strongest activity as shown by forming bigger clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2P, 2L</xref>), and Brm cleavage products, Brm-N or C, only had weak rescue ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2Q, 2R, 2L</xref>).</p><p>We also tried to check the cleavage event of Brm in ISCs and EBs in midgut. We dissected more than 100 guts each to detect the cleavage of endogenous Brm or the overexpressed Flag-Brm/Flag- Brm<sup>D718A</sup> in ISCs/EBs with or without Hpo co-expression by Western blot. Unfortunately, we failed to detect any Brm signal. It may be due to the fact that Brm protein levels are high in ISCs and EBs, yet the gut only contains a small number of ISCs and EBs, and most of the gut cells are ECs with low Brm protein levels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
