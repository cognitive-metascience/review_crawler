Less appreciated is that the extent and free-energy cost of these deformations likely varies among different functional states of a protein, and thus, that they might contribute significantly to defining its mechanism. We consider the trimeric Na<sup>+</sup>-aspartate symporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, a homolog of an important class of neurotransmitter transporters, whose mechanism entails one of the most drastic structural changes known. Molecular simulations indicate that when the protomers become inward-facing, they cause deep, long-ranged, and yet mutually-independent membrane deformations. Using a novel simulation methodology, we estimate that the free-energy cost of this membrane perturbation is in the order of 6–7 kcal/mol per protomer. Compensating free-energy contributions within the protein or its environment must thus stabilize this inward-facing conformation for the transporter to function. We discuss these striking results in the context of existing experimental observations for this and other transporters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>membrane morphology</kwd><kwd>molecular simulation</kwd><kwd>thermodynamics</kwd><kwd>enhanced sampling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Wenchang</given-names></name><name><surname>Fiorin</surname><given-names>Giacomo</given-names></name><name><surname>Anselmi</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name><name><surname>Faraldo-Gómez</surname><given-names>José D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karimi-Varzaneh</surname><given-names>Hossein Ali</given-names></name><name><surname>Poblete</surname><given-names>Horacio</given-names></name><name><surname>Forrest</surname><given-names>Lucy R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conformational mechanism of a transporter protein is found to have profound and energetically costly effects on the morphology of the surrounding membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integral membrane proteins can have a marked impact on the morphology of the surrounding bilayer. For example, they might alter its curvature or thickness, or foster the enrichment or depletion of specific types of lipid in their vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marsh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>). These perturbations develop to accommodate the amino-acid composition and specific structural features of the protein surface. For a broad range of systems of interest, however, these features are not static, but vary as the protein carries out its biological activity. Examples include channel proteins and their gating mechanisms, or the conformational cycles resulting in alternating access in active transporters. The protein-lipid interface also changes when membrane proteins form complexes or oligomers. Because most membrane perturbations entail an energetic or entropic cost, it seems reasonable to expect that the bilayer contributes to the thermodynamics and kinetics of these processes, favoring or disfavoring specific structural states. Such interdependence would help explain why changes in lipid bilayer composition, either resulting from natural regulatory mechanisms or induced artificially, can have a determining effect on protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jensen and Mouritsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denning and Beckstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordero-Morales and Vásquez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haselwandter and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we seek to gain insights into this interplay for a class of membrane proteins known to undergo a striking structural transformation, namely secondary-active transporters featuring the so-called elevator mechanism. We specifically focus on the Na<sup>+</sup>-aspartate symporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub> from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic>, a member and model system of the Excitatory Amino-Acid Transporter (EAAT) family, which includes the human SLC1 neurotransmitter transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gether et al., 2006</xref>). Secondary-active transporters like Glt<sub>Ph</sub> interconvert between two major conformational states that alternately expose binding sites for ions and substrate to either side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boudker and Verdon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forrest et al., 2011</xref>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, this conformational interconversion takes place only when Na<sup>+</sup> and aspartate occupy the transporter or when the transporter is empty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ryan et al., 2009</xref>), which defines this protein as a co-transporter. For either occupancy state, the exchange between outward- and inward-facing conformations is spontaneous, that is it does not require an extrinsic electrochemical driving force. However, the relative populations of these conformational states and the net directionality of the transport cycle do depend on the membrane potential and the relative concentrations of ions and substrates on either side of the membrane. This dependence is why downhill translocation of Na<sup>+</sup> will power uphill transport of aspartate, and vice versa.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> trimer in the outward- and inward-facing states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) View from the extracellular space, with the three protomers in the outward-facing conformation (PDB 2NWL).

The protomers consist of two distinct units: the scaffold domain, which provides a stable trimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groeneveld and Slotboom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Georgieva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hänelt et al., 2013</xref>), and the transport domain, which encapsulates the ion and aspartate binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Both domains are exposed to the lipid bilayer, but structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in outward- and inward-facing states clearly reveal that it is the movement of the latter domain that results in alternating access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, if one assumes that the scaffold domains remain stationary relative to the membrane mid-plane, each transport domain would move perpendicularly to that plane by approximately 15 Å, that is about one-third of the total bilayer width. How this drastic structural change impacts the relationship between protein and membrane has, to our knowledge, not been previously evaluated. One might envisage that the transport domains simply traverse the membrane (like an elevator), moving polar sidechains on their surface into the bilayer interior and exposing hydrophobic ones to the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, the morphology of the lipid bilayer could adapt to the conformational state of the protein, and match the amino-acid make-up of the protein surface throughout the transport cycle. Which of these two possibilities entails the least energetic cost is entirely unclear. The absence of functional cooperativity among protomers would appear to rule out the latter, as a pronounced membrane deformation induced by one protomer could impact the conformational dynamics of its two neighbors. On the other hand, the cumulative cost of dehydration of polar and charged sidechains could be exceedingly large. Experimental studies of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> homolog EAAT2 also appear to show that bilayer-facing regions in the outward-facing state are similarly solvent-accessible throughout the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silverstein et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations in principle provide a means to examine this interplay in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marrink et al., 2019</xref>). Current computing power makes it feasible to examine the morphology of simple phospholipid membranes around protein structures, for many cases of interest. Highly complex membranes remain beyond reach, however, if represented in atomic detail, as the relaxation time of an arbitrarily-configured multi-component lipid mixture is slower than typically attainable simulation times, thus imposing a starting-condition bias on any analysis. In such cases, so-called coarse-grained simulations are a viable approach despite their reduced level of detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, simulation methods that permit a direct quantification of the energetic footprint of a membrane morphological change have been lacking. Computational approaches in this area have typically relied on continuum-mechanics theories of membrane elasticity, which necessarily pre-suppose important parameters defining the bilayer energetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Argudo et al., 2017</xref>). Although such approaches can be predictive and insightful in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>), it is unclear whether macroscopic models are generally transferable to the length-scales of individual membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiorin et al., 2019</xref>). To circumvent this problem, we have recently developed a free-energy simulation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiorin et al., 2019</xref>) with which the potential-of-mean-force of a membrane deformation can be probed directly from a simulation system, much in the same way processes such as ligand recognition or ion permeation are commonly characterized. Here, in addition to conventional simulations and structural bioinformatic approaches, we apply this new technology to obtain quantitative insights into the nature of the interplay between Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and the surrounding membrane. The implications of the major conformational change required for transport are discussed in the light of available experimental observations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alternating access causes major membrane deformations, long-ranged but non-cooperative</title><p>To examine how the transport cycle of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> impacts the surrounding membrane, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of phospholipid bilayers containing structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> trimers in four different conformational states. Specifically, we examined states where all three protomers are in either the inward- or outward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), as well as two intermediates where one protomer is inward-facing and the other two are outward-facing, or vice versa. To enable the calculations to reveal long-range perturbations, the simulated membranes are about 50 × 50 nm<sup>2</sup> in size, that is six-fold wider than the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This area translates into ~7500 lipid molecules, much larger than typical simulation systems. In a first set of calculations, therefore, we opted for coarse-grained representation of the molecular system, using the MARTINI forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Monticelli et al., 2008</xref>). The conformational state of the trimer was preserved throughout each of the simulations, while the lipid bilayer was free to adjust to that state. It is worth noting that the elastic properties of lipid bilayers, as quantified by, for example, their macroscopic bending modulus, are well described by MARTINI, despite its inherent approximations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marrink et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiorin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The results of this analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. For the state with all three protomers in the outward-facing conformation, we found the membrane to be only modestly perturbed. This perturbation is maximal in the vicinity of the transport domains, where the membrane mid-plane is elevated by 3–4 Å; near the scaffold, however, the elevation is only ~2 Å. By contrast, for the cases in which one, two or all three transport domains are in the inward-facing state, we observe a major morphological impact on the surrounding membrane. Specifically, we observe that the displacement of the transport domain causes a ~ 10 Å depression in the lipid bilayer, that is, about 50% of the width of its hydrophobic core. This perturbation is also remarkably long-ranged, extending radially for nearly 100 Å from the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Strikingly, however, along the perimeter of the protein, the perturbation is entirely confined to the interface with the transport domain, that is, it is abruptly terminated near the scaffold, where the membrane is again minimally depressed, by only about 1–2 Å. Indeed, comparison of intermediates with one or two protomers in the inward-facing state shows that each transport domain causes an independent perturbation, largely identical and seemingly additive to that caused by the other protomers, while in the vicinity of the scaffold domains the membrane remains largely unperturbed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in membrane morphology induced by the conformational cycle of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>.</title><p>The results are based on coarse-grained MD simulations of the transporter in a POPC bilayer at 298K.

It should also be noted that the observed deflections in the membrane mid-plane do not result from significant differences in lipid-bilayer thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the second-rank order parameter of the lipid alkyl tails, which is a measure of their tilt relative to the membrane perpendicular, also shows little contrast between the outward- and inward-facing conformational states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The only significant difference is observed for the inner leaflet, at the point where the transport domain meets the scaffold, in the inward-facing state.

This effect is, however, localized and does not propagate beyond the perimeter of the scaffold.

Given the large system size of the all-atom simulation system for all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (~3,000,000 atoms), we sought to determine the minimum sampling time required to evaluate whether the membrane deformation induced by the protein in coarse-grained simulations was compatible with this more accurate representation. To this end we constructed a simulation system consisting of a 640-DPPC lipid bilayer (323 K) and ~32,700 TIP3P water molecules, enclosed in a periodic box of ~140 × 140×80 Å. After equilibration, an artificial deflection of the membrane mid-plane was created in this bilayer whose magnitude is comparable to that observed in the simulations of inward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To create this perturbation, lipid molecules inside a cylinder of ~10 Å in radius were progressively displaced perpendicularly to the plane of the membrane by applying a harmonic restraint with a moving center and force constant of 100 kcal/mol Å<sup>−2</sup>. The rate of movement of the restraint center was such that after 50 ns of simulation the vertical deflection was 10 Å; this value was then sustained for 70 ns, using the same restraint, now stationary. An unrestrained simulation of ~200 ns was carried out thereafter to evaluate the persistence or relaxation of the membrane deformation, during which we observed that the membrane relaxed fully within ~150 ns.

The complementary analyses described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> indicate that the membrane adapts to the conformational state of the protein to preclude strongly hydrophilic side chains from penetrating the core of the bilayer, while also avoiding exposure of hydrophobic portions of the protein surface to solvent. The deformed state of the bilayer also appears to be stabilized by numerous hydrogen-bonding interactions between polar and aromatic residues and lipid headgroups. For example, it is apparent that Arg105 and Lys230, which face the extracellular solution in the outward-facing state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), would be fully dehydrated in the inward-facing conformation were it not for the fact that the membrane bends inwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Instead, these residues form highly persistent interactions with the phosphate and ester groups in the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, a large number of hydrophobic residues on the intracellular side of the transport domain would be exposed to solvent if the membrane was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) individual per-residue preferences accumulated across the protein surface add up to very large energetic gains (which, as will be discussed later, are balanced by the resistance of the membrane to be deformed). Notably, this pattern of H-bonding interactions extends to the scaffold, where they appear to help anchor the bilayer in between adjacent transport domains, on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, clear co-evolutionary relationships can be detected across Glt<sub>Ph</sub> homologs for several clusters of membrane-exposed residues that include those engaged in hydrogen-bonding with lipids in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In summary, the changes in membrane morphology induced by the conformational cycle of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> thus appear to be dictated by the displacement of protein interfaces that have evolved to be closely matched with the chemical features of the membrane and the surrounding solvent.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Energetics of solvation and evolutionary conservation of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> lipid interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Molecular systems used to evaluate the change in the free energy of polar/hydrophobic solvation that results from membrane bending, for all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub>.

This observation begs the question: what is the energetic cost of such a deformation? To answer this question precisely is very challenging. As we discuss in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiorin et al., 2019</xref>), most computational strategies to examine the energetics of membrane bending are based upon the Helfrich-Canham theory, which predicts a relationship between curvature and energy dictated by the bending modulus of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canham, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helfrich, 1973</xref>). Although this theory is appropriate for mesoscopic perturbations, it can be inadequate on its own in the length scales that are relevant to membrane protein mechanistic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goetz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brannigan and Brown, 2006</xref>). Hence, a number of variations and extensions of the Helfrich-Canham function have been proposed to account for other possible contributions to the membrane energetics, based on more complex functions of the local bilayer curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brannigan and Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khelashvili et al., 2013</xref>). An alternative route to evaluate membrane perturbations would be to calculate the associated free-energy cost directly from a molecular dynamics simulation, using enhanced-sampling techniques. This type of model-free, microscopic approach has become state-of-the-art in computational studies of other molecular-scale processes such as ion permeation, ligand binding, or protein conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harpole and Delemotte, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flood et al., 2019</xref>), superseding other types of models and theories. The reason why microscopic enhanced-sampling approaches have lagged behind for membranes is the difficulty in formulating appropriate descriptors of the membrane shape and configuration – that is the so-called ‘collective variable’ problem.</p><p>In a recent development, we have reported a novel free-energy simulation strategy to address this problem, which we refer to as Multi-Map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiorin et al., 2019</xref>). The central element of this method is a collective variable that quantifies the similarity between the instantaneous configuration of the lipid membrane and a set of pre-defined density distributions mapped onto a 3D grid. Biased exploration of this Multi-Map variable, for example using umbrella-sampling simulations, not only transforms the bilayer shape as dictated by the set of target density distributions, but also permits derivation of the corresponding potential-of-mean-force. What, then, is the free-energy cost of the membrane deformations induced by inward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub>?</p><p>To evaluate this cost, we devised a Multi-Map calculation whereby a lipid membrane is driven to deform in a manner that mimics the perturbation caused by Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, but in the absence of the protein. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, we show 2D representations of three membrane configurations sampled by this enhanced-simulation methodology. The simulations also sample configurations for which the amplitude of the membrane perturbations is greater and smaller than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, that is larger and smaller values of the Multi-Map variable. The corresponding potential-of-mean-force curve, that is, the free-energy change as a function of the deformation amplitude, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. From comparison of this data with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it can be inferred that the cost of the membrane perturbation induced by all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> is on the order of 20 kcal/mol in total, or 6–7 kcal/mol per protomer. (This value was obtained in the absence of membrane tension; under membrane tension, the cost would be greater, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, but the extent of the deformation is smaller, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.) Clearly, this energetic penalty is sizable; as noted above, however, energetic gains that result from polar and hydrophobic solvation of the protein surface when the membrane is deformed are comparable in magnitude, if not greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At any rate, this analysis shows that the morphological preference of the membrane is a major contributor to the free-energy landscape of this transporter; it specifically and strongly opposes the inward-facing state, and so must be counterbalanced by other free-energy contributions for the transporter to carry out its structural mechanism.

Strikingly, this perturbation is abruptly suppressed at the point where the bilayer meets the trimerization domain; therefore, each protomer induces an independent deformation, consistent with existing experimental evidence demonstrating no protomer-protomer cooperativity in this class of transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grewer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch and Larsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erkens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>).

To balance out this cost, therefore, the inward-facing conformation must somehow recoup this energy, through distinct protein-protein, protein-lipid and/or protein-water interactions. Admittedly, at this point we can only infer the magnitude of free-energy penalty from simulations where the Multi-Map method mimics the impact of the protein on the membrane. While imperfect, it is worth underscoring the technical breakthrough made by this approach: it provides a means to estimate the membrane energetics directly from simulated molecular-dynamics trajectories, without a priori theoretical assumptions. Thus, we believe that further methodological developments and systematic applications of this methodology, in combination with other enhanced-sampling techniques, will result in increasingly precise estimates, and will also enable us to dissect the compensating interactions that must occur in this and other membrane-protein systems. These caveats notwithstanding, we believe our estimate of the free-energy penalty of membrane bending not to be at all unrealistic. For example, based on electrophysiological studies of the gating mechanism of the <italic>Shaker</italic> voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, it has been deduced that at zero membrane potential the conformational free-energy of the open state is about 15 kcal/mol lower than that of the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chowdhury and Chanda, 2012</xref>). Similarly, a value of 16 kcal/mol was deduced for the Na<sup>+</sup>-channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chowdhury and Chanda, 2012</xref>). Regardless of the specifics, this study underscores that the configurational energetics of the lipid bilayer are non-negligible and must therefore be incorporated into the conceptual models and theories used to describe membrane-protein mechanisms – much in the same way one would consider, for example, the dehydration energetics of different ions (also in the order of tens of kcal/mol) when rationalizing the selectivity or conductance rates of a channel protein. It is hoped, therefore, that the calculations presented here will spur further biophysical studies designed to assess the impact of bilayer composition and morphology on the energetics of transporters – in analogy with research other membrane proteins such as receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Chawla, 2017</xref>) and channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen, 2013</xref>). For example, it would be of interest to dissect how the functional dynamics of a transporter such as Glt<sub>Ph</sub> are influenced by the amino-acid make-up of the protein-lipid interface, as well as by lipid bilayer composition. Indeed, functional studies have shown that subtle lipid modifications (methylation) and single-point mutations (Tyr33) have detectable effects on the rates of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McIlwain et al., 2015</xref>). It is also intriguing that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) modulate the activity of neuronal EAAT transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerangue et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fairman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tzingounis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grintal et al., 2009</xref>) and are also known to influence the bending energetics of lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordero-Morales and Vásquez, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The aforementioned smFRET studies have also indicated that the balance of outward- and inward-facing states hardly differs when measured in liposomes (containing mostly PE, PG and PC lipids) or in DDM micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together with our findings, this observation challenges the notion that detergent micelles have no distinct morphological preference and will comply to the conformation of a protein at little or no energetic cost. To the contrary, when a detergent solution is concentrated above a certain threshold, the micelles that form have an inherently preferred geometry and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lipfert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oliver et al., 2013</xref>), that is, there exists a well-defined free-energy minimum of micelle formation. When a micelle assembles around a protein, one might expect that free-energy minimum to naturally shift, that is, the micelle morphology will adapt to the volume and surface of the protein. However, this adaption is not necessarily identical for all conformations of a protein; indeed, one might expect that different free-energy minima will exist for alternative structural states (both in magnitude and morphology), and that this difference in will be greater for some detergents than for others. The expectation that the deformation of a micelle entails little or no energetic cost is even less intuitive if one assumes that the micelle does not reassemble when a protein changes structure. Indeed, the above-mentioned cryo-EM data for nhTMEM16 shows that a highly localized feature of the protein surface causes nearly identical morphological changes in a lipid nanodisc and in a DDM micelle, namely a perturbation that gradually decays along the protein perimeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>). If the DDM micelle was indeed much softer or more compliant than the lipid nanodisc, the resulting curvature would be more localized. Thus, on this matter too we believe our data highlights the need for further work probing how the thermodynamics of micellar or lipid solvation might depend on the conformational state of a protein, or on its oligomerization state.</p><p>The dynamics of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> at the single-molecule level have also been evaluated using high-speed AFM measurements in protein-dense 2D preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>). These elegant measurements clearly confirmed that each protomer exchanges between outward- and inward-facing states stochastically (provided the adequate occupancy state) and independently from each other. Intriguingly, though, in these measurements the population ratio between outward- and inward-facing is shifted significantly against the latter, by about 5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heath and Scheuring, 2019</xref>). A possible explanation for the discrepancy between the smFRET and AFM measurements is that the curvature of the outside-out proteoliposomes used in the former experiment favors the inward-facing state, while the flat membranes in the latter do not. However, our finding that the membrane perturbation caused by Glt<sub>Ph</sub> projects away from the protein surface for several nanometers provides an alternative explanation: transition to the inward-facing state would be more energetically costly when this deformation must occur in a more confined space. In other words, it is conceivable that the aforementioned balance between large, competing energetic contributions is altered as a result of molecular crowding, in this case favoring the outward-facing conformation. Interestingly, some members of the EAAT family are expressed in the membranes of certain cell types at very high densities (in the order of thousands of transporters per square-micron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danbolt, 2001</xref>]), raising the possibility that crowding effects occur in physiological settings. On a related, more technical note, it is worth noting that molecular simulation studies aiming to evaluate the alternating-access mechanism and protein-lipid interplay for cases such as Glt<sub>Ph</sub> might be significantly skewed by finite-size effects if the lipid bilayer patch is not sufficiently large to accommodate the full range of the membrane perturbation created by the protein.</p><p>Large-scale structural changes are not exclusive to membrane proteins in the EAAT superfamily. Elevator-like secondary-active transporters are, however, appealing model systems to evaluate the interplay between proteins and the lipid bilayer, given the range of their motions and that these motions occur spontaneously and, in some cases, on time-scales amenable to single-molecule measurements like smFRET or high-speed AFM. As an example of another elevator-like mechanism, an initial analysis of the bacterial sodium-dicarboxylate symporter VcINDY is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. VcINDY is a dimer, but is similar to Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in that each of the constituent protomers features two distinct domains, one facilitating dimerization and the other responsible for substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mancusso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mulligan et al., 2016</xref>). Our simulations show that upon transition from the (predicted) outward-facing state to the (experimentally determined) inward-facing conformation, the transport domains would induce a deformation in the membrane that is comparable to that observed for Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. Again, this deformation is suppressed by the scaffold, suggesting that the protomers function independently. Despite the commonalities between Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and VcINDY, however, it is important to note that other elevator-like transporters, perhaps even those in the same structural family, might influence the membrane differently, as this interplay is ultimately determined by the amino-acid make-up of the protein surface. For example, it is entirely possible that, in some cases, the outward-facing state perturbs the membrane the most. To document and dissect this variability is no doubt of interest and will be the focus of future studies.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Membrane deformation induced by the Na<sup>+</sup>-dicarboxylate symporter VcINDY, based on coarse-grained MD simulations in POPC at 298 K.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the VcINDY dimer in the outward-facing state, viewed along the membrane perpendicular from the extracellular space.

Needless to say, numerous channels and transporters also undergo major conformational changes during function, which might impact the membrane to varying degrees. The computational analysis presented here makes it clear that the inherent configurational energetics of the lipid bilayer can be both non-negligible and markedly state-dependent, and must therefore be integrated in our conceptualizations of membrane protein mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Coarse-grained simulations of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> trimers and VcINDY dimers</title><p>Four different conformational states of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transporter were simulated using a coarse-grained (CG) representation of the protein and its environment, using the MARTINI 2.1 forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>). Symmetric trimers of outward- and inward-facing conformers were obtained from X-ray crystal structures (PDB 2NWL and 3KBC, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). These differ primarily in the position of the transport domains (defined here as residues 74–129 and 223–416), relative to the central oligomerization domain, or scaffold (residues 6–73 and 120–222). Two asymmetric trimers were also considered, combining two outward- and one inward-facing protomer, or two inward- and one outward-facing protomer. These intermediates were constructed by superposing the scaffold domain of individual protomers from the inward-facing structure onto the trimer with all protomers outward-facing. All four states of the transporter were embedded in a hydrated bilayer of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipids, to evaluate the morphological adaption of the membrane to the protein conformation. The conformation of each state was maintained throughout the simulations by applying a network of harmonic distance restraints to a pre-defined set of pairs of non-bonded protein atoms. This set comprises all pairs of backbone atoms separated by a distance between 5 and 9 Å; the force constant of these elastic restraints is 1.2 kcal/mol Å<sup>−2</sup>. The protein-membrane systems include ~7500 lipids and ~170,000 solvent molecules, for a total of ~260,000 particles. The dimensions of the simulation systems are approximately 500 × 500 × 120 Å. Counter-ions were added to the solvent to neutralize the total charge of all molecular systems.</p><p>All CG simulations were carried out using GROMACS 4.5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hess et al., 2008</xref>), with a 10-fs integration time-step.

Analogous, triplicated simulations of 600 ns were also carried out for all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in a bilayer of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) lipids at 323 K; in a mixed bilayer of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) lipids and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG) lipids in a 2:1 ratio, at 298K; and in a bilayer of POPE lipids, also at 298 K. Triplicated simulations of 600 ns were also carried out for all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in POPC at 298 K under applied membrane tensions of 1, 5 and 10 mN/m.

Specifically, we chose those snapshots in which the instantaneous shape of the membrane mid-plane showed the lowest RMS deviation from the shape calculated by averaging all trajectory data for this all-inward state. Using an all-atom model of the protein derived from the crystal structure (PDB 3KBC), the surrounding (coarse-grained) membrane and solvent were transformed into an all-atom representation as prescribed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wassenaar et al., 2014</xref>), and equilibrated through a series of simulations implementing positional restraints.

The simulations were carried out at constant temperature (323 K), using a Langevin thermostat, and constant semi-isotropic pressure (one atm), using the Nosé-Hoover-Langevin barostat, with periodic boundaries. The integration time-step was 2 fs. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle-Mesh Ewald with a real space cut-off of 12 Å.

To this end, a set of 10 three-dimensional density maps that idealize this deformation but vary in its amplitude were generated and used to define the so-called Multi-Map coordinate ξ. This variable quantifies the similarity between any instantaneous configuration of the membrane and each of the density maps in the target set. Biased-sampling of the Multi-Map coordinate ξ thus perturbs the membrane as dictated by the set of target maps and permits a derivation of the corresponding free-energy cost as a function of the deformation amplitude, that is, the potential of mean force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiorin et al., 2019</xref>). This technique was applied to a CG bilayer of 1,800 POPC molecules (side length of approx. 230 Å), using a developmental version of NAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) and analogous pressure and temperature conditions as those specified above. Umbrella-sampling was employed as the biasing method; the target range in ξ was divided into 61 windows, and 18 simulations of 1 μs each were carried out to sample ξ in each window. The PMF was calculated on the basis of the resulting time-series of ξ, using the WHAM method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 1992</xref>).

This transporter, that typifies the 'elevator mechanism', undergoes particularly large conformational changes upon substrate transport; the transition between the outward-facing and inward-facing conformations involves a 15 Ang motion of the transport domain with respect to the stationary domain of the protein. The simulations suggest that this transition radically perturbs the lipid bilayer, which is expected. However, very surprisingly, it leads to a large free energy penalty of about 20 kcal/mol (which of course needs to be balanced by internal components of the free energy).</p><p>Opinion:</p><p>The manuscript addresses a fundamental and very interesting question in membrane biophysics. In this respect it is very suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The problem is that it is unclear how trustworthy this large estimate is. The following suggestions may increase the credibility of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in-plane distributions of the membrane deformations predicted by the simulations are inaccessible for experimental verifications. Moreover, the character of these deformations (types of strains in the case of 3D description or bending/stretching/chain tilting for a 2D description of the membrane) is not determined.</p><p>2) &quot;In a recent breakthrough, we have developed and validated a promising free-energy simulation strategy to address this problem, which we refer to as Multi-Map (Fiorin, 2019)&quot;. The Fiorin paper is not in review here so we will not comment about it in detail. However, the draft that is included does not consolidate this bold statement. To our understanding it shows that the new formalism converges to the Helfrich-Canham theory and agrees with measurements at long distances (100Ang and more), as it should. However, we did not see any comparison regarding short distances which are relevant here. This statement should be removed.</p><p>3) The authors dismiss the Helfrich-Canham theory and its extensions, arguing that they do not hold for short distances. And yet, it would be insightful for the reader to know what values this approximate model and its extensions give for GltPh. At the very least it would indicate how high the 20 kcal/mol value is compared to existing theory.</p><p>4) The derived energies of the membrane deformations, which could be indeed important for understanding the effects of the membrane lipid composition on the protein function, are not supported by any independent estimations and remain, therefore, completely dependent on the parameters of the computational model (forcefield parameters), and other details of the simulations. The authors should admit to it or provide experimental measurements.</p><p>5) No analysis is provided either of the effects of membrane tension, which may dramatically change the protein-mediated deformations and their distribution, or of the presence in the membrane of specific lipids such as cholesterol, PIPs, DAGs, etc, whose redistribution to the protein vicinity may moderate the elastic energy. This decreases the general impact of the results.</p><p>6) Evidently, the authors are aware of the exceedingly high energy penalty due to lipid perturbation and try to explain it in Discussion. However, the arguments raised are not compelling. Thus, the tune of the manuscript should reflect the fact that all we have here is a computation that may or may not be correct.</p><p>7) Introduction, third paragraph: The question is nicely set between (1) &quot;moving polar sidechains on their surface into the bilayer interior and exposing hydrophobic ones to the solvent&quot; and (2) &quot;the morphology of the lipid bilayer could adapt to the conformational state of the protein, and match the amino-acid make-up of the protein surface&quot;. The authors obviously come to the conclusion that the latter (2) is the case. However, at a considerable (20kcal/mol) cost. Given that the structure of all conformations are known, the authors should provide an estimate of the energetic cost for the rejected hypothesis (1).</p><p>The simulations:</p><p>8) The boundary conditions imposed on the membrane fragment are not specified. At the same time, in the absence of membrane tension, which seems to be the case here, the effects of the boundary conditions might be substantial.</p><p>9) The method is based on combining coarse-grained and all-atom simulations, which can be tricky. In particular, for the all-atom simulations, the authors take the course-grained system they simulated and convert it to all-atom, while also (naturally) changing force-fields. Then they let the system relax and report that the trends observed are consistent with the course-grain simulations. It is theoretically possible that transitioning the system from the course-grained to the all-atom parameters is not that trivial, and maybe the fact that they start from an already equilibrated state introduces some bias. Could it be examined somehow?</p><p>10) It is unfortunate that DPPC (transition temperature 41C) was chosen for many simulations. Why?

They note that the smFRET studies displayed almost zero energy difference between the states. In contrast the HS-AFM study revealed that the inward facing state indeed was the high energy state (like here). The authors mention that the HS-AFM study was performed in rather densely packed membrane where no such long range lipid relaxations are possible as in the study here, yet it is a flat membrane. In this context, it is also noticeable that the smFRET studies are performed either in detergent or on transporters in small vesicles that are tethered in outside-out configuration only – which goes against the bowl-shaped structure of GltPh – of which the authors see the preference for membrane bending in Figure 1 (side view), which might favor the adoption of the inward-facing state in the smFRET experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50576.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Opinion:</p><p>The manuscript addresses a fundamental and very interesting question in membrane biophysics. In this respect it is very suitable for publication in eLife. The problem is that it is unclear how trustworthy this large estimate is. The following suggestions may increase the credibility of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the editor’s remarks in regard to the broad significance of the subject of our study, and are thankful to all reviewers for their suggestions and constructive criticisms. We trust that the new data and clarifications provided in the revised manuscript will address the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p>For the record, however, we believe it is important to clarify that our analysis of the extent of the membrane perturbations induced by Glt<sub>Ph</sub> did not involve the use of a new enhanced sampling simulation method, as the Summary states. This component of the study, which has been substantially modified and expanded in the revision, entailed standard simulation methods, in different conditions and using both coarse-grained and all-atom forcefields – the latter being particularly challenging due to the very large size of the system. The new enhanced-sampling methodology mentioned in the Summary, now published in J Comp Chem, was used only to estimate the energetic cost of this perturbation. This second component has also been expanded in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in-plane distributions of the membrane deformations predicted by the simulations are inaccessible for experimental verifications. Moreover, the character of these deformations (types of strains in the case of 3D description or bending/stretching/chain tilting for a 2D description of the membrane) is not determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that by in-plane distributions the reviewer refers to the two-dimensional representations of the deflection (depression/elevation) of the membrane mid-plane. We believe this kind of representation is important as it quantifies what is observed in the simulations, which in turn permits comparison of different conditions and conformational states. In order to facilitate a direct comparison with experiment, however, we also provided three-dimensional distributions (Figure 2, Figure 5, Video 1 and Video 2, Figure 8) of the lipid density around the protein – for both Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and VcINDY. We believe that in time it will be possible to directly contrast this data with three-dimensional density maps derived from single-particle cryo-EM imaging of these transporters reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs – as has been possible for other membrane proteins.</p><p>With regard to the character of the deformation induced by all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, additional figures have been provided to underscore that the impact of the protein is primarily a change in the curvature of both membrane leaflets, as originally stated. Specifically, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows that the thickness of the membrane is, relatively speaking, influenced only minimally, both in terms of magnitude and range. Figure 4—figure supplement 2 reiterates the observation made in the original version that a significant change in alkyl-chain tilt (as quantified by the second-rank order parameter) is observed only in the inner leaflet, and only at the interface between the membrane and the scaffold. By contrast, the alkyl-chain tilt along the periphery of the transport domain, where the membrane is most significantly depressed, is essentially bulk-like. This data correlates with what can be inferred from the graphical 3D representations of lipid density in Figure 2, Figure 5, and Video 1and Video 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;In a recent breakthrough, we have developed and validated a promising free-energy simulation strategy to address this problem, which we refer to as Multi-Map (Fiorin, 2019)&quot;. The Fiorin paper is not in review here so we will not comment about it in detail. However, the draft that is included does not consolidate this bold statement. To our understanding it shows that the new formalism converges to the Helfrich-Canham theory and agrees with measurements at long distances (100Ang and more), as it should. However, we did not see any comparison regarding short distances which are relevant here. This statement should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have no objection to rephrasing this statement to make it strictly factual: “In a recent development, we have reported a novel free-energy simulation strategy to address this problem, which we refer to as Multi-Map (Fiorin, 2019).”</p><p>We must note, however, that in this context the term “validation” refers to the fact we established the correctness of the enhanced-sampling algorithm, i.e., that it reproduces the expected thermodynamic ensemble, the target membrane morphology, and the mean forces along the biased collective variable from which the free energy is derived.</p><p>One way in which the proposed method was validated (as defined above) was by comparing it with unbiased-sampling simulations, for a problem that is fully quantifiable through both approaches (the free-energy of hydration of a hydrophobic cavity). In addition, the draft of Fiorin et al., enclosed with the original submission of the current article did include a comparison of calculated and measured bending moduli for small bilayers of different lipid types, in the presence and absence of cholesterol. Because experiments and computations probe very different length scales, what was evaluated is the relative change in this bending modulus upon addition of cholesterol. The results of this analysis were positive for the lipid types for which the experimental data is uncontroversial (POPC and DMPC). Thus, at least in regard to the effect of cholesterol on membrane rigidity of small lipid bilayers, the computational Multi-Map method performs no worse than existing experimental techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors dismiss the Helfrich-Canham theory and its extensions, arguing that they do not hold for short distances. And yet, it would be insightful for the reader to know what values this approximate model and its extensions give for GltPh. At the very least it would indicate how high the 20 kcal/mol value is compared to existing theory.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not argued, here or elsewhere, that extensions to the Helfrich-Canham theory do not hold for small wave-length deformations, nor have we dismissed them. To the contrary, in Fiorin et al., we discuss how these extensions address the known limitations of the Helfrich-Canham model (described by us and others before us), in some cases quite elegantly. We have however argued that an alternative, direct PMF approach is advantageous as it does not entail important ad hoc assumptions (e.g. a bending modulus, a homogenous membrane, etc.) and avoids ill-defined methodological choices (as discussed below). In any case, it is beyond our specific expertise to carry out a systematic comparison of the multiple variations and extensions of the Helfrich-Canham functional that have been formulated over the years. As per <italic>eLife</italic>’s editorial policy, we believe this request is outside the scope of this revision.</p><p>Using our own simulation data, however, it is relatively straightforward to illustrate why an alternative to the Helfrich-Canham approach is advantageous. In the newly provided Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, we compare free-energy curves calculated with the direct PMF method (Figure 7) with 3 alternative results deduced from the Helfrich-Canham equation, for the same set of molecular configurations (i.e. for each of the umbrella-sampling simulations carried out to calculate the PMF). The two inputs for the calculation of the Helfrich-Canham energy are the assumed bending modulus (here we use <italic>k</italic><sub>c</sub> = 18 kcal/mol, standard for POPC) and the membrane curvature distribution across the bilayer plane, <italic>c(x,y</italic>). We evaluate this curvature distribution from analysis of the average mid-plane in from each umbrella-sampling simulation (18 μs per window) – see Materials and methods section. The Helfrich-Canham energy is then obtained by integrating the energy density [0.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>c</sub><italic>c</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>x,y</italic>)] over the area of the membrane. The three calculations in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A use the same value of the bending modulus, but differ in the level of resolution used to probe <italic>c(x,y</italic>). Linear regressions of the data in each case show that the Helfrich energy can be much larger, similar or somewhat smaller depending on the resolution with which the average local curvature of the membrane is evaluated. Needless to say, a smaller or larger value of the bending modulus might improve this correlation for a given resolution, but make it worse for another. Nevertheless, it seems clear that there is no reasonable choice of either <italic>k</italic><sub>c</sub> or the curvature-map resolution that would lead to Helfrich energies that are, say, 2-fold smaller than those we calculate with the Multi-Map method. The opposite is however true, i.e. Helfrich energies that are significantly larger than those deduced with a direct PMF method can be easily envisaged. In sum, going back to reviewers’ point, the 20 kcal/mol value reported in the manuscript is no larger than what would be reasonably inferred from non-microscopic theories of membrane energetics.</p><p>As illustrated in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, a rigorous evaluation of the local membrane curvature <italic>c(x,y</italic>) is itself challenging and prone to large statistical errors despite extensive simulation time (18 μs per point, split in 1-μs fragments). Thus, when comparing RMS-curvatures across the bilayer obtained at different resolutions, the expected correlation is degraded at moderate to low curvature values. These ambiguities involved in extracting membrane curvature from molecular configurations further highlight the value of direct PMF calculations, of the kind now made possible by the Multi-Map method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The derived energies of the membrane deformations, which could be indeed important for understanding the effects of the membrane lipid composition on the protein function, are not supported by any independent estimations and remain, therefore, completely dependent on the parameters of the computational model (forcefield parameters), and other details of the simulations. The authors should admit to it or provide experimental measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, evidently, that the results from any computer simulation or theoretical analysis are hypothetical until proven by experiment. This point has been clarified in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) No analysis is provided either of the effects of membrane tension, which may dramatically change the protein-mediated deformations and their distribution, or of the presence in the membrane of specific lipids such as cholesterol, PIPs, DAGs, etc, whose redistribution to the protein vicinity may moderate the elastic energy. This decreases the general impact of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to discuss in detail the effect of membrane tension and membrane composition, as this is a recurrent question. As shown in the newly provided Figure 3, tensions of increasing magnitude do not dramatically change the nature of the deformations induced by all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. At the structural level, the effect of increased membrane tension is to gradually reduce the magnitude of the depression induced by the transport domains. Nevertheless, this perturbation is discernable even when the applied membrane tension is as high as 10 mN/m. It is important to note, however, that the energetic cost of the membrane deformation induced by Glt<sub>Ph</sub> increases under membrane tension, as we show in the revised version of Figure 7B. Thus, while the amplitude of the perturbation caused by the transporter would be somewhat diminished if the membrane was under tension, the resulting energetic cost might be comparable to (or greater than) a condition where the membrane is not under tension.</p><p>With regard to the effect of lipid composition, we now compare 4 different conditions, namely POPC, POPE and 2:1 POPE-POPG at 298 K and DPPC at 323 K. Albeit simplified, we would argue these model membranes are not entirely unlike the conditions that have been probed in published liposome reconstitutions. As shown in Figure 4, the nature of the deformations induced by all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> is not dramatically changed by different lipid compositions either.</p><p>The notion that the functional regulation of membrane proteins by specific lipids (PIP2, cholesterol, etc) might be in part due to changes in the energetics of membrane plasticity is indeed an intriguing possibility, which we are currently pursuing for other systems where systematic experimental analyses have been conducted. We are unaware of such data for Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and thus we believe that addressing this question is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Evidently, the authors are aware of the exceedingly high energy penalty due to lipid perturbation and try to explain it in Discussion. However, the arguments raised are not compelling. Thus, the tune of the manuscript should reflect the fact that all we have here is a computation that may or may not be correct.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to points 4 and point 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Introduction, third paragraph: The question is nicely set between (1) &quot;moving polar sidechains on their surface into the bilayer interior and exposing hydrophobic ones to the solvent&quot; and (2) &quot;the morphology of the lipid bilayer could adapt to the conformational state of the protein, and match the amino-acid make-up of the protein surface&quot;. The authors obviously come to the conclusion that the latter (2) is the case. However, at a considerable (20kcal/mol) cost. Given that the structure of all conformations are known, the authors should provide an estimate of the energetic cost for the rejected hypothesis (1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, as this analysis enables us to quantify our claim that the cost of membrane bending is considerable smaller than the cost of the alternative (rejected) hypothesis.</p><p>This analysis is summarized in the newly provided Figure 6, for an equilibrated simulation snapshot of all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, and in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 for the crystal structure. The question that we pose is: what would be the hypothetical free-energy gain/cost of preserving a flat membrane when the transporter is in the all-inward state? To estimate this cost, we considered the two membrane configurations described in the figure – one deformed, as in our simulation, and a version thereof that has the same thickness but flat. (By ‘membrane’, we refer to the solvent-excluded region of the bilayer.) We then calculated the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) for all protein residues in either case. The difference, i.e. ΔSASA, was then normalized by the SASA of each residue-type when fully solvent-exposed in a Gly-X-Gly peptide. The resulting ‘dehydration factor’ was then multiplied by the transfer free-energy of that residue type into the membrane, according to two independent hydrophobicity scales: one based on experimental measurements of the stability of WT and mutagenized OMPLA, published by Karen Fleming; and another published by Peter Tieleman, based on MD simulations.</p><p>Taken together, these results underscore how strikingly unfavorable it would be for the membrane to remain flat when the transport domains adopt the inward facing state. Small energy penalties from a large number of residues add up to very large totals – specifically about 30 kcal/mol for the Fleming scale and about 50 kcal/mol for the Tieleman scale. As originally stated, these penalties result from either exposing polar sidechains to the bilayer interior (R105, K230), or from exposing hydrophobic sidechains to the solvent; indeed, more than a dozen hydrophobic residues disfavor the flat membrane by 1 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> or more, each. As one might expect, the polar residues that contribute the most are on the extracellular side of the transport domains, while the hydrophobic groups are on the intracellular side. A few hydrophobic residues on the extracellular side favor the flat membrane, but their total contribution is comparatively much smaller than the energetic penalty that opposes it.</p><p>It should be noted that, by definition, this ‘transfer free-energy’ examines the energetics of hydration/dehydration, neglecting the stabilizing effect of the hydrogen-bonding interactions between polar sidechains and the lipid headgroups described in Figure 5; many of these lipid contacts would be unfeasible if the membrane was flat, and would be replaced by water, penalizing this hypothetical state further.</p><p>In summary, the adaptation of the membrane to the conformational state of the transporter, while clearly costly, is nevertheless much more favorable than the alternative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The simulations:</p><p>8) The boundary conditions imposed on the membrane fragment are not specified. At the same time, in the absence of membrane tension, which seems to be the case here, the effects of the boundary conditions might be substantial.</p></disp-quote><p>The boundary conditions are now specified in the Materials and methods section, i.e., semi-isotropic pressure coupling and periodic boundary conditions. As mentioned, simulations are now presented with and without applied membrane tension. See Figure 3 and our response to point 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The method is based on combining coarse-grained and all-atom simulations, which can be tricky. In particular, for the all-atom simulations, the authors take the course-grained system they simulated and convert it to all-atom, while also (naturally) changing force-fields. Then they let the system relax and report that the trends observed are consistent with the course-grain simulations. It is theoretically possible that transitioning the system from the course-grained to the all-atom parameters is not that trivial, and maybe the fact that they start from an already equilibrated state introduces some bias. Could it be examined somehow?</p></disp-quote><p>This possibility was examined in the original submission, specifically in Figure 5—figure supplement 1AB (Formerly Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In this calculation, a perturbation of magnitude comparable to that induced by Glt<sub>Ph</sub> is created in an all-atom lipid bilayer and allowed to relax over time. The perturbation dissipates well within 100 ns, which is shorter than the length of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> all-atom simulations.</p><p>In the revised version of the article, we further examine this question by quantifying the degree to which lipid molecules exchange between the first solvation shells around the protein and the rest of the membrane in the course of our 3 all-atom simulations of all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. As shown in the newly-provided Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, we find that, by the end of the simulation, about 30% of the lipids that are initially in these first solvation shells are replaced by other lipid molecules from further away from the protein – with the overall lipid number in each shell approximately constant. These exchanges would permit a change in membrane morphology, if the such change was favorable. The fact that the membrane remains deformed, despite the results from these two control calculations, suggests that this deformation is the preferred state of the molecular system, and not an artifact of the coarse-grained forcefield, preserved at the all-atom level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is unfortunate that DPPC (transition temperature 41C) was chosen for many simulations. Why? Also, simulations using POPC (transition temperature -2C) are shown. The fact that the results are quasi identical seems rather worrying than comforting. Why these choices? Why not using a mixture, it is not unthinkable that in a mixture the protein would recruit specific lipids on these interfaces between transporter and scaffold domains. Please comment. Or, better, examine in simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we did not observe a phase transition in any of our original simulations, we recognize that the use of DPPC near the (coarse-grained) transition temperature is a concern. To address this concern, we have repeated all the coarse-grained simulations using different conditions. Specifically, we repeated the triplicated simulations of all-outward, one-inward, two-inward, and all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> using POPC at 298 K, and show the results in Figure 2. We also carried out triplicated simulations of all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in POPE and in a 2:1 POPE:POPG mixture at 298 K, as well as in DPPC at 323 K, i.e., well above the transition temperature. The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 4. The triplicated simulations of VcINDY, in all-outward and all-inward conformations were also repeated using POPC at 298 K, and the results shown in Figure 8. Taken together, these new simulation data convey that the effects we describe are not critically dependent on variations in the lipid composition of the membrane.

This does not change anything to the results in terms of local deformation, right? Is the bilayer held in place at the periphery of the simulation box?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this point in the revised version.</p><p>The Z-coordinate of the membrane mid-plane is obtained from an average over all snapshots collected in a given simulation. The protein starts perfectly centered in the membrane, but in the course of a simulation it tumbles and rotates freely (and the membrane, which is initially flat, adapts accordingly). To analyze the simulation data, therefore, all snapshots must be first transformed so that the center-of-mass and orientation of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> trimer are consistent across the data set. To do so, all atomic coordinates (protein, membrane, solvent) are roto-translated equally, in a manner that results in an optimal (least-squares) fitting of the protein backbone. Note that this transformation does not alter in any way the relative coordinates of the atoms in the molecular system. Through this procedure, the membrane shape is defined with good precision in the vicinity of the protein. Conversely, at the edges of the simulated membrane patch, this procedure leads to large “apparent” fluctuations and an ill-defined average. Nevertheless, with extensive sampling it becomes possible to define a 0-level with confidence, i.e. a broad region far from the protein where the membrane is flat on average, and where the “apparent” fluctuations induced by the analysis process are small. In our case, that 0-level is about ~200 Å from the protein center.</p><p>The original version of Figure 5A (formerly 3A) was a close-up view of the membrane close to the protein – hence this 0-level wasn’t clear. To avoid confusion, in the new version we zoom out and present the data exactly as for the coarse-grained simulations in Figure 2. As mentioned, the 0-level becomes clear at about 200 Å from the protein center.</p><p>The membrane is not held in place, anywhere along the periphery of the system, or elsewhere. The perturbation caused by the transporter does however decay naturally away from the protein surface and so the membrane does indeed become flat, as it should. That is the region where the 0-level is set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Further on this: Why is the scaffold domain considered the 'anchor'? Why does the membrane next to the transporter domains (that are in the inward (down) orientation) move down, rather than the scaffold domain moving upwards? Overall – after sufficiently long relaxation of the all-inward structure – shouldn't the overall level of the membrane remain 0 and the membrane next to the transporter domains shift downwards, but the membrane next to the scaffold domains shift upwards? Especially, in light of Figure 3C, which seems to show that there are many more key amino acids in the transporter than in the scaffold domain, one would expect that the transport domain dominates the relative motion. It is unclear how in panels like Figure 2A left, 2A right, Figure 3A, all membrane deformation values can be positive or negative? Is this the reason why such huge energy penalties result from the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, the 0-level can be defined reliably at about 200 Å from the center of the protein, which is about 150 Å from its surface. Relative to this 0-level, the change in the membrane mid-plane is much smaller at the interface with the scaffold domain than at the interface with the transport domains (see 1D profiles in Figure 2D, formerly Figure 3C). The relative change in this mid-plane when comparing all-outward to all-inward is also much larger for the transport domains. Therefore, it seems logical to think of the scaffold domain as the ‘anchor’. As noted, however, the scaffold isn’t entirely stationary. Comparing the all-outward with the all-inward state, we detect a small net displacement inwards and the transport domains move inwards too. However, we certainly do not observe an upwards displacement, relative to the 0-level. [Of course, one could arbitrarily redefine the 0-level so that the membrane mid-plane appears unperturbed at the transport domain, but that 0-level would not be consistent with the lipid bilayer further from the protein.]</p><p>Ultimately, the geometry of the membrane and the position of the protein therein is determined by a complex free-energy function that, as we argue, includes the conformational preference of the membrane itself and not only a protein-centric perspective. The geometry described by the reviewer for all-inward Glt<sub>Ph</sub> seems entirely plausible a priori (i.e., the membrane is elevated near the scaffold domain and approximately balances out the opposite perturbation caused the transport domains), but in our view is not more intuitive than other alternatives. Arguably, the purpose of molecular simulations such as those presented in our article is precisely to investigate complex, multi-component problems such as this – notwithstanding the caveat in point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Discussion section: The authors find a large energetic penalty for the inward facing state due to membrane deformation.
