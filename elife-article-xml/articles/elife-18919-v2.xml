structure. However, systematic screening for epigenetic regulators is challenging and often relies on laborious assays or indirect reporter read-outs. Here we describe a strategy, Epi-ID, to directly assess chromatin status in thousands of mutants. In Epi-ID, chromatin status on DNA barcodes is interrogated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing, allowing for quantitative comparison of many mutants in parallel. Screening of a barcoded yeast knock-out collection for regulators of histone H3K79 methylation by Dot1 identified all known regulators as well as novel players and processes. These include histone deposition, homologous recombination, and adenosine kinase, which influences the methionine cycle. Gcn5, the acetyltransferase within the SAGA complex, was found to regulate histone methylation and H2B ubiquitination. The concept of Epi-ID is widely applicable and can be readily applied to other chromatin features.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18919.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18919.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18919.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To fit into the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (which include plant, animal and yeast cells), DNA wraps around histone proteins to form a structure called chromatin. Histones can be modified by a variety of chemical tags, which affect how easily nearby DNA can be accessed by other molecules in the cell. These modifications therefore help to control the activity of the genes encoded in the DNA and other key processes such as DNA repair.</p><p>If histone modifications are not regulated correctly, diseases such as cancer may result. Enzymes generally perform the actual modification, but there is another layer of regulation that controls the activity of these enzymes that not much is known about.</p><p>The activity of an enzyme that performs a histone modification known as H3K79 methylation (which involves a methyl chemical group being added to a particular region of a particular histone protein) has been linked to some forms of leukemia. Collections of mutant yeast cells can be used to identify the factors that regulate histone modifications in both yeast and human cells. However, current methods that screen for these regulators are time consuming.</p><p>To make the search for histone modification regulators more efficient, Vlaming et al. developed a new screening procedure called Epi-ID that can measure the amount of a specific histone modification in thousands of budding yeast mutants at the same time. In Epi-ID, each mutant yeast cell has a unique DNA sequence, or âbarcodeâ. The mutant cells are mixed together and the barcodes that are modified by a particular histone modification â such as H3K79 methylation â are isolated and then counted using a DNA sequencing technique. A high barcode count of a certain mutant indicates that more of the histone modification occurs in that mutant.</p><p>Using Epi-ID to survey H3K79 methylation enabled Vlaming et al. to successfully identify all previously known H3K79 methylation regulators, as well several new ones. These new regulators included enzymes that deposit histones on DNA, that carry out DNA repair, and that modify or de-modify histone proteins. To move forward with the newly identified regulators, it will be important to analyze how they control H3K79 methylation in yeast cells and to determine whether the regulators also control H3K79 methylation in human cells.</p><p>Finally, Epi-ID can be used to identify regulators of other types of histone modifications. A better understanding of chromatin regulation â and H3K79 methylation regulation in particular â can increase our understanding of diseases in which chromatin is deregulated, and may yield new strategies for the treatment of such diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18919.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18919.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>histone modifications</kwd><kwd>H3K79 methylation</kwd><kwd>Dot1</kwd><kwd>SAGA</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>adenosine kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-VICI-016.130.627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leeuwen</surname><given-names>Fred van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KWF NKI2014-7232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leeuwen</surname><given-names>Fred van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KWF NKI2009-4511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leeuwen</surname><given-names>Fred van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-VIDI 723.012.102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maarten Altelaar</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Roadmap Large-scale Research Facilities of The Netherlands</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>184.032.201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoekman</surname><given-names>Liesbeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Maarten Altelaar</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI-KIEM-731.013.102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Leeuwen</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI-LIFT-731.015.405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Leeuwen</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The interrogation of histone modifications on DNA barcodes enables efficient and direct screening for epigenetic regulators in thousands of mutants in parallel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genome is packaged by histone proteins that are decorated with a wide variety of modifications. This provides a versatile marking mechanism that integrates cellular signals and plays a key role in processes such as transcription and DNA repair. Regulating the proper composition and modifications of chromatin is critical, as exemplified by the many cancer-promoting chromatin alterations and the epigenetic drugs in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brien et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>At a first level, chromatin modification is under the control of modifying and demodifying enzymes, many of which have been identified. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a second level of control that can involve a plethora of mechanisms, including targeting of enzymes to their site of action, cofactor availability, histone modification cross-talk, and regulation by protein-protein interactions. Understanding the establishment of epigenetic states and designing strategies to perturb them in treatment of disease will require a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the network of signals that feeds into the histone modification systems.</p><p>A specific histone modification of great clinical importance that is still poorly understood is methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 (H3K79) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlaming and van Leeuwen, 2016</xref>). H3K79 is methylated by Dot1/DOT1L. Human DOT1L is important in a subset of leukemias that express an MLL fusion protein caused by rearrangements of the MLL gene (MLL-r) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). DOT1L inhibitors have been developed and are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MLL-r leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stein and Tallman, 2015</xref>). DOT1L has also been implicated in other cancers, and it has a role in normal development and cellular reprogramming (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLean et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen and Zhang (2011)</xref>). Furthermore, Dot1 plays a role in meiotic checkpoint activation and the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen and Zhang, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the exact mechanism of action of H3K79 methylation remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlaming and van Leeuwen, 2016</xref>). The discovery of the important roles of H3K79 methylation has spiked an interest in the regulation of this modification. Both H3K79 methylation and the Dot1(L) enzyme are conserved from budding yeast to humans. Although some regulators, such as MLL fusion partners AF9 and AF10, are specific to DOT1L, other regulators are conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlaming and van Leeuwen, 2016</xref>). The best-characterized regulatory pathway is a trans-histone cross-talk: ubiquitination of H2B by Bre1 in yeast or RNF20/40 in mammals promotes H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weake and Workman, 2008</xref>). Other H3K79 methylation regulators may yet be discovered and could be potential new drug targets in diseases in which DOT1L has been implicated.</p><p>To search for regulators of H3K79 methylation we took advantage of the yeast knock-out collection. Thus far, systematic analysis of chromatin regulatory mechanisms has been challenging; the available techniques are either laborious or indirect (see discussion). Here we describe a screening strategy to identify chromatin regulators in a quantitative, systematic, and high-throughput manner using a direct read-out of the chromatin status in mutant libraries. In this method, which we call Epi-ID, chromatin status on DNA barcodes in the yeast genome is directly interrogated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on a pool of cells and read out by parallel deep sequencing. With the Epi-ID protocol, it is possible to screen thousands of strains for effects on a chromatin feature of interest.</p><p>We used Epi-ID to screen the yeast knock-out collection for factors that influence H3K79 methylation (H3K79me). This screen identified all known regulators of H3K79me, as well as several new regulators that could be validated. We found that histone deposition and homologous recombination negatively regulate H3K79me and that adenosine kinase promotes H3 methylation through its effect on the methionine cycle. Finally, the histone acetyltransferase module in the SAGA complex was identified as an H3K79me regulator and subsequently shown to regulate H2B ubiquitination and other downstream methylation marks, probably through the stability of the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp8, which is also a member of the SAGA complex.</p><p>In summary, Epi-ID is a direct, efficient and widely applicable screening technology. The Epi-ID screen presented here yielded a comprehensive picture of the H3K79 methylation regulome, and the technique can be readily applied to other chromatin modifications or chromatin-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epi-ID outline</title><p>DNA barcodes, unique sequences that can serve as identifiers, enable experiments on pools of cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2008</xref>). When counted by high-throughput sequencing, they yield quantitative information. Classically, collections of barcoded yeast knock-out strains have been used for competitive growth assays, e.g. to find genes that mediate drug toxicity or resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giaever and Nislow, 2014</xref>). Here we take advantage of a yeast collection with barcodes in the genomic DNA, and thus packaged into chromatin, and use the barcodes to report on chromatin modification status or binding events. By performing ChIP on pools of barcoded cells and counting the abundance of the barcodes by high-throughput sequencing, the relative enrichment of each barcode can be determined. Since each barcode corresponds to a gene deletion, the enrichment of the barcode reports on the effect of the gene deletion on the abundance of the chromatin feature assessed by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have successfully tested this concept previously in combination with the recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) assay to find regulators of histone turnover in a small set of candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verzijlbergen et al., 2011</xref>). Now, we modified the technique such that it is applicable to screening the complete set of non-essential knock outs and applied Epi-ID to find regulators of H3K79 methylation by Dot1.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18919.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline and proof-of-concept of Epi-ID.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The barcoded knock-out library used for Epi-ID was created by crossing the NatMX knock-out library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tong and Boone, 2006</xref>) with the Barcoder collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2008</xref>).

Two custom sequencing primers were designed to include the U1/D1 sequence just upstream of the UpTag and DownTag. Starting the reads with the barcode yields maximum complexity in the first base pairs, which is good for clustering efficiency. These sequencing primers are compatible with standard Illumina sequencing conditions and can be mixed together to sequence UpTag and DownTag in one lane. A 6-base-pair index is introduced in the reverse primer, to allow for multiplexing. (<bold>B</bold>) ChIP-qPCR data of the different methylation states, normalized to H3, at several loci.

Although this is a model based on global H3K79 methylation, qualitatively similar changes in methylation can be expected on lowly versus highly methylated loci. Dashed lines indicate estimated levels of H3K79 methylation at the loci tested in the qPCR. HML, a silent mating type locus, has very low levels of methylation, the two promoters have intermediate levels and the two ORFs have high levels of methylation. HO promoter and HO terminator have a low to intermediate level of H3K79 methylation, both an increase and a decrease of methylation are possible, making these loci suitable for a regulator screen.

Barcoder strains (~1100) harbor two unique 20-base-pair barcodes at a common location. The barcodes are upstream (UpTag) and downstream (DownTag) of a selection marker (KanMX) integrated at a safe-harbor locus, the well-studied HO gene. We obtained a set of approximately 4300 strains, divided over five subsets with unique barcodes. With this new library, chromatin structure or modification status can be measured at a common locus in many knock-out strains, avoiding possible position effects of the integrated barcoded cassette. However, the UpTag and DownTag differ in their genomic contexts, being surrounded by promoters or terminators, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the two barcode positions will give information on Dot1 regulation in different functional contexts.</p><p>Second, we optimized the barcode-seq library construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The sequencing library was generated in a single round of amplification. UpTag and DownTag were amplified separately, using primers that annealed to common sequences immediately flanking the barcodes. An index introduced in this PCR allowed for extensive multiplexing, of up to at least 150 samples in one Illumina HiSeq lane.</p><p>Before performing the H3K79me Epi-ID, we confirmed the presence of H3K79 methylation around the barcodes by ChIP-qPCR in a wild-type strain. Both barcode loci showed an intermediate level of H3K79 methylation in a wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Here it is important to consider Dot1âs distributive mechanism of methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frederiks et al., 2008</xref>). This distributive mode of action leads to a characteristic shift in methylation states with changing Dot1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). With increasing Dot1 activity, H3K79me1 will first increase and then decrease, as it is being converted into higher methylation states. Around the barcodes, H3K79me1 was high and H3K79me3 was low compared to coding sequences; this intermediate level of H3K79 methylation was consistent with the intergenic location of the barcodes and indicated that they should be able to report increased as well as decreased Dot1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Epi-ID finds the known H3K79 methylation regulators</title><p>We applied the optimized Epi-ID protocol to screen for regulators of H3K79 methylation. H3K79me1 and H3K79me3 were used for measuring changes in Dot1 activity since the combination of these methylation states provides the most informative and robust readout of Dot1 activity. Input DNA and total H3 ChIP were used for normalization purposes. All barcode count data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>.</p><p>The average data of two Epi-ID experiments was plotted as H3K79me1 versus H3K79me3, each normalized to H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Data was median-normalized within each library subset, based on the assumption that most mutant strains have a wild-type level of H3K79 methylation. Uniquely-barcoded <italic>dot1Î</italic>, <italic>bre1Î</italic> and Dot1 over-expression control strains were added to each library subset as internal controls. The E3 ligase Bre1 ubiquitinates histone H2B on lysine 123, thereby promoting Dot1 activity, and in a <italic>bre1Î</italic> strain H3K79 methylation is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weake and Workman, 2008</xref>). A Dot1 over-expression strain has high levels of methylation. The spiked-in controls were clear outliers: <italic>dot1Î</italic> strains showed low H3K79me1 and H3K79me3 at both the UpTag and DownTag, <italic>bre1Î</italic> strains showed low H3K79me3 and high H3K79me1, and Dot1 over-expression strains showed high H3K79me3 and low H3K79me1. The independent <italic>dot1Î</italic> and <italic>bre1Î</italic> strains present in the original library behave the same as their added counterparts. The results of the spiked-in control strains confirmed that Epi-ID can be used to identify strains with lower and higher levels of H3K79 methylation in pools of mutants.</p><p>Several other strong outliers could readily be explained, since they were known to affect H2B ubiquitination and H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Positive regulators of H3K79 methylation were Rad6 and Lge1, which form the H2B ubiquitination complex together with Bre1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weake and Workman, 2008</xref>), and Rtf1, which is part of the PAF transcription-elongation complex and recruits Bre1/Rad6 to chromatin of transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piro et al., 2012</xref>). Ubp8 and its partners in the deubiquitinase (DUB) module of the SAGA complex (Sgf73, Sgf11 and Sus1) together deubiquitinate H2B and predominantly act at the 5â ends of transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schulze et al., 2011</xref>). In the Epi-ID screen, deletion of the genes encoding these proteins led to increased methylation on the UpTag, but not on the DownTag, as expected given their respective promoter and terminator context. Notably, deletion of the other H2B DUB, <italic>UBP10</italic>, did not increase H3K79me on the barcodes, consistent with the observation that Ubp10 preferentially acts on telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>). In summary, Epi-ID identified all established H3K79 methylation regulators acting via H2Bub in euchromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Deposition of new histones counteracts H3K79 methylation in the absence of a demethylase</title><p>H3K79 methylation is very stable and accumulates on old histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Vos et al., 2011</xref>).

None of the genes with a known demethylase domain was found among the negative regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Given the likely absence of a demethylase, the main mechanism to counteract Dot1 activity may be dilution of methylated histones. This can occur by replication-independent turnover of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>), or by dilution during S phase when the biggest influx of new histones occurs. A negative correlation between histone turnover and H3K79me3 level has been observed in genome-wide maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Radman-Livaja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weiner et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these observations and computational modeling, it has been proposed that slow-growing cells accumulate more H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Vos et al., 2011</xref>). To test this hypothesis without having to change temperature or carbon source, we used barcode-seq to derive growth rates for each of the knock-out clones in the pool of cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and determined the relation between growth rate and H3K79me level. As a single score for H3K79 methylation level, we used the H3K79me3/H3K79me1 ratio. This score was very robust, with a Pearson correlation of 0.89 between two screens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a negative correlation between the growth rate and the H3K79 methylation score on both UpTag and DownTag (rÂ =Â â0.4) and methylation was significantly higher for the slow growers than for the remainder of the yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The expected shift was based on the linear model fitting the data (the red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The robust top outliers based on this growth-corrected methylation score are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Rtt109 was one of the strongest negative regulators of H3K79 methylation on the UpTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and high H3K79 methylation upon deletion of <italic>RTT109</italic> could be validated by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Rtt109 is a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates newly synthesized histone H3 on lysine 56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2007</xref>).

The fact that Rtt109 was one of the strongest negative regulators of H3K79me at the UpTag, i.e. in a promoter region, indicates that histone turnover is an important determinant of the H3K79me level. Altogether, these data support the idea that no H3K79 demethylase is active in yeast and show that the deposition of new histones (replication-coupled or -independent) is an important mechanism to counteract H3K79 methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The NatA Complex regulates H3K79 methylation and H2B ubiquitination</title><p>Among the strongest positive regulators of H3K79me on both the UpTag and DownTag were Nat1 and Ard1, the two components of the NatA N-acetyltransferase complex.

Ard1 has been reported to promote H2Bub and specifically H3K79me3, but the role of Nat1 remained uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed the effect of Ard1 on H2B ubiquitination and H3K79 methylation, and found an identical effect for Nat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This was expected based on the reaction scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and is in agreement with the lower histone H3 methylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), since SAH is a known inhibitor of methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Etchegaray and Mostoslavsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richon et al., 2011</xref>). However, SAM levels increased by as much as 75-fold, causing an unexpected 4-fold increase of the SAM/SAH ratio. The increase in SAM levels may be caused by a global inhibition of methyltransferases by excess SAH and therefore reduced SAM usage, or by compensatory mechanisms such as altered expression of methionine biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>). Although the SAM/SAH ratio is often considered to determine the activity of methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Etchegaray and Mostoslavsky, 2016</xref>), our findings suggest that the absolute levels of SAH and SAM are also important.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DNA repair complexes regulating H3K79 methylation</title><p>To find the more subtle second-level regulators of H3K79me in a systematic and unbiased manner, we first used Cutoff Linked to Interaction Knowledge (CLIK) to determine the threshold above which outliers were likely to be genuine regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dittmar et al., 2013</xref>). CLIK is based on the notion that the rate of interactions among true positives in a screen is higher than for a random set of genes. The algorithm indeed identified many genetic and/or physical interactions between genes at both the low methylation and high methylation ends of the data, for both UpTag and DownTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and determined cutoffs based on the points in the rank list where interaction density dropped. The groups defined in this way were considered candidate regulators.</p><p>Rather than focusing on individual genes in these groups, we took two bioinformatics approaches to identify complexes and processes that regulate H3K79 methylation. First, the built-in complex enrichment analysis in the CLIK tool identified enriched complexes in all groups of candidate regulators (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Table 1âsource data 1</xref>). Few new complexes were identified among the positive regulators, so we focused our attention on the negative regulators. Strikingly, of the enriched complexes on the UpTag, Mms22-Rtt101-Mms1, Slx5-Slx8, and Rad51-Rad57 were all involved in DNA repair, specifically at replication forks (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branzei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costes and Lambert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Second, we used PANTHER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mi et al., 2016</xref>) to identify processes enriched among the candidate negative regulators at the UpTag (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). With the exception of two very general terms, all enriched GO processes fall into the DNA repair category.

Slx5 and Slx8 form a heterodimeric SUMO-targeted Ubiquitin Ligase complex (StUbL) that is required to maintain genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). Strains lacking Slx5 or Slx8 grow very slowly due to the amplification of endogenous 2Âµ circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>), so we first relieved the growth defect of these strains by curing them (and a wild-type control) of the 2Âµ plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Because the substrates of the Slx5/Slx8 StUbL complex largely overlap with those of the SUMO ligase Mms21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albuquerque et al., 2013</xref>), we also generated a strain in which the SUMO ligase activity of Mms21 was compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao and Blobel, 2005</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, ChIP-qPCR showed an increase in methylation at the HO promoter, near the UpTag, in both <italic>slx8Î</italic> and <italic>mms21ÎC</italic>, implicating the SUMO-ubiquitin pathway in regulating H3K79 methylation. A small global increase in methylation was observed in these strains by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that the effect was not limited to the barcode regions.</p><p>No DNA-damaging agents were present in the Epi-ID experiment. However, also in untreated cells homologous recombination is needed to restart replication forks that have stalled or collapsed, for instance at structure-forming sequences or replication-fork barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costes and Lambert, 2012</xref>). Mms22, Rtt101 and Mms1 (of which Rtt101 was not in the dataset) form a Cul4-like E3 ubiquitin ligase that sits at replication forks and promotes restart of stalled forks, presumably through homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaisica et al., 2011</xref>). Rad52 and its partners are central players in homologous recombination, also at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costes and Lambert, 2012</xref>). The Slx5 and Slx8 StUbL complex and Mms21 promote translocation of DNA breaks and collapsed replication forks to nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horigome et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, also the nuclear pore component required for this translocation, Nup84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2015</xref>), was identified as a negative regulator of H3K79me in the Epi-ID screen. At the pore, Slx5/8 modulate homologous recombination by targeting protein substrates for degradation, including Rad52 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Other factors from the process of HR-mediated DSB repair that were among the negative regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) include Sgs1, which also facilitates re-initiation of stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashton and Hickson, 2010</xref>), and Ctf4, which tethers Mms22 to the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buser et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, among the second-level regulators of H3K79me are many factors required to allow recovery of stalled replication forks. This suggests that this process regulates H3K79me, either because the repair itself counteracts methylation or inhibits Dot1, or because unrepaired collapsed replication forks lead to accumulation of H3K79 methylation.</p><p>Since H2B ubiquitination has been described to facilitate fork recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2014</xref>), we wondered if the regulation of H3K79 methylation could be through H2B ubiquitination. However, H2Bub levels were not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), and neither was Dot1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Unraveling the mechanism of this regulation will require further studies. Another interesting point is the function of this regulation. Dot1 has been shown to function in several DNA repair pathways; it mediates checkpoint activation and recombinational repair after UV damage, and represses translesion synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conde and San-Segundo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rossodivita et al., 2014</xref>). Dot1 has not yet been studied in the context of replication fork stalling, but our finding that H3K79 methylation is regulated in this context warrants further investigations. Finally, since homologues of all involved proteins can be found in mammals, it will be interesting to see if also the described H3K79me regulation is conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The SAGA HAT module negatively regulates histone methylation and H2B ubiquitination</title><p>SAGA complex subunits were highly enriched among the negative H3K79me regulators on the UpTag (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These not only included subunits of the deubiquitinase (DUB) module, but also subunits of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module. Indeed, Gcn5 and its partners in the HAT module, Ada2 and Ngg1 (Ada3), were among the strongest negative regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). No data was obtained on Sgf29, the last SAGA HAT module subunit. The specificity these factors showed for the UpTag is not surprising given the activity of Gcn5 at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet et al., 2014</xref>). Mass spectrometry measurements demonstrated that the effect of Gcn5 was not limited to the UpTag, since a <italic>gcn5Î</italic> strain also had more H3K79me3 and less H3K79me1 globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To investigate the role of Gcn5 in more detail, we analyzed the behavior of a specific point mutant, Gcn5-F221A. This mutant protein has previously been shown to be catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuo et al., 1998</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanza et al., 2012</xref>). To allow for a direct, quantitative, and sensitive comparison, we performed a custom-designed Epi-ID experiment with a set of <italic>gcn5Î</italic> strains with single-copy plasmids. In contrast to wild-type Gcn5, the Gcn5-F221A mutant was not able to rescue the knock-out phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,C</xref>). This finding suggests that H3K79me regulation by Gcn5 depends on its catalytic activity. However, it cannot be excluded that the F221A mutation acts by other mechanisms such as disrupting nucleosome binding or altering the stability of Gcn5.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18919.024</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Gcn5 regulates H2B ubiquitination and H3 methylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MS analysis of H3K79 methylation levels in wild-type and <italic>gcn5Î</italic> strains.

Since Gcn5 is found in the SAGA complex, just like the H2Bub DUB Ubp8, we wondered if Gcn5 could function through H2B ubiquitination. Indeed, <italic>gcn5Î</italic> strains were found to have significantly more H2Bub on the UpTag than wild-type strains, and this was also the case for cells expressing the inactive Gcn5-F221A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The effect of Gcn5 on the H2Bub level at this locus was comparable to the effect of Ubp8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Since H2Bub levels were affected, we also tested the effect on H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 in the custom Epi-ID experiment and found both to be increased in the absence of Gcn5 acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, at the UpTag we found the activity of Gcn5 to negatively regulate H2B ubiquitination and, probably through its ubiquitination effect, methylation of H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79.</p><p>To validate the H2Bub increase caused by <italic>GCN5</italic> deletion by an independent method and to test whether the effect was not limited to the barcode region, we took two approaches. First, using ChIP-qPCR, both an increase in H2Bub and a decrease in H3K9ac could be observed at the HO promoter, near the UpTag in <italic>gcn5Î</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These changes were also observed at several other loci, but not at all of the loci examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to determine where H2Bub regulation by Gcn5 occurs and how the specificity for certain regions is established. Second, immunoblotting was used to determine the global change in H2Bub level. Both <italic>gcn5Î</italic> and <italic>ada2Î</italic> strains showed increased H2Bub -levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement AâC</xref>).</p><p>Gcn5 may modulate H2Bub by acetylating histones or by interactions between the HAT and DUB modules. Indeed, acetylation on one of the DUB module components has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henriksen et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, interactions between the HAT module and the DUB module have also been observed by independent approaches in yeast and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atanassov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Durand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate this further, we examined the expression of H2Bub regulators and observed that Ubp8 protein expression was significantly decreased in the absence of Gcn5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâG</xref>). A reduction in Ubp8 protein level was also observed in chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2DâE</xref>). Thus, the lower Ubp8 levels can at least in part explain the observed change in H2Bub in <italic>gcn5Î</italic> cells. These findings suggest that Gcn5 is required for Ubp8 stability, potentially by regulating the association with its partners in the SAGA DUB module. Taken together, we identified the SAGA HAT as a negative regulator of H3K79 methylation, and then discovered that it regulates H2B ubiquitination and subsequent methylation events on three lysine residues on histone H3, at least in part by maintaining Ubp8 protein expression. The sensitivity of the Epi-ID technique allowed for identification of this regulatory mechanism, even though the global effects are small and previously went unnoticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Our finding that the SAGA HAT module regulates the DUB, together with the finding that the DUB module regulates HAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2014</xref>), suggests that the two activities in the SAGA complex are highly interactive, despite being organized in distinct modules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Chromatin regulatory mechanisms are important for genome function and are often deregulated in cancer and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brien et al., 2016</xref>). To enable efficient and direct screening for chromatin regulators, we developed Epi-ID, in which chromatin modification or binding-events at DNA barcodes are directly interrogated by ChIP followed by deep sequencing.</p><p>The Epi-ID technique has several advantages over the methods that are currently available. First, in contrast to other techniques used to screen for chromatin regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dover et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulze et al., 2009</xref>), Epi-ID can be performed on pools of cells, making it easily applicable to large collections of mutants. Second, Epi-ID is a direct method, in contrast to reporter gene assays that have been used to read out chromatin changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossmann et al., 2011</xref>). Third, it is a very sensitive method that is able to pick up differences that cannot be detected by immunoblot. Finally, by comparing all knock-outs directly in a competitive manner, no complex normalization methods are required.</p><p>As a proof of concept we applied Epi-ID to delineate the regulome of H3K79 methylation in budding yeast. All known H3K79 methylation regulators were identified, as well as several new regulators. All tested candidate regulators could be validated on a global level and/or locally, by ChIP-qPCR. It is clear from our data that the well-studied H2Bub-H3K79me trans-histone cross-talk is the main Dot1 regulatory pathway. Not only the factors directly involved in H2B (de)ubiquitination were identified as regulators ofÂ H3K79 methylation, also new H2Bub modulators were discovered. One of these was Gcn5, which is responsible for the HAT activity in SAGA and was found to negatively regulate H3 methylation and H2Bub, at least in part by maintaining Ubp8 protein abundance. No candidate H3K79 demethylase was identified and histone deposition was found to negatively regulate H3K79Â methylation, supporting the hypothesis that in the absence of a demethylase histone dilution is the main mechanism to counteract Dot1 activity. Several proteins involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination were scored as negative regulators of Dot1 activity, particularly proteins required for the recovery of stalled replication forks through recombination. Finally, there are several candidate regulators that we have not yet studied further. These factors may regulate Dot1 indirectly, through one of the mechanisms described above, or through a yet to be discovered mechanism. Especially for these uncharacterized candidates, indirect effects of gene knock-outs on neighboring genes should also be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shitrit et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies will be required to clarify the mechanisms of some of these regulators. The resource on Dot1 regulation presented here can be used as a starting point for such studies.</p><p>The Epi-ID screen reported here was performed using the knock-out collection of non-essential genes and offers a valuable resource for future studies on the regulation of H3K79 methylation in yeast and other organisms. However, Epi-ID is not limited to the use of knock-out collections but is highly flexible with regard to the library being screened. Combining barcode libraries with libraries of temperature sensitive alleles, histone mutants, or hypomorphic (DamP) alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Aroya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2008</xref>) may lead to new insights into the contribution of essential genes in regulating chromatin structure and function. Dedicated, smaller custom libraries can also be made, as illustrated by the experiment testing the rescue potential of Gcn5-containing plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this case one indexed Epi-ID experiment was an efficient and robust alternative to performing multiple replicate ChIPs and qPCR analyses.</p><p>The technology can easily be applied to chromatin features other than H3K79 methylation. As an example, we showed a small Epi-ID experiment for H2B ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, a previous version of the technique has been used to identify histone turnover factors, albeit on a smaller scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verzijlbergen et al., 2011</xref>), and Epi-ID for H2A.Z levels has also been performed successfully (Korthout, van Leeuwen et al., submitted). The only requirement for an Epi-ID experiment is that a ChIP against the chromatin feature of interest can pull down one or both of the barcoded regions at the HO locus. We envision that it will be feasible to generate a library of clones with barcodes at a locus of interest in the near future, which would eliminate this limitation. Such strategies will allow for determining the regulome of many other chromatin features and investigating the cross-talk between the different networks.</p><p>Yeast offers the unique possibility to use genetic crosses and SGA technology to combine gene inactivations with chromatinized DNA barcodes. However, the concept of Epi-ID, i.e. barcode-ChIP-seq in mutant backgrounds, is not restricted to yeast and is in principle transferable to other organisms. The basic requirement is that mutants can be uniquely identified by a chromatinized DNA sequence, which is the case in shRNA, CRISPR and CRISPRi libraries when the genetic elements to inactivate genes are integrated in the genome (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evers et al., 2016</xref>). With the recent developments in genome targeting and editing, tools are becoming available to integrate barcoded libraries at a common locus to avoid position effects. Taken together, Epi-ID is a highly adaptable technique that enables the identification of new chromatin regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, respectively. Yeast media were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tong and Boone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Leeuwen and Gottschling, 2002</xref>). Library manipulations were done using the RoToR from Singer Instruments (Watchet, UK) and the synthetic genetic array (SGA) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tong and Boone, 2006</xref>). The collection of barcoded knockouts was made by crossing a set of 1140 Barcoder strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2008</xref>) to each of five plates making up the <italic>MAT</italic>Î± NatMX knock-out collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tong and Boone, 2006</xref>). After mating, diploids were selected with G418 and CloNat double selection on rich media.

The barcodes and deletions were checked for a few mutants and were found to be correct. Three extra Barcoder strains were generated by amplifying the barcoded KanMX locus from strains from the <italic>MAT</italic>a haploid gene knockout library (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) and integrating it at the HO locus in strain BY4741. The <italic>dot1Î</italic> and <italic>bre1Î</italic> strains were taken from the NatMX library and a Dot1 over-expression strain was generated by integrating the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter amplified from pYM-N15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janke et al., 2004</xref>) in front of the <italic>DOT1</italic> gene in strain Y7092. These strains were crossed to the extra Barcoder strains to generate barcoded controls that have the same background as the library (NKI4557-4559). NKI4560 was generated by selecting a G418-resistant, CloNat-sensitive haploid after the library cross.</p><p>A custom set of barcoded deletion strains was made by re-arraying <italic>MAT</italic>Î± NatMX deletion strains using the Stinger extension to the RoToR system (Singer Instruments), crossing these to Barcoders and selecting double-resistant <italic>MAT</italic>a haploids. Uniquely barcoded CloNat-sensitive <italic>MAT</italic>a haploids were used as wild-type strains. Strains were transformed with single-copy CEN-LEU2 plasmids using an adaptation of the microtiter plate LiAc protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gietz, 2014</xref>). The Gcn5-containing plasmids were generated by replacing the TRP1 marker in pRS414-GCN5 and pRS414-gcn5-F221A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Oevelen et al., 2006</xref>) by the LEU2 marker using homologous recombination in yeast.</p><p>NKI4657 was generated by integrating a barcoded KanMX at the HO locus of BY4733. In this background, several deletions were made for validation experiments. The endogenous 2Âµ plasmid was cured from some strains by transforming the pBIS-GALkFLP(URA3) plasmid into the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsalik and Gartenberg, 1998</xref>), inducing mutant FLP recombinase on galactose-containing medium and then selecting for the loss of the plasmid on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Loss of the 2Âµ plasmid was confirmed by PCR. To test the role of the SUMO ligase activity of the essential Mms21, we truncated this essential gene at amino acid 183 to eliminate the catalytic domain, yet still support viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao and Blobel, 2005</xref>). This truncation was made by integrating a stop codon, <italic>CYC1</italic> terminator and NatMX cassette in the place of the C-terminal <italic>MMS21</italic> sequence.</p><p>Strains expressing FLAG-tagged (mutant) H2B, NKI4609 and NKI4610, were made by transforming pRG422 and pRG423, respectively, into NKI4602 and selecting cells that had lost the original plasmid.</p><p>To determine effects on the expression levels of H2Bub regulators, strains with TAP-tagged alleles were derived from the TAP-Fusion ORF collection (Dharmacon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>GCN5</italic> and <italic>NAT1</italic> were replaced by NatMX in these strains.

Finally, because Bre1-TAP loses its interaction with Rad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wood et al., 2003</xref>), we used KY2513, in which Bre1 carries a FLAG tag on the N terminus and deleted <italic>GCN5</italic> and <italic>NAT1</italic> in this strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Epi-ID</title><p>Briefly, the Epi-ID screens consisted of five steps: (1) preparing chromatin from pools of cells, (2) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments, (3) PCR reactions on purified DNA, (4) Sequencing, (5) Data analysis. The five plates of the collection were treated separately until after the PCR. The five plates were grown on rich media for one night and cells were scraped off and pooled in liquid media in the morning. The cultures were grown for 4â5 hr until in log phase and cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde, washed and harvested. Chromatin was prepared essentially as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlaming et al. (2014)</xref>, in the presence of SDS for H3C and methyl ChIPs, but sonication of chromatin fromÂ ~5E9 cells in 1.5 mL was done in 15 mL tubes. The ChIP was also performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlaming et al. (2014)</xref>, using polyclonal antibodies against H3K79me1, H3K79me3 and the H3 C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frederiks et al., 2008</xref>). In the small-scale Epi-ID experiments, also antibodies against H3K4me3 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306649">AB_306649</ext-link>, lot GR273043-1) and H3K36me3 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306966">AB_306966</ext-link>, lot GF260274-1) were used, as well as an H2BK123ub antibody that will be described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). The UpTag and DownTag were amplified separately from the purified DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The scale of each Epi-ID experiment was chosen such that on average an estimated number of 250 copies of each barcode was present in each PCR reaction to minimize jackpot effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). The forward primer (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTCGCTCTTCCGATCTAGATGTCCACGAGGTCTCT/AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTCCGATCTACGGTGTCGGTCTCGTAG for UpTag/DownTag) introduced the Illumina P5 sequence and extra nucleotides for annealing of the 5â end of the custom sequencing primers. With the reverse primer (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNGTCGACCTGCAGCGTACG/CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGANNNNNNAACGAGCTCGAATTCATCGA for UpTag/DownTag) the Illumina P7 sequence was introduced, as well as a 6-base-pair index. The uniquely barcoded amplicons were then mixed equimolarly and purified from an agarose gel with a size selection of 100â150 bp. The purified DNA was sequenced (single read,Â &gt;50 bp) on a HiSeq2500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with High Output Run Mode, using a mix of custom sequencing primers for the UpTag and DownTag (CGCTCTTCCGATCTAGATGTCCACGAGGTCTCT/ ACACTCTTCCGATCTACGGTGTCGGTCTCGTAG). Since the above-mentioned primer sequences were not compatible with paired-end flow cells, the oligonucleotide sequences were slightly altered (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) to sequence small-scale Epi-ID experiments on a MiSeq (Illumina).</p><p>A Perl script, eXtracting Counting And LInking to Barcode References (xcalibr), was written to transform raw sequencing reads to tables with counts for each index-barcode combination. In short, the U2/D2 sequences were used to assign a read to UpTag or DownTag and the index sequence behind the U2/D2 sequence and the barcode sequence in the beginning of the read were identified. The xcalibr source code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NKI-GCF/xcalibr">https://github.com/NKI-GCF/xcalibr</ext-link>. In the counts table, counts below ten were removed. After that, any barcode below 10% of the median in an input sample of a plate was considered not present on that plate and counts for all indices belonging to this plate were removed. The tables were median-normalized for each index and converted to a table with ORFs and experiments based on the barcode-index combinations. In this table IP columns could be divided over each other or over input. H3K79me data of strains with H3/input ofÂ &lt;0.5 was discarded.

Growth rates that gave a goodness of fit ofÂ &lt;0.95 were discarded. Growth rates were calculated using data of the UpTag and DownTag separately, and these values were averaged. A few cases were removed, where different rates were calculated for the UpTag and DownTag (c.o.v.Â &gt;0.2). Finally, the growth rates calculated for two independent experiments were averaged.

Samples were dissolved in 10% formic acid prior to reverse phase nano-flow liquid chromatography on an EASY nLC 1000 system (Thermo Scientific,Â San Jose, CA) coupled to a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific.Â San Jose, CA). Briefly, peptides were separated on a ReproSilâPur 120 C18âAQ 2.4 Î¼m (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) 75 Î¼mÂ ÃÂ 500 mm analytical column (packed in house) in a 30 min. linear gradient from 10% to 40% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 8:2 (v/v) acetonitrile:water) followed by a 15âmin wash at 100% solvent B atÂ ~250 nl/min. Nanospray was achieved using the Proxeon nanoflex source and fused silica gold coated emitters (pulled and coated in-house) at 1.55 kV. The mass spectrometer was configured in targeted mode to select precursor ions by quadrupole isolation at 1.6 Th, followed by HCD fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 25 and Orbitrap MS2 fragment detection. The instrument was run in top speed mode with 3Â s cycles.</p><p>PRM parameters were optimized using a set of four purified synthetic peptides with the sequence EIAQDFK*TDLR (K*: K-me0, -me1, -me2 and -me3). Briefly, doubly and triply charged precursors were fragmented in the Orbitrap Fusion and their four most abundant fragment ions were selected and validated using Skyline software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014080">SCR_014080</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>). Label-free quantification was achieved by comparing the area of each methylation state to the sum of the areas of all methylation states. As the four different peptides have slightly different physicochemical properties and thus might have slightly different ionization efficiencies in the mass spectrometer, final peptide intensities were corrected using a relative response factor to obtain more accurate results. The relative response factor was obtained by measuring the peak areas of the four differently methylated peptide standards from an equimolar mixture and dividing peptide areas by the area of the unmethylated peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ChIP-qPCR</title><p>ChIP-qPCR experiments were performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlaming et al.

A <italic>DC</italic> protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used to quantify protein content of chromatin samples, with the purpose of equalizing the amount of chromatin going into each ChIP. Antibodies used were the same as for Epi-ID or immunoblot experiments, as well as an antibody against H3K9ac (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2118292">AB_2118292</ext-link>, lot GR243602-1).

SAM and SAH measurements were performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Struys et al., 2000</xref>). Briefly, SAM and SAH were extracted from yeast lysates using solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB, Waters, Milford, MA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a new strategy for carrying out an unbiased screen for genes that regulate chromatin modifications. The Epi-ID method allows pools of individual mutants, each carrying a specific integrated barcode, to be probed by ChIP. Deep sequencing of the barcodes in the precipitated samples allows quantitative assessment of the effects of a given mutation on the chromatin parameter, in this case H3K79me1 and H3K79me3. In addition to the genes previously known to regulate H3K79 methylation, either directly or indirectly, the authors identify novel genes including the Gcn5 acetyltransferase, N-terminal acetyltransferases, genes that regulate replication fork recovery, and enzymes involved in S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and SAH biosynthesis. The manuscript also makes a strong case that there is no H3K79 demethylase, with the caveat that essential strains were not tested. Overall, the reviewers found the Epi-ID method to have strong potential for identifying novel genes impacting methylation that could be readily extended to other chromatin modifications for which the appropriate antibodies are available. However, a more thorough exploration of some of the hits would make a stronger case of the utility of the approach.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is speculative, and the results on the leukemia cell lines do not clarify the conclusions. The adenosine kinase inhibitors could be influencing cell viability through a mechanism quite unrelated to Dot1L or H3K79me. What do the H3K79me levels look like in the treated cells? In their current form, these tissue culture experiments weaken the paper and should be omitted unless further pursued.</p><p>2) The finding that deletion of ADO1 impacts histone methylation is presented as a discovery, whereas it seems to fall in the category of a confirmation of the validity of the screen rather than new information. Since ADO1 was already reported to regulate SAM levels (Kanai 2013), it is not surprising that altering levels of the methyl donor would impact histone methylation. It was initially puzzling that deletion of ADO1 had opposing effects on Dot1 versus Set1 and Set2. However, the explanation that the authors suggest, namely that these enzymes respond differently to restriction of SAM and SAH is, in fact, consistent with the cited paper (Sadhu et al., 2013), which reported differential effects on H3K79 versus H3 K4 methylation in response to nutritional limitation. The lengthy discussion of this gene does not seem warranted in light of what was previously known. Instead, this could be cast differently, namely as support for the Epi-ID method.</p><p>3) One of the more intriguing findings is the observed impact of acetyltransferase mutations on H3K79 methylation via an effect on H2B ubiquitination, which is required for methylation by Dot1. A deletion or catalytic mutant of the Gcn5 acetyltransferase increased methylation via an impact on H2B ubiquitination, whereas mutations in the N-terminal acetyltransferase proteins, Nat1 and Ard1, caused a decrease in H2B ubiquitination. However, these results are not pursued adequately, leaving open the question of whether these genes directly regulate H2B ubiquitination or have indirect effects. At minimum, the authors should show whether any of the acetyltransferase mutants affect levels of proteins known to be involved in H2B ubiquitination, Bre1, Rad6 and Lge1, or deubiquitination, Ubp8 and Ubp10. Potential effects on protein levels should be explored for any other mutants discussed, as was done for Slx5/8.</p><p>4) Do the HAT mutations also affect H3K4 methylation?</p><p>5) The western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for Ado1 effects is not particularly convincing. H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 levels also seem to be decreased.</p><p>6) What do H2Bub levels look like in the ado1 mutant?</p><p>7) Conclusions drawn from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (even in regards to controls) should be qualified in regards to effects of deletions on growth rates which affect K79me3 (as the authors address in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>8) How do the authors ensure that the time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> represent log phase growth? While the growth rates for two independent experiments were determined and then averaged, can the same conclusions about K79me3 and growth rate be derived independently from each experiment? Assuming this is the case, this should be stated (although it may be buried in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> legend).

The addition of controls in which protein levels were measured in the various mutant strains improved the manuscript and helped clarify interpretations.

However, Ubp8 protein levels are reduced in the gcn5 deletion strain, indicating that the defect in H2B deubiquitylation is a consequence of the loss of the SAGA subunit, Ubp8, rather than regulation of its catalytic activity. The authors show that a mutant of Gcn5, F221A, has a phenotype comparable to the deletion; however, F221 forms hydrophobic interactions with multiple buried residues, which raises the possibility that the strong effect of the F221A mutation results from destabilization of Gcn5, which would be predicted to lead to loss of Ubp8. To demonstrate that Gcn5 indeed regulates Ubp8 activity, as opposed to stabilizing its incorporation into SAGA, the authors should provide evidence that the levels of both Gcn5 and Ubp8 are unchanged when Gcn5 bears the F221A substitution. Without this result, the authors should soften their conclusions here. Should the authors wish to generate a bona fide Gcn5 catalytic mutant, substitution of the conserved catalytic E122 would be a better choice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18919.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is speculative, and the results on the leukemia cell lines do not clarify the conclusions. The adenosine kinase inhibitors could be influencing cell viability through a mechanism quite unrelated to Dot1L or H3K79me. What do the H3K79me levels look like in the treated cells? In their current form, these tissue culture experiments weaken the paper and should be omitted unless further pursued.</italic></p><p>The tissue culture experiments were included to indicate the possible utility or relevance of the Epi-ID results for human biology. However, we agree with the comments that those results are still preliminary; taking the cell line part to the same level as the rest of the manuscript would require substantially more work and therefore falls beyond the main scope of this paper. We therefore followed your suggestion to omit the cell culture experiments from the manuscript and instead focused on additional experiments to strengthen the other findings (see below).</p><p><italic>2) The finding that deletion of ADO1 impacts histone methylation is presented as a discovery, whereas it seems to fall in the category of a confirmation of the validity of the screen rather than new information. Since ADO1 was already reported to regulate SAM levels (Kanai 2013), it is not surprising that altering levels of the methyl donor would impact histone methylation. It was initially puzzling that deletion of ADO1 had opposing effects on Dot1 versus Set1 and Set2. However, the explanation that the authors suggest, namely that these enzymes respond differently to restriction of SAM and SAH is, in fact, consistent with the cited paper (Sadhu et al., 2013), which reported differential effects on H3K79 versus H3 K4 methylation in response to nutritional limitation. The lengthy discussion of this gene does not seem warranted in light of what was previously known. Instead, this could be cast differently, namely as support for the Epi-ID method.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to adjust the way in which the phenotype of the ADO1 knock-out is presented. Taking into account your comments and the results we obtained while addressing comments #5 and #6, we shortened the discussion of this gene and moved the Results section more towards the beginning of the manuscript where the regulators are discussed that confirm the power of the screening method (subsection âAdenosine kinase promotes histone methylationâ). We have made a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which describes both positive regulators, the NatA complex and Ado1.</p><p>We also clarified why we believe the observed changes in the ADO1 knock-out are unexpected and do not just confirm what has previously been shown. Briefly, it has been reported that both SAM and SAH levels are up in ado1d cells, but the extent of the SAH increase was not reported in previous studies. Therefore, it was not known how the SAM/SAH ratio was affected and the prediction would be that it would decrease, given where it acts on the methionine cycle. The SAM/SAH ratio is generally considered to represent the methylation potential in the cell, so also based on the reduced histone H3 methylation that we observed a reduction in the SAM/SAH ratio was expected. However, we found that the increase in SAM is actually larger than the increase and SAH, leading to a higher SAM/SAH ratio. Therefore, our results suggest that the SAM/SAH ratio cannot be taken as the sole determinant of methylation potential and that absolute levels of SAM and SAH should also be taken into consideration. We now discuss this more clearly in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><p>The study by Sadhu et al. (2013) nicely shows how Dot1 and Set1 seem to respond differently to perturbation of folate synthesis and supply in yeast; we now cite this paper in the Results section to emphasize the role of nutrient levels on histone methylation. However, the SAM levels were not altered in a folate synthesis mutant (fol3Î), whereas deletion of ADO1 causes large changes in SAM and SAH. Considering this difference, we prefer to not directly compare the histone methylation phenotypes in ado1Î and fol3Î mutants and focus the discussion of the results on the SAM and SAH changes.</p><p><italic>3) One of the more intriguing findings is the observed impact of acetyltransferase mutations on H3K79 methylation via an effect on H2B ubiquitination, which is required for methylation by Dot1. A deletion or catalytic mutant of the Gcn5 acetyltransferase increased methylation via an impact on H2B ubiquitination, whereas mutations in the N-terminal acetyltransferase proteins, Nat1 and Ard1, caused a decrease in H2B ubiquitination. However, these results are not pursued adequately, leaving open the question of whether these genes directly regulate H2B ubiquitination or have indirect effects. At minimum, the authors should show whether any of the acetyltransferase mutants affect levels of proteins known to be involved in H2B ubiquitination, Bre1, Rad6 and Lge1, or deubiquitination, Ubp8 and Ubp10. Potential effects on protein levels should be explored for any other mutants discussed, as was done for Slx5/8.</italic></p><p>Following the suggestions, we performed a series of experiments to obtain more insight into the regulatory roles of the acetyltransferase mutants:</p><p>We checked the protein levels of Dot1 for both nat1d and gcn5d strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>, respectively) and found that neither the NatA complex nor Gcn5 affect the expression of Dot1 itself.</p><p>We checked the protein levels of positive H2Bub regulators Bre1, Rad6, Lge1, Rtf1, and negative H2Bub regulators Ubp8 and Ubp10, for both nat1d and gcn5d strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-G</xref>, respectively). No significant decrease in H2B ubiquitination factors or increase in H2Bub deubiquitinating factors was observed in nat1d strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E-G</xref>), as discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection âThe NatA complex regulates H3K79 methylation and H2B ubiquitinationâ.</p><p>In gcn5d strains, of all the H2Bub regulators, only Ubp8 showed a significant change in protein expression that could explain the observed change in H2Bub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We observed this decrease in whole-cell extracts and confirmed it in (independent) chromatin fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D-E</xref>). These findings suggest that Gcn5 is required for Ubp8 stability, potentially by regulating the association with its partners in the SAGA DUB module, as discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection âThe SAGA HAT module negatively regulates histone methylation and H2B ubiquitinationâ.</p><p>To strengthen the result that Gcn5 regulates H2Bub, we also performed a ChIP-qPCR experiment on several loci, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>. This validated the H2Bub increase in gcn5d strains. Moreover, while analyzing protein expression in WT and gcn5d strains (described above), we again repeatedly observed the global increase in H2Bub in gcn5d strains. This effect can now also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>.</p><p>Dot1 immunoblots have now also been included for the ado1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Do the HAT mutations also affect H3K4 methylation?</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting question and we decided to study the effects on both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 for Gcn5 and the NatA complex.</p><p>For the NatA complex we addressed this question by immunoblot analysis, since the effects on H2Bub and H3K79me can easily be measured on a global level. As expected, given the H2Bub effect, H3K4me3 was lost in bre1d cells and decreased in nat1d or ard1d cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also noticed that H3K36me3 was decreased in the absence of Bre1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which to our knowledge has not been described before in literature. We validated the effect of H2Bub on H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) and also found a partial effect of the NatA complex on H3K36me3, consistent with its partial H2Bub loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the role of Gcn5, which has smaller global H3K79me effects, we decided to perform a new small-scale Epi-ID experiment using strains that contained empty plasmid or a wild-type/mutant Gcn5-expressing plasmid. In this experiment we used antibodies against H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, as well as antibodies against H2Bub, H3K79me1 and H3K79me3. We observed the same H3K79me methylation effects as before on the barcoded locus (the previous results have now been moved to the figure supplement and the new result can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and observed an increase in H2B ubiquitination on this locus in a gcn5d strain. This regulation of H2Bub levels was dependent on the catalytic activity of Gcn5. Finally, both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 were significantly increased in the absence of Gcn5 or its catalytic activity.</p><p>These additional experiments show that, NatA and Gcn5 both affect H2B ubiquitination and the trimethylated states of H3K4, H3K36 and H3K79, which are all promoted by H2Bub.</p><p><italic>5) The western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for Ado1 effects is not particularly convincing. H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 levels also seem to be decreased.</italic></p><p>We previously observed that the decrease in H3K79me3 was somewhat stronger and more reproducible than the decreases in H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, which led us to conclude that Dot1 was more affected by Ado1 than Set1 and Set2. This was based on the quantification of three replicates, of which only one was shown. To address the variation between replicates (see also response to comment #6), we repeated these experiments and performed additional immunoblots. The old blots are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>, the new results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figures 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>. Considering the newly obtained data, we conclude that the decreases in H3K79me3, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are comparable. The text has been adjusted accordingly (subsection âAdenosine kinase promotes histone methylationâ, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) What do H2Bub levels look like in the ado1 mutant?</italic></p><p>To address this question we first performed an H2B blot on the samples that were used for the methylation blots originally shown in the main figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). We found that the lower H3K79me levels in the ado1d strain could not be explained by lower H2Bub levels. Instead, the blots suggested that H2B ubiquitination was increased in the ado1d strain, potentially even masking stronger methylation defects. To confirm this unexpected result, we generated additional biological replicates of three independently generated wild-type and <italic>ADO1</italic> mutant strains. Collectively, the results show that all three methyltransferases (Set1, Set2 and Dot1) are affected by loss of Ado1, and that there is small increase in H2B ubiquitination, which could partially mask stronger defects in methyltransferase activity caused by altered SAM/SAH levels. We discuss these results in the first paragraph of the subsection âAdenosine kinase promotes histone methylationâ.</p><p><italic>7) Conclusions drawn from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (even in regards to controls) should be qualified in regards to effects of deletions on growth rates which affect K79me3 (as the authors address in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</italic></p><p>In the Results section, we have now added the following sentence after explaining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>: âIt can also be appreciated from this plot that the known regulators identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> remain outliers after taking into account the growth defects that some of them have.â</p><p><italic>8) How do the authors ensure that the time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> represent log phase growth? While the growth rates for two independent experiments were determined and then averaged, can the same conclusions about K79me3 and growth rate be derived independently from each experiment? Assuming this is the case, this should be stated (although it may be buried in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> legend). It would also be helpful to make clear in the main text that the strains were separately grown, as opposed to grown as a pool.</italic></p><p>First, to clarify, growth rates were determined in pools of cells, making use of barcode sequencing of DNA isolated at each of the time points. Details can be found in the Methods section (subsection âGrowth rate determination and growth correctionâ), but we have adjusted the text in the Results section to make this more clear (subsection âDeposition of new histones counteracts H3K79 methylation in the absence of a demethylaseâ, first paragraph).</p><p>The growth rates were determined in experiments separate from the H3K79me regulator Epi-ID screens. We have now phrased this more clearly in the Methods section (subsection âGrowth rate determination and growth correctionâ). We have also included a plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) to show the strong correlation between the growth rates determined in the two replicate experiments, but cannot compare one of the growth rate replicates with one of the H3K79me replicates.</p><p>In the growth rate experiments, we also determined cell densities by OD measurement for each pool of cells at each time point. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref> we have now included a plot of these densities to show that the increases in cell numbers fit logarithmic cell growth throughout the course of the experiment. However, since the OD measurements are not very precise and there was one clear outlier, we used the more robust internal normalization (i.e. assuming a median growth rate of 0.42h<sup>-1</sup>) to calculate the growth rates.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>The revised manuscript appropriately addresses almost all previous concerns.

However, Ubp8 protein levels are reduced in the gcn5 deletion strain, indicating that the defect in H2B deubiquitylation is a consequence of the loss of the SAGA subunit, Ubp8, rather than regulation of its catalytic activity.

Should the authors wish to generate a bona fide Gcn5 catalytic mutant, substitution of the conserved catalytic E122 would be a better choice.</italic></p><p>We have made two adjustments to address this issue.</p><p>First, it was not our intention to suggest that Gcn5 (and its catalytic activity) are regulators of Ubp8 activity. We did not state this point in the manuscript. In fact, we show that the level of Ubp8 is reduced in the absence of wild-type Gcn5, suggesting that the effect on H2Bub is indeed more likely to be mediated by altered Ubp8 levels rather than altered Ubp8 activity. To our knowledge, a role for Gcn5 in modulating Ubp8 stability has not been reported previously. To make this clearer and avoid any confusion, we adjusted the text, where we, for example, now explicitly mention that âwe examined the expression of H2Bub regulators and observed that Ubp8 showed a significant change in protein expression in the absence of Gcn5â¦ A reduction in Ubp8 protein level was also observed in chromatin fractionsâ¦ These findings suggest that Gcn5 is required for Ubp8 stability, potentially by regulating the association with its partners in the SAGA DUB moduleâ.</p><p>Second, we chose the Gcn5-F221A mutant because it had previously been used by several other labs to determine the role of the catalytic activity of Gcn5; the mutation did not seem to affect the expression of Gcn5, the Gcn5-F221A protein still interacted with Ada2, and it acted in a dominant negative fashion, together indicating that the loss of activity caused by the F221A mutation was not due to Gcn5 destabilization (e.g. Kuo G&amp;D 1998; Wang G&amp;D 1998; Li MCB 2005; van Oevelen JBC 2006; Lanza PLoSOne 2012). However, the reviewer is absolutely right that we cannot exclude that the mutation has additional effects on Gcn5 protein folding or stability, especially given the location of the F221 residue. We thank the reviewer for providing this expert insight and have made a few adjustments in the text (subsection âThe SAGA HAT module negatively regulates histone methylation and H2B ubiquitinationâ, first paragraph, and the Abstract, Introduction, fifth paragraph, and subsection âThe SAGA HAT module negatively regulates histone methylation and H2B ubiquitinationâ, second and fifth paragraphs) to discuss this possibility and soften our conclusions about the role of the catalytic activity. The main section now ends with âThis finding suggests that H3K79me regulation by Gcn5 depends on its catalytic activity. However, it cannot be excluded that the F221A mutation acts by other mechanisms such as altering nucleosome binding or the stability or protein folding of Gcn5.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
