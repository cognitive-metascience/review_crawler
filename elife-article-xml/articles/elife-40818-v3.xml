activation of striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs). To better understand the mechanisms underlying this deficit, striatal neurons in ex vivo brain slices from mouse genetic models of HD were studied using electrophysiological, optical and biochemical approaches. Distal dendrites of iSPNs from symptomatic HD mice were hypoexcitable, a change that was attributable to increased association of dendritic Kv4 potassium channels with auxiliary KChIP subunits. This association was negatively modulated by TrkB receptor signaling. Dendritic excitability of HD iSPNs was rescued by knocking-down expression of Kv4 channels, by disrupting KChIP binding, by restoring TrkB receptor signaling or by lowering mutant-Htt (mHtt) levels with a zinc finger protein. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that mHtt induces reversible alterations in the dendritic excitability of iSPNs that could contribute to the motor symptoms of HD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Huntington's disease</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>Kv4</kwd><kwd>KChIP</kwd><kwd>zinc finger protein</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005725</institution-id><institution>CHDI Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surmeier</surname><given-names>D James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surmeier</surname><given-names>D James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS069777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>C Savio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS34696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surmeier</surname><given-names>D James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In mouse models of Huntington's disease, striatal spiny projection neurons up-regulate dendritic potassium channels, which impairs their normal function, but a zinc finger gene therapy can reverse this deficit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuccato et al., 2010</xref>). At the outset of motor symptoms, HD patients have uncontrolled, choreic ‘dance-like’ movements. These symptoms are accompanied by down-regulation of phenotypic markers in striatal indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs), which has led to the hypothesis that the hyperkinetic symptoms are due to a loss in indirect pathway function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>What causes the deficit in iSPNs is less clear. Study of genetic HD models has implicated a large cast of potential factors that could be responsible. One of these factors is the loss of neurotrophic support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gil and Rego, 2008</xref>). Mutant Htt (mHtt) induces deficits in the synthesis, transport and release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuccato et al., 2010</xref>), as well as deficits in postsynaptic BDNF signaling through TrkB receptors (TrkBRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginés et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>). In mouse models of HD, the progressive loss of TrkBR signaling leads to the disruption of long-term potentiation (LTP) at iSPN corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>). As corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses are the principal source of excitatory input to iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolam et al., 2000</xref>), the hyperkinetic symptoms of early stage HD could be due, in part, to a deficit in the ability to appropriately activate iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plotkin and Surmeier, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a deficit in synaptic plasticity, diminished dendritic excitability also could contribute to the failure of iSPNs to be activated by cortical activity. Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels are key determinants of iSPN dendritic excitability; these channels dampen dendritic propagation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), as well as somatically generated back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day et al., 2008</xref>). Befitting their importance in dendritic integration, Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels are modulated by several signaling cascades. For example, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), which are potently activated by TrkBRs, phosphorylate Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels limiting their activation in response to membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schrader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels also are modulated by local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling; Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Cav3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels has the opposite effect of TrkBR signaling, diminishing inactivation of Kv4 channels and increasing their ability to blunt sub-threshold depolarizing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). This modulation requires an auxiliary subunit referred to as a K<sup>+</sup> channel interacting protein (KChIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vacher and Trimmer, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, although it is unclear why, KChIPs are also required for ERK phosphorylation to negatively modulate Kv4 channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrader et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>All three of these elements – KChIPs, Cav3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and TrkBRs – richly invest the distal dendrites of SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Sabatini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>) raising the possibility that they bidirectional regulate Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channel gating, as described in other neurons. This is relevant to HD as the loss of TrkBR signaling in iSPNs could enhance Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channel availability and diminish the responsiveness of iSPNs to excitatory synaptic signals necessary for movement suppression. This study was undertaken to test this hypothesis. Indeed, the dendritic excitability of iSPNs in two genetic mouse models of HD (BACHD and Q175) was depressed at an age (~6 months old) when mice became symptomatic. The reduction in dendritic excitability could be traced to enhanced opening of Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels arising from increased association of Kv4 channels with auxiliary KChIP subunits and Cav3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. This association was negatively modulated by TrkBR signaling in wild-type mice but not in HD mice. Pharmacological or genetic suppression of p75NTR signaling pathways restored the ability of TrkBR signaling to modulate Kv4 channels in HD iSPNs. Finally, striatal suppression of mHtt transcription with a zinc finger protein (ZFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garriga-Canut et al., 2012</xref>) reversed the iSPN deficits in both dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity pointing to a regionally-autonomous mechanism in the disease phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two genetic models of HD were used in these experiments: hemizygous BACHD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">André et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray et al., 2008</xref>) and heterozygous Q175 knock-in mice (Q175+/-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heikkinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menalled et al., 2012</xref>). The BACHD mouse is a transgenic model of HD in which the full-length human mHtt has been inserted using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). These mice display progressive motor and physiological deficits. At 2–3 months of age, the deficits are very modest but become more discernible by 6 months of age. To cross validate results in the BACHD model, Q175 ±mice having an Htt gene with an expanded CAG locus (175–180 repeats) were also examined; these mice also manifest a progressive motor and physiological phenotype that becomes apparent at 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heikkinen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menalled et al., 2012</xref>). To selectively sample iSPNs and neighboring direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs), these HD models were crossed into reporter lines for these two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dendritic excitability was reduced in iSPNs from HD models</title><p>To characterize the excitability of SPN dendrites, patch clamp and optical approaches were used in ex vivo striatal brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higley and Sabatini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>). To visualize dendritic trees, cells were loaded with red Alexa Fluor 568 (25 μM) with a somatic patch electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Previous work has shown that action potentials (APs) evoked in the soma of SPNs by brief current steps, back-propagate into SPN dendrites. These back-propagating APs (bAPs) transiently open voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which elevates cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Day et al., 2006</xref>). The bAP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient can be used as a surrogate measure of dendritic excitability as SPN dendrites are too small to directly record from with a patch electrode. To measure this transient, neurons were dialyzed with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye Fluo4 (100 µM) and dendritic fluorescence measured using two photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM). Brief trains of somatic bAPs were generated and line scans performed at parfocal proximal (~50 µm from soma) and distal (~100 µm from soma) dendritic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40818.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distal dendritic excitability was reduced in iSPNs from HD models.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Characterization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients induced by bAPs in dendritic spines of SPNs.

To generate reliable quantitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> estimates from fluorescence measurements three steps were taken. First, the area of the fluorescence response above baseline was calculated to generate a measure of the net Ca<sup>2+</sup> charge transferred; this minimized variability associated with dye concentrations and buffering. Second, a red, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive dye was used to locate dendrites and to monitor dye loading and changes in laser power or focal plane. Third, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> area estimate in distal dendrites was normalized by that in a proximal parfocal dendrite. This ratio will be referred to as the dendritic index. In iSPNs from 6 month old BACHD mice, the dendritic index of iSPNs was significantly smaller than that from wild-type iSPNs indicating a relative reduction in distal dendritic excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>). In contrast, there was no difference in the dendritic index of age-matched dSPNs from BACHD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). A qualitatively similar loss of distal dendritic excitability was found in iSPNs from 6 month old Q175 ±mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–h</xref>). As for BACHD dSPNs, Q175 ±dSPNs did not differ significantly from their wild-type littermates. Because all of the phenomena observed in iSPNs were the same in the two mouse models, for simplicity the two will be lumped and called HD mice (genotype data can be found in the figure legends).</p><p>Previous work had shown that there was no discernible change in the dendritic architecture of HD iSPNs at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Indersmitten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>), so physiological factors that might account for the drop in dendritic index were explored. One potential explanation for this change is that Cav3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which are preferentially located in distal dendrites of SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>), were down-regulated in HD iSPNs. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of mRNAs in iSPNs separated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) didn’t reveal any significant change in the expression of either of the two primary Cav3 channel pore-forming subunits (Cav3.2, Cav3.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reduced dendritic excitability was dependent upon Kv4 channels</title><p>Another determinant of bAP propagation and dendritic excitability in SPNs is the voltage-dependent Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day et al., 2008</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, the striatum of wild-type and HD mice were injected with adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a bicistronic expression cassette for a Kv4.2 shRNA and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP).

To directly interrogate distal dendrites, optogenetic approaches were used. For these experiments a mouse line of transgenic mice, in which channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) was expressed in a large percentage of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arenkiel et al., 2007</xref>), was crossed into the BACHD iSPN reporter line. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 µM) to block conducted activity and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 200 µM) to enhance presynaptic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>), ChR2-containing presynaptic terminals abutting spine heads were activated by a blue (473 nm) laser flash (spot size ~10 µm in diameter). Laser intensity and the number of spine heads stimulated in rapid succession were adjusted to yield a somatic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) of about 10 mV. Based upon previous work, this should have arisen from 5 to 10 neighboring synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels in regulating EPSPs, the extracellular concentration of 4-AP was increased to 2 mM after measuring the basal EPSP. Given the differences in the affinity of 4-AP for Kv1 and Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hille, 2001</xref>), this should allow the contribution of Kv4 channels to be determined. At synapses on proximal iSPN dendrites, increasing the 4-AP concentration roughly doubled the response to optogenetic activation of corticostriatal terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, left). It is worth noting that 2 mM 4-AP had little effect on EPSPs when they were in the 0.5–1 mV range at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that Kv4 channels were largely postsynaptic and required a significant depolarization to be activated. The magnitude of the 4-AP induced enhancement of EPSPs was similar at proximal synapses on HD and wild-type iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, right). To quantify the enhancement, a ‘Kv4 index’ was defined (1 R, where R was the ratio of EPSP amplitudes before and after 2 mM 4-AP; this index grows larger with increasing engagement of Kv4 channels; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). As inferred from the previous observations, the Kv4 index at proximal synapses was not different between wild-type and HD iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). At distal synapses, 2 mM 4-AP also roughly doubled the amplitude of the evoked EPSP in wild-type iSPNs (as in proximal dendrites), but in HD iSPNs the Kv4 index was significantly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f,g</xref>). This difference was consistent with the proposition that in HD iSPNs, distal dendrites were less excitable because Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels were more robustly engaged by depolarization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Upregulation of Kv4 channels was dependent upon KChIPs</title><p>Functional Kv4 channels are macromolecular complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birnbaum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibata et al., 2003</xref>).

However, there were no significant differences in Kv4 or KChIP mRNA expression between iSPNs taken from wild-type and HD mice. The qPCR results also make the point that mRNA for Kv4.2 subunits was much more abundant in iSPNs than mRNAs for either Kv4.1 or Kv4.3 subunits.</p><p>Although Kv4 mRNA expression was unchanged, it could be the case that the subcellular distribution of channels shifted toward distal dendrites in Q175 iSPNs, resulting in distal hypoexcitability. To test this possibility, iSPNs were sparsely labeled by injecting a low titre of AAV carrying a Cre-dependent tdTomato expression construct into the striatum of 6 month-old wildtype and Q175 A2a-Cre mice. After allowing time for expression of the construct, mice were sacrificed, perfused and processed for Kv4.2 immunoreactivity (IR). Next, the density of Kv4.2 IR in proximal (&lt;80 µm from soma) and distal (&gt;100 µm from soma) dendrites of iSPNs was assessed from deconvolved, confocal z-stacks using a proximity algorithm (Imaris Coloc, see Materials and methods).

One way is to increase Kv4 protein expression and surface trafficking. However, Kv4.2 protein in the HD striatum was not greater than that in littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>) suggesting this was not their mode of action in HD iSPNs (although a relative increase in surface expression cannot be excluded). Another way in which KChIP2 enhances Kv4 channel function is by increasing channel availability in response to depolarization and an elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Cav3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which are enriched in distal dendrites of SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plotkin et al., 2011</xref>), can form a signaling complex with KChIPs and Kv4 channels in cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>).

To determine if lowering mHtt with a ZFP could restore TrkBR-dependent LTP in symptomatic mice, the same strategy was used as described above; that is, HD (Q175+/-) mice and littermate controls were injected with ZFP-AAV and nbZFP-AAV at 6 months of age and then sacrificed 4–6 months later for electrophysiological analysis. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>), after dialysis with a Cs<sup>+</sup>-containing solution to block K<sup>+</sup> channels, EPSPs were evoked by uncaging glutamate on 8–16 neighboring spines on distal dendrites of iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). In the presence of BDNF (50 ng/ml), an A2a adenosine receptor agonist (CGS21680, 200 nM), NMDA (5 µM) and glycine (5 µM), the somatic membrane was depolarized to −20 mV (1 s) four times, ‘resting’ for 10 s between depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Then, the same spines were interrogated by glutamate uncaging at regular intervals (5, 10, 15 min) to determine whether there had been any lasting change in synaptic strength. In wild-type iSPNs, this protocol led to reliable LTP of axospinous synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>). However, in iSPNs from HD mice infected with the vector containing the nbZFP construct, LTP was not observed, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>).

Thus, our studies not only provide new insight into how dendritic Kv4 channel function in iSPNs is regulated by TrkBR signaling and how this goes awry in HD, they suggest that a regional gene therapy could be of therapeutic value to symptomatic HD patients.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kv4 channel up-regulation induced dendritic hypoexcitability</title><p>Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels regulate the dendritic propagation of bAPs, as well as the response to local, synaptic depolarization in many neurons, including SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnston et al., 2000</xref>). By modulating bAP amplitude, Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channels control opening of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx making bAP-evoked alterations in dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration a suitable surrogate measure of Kv4 channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Sabatini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Day et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Häusser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnston et al., 2003</xref>). To allow for comparisons of dendritic bAP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals between neurons, the distal dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was normalized by that taken in a parfocal proximal dendrite. In addition, the fluorescence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator was corrected for other optical variables by using the fluorescence of a red dye as a normalization factor (ΔG/R). In iSPNs from both BACHD and Q175 HD mice, the ratio of distal to proximal bAP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were smaller than in age-matched, wild-type iSPNs; this deficit was corrected by knocking down the expression of Kv4.2 subunits or by pharmacologically inhibiting Kv4 channels with 4-AP. The up-regulation in distal dendritic Kv4 channels in HD iSPNs also was manifested in the response to locally evoked synaptic responses, as 2 mM 4-AP enhanced the amplitude of optically evoked EPSPs in the distal dendrites of HD iSPNs more than in wild-type iSPNs.</p><p>The up-regulation in Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channel currents in HD iSPNs was not attributable to a change in the expression of Kv4 subunit genes in HD striata, but rather to their association with KChIPs. Previous work in other systems has shown that auxiliary KChIP subunits not only can enhance Kv4 channel trafficking to the membrane, but they can also increase the opening of Kv4 channels in response to depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kunjilwar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibata et al., 2003</xref>). Although the density of Kv4 immunoreactivity in the striatal neuropil made these experiments difficult, there was no discernible difference in the density of these channels in the proximal and distal dendrites of wildtype and Q175 iSPN dendrites – arguing against a primary role for trafficking. Nonetheless our data are consistent with the proposition KChIPs enhanced the function of Kv4 channels in HD iSPNs. Four observations support this conclusion. First, in striatal membrane extracts, Kv4.2 channels formed protein complex with KChIPs and Cav3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kunjilwar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibata et al., 2003</xref>). Second, dialysis with a pan-KChIP or KChIP2 antibody that disrupts the interaction between Kv4.2 and KChIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>) normalized the dendritic response to bAPs and to local synaptic stimulation. Finally, blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Cav3 channels, which also complex with KChIPs and serve as a source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to regulate the positive gating interaction of KChIPs on Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turner and Zamponi, 2014</xref>), blunted the ability of Kv4 channels to modulate EPSPs evoked in distal dendrites.</p><p>Our studies found no evidence supporting the proposition that an alteration in Cav3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel expression or function contributed to the HD iSPN phenotype. The expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was not changed in Q175 iSPNs and Kv4 K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibition normalized the EPSPs produced by distal uncaging of glutamate. But, a causal role for Cav Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels cannot be completely excluded. Moreover, alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling might have contributed to our observations in other ways. In HD models, there is increased ryanodine receptor (RYR) mediated release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>). As RYR-mediated release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores adds to the bAP-evoked dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plotkin et al., 2013</xref>), it is possible that boosting this signal augmented KChIP-dependent facilitation of Kv4 channel opening.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Kv4 and KChIP association was regulated by TrkBR signaling</title><p>Although it was evident that an increased association of KChIP proteins with Kv4 channel subunits was responsible for the suppression of dendritic excitability in HD iSPNs it was less clear what caused the change. There was no detectable increase in the expression of any KChIP mRNA in HD striata. One other well-known regulator of Kv4 channel gating is phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffman and Johnston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuan et al., 2002</xref>). The C-terminal region of the Kv4.2 subunit has several sites that are phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases like ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schrader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrader et al., 2006</xref>). Phosphorylation of these sites decreases Kv4 channel opening in response to depolarization by increasing steady-state inactivation. Association of Kv4 subunits with KChIPs is necessary for the effects of phosphorylation on gating to be seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrader et al., 2006</xref>). Given that phosphorylation and KChIP association have the opposite effect on Kv4 gating, it was possible that the effects of phosphorylation were mediated by dissociation of the KChIP subunit. While KChIPs bind to the N-terminal region of Kv4 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gulbis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sewing et al., 1996</xref>), this region is projected to come in close physical proximity to the C-terminal phosphorylation sites in a native channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jerng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2004</xref>) lending some plausibility to the hypothesis. Indeed, in wild-type striata, stimulation of TrkBRs with BDNF significantly decreased the association of Kv4 channels with KChIPs and increased dendritic excitability in iSPNs measured either with bAPs or local synaptic stimulation.</p><p>This inference provides a ready explanation for why Kv4 channels in HD iSPN dendrites were more readily engaged by depolarization. Previous work has shown that TrkBR signaling is blunted in HD iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these previous results, phosphorylation of Kv4.2 subunits at two C-terminal sites (Thr607, 602) was reduced in HD striata. Moreover, BDNF stimulation of TrkBRs in HD striata failed to alter the association of KChIPs and Kv4.2 subunits, unlike wild-type striata. The deficit in TrkBR signaling in iSPNs is attributable to up-regulation in p75NTR signaling through ROCK and PTEN, not to any deficit in TrkBR expression or coupling to Ras/c-Raf or PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of ROCK rescued the ability of BDNF and TrkBR signaling to dissociate Kv4.2 subunits from KChIPs in HD striata. Moreover, ROCK inhibition restored the ability of TrkBR signaling to increase the response to synaptic stimulation in HD iSPNs. Lastly, inhibiting other elements in the p75NTR signaling cascade – p75NTRs themselves or PTEN – also rescued dendritic excitability in HD iSPNs following exposure to BDNF. All these lines of evidence support the conclusion that the down-regulation of dendritic excitability in HD iSPNs was mediated – at least in part – by the failure of TrkBR signaling to promote phosphorylation of Kv4.2 subunits and dis-association of KChIPs. Thus, the disruption in TrkBR signaling in HD models results not only in impaired potentiation of excitatory synapses, but in dendritic hypoexcitability. This coordinated deficit should make it more difficult to appropriately activate the basal ganglia indirect pathway and suppress unwanted movements providing a mechanistic foundation for early hyperkinetic features of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1992</xref>). mHtt effects were reversible and regionally autonomous</p><p>Why iSPNs are preferentially vulnerable in human HD patients remains unresolved. It has been hypothesized that iSPN vulnerability in HD is actually secondary to the failure of cortical neurons to synthesize and transport BDNF to the striatum, which is necessary for normal iSPN function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Virlogeux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuccato et al., 2010</xref>). While a transport deficit may contribute to the phenotype in mouse HD models there are striatal TrkBR signaling deficits that precede any discernible reduction in cortically-derived BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plotkin et al., 2014</xref>). It also is difficult to understand how a global deficit in cortical delivery of BDNF to the striatum might selectively alter iSPN excitability; neighboring dSPNs also express TrkBRs and there is no evidence that these two SPN populations are innervated by different cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kress et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobo et al., 2010</xref>). However, these two types of SPN have a wide range of intrinsic differences that could underlie their disparity in sensitivity to mHtt expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heiman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In support of the proposition that there is regional autonomy to the HD phenotype striatally-delivered ZFPs targeting the CAG repeat domain of mHtt reversed the dendritic excitability deficits in HD iSPNs. These experiments also demonstrate that the consequences of mHtt expression on striatal physiology are reversible, at least in the near-term, in agreement with previous work arguing that the continuous supply of mutant protein was necessary to maintain the disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>A key translational question is whether therapeutic strategies targeting a single region of the basal ganglia or cerebral cortex will be able to ameliorate the HD symptoms, in spite of the widespread expression of mHtt. The circuits most affected in HD are synaptically coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Plotkin and Surmeier, 2015</xref>) making it possible that a deficit in one node of the network is responsible for pathophysiology elsewhere. If this were the case, regionally-targeted gene therapies would become an option for patients. The demonstration that regionally autonomous mechanisms control the iSPN HD phenotype appear to make the striatum a necessary therapeutic node. However, it is not clear that this node will turn out to be sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Brain slice preparation</title><p>Transverse corticostriatal or parasagittal slices (300 or 275 μm thickness) were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawaguchi et al., 1989</xref>) from PD80-90 for asymptomatic animals and PD180-210 for symptomatic mice.

After centrifugation (16,000 g 10 min), supernatants containing 200 μg membrane protein were incubated with 5 μg goat anti-Kv4.2 antibody (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 μg rabbit anti-Kv1.2 antibody (ThermoFisher PA5-23006), or 5 μg anti-panKChIP antibody (Neuromab 75–006), or, as IP negative control, 5 ug of normal goat IgG (Thermo Scientific) overnight at 4°C with constant mixing. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out using Pierce Classic Magnetic Co-IP Kit (Thermo Scientific) following the instructions. Briefly, the mixtures were incubated with protein A/G magnetic beads at room temperature for 1 hr to bring down the antigen-antibody complexes. The beads were then washed two times with Pierce IP wash buffer and once with pure water. Immunocomplexes were eluted using 60 μl elution buffer and the low pH neutralized by adding neutralization buffer. Samples were prepared in NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies to pan-KChIP (Neuromab 75–006, 1:1000), KChIP2 (Neuromab 75–004, 1:1000), Cav3.2 (Alomone ACC-025, 1:200), Cav1.3 (gift from Amy Lee, 1:1000), phospho-Kv4.2 (Thr607, Santa Cruz sc-377545, 1:200), phospho-Kv4.2 (Thr602, Santa Cruz sc-377574, 1:500), Kv1.2 (Neuromab 75–008, 1:500) and Kv4.2 (Neuromab 75–016, 1:1000) were used for Western blotting. Target protein bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling) and enhanced chemiluminescent reagent SuperSignal West Dura (Thermo Scientific). Intensities of the target protein bands were detected by Odyssey Fc (Li-Cor) and quantified in Image Studio (Li-Cor).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ZFP constructs</title><p>The plasmid (pVAX −30645) containing allele selective ZFP repressor cDNA and non-binding ZFP cDNA (CHDI-90001486) were obtained from Sigma and CHDI. 1646 bp ZFP and the 1180 bp non-binding ZFP inserts were subcloned and packaged into AAV9 by Virovek (Hayward, CA). The expression of N-term NLS and C-term FLAG tagged human mutant Htt-repressor ZFP and tdTomato is bridged by viral 2A cleavage peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell line</title><p>STHdh Q7/111 was obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research's HD Community Biorepository (Coriell ref# CHDI-90000072; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_DN41">CVCL_DN41</ext-link>). STHdh Q7/111 is a striatal derived cell line from a knock in transgenic mouse containing heterozygous Huntingtin (Htt) loci with a humanized Exon 1 with 111 polyglutamine repeats. The status of mycoplasma contamination was not reported. Cells were plated in 12 well plates and then infected with AAV carrying ZFP-30645 or nonbinding ZFP after overnight incubation and harvested after 72 hr of infection for RNA isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>ZFP mediation suppression of mHtt in A2a-Q175 HETs</title><p>Stereotaxic injections of AAV carrying ZFP and tdTomato genes were made in striatum (ML = −1.7, AP = 0.98, DV = −3.6) of isoflurane-anesthetized 4-month-old A2a-EGFP and A2a-EGFP/Q175 mice. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 2 months post-injection. Q175 Mice and their WT litter-mates were randomly chosen from a large breeding colony comprised of multiple litters based on appropriate age. All mice were ear-tagged and the injections given and recorded by a technician. After recording and data analysis, the tag numbers were matched to the data sample so the data could be assigned to the appropriate test group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Image analysis of striatal coronal sections</title><p>Coronal sections spaced 100 μm apart comprising rostral, middle and caudal levels of the striatum were examined with confocal microscope (Fluoview Olympus). Confocal images of the entire slices were created under low power while 60X images were taken to visualize individual cells. For each coronal section, the entire three-dimensional stack of images from the ventral surface to the top of the section was obtained by using the Z drive and subsequently collapsed. Quantitative analyses of SPN infection rates were performed using the ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). EGFP (iSPNs), tdTomato (ZFP) and blue (DAPI) cells were counted from the confocal images to determine the percent of ZFP-tdTomato expressing cells and the percent of eGFP expressing iSPNs from the total DAPI stained cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantitative analysis of 3d dendritic colocalization of kv 4.2 channels</title><p>Stereotaxic injections of AAV-EF1-Flex-tdTomato were made in striatum (ML = 1.9, AP = 0.98, DV = −3.8) of isoflurane anesthetized 6–8 months old A2a-Cre/Q175 mice and wild-type littermates. Three weeks later, mice were transcardially perfused with saline followed by freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Free-floating 80 µm thick sections were obtained using a vibratome and processed for immunolabeling. Sections were blocked in solution containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4 for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were then labeled overnight at 4°C with primary antibody to Kv4.2 (Neuromab 75–361, 1:100). Following three 10 min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:400 for 30 min. Sections were rinsed and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs, R.I. 1.45). Confocal images were captured using Nikon A1R confocal laser microscope system with 100 x objective (N.A. 1.45). Z-stacks were deconvolved using AutoQuant 3 (Media Cybernetics) with Adaptive PSF (blind) method and theoretical PSF settings. Image were processed in Imaris Image Analysis (Bitplane). Threshold cutoff was used for background substraction in green channel (Kv 4.2 labeling). New surfaces were added to the volume rendered of proximal or distal dendrites labeled with tdTomato to create masked channel. ImarisColoc with automatic selection of the thresholds (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costes et al., 2004</xref>) was used to determine and quantify the colocalization. Random images generated by smoothing white noise with a Gaussian PSF of the specified width that have 0 or one correlation where excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Pharmacological reagents</title><p>Stock solutions were prepared before experiments and added to the perfusion solution or focally applied with pressure ejection in the final concentration indicated. Two-photon laser uncaging and optogenetic experiments were performed in the presence of 2 μM TTX and 200 μM 4-AP. The ROCK2 inhibitor SR3850 was obtained from CHDI (CHDI-00484785).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data was graphically presented using non-parametric box and whisker plots. In these plots, the center line is the median, the edges of the box mark the interquartiles of the distribution and the lines extend to the limiting values of the sample distribution; outliers (defined as values further away from the median than 1.5XInterquartile range) are marked as asterisks. Statistical significance was determined using non-parametric tests running on GraphPad Prism Version 5.0 (GraphPad Software).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Vivian Hernandez for initial characterization of the Kv4.2 shRNA.

The study shows that excitability in the distal, but not proximal, dendrites of indirect pathway spiny neurons (iSPNs) is sharply regulated by Kv4 currents, and that in slices from the mutant lines there is a reduction in function that can be explained by an increase in these currents. The authors do a thorough study of the mechanism, using down-regulation of Kv4 through shRNA, antibodies to KChIP2, and modulation of signaling pathways known to be impaired in HD. They further provide evidence that signaling through the TrkBR rescues the deficits in dendritic excitability, and is associated with a decrease in association of KChIP2 with Kv4.2 (and presumably with Cav3.2, although this was not assayed). The results are consistent with the model that in HD models, the distal dendrites of iSPNs have reduced excitability that can be rescued with reduction of Kv4 activation, inhibiting ROCK, or providing BDNF. They go a step further, showing that the effects of the mutant huntingtin is cell autonomous by expressing a zinc finger protein that reduces the mHtt mRNA only in iSPNs. In these cells, dendritic excitability was maintained in a normal state, supporting the cell autonomous hypothesis. Knocking down expression of mutant huntingtin protein in striatum restored dendritic excitability and LTP in spiny projection neurons, providing evidence supporting a causal link between the presence of the mutant protein and altered dendritic signaling. The authors point out that their zinc finger protein also has translational potential.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The LTP data presented in Figure 7 is a bit of a disconnect with the other presented data. An implicit assumption that could be made by readers is that the mechanisms described in Figures 1-6 (related to Kv4 channels and dendritic excitability) somehow give rise to the loss of LTP. While there may be some relationship, it is not explicitly tested in Figure 7, where the authors dialyze iSPNs with Cesium to block K-channels. The results in Figure 7 seem like a non-sequitur, showing that the ZFP can also restore LTP (although almost certainly through a different mechanism in those experiments). The authors should make it clear in the manuscript, ideally in both the Results section and Discussion section, that the rescue of LTP by the ZFP is not through the same mechanism described in the rest of the paper (regulation of Kv4 channels). Alternatively, the last figure could simply be deleted.</p><p>2) The evidence supporting the overall molecular mechanism as presented in Figure 4A and 4F, namely that mutant huntingtin protein and BDNF signaling impact dendritic excitability through effects on the association of Kv4.2/KChIP2/Cav3.2. The authors should perform multilabel immunohistochemistry experiments to determine whether the expression levels of these proteins is altered in the distal dendrites of spiny projection neurons (i.e., in the striatal neuropil) of HD mice versus WT. These data would provide a huge increase in spatial resolution above the samples of homogenized whole striatum that were used for the RT-PCR and immunoblot experiments, and could be performed on samples from the same mice used throughout this study that selectively express GFP in iSPNs, so proximal versus distal dendrites of GFP-positive iSPNs can be distinguished. All of the antibodies used here work well for immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry in mouse brain. The analyses of mRNA and protein levels samples prepared from striatum do not provide spatial resolution as to expression levels in the site under study (the distal dendrites of spiny projection neurons), and given the established role of KChIPs in trafficking, one could imagine a scenario in which the overall expression levels of Kv4.2 are unchanged, but its levels in distal dendrites are substantially altered. This would also address whether the ratio of Kv4.2 and KChIP2 are altered in distal dendrites, and whether there is replacement of KChIP2 with one of the other KChIPs present in these cells and that may not have the same impact on Kv4.2 and/or the Kv4:KChIP:Cav3 complex.</p><p>3) The co-IP experiments that further support this model should also be strengthened. Specifically, the authors use non-immune IgG as a negative control. While this is commonly used, it is not rigorous as IgG pulls down nothing, and does not provide compelling evidence that what is pulled down with a target-specific antibody that is effective at IP'ing something is specifically co-IP'd with that target, or would come down with the effective IP of any target protein from the same samples. A much stronger control is to successfully IP related but distinct proteins present in these samples (e.g., other potassium channel subunits such as Kv1 or Kv2 channels and their auxiliary subunits) and show that these IPs have the target but lack the components of what the authors argue is the dedicated and specific association of Kv4.2:KChIP2:Cav3.2.</p><p>4) Much of the data regarding physiology and rescue can also be explained by reductions in Cav conductances that can't be detected using mRNA levels. When the authors downregulate/down-modify closely associated K channels/subunits, more Ca will come in. Are there any further data that rule out a primary role of Ca channel pathology? If so, please add these; if not, the authors need to consider and discuss this in the manuscript. The experiments suggested above under 2 and 3 will also help to provide information on this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40818.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The LTP data presented in Figure 7 is a bit of a disconnect with the other presented data.

Our working hypothesis was that lowering mHtt would restore TrkBR signaling to iSPNs and in so doing re-establish normalize dendritic excitability. It did so. However, it was possible that lowering mHtt was altering dendritic excitability in other ways. Another dendritic phenomenon that is dependent upon TrkBR signaling is LTP. Sure enough, ZFP-mediated lowering of mHtt also restored LTP, providing added confidence to the assertion that TrkBR signaling had been rescued. In the revision, the logic is more clearly laid out and it is stated that the restoration of LTP is not a consequence of restoration of Kv4.2 function but rather that of TrkBR signaling. Moreover, references to the LTP experiments have been eliminated from the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The evidence supporting the overall molecular mechanism as presented in Figure 4A and 4F, namely that mutant huntingtin protein and BDNF signaling impact dendritic excitability through effects on the association of Kv4.2/KChIP2/Cav3.2.

However, to our knowledge, this type of analysis has never been performed in brain tissue from adult mice. Nevertheless, we recruited an expert (Ema Ilijic, added as a co-author) in the immunocytochemical localization of proteins to the project in an attempt to do so. To this end, we used sparse labeling of iSPNs using AAV delivery of a Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter to fill iSPNs in 6 month-old wildtype and Q175 mice. Next, Kv4.2 immunoreactivity was localized using well-characterized antibodies (NeuroMab). Confocal microscopy was then used to acquire images of the striatum. Lastly, z-stacks obtained in this way were deconvolved and then analyzed using ImarisColoc to determine the distribution of Kv4.2 protein in proximal and distal dendrites of iSPNs. This new set of studies found no difference in the dendritic distribution of Kv4.2 protein in wildtype and zQ175 iSPNs (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In addition, the Discussion section has been edited to make the reader aware of the possibility that we cannot exclude the possibility that there are other combinations of the channel complex that were differentially distributed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The co-IP experiments that further support this model should also be strengthened.

Kv1.2 protein is abundant in the striatum (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) and was pulled down by the Kv1.2 antibody (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). However, the Kv1.2 antibody did not pull-down KChIP2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). These results support the proposition that the association between Kv4.2 and KChIP2 was specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Much of the data regarding physiology and rescue can also be explained by reductions in Cav conductances that can't be detected using mRNA levels.

Nevertheless, in the Discussion section of the revision, the possibility that altered function of distal Cav3 channels contributed to the observations is acknowledged.</p></body></sub-article></article>
