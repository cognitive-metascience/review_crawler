We hypothesized that focal hippocampal damage is associated with changes across the extended hippocampal system and that these, rather than hippocampal atrophy per se, would explain variability in memory between patients. We assessed this hypothesis in a uniquely large cohort of patients (n = 38) after autoimmune limbic encephalitis, a syndrome associated with focal structural hippocampal pathology. These patients showed impaired recall, recognition and maintenance of new information, and remote autobiographical amnesia. Besides hippocampal atrophy, we observed correlatively reduced thalamic and entorhinal cortical volume, resting-state inter-hippocampal connectivity and activity in posteromedial cortex. Associations of hippocampal volume with recall, recognition, and remote memory were fully mediated by wider network abnormalities, and were only direct in forgetting. Network abnormalities may explain the variability across studies of amnesia and speak to debates in memory neuroscience.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>amnesia</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>limbic encephalitis</kwd><kwd>cingulate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104079/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irani</surname><given-names>Sarosh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCB-Oxford University Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irani</surname><given-names>Sarosh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000374</institution-id><institution>British Medical Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vera Down Grant (2013)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irani</surname><given-names>Sarosh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000374</institution-id><institution>British Medical Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Margaret Temple Grant (2017)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irani</surname><given-names>Sarosh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000295</institution-id><institution>Epilepsy Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P1201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irani</surname><given-names>Sarosh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000592</institution-id><institution>US-UK Fulbright Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MS-SOCIETY research AWARD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irani</surname><given-names>Sarosh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K010395/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>Christopher R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hippocampal damage is associated with changes across the extended hippocampal system, and these may explain variability in memory between patients presenting with hippocampal amnesia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ever since the first report of the famous patient H.M. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>), hippocampal (HPC) amnesia has played a fundamental role in the neuroscience of human memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">MacPherson and Della Sala, 2019</xref>). Studies of amnesic patients have, however, often produced inconsistent results. Such studies have been criticized for attributing behavioral deficits solely to the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Squire and Wixted, 2011</xref>), despite the fact that focal damage may trigger more subtle structural and functional abnormalities across an extended HPC system, involving the thalamus and cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggleton, 2014</xref>). Indeed, broader network abnormalities are well documented in other ‘focal’ conditions [e.g. ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Veldsman et al., 2018</xref>)] and have been demonstrated in small case series of amnesic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hayes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>). These abnormalities may be important in understanding memory impairment in neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addis et al., 2007</xref>) but their explanatory potential is under-explored.</p><p>We propose that network abnormalities are key to understanding inconsistencies that underpin central debates about HPC function in amnesia research. One such debate centers on the dissociation of neurocognitive processes underlying fundamental aspects of anterograde retrieval. Some authors hold that recall relies on HPC-dependent recollection processes, whereas recognition additionally draws on familiarity, which is mediated by non-HPC structures within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown and Aggleton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kafkas et al., 2016</xref>). Others argue that recollection and familiarity do not dissociate within the MTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wixted and Squire, 2010</xref>). Related to the above, some theorists posit that HPC processing is material-specific, whereby the HPC holds a privileged role in processing scenes or spatial stimuli and this function underpins its involvement in episodic memory and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Maguire and Mullally, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Graham et al., 2010</xref>). An opposing view holds that the primary role of the HPC is the material-independent maintenance of information over a limited time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). A second, long-standing debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cassel and Kopelman, 2019</xref>), pertains to the presence of abnormal (accelerated) forgetting in HPC amnesia. Whereas some reports have provided evidence for abnormal forgetting after MTL damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Huppert and Piercy, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Isaac and Mayes, 1999</xref>), other studies have reported normal forgetting rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freed et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kopelman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">McKee and Squire, 1992</xref>). A third debate pertains to the HPC role in remote memory. The ‘standard consolidation theory’ holds that newly-acquired memories initially depend upon the HPC but that, through a process of ‘consolidation’, memory traces gradually become HPC-independent and are stored in and retrieved by neocortical structures alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hardt and Nadel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Squire et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, ‘multiple trace theory’ proposes that the HPC is necessary for vivid episodic recollection irrespective of the age of the memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Moscovitch et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A central problem for addressing these debates with neuropsychology and, more specifically, for determining the relevance of wider brain network abnormalities, is that HPC amnesia is very rare. Consequently, most studies rely upon just a handful of amnesic cases and are thus susceptible to confounds such as impairment severity, measurement noise and individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lambon Ralph et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lambon Ralph et al., 2002</xref>). Larger cohort studies would partially overcome these confounds and capitalize on case heterogeneity to map behavior to brain structure and function.</p><p>In order to explore the impact of HPC damage on wider brain networks and determine the impact of these abnormalities upon memory, we studied a uniquely large cohort (n = 38) of patients after autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE). In its acute phase, this highly consistent clinical syndrome classically causes focal HPC damage, seen on MRI as high T2 signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kotsenas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Loane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Malter et al., 2014</xref>). Although most patients respond well to early immunosuppressive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Irani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>), some subsequently develop HPC atrophy and persistent cognitive impairment, the most prominent aspect of which is anterograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Butler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Irani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Loane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Malter et al., 2014</xref>). Autoimmune LE patients are often included in studies of HPC amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hassabis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Henson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Maguire et al., 2006</xref>). Post-mortem studies demonstrate focal HPC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Khan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Park et al., 2007</xref>), contrasting with the wider damage typically found following other encephalitides [e.g. herpes simplex encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Damasio and Van Hoesen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gitelman et al., 2001</xref>)] or global ischemia/anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huang and Castillo, 2008</xref>), conditions that have also been used as models of human HPC function (for discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Squire and Zola, 1996</xref>). Animal models have also shown focal limbic involvement (HPC, amygdala) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tröscher et al., 2017</xref>). Patients’ varying degrees of residual symptom severity offered us the opportunity to examine the relationships between cognition and brain structure and function.</p><p>Patients (n = 38) and healthy controls (n = 41) were assessed with a thorough battery of neuropsychological tests of episodic memory (for verbal and visual material) and other cognitive functions, in order to identify the tasks in which patients showed impaired performance. The tests we employed are robust, widely used, well-normed, and largely model-free (see below). Using manual volumetry of MTL regions, as well as whole-brain, voxel-based investigations of structural MRI, we identified regions of gray matter (GM) volume reduction in patients as compared with healthy controls. Using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), we also identified resting-state functional abnormalities in patients with respect to both segregation and integration, that is in terms of hemodynamic activity in local regions (resting-state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; rsALFF) and functional connectivity between regions (resting-state functional connectivity; rsFC). Finally, we investigated the relationships between brain abnormalities and cognitive deficits. We predicted that: i) HPC damage (documented to occur focally in autoimmune LE) would be accompanied by remote abnormalities in hubs of the extended HPC system, including the HPC-diencephalic-cingulate network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggleton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bubb et al., 2017</xref>); ii) variation in the extent of these network-wide abnormalities across patients would explain variability in memory impairment over and above HPC atrophy; iii) Moreover, on our assumption that HPC damage leads to broader network disruption, we predicted that relationships between HPC atrophy and memory impairment would be mediated by this network disruption. This prediction is in line with recent functional imaging and lesion studies that emphasize the importance of broader networks in episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cook et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Inhoff and Ranganath, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schedlbauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Watrous et al., 2013</xref>); iv) taking these abnormalities into account would enable us to identify which particular aspects of memory impairment are a direct function of HPC atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our analysis approach is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Their cognitive profile was characterized by highly focal episodic memory impairment. Patients were impaired in both recall and recognition of both verbal and visual material (including scenes), and showed pronounced forgetting of visual material – verbal forgetting was marginally impaired. A clear exception was patients’ preserved face recognition memory. They also showed impaired remote autobiographical memory for both childhood and early adulthood epochs, but preserved remote personal semantic memory.

We used a series of bivariate correlations and mediation analyses, with HPC volume as the independent variable, thalamic volume as the mediator variable, and rsALFF in the PCC as the dependent variable. A mediation analysis supported this hypothesis, showing that the effects of the average GM volume reduction in the HPC VBM clusters on patients’ reduced rsALFF in the PCC were fully mediated by the correlative reduction of the average GM volume of the thalamic VBM clusters (direct effect: β = 0.26, p=0.064; indirect effect: β = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.004,0.403); a: mean GM volume of the two HPC clusters correlated with the mean GM volume of the two thalamic clusters across patients; b: mean PCC rsALFF correlated across patients with the mean GM volume of the two thalamic clusters; the mediation analysis demonstrates that this effect held when the correlation of thalamic GM volume with the mean GM volume of the HPC clusters was accounted for; c: mean GM volume of the HPC clusters correlated with PCC rsALFF; the mediation analysis demonstrated that this relationship did not hold over and above the correlation of the mean GM volume of the thalamic clusters with the HPC clusters; there was thus no direct effect of reduced HPC GM volume on PCC rsALFF (within parenthesis: 95% confidence intervals); GM: gray matter; HPC: hippocampus; MAP: Memory and Amnesia Project; OPTIMA: Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; rsALFF: resting-state amplitude of low frequency fluctuations; TIV: total intracranial volume; VBM: voxel-based morphometry; z-res: GM volumes from VBM clusters are residualized against age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV across participants; mean rsALFF is residualized against age and sex across participants.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2s1sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46156.007</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>This spreadsheet contains the mean GM volume of the HPC and thalamic VBM clusters and the mean rsALFF in the PCC cluster (z-res) for healthy controls and patients that are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; GM: gray matter; HPC: hippocampus; MAP: Memory and Amnesia Project; OPTIMA: Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; rsALFF: resting-state amplitude of low frequency fluctuations; TIV: total intracranial volume; VBM: voxel-based morphometry; z-res: GM volumes from VBM clusters are residualized against age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV across participants; mean rsALFF is residualized against age and sex across participants.</title><p>These data can be opened with Microsoft Excel or with open-source alternatives such as OpenOffice.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-46156-fig2-figsupp1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46156-fig2-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46156.008</object-id><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>GM volume reduction in autoimmune LE patients (whole-brain VBM).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top">kE</th><th colspan="5" valign="top">Peak</th><th colspan="3" valign="top">Center of mass</th><th rowspan="2" valign="top">Structure</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">p-FWE</th><th valign="top">T</th><th valign="top">X</th><th valign="top">Y</th><th valign="top">Z</th><th valign="top">X</th><th valign="top">Y</th><th valign="top">Z</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2574</td><td>&lt;0.0005</td><td>7.53</td><td>28</td><td>−17</td><td>−20</td><td valign="bottom">28</td><td>−16</td><td>−18</td><td valign="bottom">R HPC</td></tr><tr><td>910</td><td>&lt;0.0005</td><td>6.81</td><td>−29</td><td>−12</td><td>−18</td><td valign="bottom">−27</td><td>−15</td><td>−19</td><td valign="bottom">L HPC</td></tr><tr><td>113</td><td>0.002</td><td>6.18</td><td>19</td><td>−28</td><td>5</td><td valign="bottom">18</td><td>−26</td><td>6</td><td valign="bottom">R lateral thalamus</td></tr><tr><td>414</td><td>0.006</td><td>5.85</td><td>-1</td><td>−16</td><td>0</td><td valign="bottom">3</td><td>−12</td><td>7</td><td valign="bottom">anterior/mediodorsal thalamus</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Contrast: controls &gt; patients; covariates: age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV.

The spatially unsmoothed timeseries data were extracted from participants’ manually delineated right HPC in native space, ensuring that rsFC differences were not an artefact of insufficient co-registration of the atrophic HPC. This seed region showed reduced rsFC with clusters in the medial prefrontal and posteromedial (PCC, retrosplenial, and precuneus) cortices, and the left HPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–g</xref>). We also wanted to ensure that the left HPC cluster that showed reduced rsFC with the right HPC was not a result of suboptimal co-registration of the functional images with the atrophic HPC. For further correlational analyses (section below), we thus used the mean rsFC values between the right and left HPC in native space (unsmoothed time series) instead of the left HPC cluster. Patients’ reduced inter-HPC rsFC (of all 13 structural and functional abnormalities) negatively correlated, across patients, with the delay between the onset of their symptoms and the time they underwent our research MRI (Supplementary Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structure/Function-Behavior Correlations</title><p>Having identified the core brain abnormalities in our patient group, we investigated the contributions of these to explaining memory impairment.</p><p>We first applied a stringent correction for multiple testing for the total number of correlations conducted (n = 39) between the brain abnormalities identified (n = 13; right/left HPC volumes and right entorhinal cortical volumes, based on manual delineation; left thalamic volumes, based on automated segmentation; anterior-mediodorsal and right dorsolateral thalamic volumes and right/left HPC volumes, expressed by the VBM clusters above; reduced rsALFF in the precuneus and the PCC; reduced rsFC between the right HPC and the left HPC, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the precuneus) and the three composite memory scores (n = 3; anterograde retrieval; anterograde retention; remote autobiographical memory).

We examined the brain abnormalities underlying episodic memory impairment in autoimmune LE, a clinical syndrome in which acute, focal inflammation in the HPC leads, in the long-term, to HPC atrophy and amnesia. We hypothesized that HPC damage would be accompanied by remote effects on the structure and function of the extended HPC system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>), and that these abnormalities would be instrumental in explaining patients’ anterograde and retrograde amnesia.</p><p>Consistent with previous investigations in smaller cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Butler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Irani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Malter et al., 2014</xref>), our patients showed selective deficits in episodic memory, in the face of normal visuomotor, language, executive function, general and personal semantic memory performance. Episodic memory impairment was evident across a broad range of tests that have been extensively used in studies of MTL amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bayley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). In terms of anterograde memory, patients showed impaired visual and verbal recall and recognition memory, and pronounced forgetting of visual material. Examining retrograde amnesia, we found striking loss of remote autobiographical memories from childhood and early adulthood.</p><p>The focal HPC high T2 signal on clinical MRI from the acute disease phase was followed by pronounced HPC atrophy and less pronounced right entorhinal cortical volume reduction within the MTL. However, patients also showed volume reduction in specific midline and lateral thalamic regions, along with reduced rsALFF in the PCC and precuneus, and reduced rsFC between the right HPC and the left HPC, the medial prefrontal and posteromedial cortices - regions known to interact closely with the HPC in the healthy brain.</p><p>These wider network abnormalities were associated with memory performance over and above HPC atrophy, and also fully mediated the relationships between HPC atrophy and memory performance. The only direct effect of HPC atrophy we observed was on forgetting, and no other brain abnormalities showed such an effect. Our results highlight the need to take into account remote changes in brain structure and function associated with HPC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggleton, 2014</xref>), since these may explain specific aspects of anterograde and retrograde amnesia and help identify others that may be a direct function of HPC atrophy per se.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Abnormalities in the extended HPC system following HPC atrophy</title><p>We found bilaterally marked HPC atrophy and less significant right entorhinal cortical volume reduction using the gold standard of manual volumetry for MTL structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). Automated segmentation of other subcortical structures disclosed left thalamic volume reduction.</p><p>However, our uniquely large cohort also enabled us to examine subtle structural abnormalities across the whole brain in a voxel-wise fashion. Using this method, volume reduction was observed in anterior-dorsomedial and dorsolateral thalamic regions, the nuclei within which are known to interact with the HPC and cingulate cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggleton et al., 2010</xref>). Our cross-sectional design cannot conclusively show that these extra-HPC abnormalities occurred as a consequence of HPC damage, an issue that needs to be addressed by future longitudinal studies. Nevertheless, acute inflammatory changes appeared confined to the HPC in the vast majority of our patients, while no such changes were found in the thalamus. Moreover, clinical T2-weighted MRIs in other autoimmune LE cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kotsenas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Malter et al., 2014</xref>), and the results of post-mortem studies have also demonstrated focal, acute HPC pathology in autoimmune LE patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Khan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Park et al., 2007</xref>) and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tröscher et al., 2017</xref>). Our interpretation of these data is, therefore, that extra-HPC structures within the extended HPC system (thalamus, PCC) are affected as a secondary consequence of HPC damage, rather than due to the primary pathology. We also note that extra-HPC damage is equally if not more likely in other conditions associated with HPC amnesia, such as cases of ischemia/anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huang and Castillo, 2008</xref>). It should, however, be acknowledged that a single case study of amnesia due to ischemia/anoxia which came to post mortem demonstrated focal neuronal loss in the CA1 region of the HPC on histopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Zola-Morgan et al., 1986</xref>). Direct comparisons between autoimmune LE and amnesia due to different etiologies would be useful in future research.</p><p>Patients also showed functional abnormalities in the posteromedial cortex, and the relationship between HPC atrophy and PCC rsALFF was fully mediated by the correlative volume reduction in the thalamic regions. This is consistent with the functional abnormalities previously observed in posteromedial cortical regions in both HPC and diencephalic amnesias in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggleton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Reed et al., 1999</xref>). Patients also showed reduced inter-HPC rsFC. In healthy individuals, the spontaneous activity of the HPC is coupled with that of the contralateral HPC at rest and these regions form part of the default-mode network. This is also the case for the medial prefrontal and posteromedial cortical regions which showed reduced rsFC with the HPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greicius et al., 2004</xref>). The decrease in inter-HPC rsFC across patients as a function of delay since symptom onset is consistent with the idea that these network-wide abnormalities follow focal HPC damage. In future, this needs replication in longitudinal studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Anterograde memory: Retrieval</title><p>Patients showed impairment across all tests of visual and verbal recall and recognition memory. The only unimpaired form of memory was face recognition. This would be predicted by some material-specific accounts of recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bird and Burgess, 2008</xref>) and is consistent with the view that recognition of unfamiliar faces is exceptional in several regards – according to some approaches, faces may be holistically processed and difficult to label verbally, and adequate performance levels may be attained in the absence of capacities to associate faces with a study list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). Ours is the largest study to date to confirm preserved face recognition memory in HPC amnesia.</p><p>At uncorrected levels, HPC volumes correlated with both recall and recognition memory scores. Crucially, however, the reduction in PCC rsALFF correlated with verbal and visual recall and visual recognition over and above HPC atrophy and, moreover, fully mediated the effects of HPC atrophy on these aspects of episodic memory. This finding demonstrates that the HPC role in recall and recognition cannot be examined in isolation from remote effects of HPC damage within the extended HPC system. It furthermore dovetails with the causal role that has been attributed to the posteromedial cortex in episodic memory for both visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonnì et al., 2015</xref>) and verbal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Koch et al., 2018</xref>) material, and aligns with evidence from neurodegenerative diseases that it is posteromedial cortex rather than HPC function that predicts episodic memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">La Joie et al., 2014</xref>). Patients’ impaired verbal recognition was associated with reduced inter-HPC rsFC. The reasons why the correlates of verbal recognition were different from those of other forms of memory are unclear, but the relationship with inter-HPC rsFC is consistent with that found between inter-HPC connectivity and episodic memory in healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and patient populations (e.g. traumatic axonal injury) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Marquez de la Plata et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that our neuropsychological assessment did not explicitly attempt to distinguish between the recollection and familiarity processes that may underlie differences in recall and recognition memory. In order to identify the neural mechanisms supporting these processes, finer-grained behavioral paradigms are required. Furthermore, our study did not include HPC subfield volumetry, which may have disclosed stronger correlations between HPC subfields and memory scores. The volumes and hemodynamic activity of HPC subfields have been associated with various forms of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bonnici et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Palombo et al., 2018</xref>). While imaging at higher field strength is required to investigate HPC subfields, our study highlights the fact that the remote effects of HPC damage on wider brain networks are a key factor in HPC amnesia.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge an alternative interpretation of the relationship that we observed between resting-state functional abnormalities and memory measures. McCormick and colleagues recently showed that HPC amnesic patients differ in the form and content of their ‘mind-wandering’ compared with healthy adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">McCormick et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that ‘resting-state’ functional abnormalities in our patients actually reflect (and are perhaps therefore mediated by) differences between healthy controls and patients with respect to the extent of mind wandering in the scanner, rather than differences in neurovascular functioning in these regions per se. Anterior and posterior midline structures are strongly implicated in mind-wandering. Nevertheless, rsfMRI measures (predominantly rsFC) have repeatedly provided reliable correlates of memory impairment in HPC amnesia [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Heine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henson et al., 2016</xref>)]. Moreover, this interpretation is not inconsistent with the basic premise of our argument, namely, that the effects of HPC damage on memory are mediated by other processes that are compromised following HPC damage. Our study was not designed to disambiguate the level of disruption that is mediating the effects of HPC atrophy. In other words, the disruption could be at the cognitive level, or at the neurovascular level, or at both levels. Further work is needed to disambiguate those two interpretations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Anterograde memory: Forgetting</title><p>The only aspect of amnesia upon which HPC atrophy showed a direct effect was that of visual forgetting (of abstract shapes). Patients showed only a marginal increase in verbal forgetting. In particular, it was the atrophy in the right HPC that was associated with visual forgetting. This is consistent with evidence for HPC lateralization of maintenance processes for verbal (left HPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frisk and Milner, 1990</xref>) and visual material (right HPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Smith and Milner, 1989</xref>). Indeed, rapid forgetting of visual information in right HPC damage was noted quite early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jones-Gotman, 1986</xref>), as was, in general, the nature of forgetting in HPC amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Huppert and Piercy, 1979</xref>). This has recently been re-emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sadeh et al., 2014</xref>), with functional neuroimaging studies in healthy young adults attributing a central role to the HPC in constraining the forgetting that occurs by new learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kuhl et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our results go beyond these studies and demonstrate an exclusive relationship between HPC atrophy and rapid forgetting even within the context of abnormalities in the extended HPC system. This relationship is consistent with computational models of HPC function that outline pattern completion and pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">O'Reilly and McClelland, 1994</xref>) as two core mechanisms that protect against forgetting. Pattern completion enables the reinstatement of previously encoded memories from incomplete input, whereas pattern separation involves the orthogonal coding of memories for overlapping events, which minimizes forgetting by generating non-interfering representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kuhl et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that the HPC role in amnesia may be much less direct than has previously been held, at least with respect to performance on widely used, standardized neuropsychological tests of memory. In contrast with the majority of such tests, the measurements of forgetting such as that used here partially control for factors that may confound simple recall scores, such as variability in attention, initial learning or retrieval strategy, factors that may depend on regions outside the HPC. Instead, measurements of forgetting may provide the most sensitive and specific way to detect HPC damage. This proposal does not preclude the possibility that the HPC mechanisms underlying the retention of newly formed memories are process- or material-specific. As our forgetting rates were derived only from a recall-based test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baddeley et al., 1994</xref>), we are unable to comment on the relationship of HPC atrophy with forgetting in recognition memory, a relationship which has recently been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sadeh et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, material-specificity in rapid forgetting should be examined with finer-grained behavioral tasks, involving different types of stimuli (e.g. scenes vs. faces). Nevertheless, the direct relationship of (right) HPC atrophy with (visual) forgetting highlights the utility of tests of accelerated forgetting in detecting HPC pathology in other disorders. Recent studies have emphasized a possible role for such tests in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Weston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Zimmermann and Butler, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Remote autobiographical memory</title><p>Patients showed spared remote personal semantic memory, in the face of impaired remote autobiographical memories. To date, research in autoimmune LE patients has focused on anterograde memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Butler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Henson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Malter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), with very little evidence on retrograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). Our study is also one of the very few to examine the relationship of HPC damage with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia.</p><p>It is possible that the test we used to assess remote memories (AMI) is insufficiently sensitive to truly ‘episodic’ aspects of autobiographical memory that have been held to be HPC-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Moscovitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</xref>). Other methods, involving parametric text-based procedures, may offer greater sensitivity [e.g. the Autobiographical Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Levine et al., 2002</xref>)]. Nevertheless, studies on other amnesic cohorts have found the AMI and the Autobiographical Interview to offer comparable results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Rensen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our findings would at first sight appear to support a role for the HPC in the recollection of remote autobiographical memories. However, the volume of the left thalamus correlated with remote autobiographical memory scores over and above HPC volumes across patients. Moreover, the effects of HPC atrophy were fully mediated by the volume reduction in the thalamus. Furthermore, no selective relationship was found between remote autobiographical memory scores and anterior or posterior HPC volumes. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the multiple trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Moscovitch et al., 2005</xref>) or trace-transformation accounts of retrograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sekeres et al., 2018</xref>), according to which remote autobiographical memory deficits should be a function of the extent of HPC damage, either <italic>in toto</italic>, or in specific HPC portions.</p><p>The absence of direct effects of HPC atrophy on remote memory, in combination with the selective presence of such effects on forgetting rates, is instead consistent with the idea that HPC circuitry acts as a buffer for the temporary maintenance of episodic information, with non-HPC structures storing more permanent memory traces. Our findings may thus offer some support for the standard consolidation model of remote memory. Other work supporting this model has primarily emphasized the role of neocortical damage in retrograde amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bayley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Squire et al., 2015</xref>). We here highlight the need also to consider the role of the thalamus. Focal thalamic damage has been often associated with retrograde amnesia in single-case or small case-series studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Carlesimo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Stuss et al., 1988</xref>), and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei may coordinate the recollection of cortically stored memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miller et al., 2001</xref>) via thalamic-prefrontal cortical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kopelman, 2015</xref>). Our results show that secondary alterations in thalamic integrity may explain the large variability in retrograde memory loss reported after HPC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bayley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">St-Laurent et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our finding that thalamic volume was reduced in our patient group is consistent with the literature on developmental amnesia due to early hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, where HPC damage has been noted along with atrophy in the thalamus and the mammillary bodies [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dzieciol et al., 2017</xref>)]. A question for future research is therefore whether adult-onset HPC damage is accompanied by atrophy in the mammillary bodies, or whether thalamic atrophy may occur in the absence of changes to the mammillary bodies, given the evidence for direct forniceal projections from the HPC/subiculum to the anterior thalamus in human and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bubb et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study, probably the largest in human HPC amnesia, shows that abnormalities in the integrity of and connectivity within the extended HPC system may occur after focal HPC damage, and that these play a central role in explaining the variability in the anterograde and retrograde amnesia of patients with HPC atrophy.

Understanding the impact of network-wide changes following HPC damage will be key to resolving long-standing controversies in the literature on human amnesia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Patients</title><sec id="s4-1-1-1"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>We identified 38 patients (26M:12F; age at research MRI: M = 63.06; IQR = 16.16 years; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) who i) had undergone neuropsychological assessment during the acute phase of the illness at the Russell Cairns Unit, Oxford (2013–2018); ii) had been diagnosed with LE according to the diagnostic criteria described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Graus et al., 2016</xref>): a) subacute onset of memory deficits [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Graus et al., 2016</xref>) mention ‘working memory deficits’.

The AMI assesses semantic autobiographical memory (‘personal semantics’) through a structured interview concerning autobiographical facts. Episodic autobiographical memory is examined through the free recall of events and is scored (0–3) for specificity and richness of episodic recall. Following the AMI manual, three points were given for episodic memories produced in a highly detailed fashion, with mention of specific time and place; 0–2 points were given to memories recalled with poor episodic detail, that is two points were credited when the episodic memory was not recalled in detail or did not involve mention of time and place, or where the memory was not recalled; one point was given for a vague personal memory; and 0 points when a response was not provided or when general semantic information was provided instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kopelman et al., 1989</xref>). Memories of three periods are assessed: childhood (up to 18 years of age), early adulthood (up to participants’ mid 30’s), and recent memories (0–5 years from the time of the interview).

This method has been extensively used to identify the regions in which groups of patients differ significantly from healthy controls with respect to their rsFC with the rest of the brain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Flodin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kazumata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). As outlined in other papers [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2016</xref>)], the strength of this approach is the use of a massive data set (connectivity between all pairs of recorded voxels) for the purposes of identifying the most reliable difference in rsFC across the whole brain between groups of participants. In other words, it is an agnostic, unbiased approach used to define data-driven regions of interest (seeds) prior to performing a post-hoc analysis on the seeds to analyse brain connectivity patterns. This PCA-based method is more reproducible than conventional seed-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Song et al., 2016</xref>). As this approach is both data-driven and conducted across the whole brain, it is strongly preferable to approaches examining a priori defined networks or seed/target regions of interest, commonly employed by studies of HPC amnesia with substantially smaller sample sizes.</p><p>In particular, the ‘connectome-MVPA’ method assesses the multivariate pattern of pairwise connections between voxels across the whole brain by performing a PCA separately for each voxel that characterizes its rsFC with the rest of the brain, in two steps. In the first step, separately for each participant, a default number (n = 64) of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) components characterizing each participant’s voxel-to-voxel correlation matrix is retained. The resulting component scores are stored as first-level voxel-to-voxel covariance matrices for each participant. In the second step, a low-dimensional representation of the entire pattern of seed-based correlations between this voxel and the rest of the brain is derived for each voxel across participants by retaining a certain number of principal components that explain most of the variance of the connectivity matrix. In our study, we retained the first seven principal components, in keeping with a conventionally used conservative 1:10 ratio between the number of components extracted and the number of subjects (n = 67). These seven resulting component score volumes best represented the whole-brain connectivity pattern for each participant, explaining the maximum inter-subject variability. They were simultaneously included in a second-level analysis F-test at group-level (an omnibus test, equivalent to seed-level F-tests in ROI-to-ROI analyses of rsFC), testing for clusters that differ between healthy controls and patients with respect to whole-brain connectivity, as represented by the PCA component volumes, while also including age and sex as between-subjects covariates. This method was then followed by post-hoc analyses to determine specific connectivity patterns in the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Resting-state FC: Seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis</title><p>The omnibus F-test above was followed up by post-hoc analyses to determine specific connectivity patterns in the data.

(<bold>B</bold>) Relationship of delay since symptom onset with structural and functional abnormalities. Given our hypothesis that broader network abnormalities unfold as a consequence of acute HPC atrophy (i.e. at a time-point after the acute focus of HPC damage), we also assessed the relationship of the delay between symptom onset and research participation with the extent of HPC and extra-HPC structural and functional abnormalities in a series of bivariate correlations. Of the structural/functional abnormalities (n=13) identified in our patient group, only inter-HPC rsFC decreased across patients as a function of the delay between symptom onset and research scan (rho=-0.58, p-corr=0.004).

(<bold>E</bold>) Relationship of memory scores with volumes of manually delineated HPC portions. *: verbal / visual recognition, visual recall composite scores: No significant correlations were observed between those scores and the volumes of the manually delineated left/right anterior/posterior HPC portions at uncorrected levels (all ps, p-unc &gt; 0.05); **: verbal recall composite scores: A weak correlation was observed with the left anterior HPC at uncorrected levels (r = 0.351, p-unc = 0.033; rest of ps, p-unc ≥ 0.095). Since patients’ rsALFF in the PCC did not correlate significantly with the volume of the manually delineated left anterior HPC (r = 0.333, p = 0.050), we entered these two factors as independent variables in a multiple step-wise linear regression, with verbal recall scores as the dependent variable. The regression terminated in a single step, with rsALFF in the PCC as the only predictor of patients’ performance (R<sup>2</sup>=0.34; β(z)=0.58; F=16.40, p &lt; 0.0005); ***: visual forgetting scores: There was no clear evidence for a selective relationship of visual forgetting with anterior vs. posterior portions of the HPC (all rhos, 0.471≥ rho ≥ 0.332; all ps, 0.055 ≥ p-unc ≥ 0.005); ****: Correlations of remote autobiographical memory with volumes of manually delineated portions of the HPC (anterior / posterior right / left HPC) were observed at uncorrected levels (0.429 ≥ r ≥ 0.334; 0.066 ≥ p-unc ≥ 0.016). All four HPC portions correlated volumetrically with the left thalamus (right anterior HPC: r = 0.327, p-unc = 0.045; left anterior HPC: r = 0.427, p-unc = 0.007; right posterior HPC: r = 0.362, p-unc = 0.025; left posterior HPC: r = 0.360, p-unc = 0.026). A series of four partial correlational analyses demonstrated that left thalamic volume correlated with remote autobiographical memory scores over and above the volume of each of those four manually delineated HPC portions (control variable: right anterior HPC: r = 0.489, p = 0.006; left anterior HPC: r = 0.482, p = 0.007; right posterior HPC: r = 0.505; p = 0.004; left posterior HPC: r = 0.509, p = 0.004); aHPC: anterior hippocampus; HPC: hippocampus; L: left hemisphere; MAP: Memory and Amnesia Project; OPTIMA: Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging; pHPC: posterior hippocampus; p-unc: p values of bivariate correlations are presented at uncorrected levels for display purposes; R: right hemisphere; rho: Spearmann’s rank correlation coefficient; r: Pearson’s correlation coefficient; TIV: total intracranial volume; z: average of age-scaled standardized scores on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory; z-res: volumes for each HPC portion are residualized against age, sex, TIV, and scan source (MAP, OPTIMA) across participants. (<bold>F</bold>) ‘Impaired’ vs. ‘Unimpaired’ patients on visual forgetting: Structural/Functional abnormalities. Given that 17 of our patients reached ceiling scores in visual forgetting, we also dichotomized our patient group into two subgroups, those that attained ceiling scores (z=0.33), and those with lower scores (z&lt;0.33). We therefore compared the two patient subgroups across the 13 structural and functional abnormalities identified above at whole-group level. Consistent with our correlational approach, the two patient subgroups differed only with respect to the volume of the right HPC, as expressed in manual volumetry (t = -3.32, p-corr = 0.027) and in the right HPC VBM cluster (t = -4.05, p-corr = 0.004; rest of ps, p-corr ≥ 0.143); We then iterated these comparisons with a series of one-way ANCOVAs, including patients’ HADS scores for depression as a covariate of no interest. The results retained their significance (manually delineated right HPC volume: F = 9.96; p-corr = 0.048; right HPC VBM cluster: F = 14.94, p-corr = 0.007; rest of ps, p-corr ≥ 0.232); p-corr: significance values are corrected for multiple testing using the Holm-Bonferroni sequential method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Holm, 1979</xref>); t/Wt: comparison between the two subgroups across the 13 structural/functional abnormalities identified at group level for patients; F: these comparisons were iterated in the form of a series of univariate ANCOVAs, including patients’ scores for depression (HADS) as between-subjects covariates; z-res: volumes are residualized against age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV; functional abnormalities are residualized against age and sex; t: Student t-test; Wt: Welch t-test; SD: standard deviation; bold: p-corr &lt; 0.05; HADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Zigmond and Snaith, 1983</xref>); ANCOVA: analysis of covariance; OPTIMA: Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging; MAP: Memory and Amnesia Project. (<bold>G</bold>) Comparison of treated vs. untreated patients on memory scores and structural/functional brain abnormalities. We investigated whether patients that had been treated with immunosuppressive therapy (n=31) showed less pronounced memory impairment and brain abnormalities as compared with those that had not received treatment (n=7), in order to ensure that the structure/function-behavior relationships disclosed across all 38 patients were not driven by the subgroup of patients that had not received such treatment. Patients who had not received such treatment scored lower than the rest of the patients on anterograde retrieval, but not on visual forgetting, or remote autobiographical memory. Nevertheless, the two patient subgroups did not differ with respect to the extent of structural or functional brain abnormalities that we observed above for the entire group of patients (all ps, p-corr ≥ 0.832), even at uncorrected levels (all ps, p-unc &gt; 0.06); p-corr: Holm-Bonferroni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Holm, 1979</xref>) correction applied separately for the number of memory scores (n=3) and the number of structural/functional abnormalities (n=13); bold: p-corr &lt; 0.05; z: average of age-scaled standardized scores on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory; z-res: volumes are residualized against age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV; functional abnormalities are residualized against age and sex. (<bold>H</bold>) Correlation of anterograde retrieval scores with structural / functional abnormalities across patients that had received immunosuppressive therapy. Given the more pronounced impairment on anterograde retrieval of patients that had not received immunosuppressive therapy, we sought to determine whether the relationship of this composite score with reduced rsALFF in the PCC held when the analysis was confined to the 31 patients that had received immunosuppressive therapy. Indeed, the relationship between reduced rsALFF in the PCC and impaired anterograde retrieval retained its significance across this patient subgroup; L, R: left, right (hemisphere); HPC: hippocampus; MPFC: medial prefrontal cortex; p-corr: p values are adjusted for multiple testing using the Holm-Bonferroni sequential method; bold: p-corr &lt; 0.05; rsALFF: resting-state amplitude of low frequency fluctuations; rsFC: resting-state functional connectivity; PrCu: precuneus; PCC: posterior cingulate cortex; z-res: volumes are residualized against age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV; functional abnormalities are residualized against age and sex.

Numbers of healthy controls and patients that underwent structural, functional MRI, and neuropsychological assessment. *: While the healthy controls whose structural MRI datasets were added from the OPTIMA project had not been assessed with our laboratory’s neuropsychological battery, they had been assessed with tests measuring overall cognitive impairment [Mini-Mental State Examination – MMSE; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Folstein et al., 1975</xref>)]. Expectedly, these scores indicated that none of those healthy controls had any apparent cognitive impairment [mean = 29.74, SD = 0.56, min = 28, well above widely accepted cut-offs, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aevarsson and Skoog, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Di Carlo et al., 2002</xref>)].

The results are potentially interesting and important because, although a number of other recent studies have used MRI and fMRI to examine effects of HPC lesions on other parts of the brain, in small groups of 2-6 patients, this paper is able to go further, by virtue of the much larger sample size, in comparing the relationship between those brain changes and a range of memory measures. The authors' main claim is that the majority of those memory measures are better explained by functional changes, or thalamic structural changes, than the conventional (implicit) assumption that HPC structural change is the main determinant. However, the paper at the moment is poorly structured, making it very difficult to understand the rationale for each analysis and the specific groups used, and the statistical interpretations need refinement.</p><p>1) A lot of the conclusions are based on mediation models in which the relationship between HPC volume (A) and a memory measure (C) is mediated by some other brain measure (e.g. functional connectivity, or thalamic volume (B)). Unfortunately, because mediation models (when implemented as path models) are fully saturated (particularly when all variables are observed quantities with measurement error, as here, rather than fixed effects that are manipulated), statistical methods cannot be used to test whether one model is any better than another, so the models need to be justified on theoretical grounds. In the present cases, while I accept that memory measures are most naturally the outcome (C), it seems plausible to me that one could swap A and B (e.g., claim that HPC volume mediates the relationship between thalamic volume and cognition). I think the authors should explicitly discuss this caveat (i.e., that their mediation results can only be interpreted under assumption that the disease primarily causes HPC damage, and this in turn causes the damage/functional disruption in other brain regions, rather than the alternative possibility that the disease causes, e.g., thalamic damage, but the effect of that damage on cognition is mediated by secondary HPC damage). This should not only be discussed at length in the Discussion, but also stated in the Introduction to explain why mediation analyses performed at all (e.g., &quot;On the assumption that the disease causes HPC damage and that this then causes disruption in the extended hippocampal network, we performed mediation analysis to see whether disruption elsewhere affected the relationship between HPC damage and memory measures…etc.&quot; or the like&quot;. In other words, the Introduction should not just give the three &quot;predictions&quot; (which are actually more like open-ended hypotheses, since nobody is cited as explicitly claiming previously that memory problems arise from somewhere other than hippocampus), but also a summary of the (complicated) statistical approach taken to address these hypotheses.</p><p>2) Why were HPC volumes compared in terms of a one-sample T-test on Z-scores for each patient versus a matched group of controls? Why not simply perform a two-sample T-test comparing the two groups, after matching control group for mean and spread of age, sex, etc, and/or covarying out these variables? That way, the authors could report a more generalizable effect size in terms of mean and standard-error of volume estimates for each group (e.g., in Table 2, from which one can always derive a group Z-score or a% volume loss if one wants), in order to compare with other studies, rather than reporting a measure that is specific to the present control group (which is not particularly large anyway, ie likely to result in noisy Z-scores). (Also, with the number of controls specified, doesn't this patient-matching procedure result in the same control participant being used as a control for multiple patients? If so, does this further reduce the generalisability of the Z-scores?)</p><p>3) In general, although it is conventional to separate Results section from Materials and methods section of a paper, the results here are so terse, and the methods (design, analysis) so complicated, that I think it would really help readability of the paper if the Results section contained more information about the rationale and details (e.g., participant samples) used in each analysis. It would also help to have a summary to pre-empt how the results are organised (e.g., first we looked at structural changes, then we used regions from these to relate to cognition, etc… i.e., a roadmap of where results are heading). Indeed, since different analyses used different subsets of patients and controls, I wonder whether a flow-chart could be added to explain which participants contributed to which analysis?</p><p>4) No rationale is given (e.g., in Introduction) for why the authors chose to measure resting-state functional &quot;activity&quot; (rsALFF), or specific aspects of functional connectivity. It is fine that the specific regions/connections are selected from the data, ie after a voxel-wise search for mean difference between patients vs controls (since all subsequent correlations are done on patient group only, so unbiased by this prior selection), but why was resting-state &quot;activity&quot; examined at all? Also, given prior studies claiming certain functional connections/networks are disrupted by HPC damage, why did the authors not examine these specifically? Or why did they not focus on the regions in the &quot;extended hippocampal network&quot; they mention in the Introduction, reducing the multiple comparison problem?</p><p>5) Personally, I think the most interesting results (given above concerns about mediation analyses) are when a variable like rsFC correlates better with a memory measure than does HPC volume. While it is interesting to know further that when a variable like rsFC is added to a stepwise regression together with HPC volume, only the former remains significant, one cannot conclude from absence of evidence that there is no effect of HPC on, e.g. verbal anterograde memory. Would it be possible to explicitly compare the regression slopes in a model with both variables (after they have been Z-scored so Betas comparable), that is to test whether there is significant positive evidence that rsFC is more strongly related to a memory score than is HPC volume?</p><p>6) In general, there are a large number of statistical tests performed (e.g., even when just considering the 6 different types of memory score). Even if the authors continue to report all results at p&lt;.05 uncorrected, it might be worth summarising at the end of the Results section those for which they are most confident (i.e., that would survive such correction).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Summary: This study reports a novel and unique investigation into the brain systems that account for memory impairments in a group of individuals (n=38) who have developed hippocampal amnesia as a result of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. This study provides one of largest investigations into the causal contribution of the hippocampal formation toward memory function. The authors completed a set of memory tests, including tests of both retrograde and anterograde memory, as well as tests of remote episodic/autobiographical memory. Through this neuropsychological battery, both verbal and visual memory was tested, and different aspects of memory were probed (e.g., recall, recognition performance, forgetting). In addition, brain imaging was performed to obtain estimates of structural integrity of brain regions in the extended hippocampal network as well as network-wide functional connectivity. Memory scores were then correlated with the brain structural and functional measures, and these analyses revealed that many of the relationships between hippocampal volume and memory were mediated by wider network abnormalities. These findings provide important linkages with other work in the literature connecting hippocampal compromise to structural and functional integrity of the thalamus and the posterior parietal cortex.</p><p>In general, I found the paper well written, and that the methods and statistical analyses were conducted rigorously. There are a few methodological details that should be stated more clearly in the manuscript, which I have detailed below. I have some other comments and questions regarding the pattern of anatomical changes observed.</p><p>1) The finding that thalamic grey matter is reduced in these amnesic individuals is consistent with the literature on developmental amnesia (e.g. Dzieciol et al., 2017). Were the mammillary bodies examined in this dataset? It would be interesting to know if individuals who sustain hippocampal compromise during adulthood also develop atrophy within these structures. Alternatively, it would also be interesting to know if thalamic atrophy might occur in the absence of changes to the mammillary bodies, given that in the macaque and human there appear to be direct fornical projections from the hippocampus/subiculum to the anterior thalamus (Bubb et al., 2017).</p><p>2) It is stated that inflammatory pathology would be 'expected to spread to adjacent areas, rather than to remote regions in the extended HPC network.' Is there empirical evidence for this assertion? Or, conversely, might there be evidence that inflammatory pathology could spread from the hippocampus to the thalamus via the fornix?</p><p>3) A bit more information about the different types of functional connectivity is needed. From my read of the paper, two types of functional connectivity were performed: resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and resting-state amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (rsALFF). Why were these two methods used and what can one method offer that the other method cannot? This should be made clearer either in the Materials and methods section or earlier in the manuscript.</p><p>4) Were mediation analyses performed for each of the correlations and only reported for the models in which either the thalamic or connectivity patterns significantly mediate the relationship between hippocampal volume and memory? In some parts of the paper these mediation analyses seem hypothesis driven (e.g. subsection “Anterograde memory: Visual Recognition”) whereas in other parts of the paper I wasn't sure if these mediation analyses were hypothesized a priori (e.g. subsection “Remote Autobiographical Memory”). This issue should be made clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an important and timely study of memory processing in patients with autoimmune limbic encephalitis who have relatively selective damage to the hippocampus. Given how rare it is to find individuals with focal damage to the hippocampus, the group of 38 patients that are described in the study is extremely large. The cohort is well-characterised from both neuroimaging and neuropsychological perspectives. The main findings are that, while the patients have relatively focal volume loss within the hippocampus, the relationships between hippocampal volume and memory performance are usually mediated by relationships with other brain structures: notably functional connectivity with posterior midline regions in the case of anterograde memory and grey matter volume in the thalamus in the case of retrograde memory. I think these findings will make a useful contribution to the field of memory research, but I have a few issues that I feel the authors should address.</p><p>In the volumetric analyses, the authors seem to be testing whether the patient group as a whole has volume loss greater than 1.5 SDs below the mean of the controls. If correct, this seems to be extremely conservative and rather unusual. I would have expected a more direct comparison between the volumes of the patients and controls – with indications of the effect size of the difference. This is the approach done with the neuropsychological tests. It might help if the degree of volume loss is expressed as a percentage of the controls, with statistics relating to the direct comparison of the patients and controls. Perhaps I am missing something here?</p><p>The authors correlate MRI measures with composite measures of performance based on averaging across tests of anterograde memory in which patients showed impairment. This seems an inadequate justification for choosing which tests contribute to the composite measures. It is interesting that the patients are unimpaired on tests of face recognition memory, and as the authors point out, this is in keeping with other findings (e.g. Taylor et al., 2007; Bird and Burgess, 2008; Smith et al., 2014; Bird, 2017). This would constitute a reasonable justification for not including face recognition memory in a composite visual recognition memory measure in patients with hippocampal damage. However, the selection of measures based on performance alone is biased.</p><p>In the description of the methods for &quot;Resting-state Hemodynamic activity: rsALFF&quot; the authors define RsALFF as the total power within the frequency rage (0.01-0.1 Hz). However, in the pre-processing section they say that they apply a temporal band pass filter of 0.01-0.1 Hz. To me, this would appear to affect the signal that they want to analyse. Could the authors justify their procedure and confirm if this procedure is used by other groups reporting the results of RsALFF analyses?</p><p>The study and its results are situated with respect to neural dysfunction at sites separated from the hippocampus. While this is very likely to be the cause of volume loss in the thalamus, it is not necessarily the case for the resting state fMRI results. It is possible that the patients engage different cognitive processes during the resting state scan compared to the controls – and therefore the differences in the engagement of the anterior and posterior midline structures reflects this. These regions are strongly implicated in &quot;mind-wandering&quot; – following undirected trains of thought. There is also evidence that patients with hippocampal damage differ markedly in the form and content of their mind-wandering compared with healthy adults (McCormick et al., 2018). It is also possible that the patients simply forgot what they were doing in the scanner, and spent more time attending to, e.g., the noise of the scanner than the controls did. My point is that functional differences between the patients and controls could reflect the BOLD engagement in different cognitive processes rather than more fundamental differences in neuro/vascular functioning in these regions per se. I would encourage the authors to discuss this issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46156.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper examines the relationship between (1) hippocampal (HPC) volume measured by MRI and (2) memory deficits in standard neuropsychological tests on a group of N=38 patients with autoimmune limbic encephalitis, in particular whether this relationship is mediated by (3) the effects of HPC damage on other measures of brain structure (e.g. thalamus) or brain function (e.g. reduced resting-state &quot;activity&quot; in medial parietal cortex or reduced fMRI connectivity between left and right HPC).

Although most patients respond well to early immunosuppressive therapy (Finke et al., 2017; Irani et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2018), some subsequently develop HPC atrophy and persistent cognitive impairment, the most prominent aspect of which is anterograde amnesia (Butler et al., 2014; Finke et al., 2017; Irani et al., 2013; Loane et al., 2019; Malter et al., 2014). Autoimmune LE patients are often included in studies of HPC amnesia (Hassabis et al., 2007; Henson et al., 2017, 2016; Maguire et al., 2006). Post-mortem studies demonstrate focal HPC damage (Khan et al., 2009; Park et al., 2007), contrasting with the wider damage typically found following other encephalitides [e.g. herpes simplex encephalitis (Damasio and Van Hoesen, 1985; Gitelman et al., 2001)] or global ischemia/anoxia (Huang and Castillo, 2008), conditions that have also been used as models of human HPC function [for discussion, see (Squire and Zola, 1996)]. Animal models have also shown focal limbic involvement (HPC, amygdala) (Tröscher et al., 2017). Patients’ varying degrees of residual symptom severity offered us the opportunity to examine the relationships between cognition and brain structure and function.’</p><p>Discussion section: ‘[…] acute inflammatory changes appeared confined to the HPC in the vast majority of our patients, while no such changes were found in the thalamus. Moreover, clinical T2-weighted MRIs in other autoimmune LE cohorts (Finke et al., 2017; Kotsenas et al., 2014; Malter et al., 2014), and the results of post-mortem studies have also demonstrated focal, acute HPC pathology in autoimmune LE patients (Khan et al., 2009; Park et al., 2007) and animal models (Tröscher et al., 2017). Our interpretation of these data is, therefore, that extra-HPC structures within the extended HPC system (thalamus, PCC) are affected as a secondary consequence of HPC damage, rather than due to the primary pathology. We also note that extra-HPC damage is equally if not more likely in other conditions associated with HPC amnesia, such as cases of ischemia/anoxia (Huang and Castillo, 2008).’</p><p>We have explicitly justified our reasons for using mediation analysis and discussed the assumptions that underlie these analyses at the end of our revised Introduction. To address the reviewer’s additional comment that nobody is cited as explicitly claiming previously that memory problems arise from somewhere other than the HPC and that therefore the questions presented in the end of our Introduction are more like ‘open-ended questions’, we have cited recently published papers that highlight the significance of broader networks in episodic memory and propose that episodic memory impairment results from broader network-wide disruption triggered by HPC damage [see for instance (Inhoff and Ranganath, 2017), where this proposal is explicitly made].</p><p>‘We predicted that: (i) HPC damage (documented to occur focally in autoimmune LE) would be accompanied by remote abnormalities in hubs of the extended HPC system, including the HPC-diencephalic-cingulate network (Aggleton, 2014; Bubb et al., 2017a); (ii) variation in the extent of these network-wide abnormalities across patients would explain variability in memory impairment over and above HPC atrophy; iii) Moreover, on our assumption that HPC damage leads to broader network disruption, we predicted that relationships between HPC atrophy and memory impairment would be mediated by this broader network disruption. This prediction is in line with recent functional imaging and lesion studies that emphasize the importance of broader networks in episodic memory (Cook et al., 2015; Henson et al., 2016; Inhoff and Ranganath, 2017; Schedlbauer et al., 2015; Watrous et al., 2013); iv) taking these abnormalities into account would enable us to identify which particular aspects of memory impairment are a direct function of HPC atrophy.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why were HPC volumes compared in terms of a one-sample T-test on Z-scores for each patient versus a matched group of controls? Why not simply perform a two-sample T-test comparing the two groups, after matching control group for mean and spread of age, sex, etc, and/or covarying out these variables? That way, the authors could report a more generalizable effect size in terms of mean and standard-error of volume estimates for each group (e.g., in Table 2, from which one can always derive a group Z-score or a% volume loss if one wants), in order to compare with other studies, rather than reporting a measure that is specific to the present control group (which is not particularly large anyway, ie likely to result in noisy Z-scores). (Also, with the number of controls specified, doesn't this patient-matching procedure result in the same control participant being used as a control for multiple patients? If so, does this further reduce the generalisability of the Z-scores?)</p></disp-quote><p>Our original approach was adopted in keeping with standard practice in single-case and case-series studies of patients with HPC damage, whereby HPC volumes of individual patients are shown to fall below the traditionally employed cut-off point of -1.5 SD from the mean of age-matched healthy controls, in the face of other MTL (and subcortical) structures showing volumes over -1.5 SD from the mean of their matched healthy controls. Nevertheless, we agree that, since the number of healthy controls is limited and that some participants are used as age-matched controls for multiple patients, this method of quantifying MTL and subcortical volumes may not be ideal. Moreover, we agree that the advantages of the approach the reviewer has recommended may give less noisy estimates of volume reduction, and that the effect sizes would be more generalisable for comparison with other studies. A similar point was raised by reviewer 3. We have now adopted the method of quantifying MTL and other subcortical volumes that the reviewer recommends. We have iterated the analyses of structure/function-behavior relationships, after first regressing MTL and subcortical volumes against age, sex, and TIV (as already done in the case of the mean values of VBM clusters in the original manuscript), as well as the project in which the structural datasets were acquired (Memory and Amnesia Project, Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging), as recommended in another point below. This has been highlighted in several instances, as, for instance, in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>Volumes derived from manual volumetry: ‘We compared healthy controls and patients on the volumes of all structures in a series of ANCOVAs, using age, sex, scan source [MAP (Memory and Amnesia Project), or OPTIMA (Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging)], and total intra-cranial volume (TIV; derived from the unified segmentation procedure in SPM12; see below) as between-subjects covariates. Volumes that were reduced in our patient group were residualized against these four variables (z-res) and entered in a series of bivariate correlations with patients’ memory scores.’</p><p>Volumes derived from VBM: ‘The mean GM volumes of VBM clusters were extracted using the Marsbar toolbox in SPM12 (Brett et al., 2002), were residualized across participants against age, sex, scan source (MAP, OPTIMA), and TIV, and were used in a series of bivariate correlations with memory scores across patients.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, although it is conventional to separate Results section from Materials and methods section of a paper, the results here are so terse, and the methods (design, analysis) so complicated, that I think it would really help readability of the paper if the Results section contained more information about the rationale and details (e.g., participant samples) used in each analysis. It would also help to have a summary to pre-empt how the results are organised (e.g., first we looked at structural changes, then we used regions from these to relate to cognition, etc… i.e., a roadmap of where results are heading). Indeed, since different analyses used different subsets of patients and controls, I wonder whether a flow-chart could be added to explain which participants contributed to which analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the reviewer’s suggested changes to the structure of the manuscript would enhance readability. We have now added more information in the Results section about the rationale and details used in each analysis, as follows:</p><p>Our analysis approach is summarized in Figure 1. We first (1) identified cognitive deficits by comparing the performance of patients and healthy controls on a broad range of neuropsychological tests. We then (2) identified regions in which patients showed structural and (3) functional abnormalities relative to healthy controls. We then (4) examined the relationship between structural / functional brain abnormalities and memory impairment across patients.</p><p>We have also added more information about methods at other places throughout the Results section, especially with respect to imaging.</p><p>As the reviewer recommended, we have also included a figure illustrating how the results are organised and which participants contributed to which analysis (Figure 1) (please also consult response below regarding the number of healthy controls used in the different analyses).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) No rationale is given (e.g., in Introduction) for why the authors chose to measure resting-state functional &quot;activity&quot; (rsALFF), or specific aspects of functional connectivity. It is fine that the specific regions/connections are selected from the data, ie after a voxel-wise search for mean difference between patients vs controls (since all subsequent correlations are done on patient group only, so unbiased by this prior selection), but why was resting-state &quot;activity&quot; examined at all? Also, given prior studies claiming certain functional connections/networks are disrupted by HPC damage, why did the authors not examine these specifically? Or why did they not focus on the regions in the &quot;extended hippocampal network&quot; they mention in the Introduction, reducing the multiple comparison problem?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now taken the following steps in response to the reviewer’s point.</p><p>1) We have elaborated on the reasons for which we examined resting-state functional activity (in the form of low-frequency oscillations), in both the Introduction and the Materials and methods sections:</p><p>Introduction: ‘Using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), we also identified resting-state functional abnormalities in patients with respect to both segregation and integration, i.e. in terms of hemodynamic activity in local regions (resting-state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; rsALFF) and functional connectivity between regions (resting-state functional connectivity; rsFC).’</p><p>Materials and methods section: ‘We explored resting-state functional abnormalities in patients with respect to both segregation and integration, i.e. in terms of hemodynamic activity in local regions and functional connectivity between regions. While the majority of rsfMRI studies investigate the correlations between brain areas from the perspective of integration, i.e. ‘resting-state functional connectivity’ (rsFC) (providing holistic information on sets of interacting brain regions) and the abnormal integration between brain areas in patient groups relative to healthy controls, these approaches do not directly provide information on the specific brain regions that show abnormalities in patients (in the form of the amplitude of spontaneous brain activity). The latter are reliably indexed by the resting-state amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (rsALFF) of the rsfMRI signal, and help us identify the specific brain regions of abnormal spontaneous activity (Zang et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2008), similar to resting-state CBF and glucose metabolic rate in PET studies. For the above reasons, the combined application of these two methods (rsFC and rsALFF) has been held to provide more information than either method alone (Lv et al., 2018). We used data-driven approaches in both.’</p><p>2) We have also now emphasized the advantages of our approach in the investigation of rsFC in our Materials and methods section:</p><p>‘Instead of selecting seed/target ROIs or networks in an a priori fashion for our rsFC analyses, we chose to capitalize on the size of our patient cohort and use a PCA-based approach, commonly referred to as ‘connectome-MVPA’ (‘multivariate pattern analysis’) [e.g. (Arnold Anteraper et al., 2019; Flodin et al., 2016; Kazumata et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2016; Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2016; Yankouskaya et al., 2017); implemented in the Conn toolbox (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012) https://sites.google.com/view/conn/measures/networks-voxel-level], in order to identify seed regions for post-hoc seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses in a data-driven fashion. This method has been extensively used to identify the regions in which groups of patients differ significantly from healthy controls with respect to their rsFC with the rest of the brain (e.g. (Flodin et al., 2016; Kazumata et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2016)). As outlined in other papers (e.g. (Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2016)), the strength of this approach is the use of a massive data set (connectivity between all pairs of recorded voxels) for the purposes of identifying the most reliable difference in rsFC across the whole brain between groups of participants. In other words, it is an agnostic, unbiased approach used to define data-driven regions of interest (seeds) prior to performing a post-hoc analysis on the seeds to analyse brain connectivity patterns. This PCA-based method is more reproducible than conventional seed-based approaches (Song et al., 2016). As this approach is both data-driven and conducted across the whole brain, it is strongly preferable to approaches examining a priori defined networks or seed/target regions of interest, commonly employed by studies of HPC amnesia with substantially smaller sample sizes.</p><p>In particular, the ‘connectome-MVPA’ method assesses the multivariate pattern of pairwise connections between voxels across the whole brain by performing a PCA separately for each voxel that characterizes its rsFC with the rest of the brain, in two steps. In the first step, separately for each participant, a default number (n=64) of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) components characterizing each participant’s voxel-to-voxel correlation matrix is retained. The resulting component scores are stored as first-level voxel-to-voxel covariance matrices for each participant. In the second step, a low-dimensional representation of the entire pattern of seed-based correlations between this voxel and the rest of the brain is derived for each voxel across participants by retaining a certain number of principal components that explain most of the variance of the connectivity matrix. In our study, we retained the first 7 principal components, in keeping with a conventionally used conservative 1:10 ratio between the number of components extracted and the number of subjects (n=67). These 7 resulting component score volumes best represented the whole-brain connectivity pattern for each participant, explaining the maximum inter-subject variability. They were simultaneously included in a second-level analysis F-test at group-level (an omnibus test, equivalent to seed-level F-tests in ROI-to-ROI analyses of rsFC), testing for clusters that differ between healthy controls and LE patients with respect to whole-brain connectivity, as represented by the PCA component volumes, while also including age and sex as between subjects covariates. This method was then followed by post-hoc analyses to determine specific connectivity patterns in the data.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Personally, I think the most interesting results (given above concerns about mediation analyses) are when a variable like rsFC correlates better with a memory measure than does HPC volume. While it is interesting to know further that when a variable like rsFC is added to a stepwise regression together with HPC volume, only the former remains significant, one cannot conclude from absence of evidence that there is no effect of HPC on, eg, verbal anterograde memory. Would it be possible to explicitly compare the regression slopes in a model with both variables (after they have been Z-scored so Betas comparable), that is to test whether there is significant positive evidence that rsFC is more strongly related to a memory score than is HPC volume?</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to highlight the following aspects of the analyses reported in the original version of our manuscript:</p><p>i) As clarified in response to point 1 above, there is very strong evidence supporting the assumption underlying our mediation analyses, namely, that the disease primarily causes HPC damage, and that this in turn causes the damage/functional disruption in other brain regions, rather than the alternative possibility that the disease causes, e.g., thalamic damage, but the effect of that damage on cognition is mediated by secondary HPC damage); we therefore strongly believe that our mediation analyses should be retained in the manuscript. Moreover, this has been highlighted in our revised manuscript (Introduction and Discussion section – see response to point 1 above).</p><p>ii) Furthermore, multiple stepwise regressions cannot be employed for every composite memory score, given that there is multicollinearity among the independent variables of interest (e.g. HPC volumes, thalamic volumes, and rsALFF in the PCC strongly correlate across patients). This was not an issue in the case of verbal recognition memory scores, where inter-HPC rsFC did not correlate across patients with HPC volumes.</p><p>iii) Comparisons between regression slopes in a model including both HPC volumes and other structural abnormalities as independent variables [such as the approach based on (Cumming, 2009), whereby two point estimates are likely statistically significantly different from each other, when the corresponding 95% confidence intervals overlap by not more than 50%] also rely on multiple linear regression, and, since the independent variables here are strongly correlated, the issue of multi-collinearity is evident.</p><p>iv) Moreover, we have consistently avoided claiming that memory impairment correlated ‘better’ or ‘more strongly’ with extra-HPC abnormalities as compared with HPC volumes. In the original version of our manuscript, we had shown that: (a) the correlations of memory scores with extra-HPC abnormalities were significant, whereas those with HPC abnormalities were not (after correction for multiple testing); (b) the effects of HPC abnormalities on memory scores are mediated by those correlative extra-HPC abnormalities (mediation analyses); (c) moreover, in the Materials and methods section and Results section of this revised version of the manuscript, we have now introduced a series of partial correlations, demonstrating that memory scores correlated with these extra-HPC abnormalities across patients over and above the correlative HPC atrophy. This is something that we also now highlight in our Discussion section, as follows:</p><p>‘At uncorrected levels, HPC volumes correlated with both recall and recognition memory scores. Crucially, however, the reduction in PCC rsALFF correlated with verbal and visual recall and visual recognition over and above HPC atrophy and, moreover, fully mediated the effects of HPC atrophy on these aspects of episodic memory. This finding demonstrates that the HPC role in recall and recognition cannot be examined in isolation from remote effects of HPC damage within the extended HPC system.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In general, there are a large number of statistical tests performed (e.g., even when just considering the 6 different types of memory score). Even if the authors continue to report all results at p&lt;.05 uncorrected, it might be worth summarising at the end of the Results those for which they are most confident (i.e., that would survive such correction).</p></disp-quote><p>In our original manuscript, we had applied Holm-Bonferroni correction (‘p-corr’) for multiple correlations of structural/functional abnormalities with memory impairment, applied separately for each of the 6 composite scores examined (verbal recognition, visual recognition, verbal recall, visual recall, visual forgetting, remote autobiographical memory). We only considered correlations at uncorrected levels (‘p-unc’) when they pertained to HPC volumes, in order to highlight the fact that, even when the aprioristic approach focusing on HPC atrophy is adopted, the effects of HPC volume reduction on episodic memory are fully mediated by correlative abnormalities in other regions of the extended HPC system (thalamic atrophy, reduced rsALFF in the PCC; except for visual forgetting). In the Results section, we have now highlighted the fact that correction for multiple correlations was applied. Moreover, in order to address the reviewer’s concern that there was no additional correction applied for the number of the 6 different composite scores (verbal recognition, visual recognition, verbal recall, visual recall, visual forgetting, remote autobiographical memory), our revised Results section now starts with an analysis that involves correction for multiple testing for the total number of correlational analyses, as below:</p><p>‘We first applied a stringent correction for multiple testing for the total number of correlations conducted (n=39) between the brain abnormalities identified (n=13; right/left HPC volumes and right entorhinal cortical volumes, based on manual delineation; left thalamic volumes, based on automated segmentation; anterior-mediodorsal and right dorsolateral thalamic volumes and right/left HPC volumes, expressed by the VBM clusters above; reduced rsALFF in the precuneus and the PCC; reduced rsFC between the right HPC and the left HPC, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the precuneus) and the three composite memory scores (n=3; anterograde retrieval; anterograde retention; remote autobiographical memory). Three correlations survived correction for multiple tests: i) Anterograde retrieval scores correlated across patients with their reduced rsALFF in the PCC (r = 0.551; p-corr = 0.024); ii) Anterograde retention (i.e. ‘forgetting’) scores correlated with patients’ reduced right HPC volume (VBM cluster; rho = 0.556, p-corr = 0.024; manually delineated right HPC volume: rho = 0.508, p-corr = 0.079); iii) Remote autobiographical memory scores correlated with patients’ reduced volume in the left thalamus (r = 0.558; p-corr = 0.041; rest of ps, p-corr ≥ 0.105; Supplementary Table 3).</p><p>Given the striking lack of correlations with HPC volume, we addressed the possibility of false negatives in our original approach by iterating the correlational analyses above after introducing three amendments: i) we fragmented the anterograde retrieval composite score into 4 composite scores (visual / verbal recall/recognition), taking into account the possibility of different relationships of recall vs. recognition memory scores with brain abnormalities; ii) we applied a more lenient correction for the number of structural/functional abnormalities (n=13), separately for each composite score examined (n=6; visual / verbal recall / recognition, remote autobiographical memory, visual forgetting; Supplementary Table 4); iii) in a post-hoc fashion, we examined the relationship of these memory scores with the manually delineated anterior vs. posterior HPC portions at uncorrected levels (Supplementary Table 5).’</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] These findings provide important linkages with other work in the literature connecting hippocampal compromise to structural and functional integrity of the thalamus and the posterior parietal cortex.</p><p>In general, I found the paper well written, and that the methods and statistical analyses were conducted rigorously. There are a few methodological details that should be stated more clearly in the manuscript, which I have detailed below. I have some other comments and questions regarding the pattern of anatomical changes observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The finding that thalamic grey matter is reduced in these amnesic individuals is consistent with the literature on developmental amnesia (e.g. Dzieciol et al., 2017). Were the mammillary bodies examined in this dataset? It would be interesting to know if individuals who sustain hippocampal compromise during adulthood also develop atrophy within these structures. Alternatively, it would also be interesting to know if thalamic atrophy might occur in the absence of changes to the mammillary bodies, given that in the macaque and human there appear to be direct fornical projections from the hippocampus/subiculum to the anterior thalamus (Bubb et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We have not yet examined the integrity of the mammillary bodies in our structural MRI datasets. We agree that this is a very interesting question that is certainly worthy of attention. However, on reflection we feel that it might be better addressed in a follow-up manuscript, perhaps with additional reference to (i) forniceal integrity, (ii) also including manual delineation of anterior and posterior thalamic regions, (iii) since the emphasis of these analyses would be on mechanisms of damage rather than specific effects on behaviour, and (iv) since we have already taken into account several structural and functional abnormalities in examining their relationships with different aspects of memory impairment, and adding more is likely to increase the likelihood of false negatives. The following text has now been added to the Discussion section:</p><p>‘Finally, our finding that thalamic volume was reduced in our patient group is consistent with the literature on developmental amnesia due to early hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, where HPC damage has been noted along with atrophy in the thalamus and the mammillary bodies [e.g. (Dzieciol et al., 2017)]. A question for future research is therefore whether adult-onset HPC damage is accompanied by atrophy in the mammillary bodies, or whether thalamic atrophy may occur in the absence of changes to the mammillary bodies, given the evidence for direct forniceal projections from the HPC/subiculum to the anterior thalamus in human and non-human primates (Bubb et al., 2017a).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is stated that inflammatory pathology would be 'expected to spread to adjacent areas, rather than to remote regions in the extended HPC network.' Is there empirical evidence for this assertion?

As we are not aware of any findings in the literature to directly support this, we have now removed this assertion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A bit more information about the different types of functional connectivity is needed. From my read of the paper, two types of functional connectivity were performed: resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and resting-state amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (rsALFF). Why were these two methods used and what can one method offer that the other method cannot? This should be made clearer either in the methods or earlier in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Materials and methods section, we have now provided more information regarding the different types of analyses conducted on our resting-state fMRI datasets, along with further justification why rsALFF was also examined along with rsFC, as follows.</p><p>‘We explored resting-state functional abnormalities in patients with respect to both segregation and integration, i.e. in terms of hemodynamic activity in local regions and functional connectivity between regions.

We used data-driven approaches in both.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Were mediation analyses performed for each of the correlations and only reported for the models in which either the thalamic or connectivity patterns significantly mediate the relationship between hippocampal volume and memory? In some parts of the paper these mediation analyses seem hypothesis driven (e.g. subsection “Anterograde memory: Visual Recognition”) whereas in other parts of the paper I wasn't sure if these mediation analyses were hypothesized a priori (e.g. subsection “Remote Autobiographical Memory”). This issue should be made clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of our manuscript, mediation analyses were planned for the structure/function-behaviour relationships for each of the 6 memory composite scores (visual / verbal recall / recognition, visual forgetting, and remote autobiographical memory). Nevertheless, in the case of verbal recognition memory, inter-HPC rsFC did not satisfy the assumptions for conducting a mediation analysis – namely, HPC volumes did not correlate across patients with their reduced inter-HPC rsFC. Instead, we conducted a multiple step-wise linear regression analysis, to investigate whether HPC volumes explain a significant portion of the variance in addition to inter-HPC rsFC (multiple step-wise linear regression relies on the assumption that the independent variables are not correlated).</p><p>Regarding the mediation analysis reported in subsection “Remote Autobiographical Memory” of the original version of our manuscript, we wanted to investigate whether the observed abnormalities in the PCC are triggered by HPC damage by means of secondary thalamic atrophy – consistent with the idea of the HPC-diencephalic-cingulate network (Bubb et al., 2017b; Vann et al., 2009). However, since these analyses are only supplementary and do not directly address our main hypothesis (that certain aspects of memory impairment are mediated by network-wide abnormalities in the extended HPC system following HPC damage), we have moved these analyses and their discussion to Figure 2—figure supplement 1, in order to further enhance readability of our Results section (as also recommended by reviewer #1).</p><p>We have amended the beginning of our Results section with a flowchart (Figure 1) illustrating the different analyses undertaken, in order to enhance readability. We also provide a brief outline of the structure of our Results section, as follows:</p><p>‘Our analysis approach is summarized in Figure 1. We first (1) identified cognitive deficits by comparing patients with healthy controls in a broad range of tests of neuropsychological assessment. We then (2) identified regions in which patients showed structural and (3) functional abnormalities relative to healthy controls. We then (4) examined the relationship between structural / functional brain abnormalities and memory impairment across our patients.’</p><p>In our revised Introduction, we now highlight that mediation analyses were conducted with HPC volumes as the independent variable:</p><p>‘We predicted that:: i) HPC damage (documented to occur focally in autoimmune LE) would be accompanied by remote abnormalities in hubs of the extended HPC system, including the HPC-diencephalic-cingulate network (Aggleton, 2014; Bubb et al., 2017a); ii) variation in the extent of these network-wide abnormalities across patients would explain variability in memory impairment over and above HPC atrophy; iii) Moreover, on our assumption that HPC damage leads to broader network disruption, we predicted that relationships between HPC atrophy and memory impairment would be mediated by this broader network disruption. This prediction is in line with recent functional imaging and lesion studies that emphasize the importance of broader networks in episodic memory (Cook et al., 2015; Henson et al., 2016; Inhoff and Ranganath, 2017; Schedlbauer et al., 2015; Watrous et al., 2013); iv) taking these abnormalities into account would enable us to identify which particular aspects of memory impairment are a direct function of HPC atrophy.’</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The main findings are that, while the patients have relatively focal volume loss within the hippocampus, the relationships between hippocampal volume and memory performance are usually mediated by relationships with other brain structures: notably functional connectivity with posterior midline regions in the case of anterograde memory and grey matter volume in the thalamus in the case of retrograde memory. I think these findings will make a useful contribution to the field of memory research, but I have a few issues that I feel the authors should address.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their encouraging feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the volumetric analyses, the authors seem to be testing whether the patient group as a whole has volume loss greater than 1.5 SDs below the mean of the controls. If correct, this seems to be extremely conservative and rather unusual. I would have expected a more direct comparison between the volumes of the patients and controls – with indications of the effect size of the difference. This is the approach done with the neuropsychological tests. It might help if the degree of volume loss is expressed as a percentage of the controls, with statistics relating to the direct comparison of the patients and controls. Perhaps I am missing something here?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. reviewer 1 has made the same point. Our original approach had been adopted in keeping with standard practice in single-case and case-series studies, whereby HPC volumes of individual patients are shown to exceed the traditionally employed cut-off point of -1.5 SD from the mean of age-matched healthy controls, in the face of other MTL structures not exceeding this cut-off point. We have now adopted the quantification of HPC (and other MTL and subcortical) volumes according to the method the reviewer recommended, and we have iterated the analyses of structure/function-behavior relationships, after regressing volumes against age, sex, scan source, and TIV across participants (as already done for the mean signal of each VBM cluster in the original manuscript). We have also included the mean and SD of the% volume reduction for our patient group in Table 2. We clarify this in our revised Materials and methods section:</p><p>‘We compared healthy controls and patients on the volumes of all structures in a series of ANCOVAs, using age, sex, scan source [MAP (Memory and Amnesia Project), or OPTIMA (Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Aging)], and total intra-cranial volume (TIV; derived from the unified segmentation procedure in SPM12; see below) as between-subjects covariates. Volumes that were reduced in our patient group were residualized against these four variables (z-res) and entered in a series of bivariate correlations with patients’ memory scores.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors correlate MRI measures with composite measures of performance based on averaging across tests of anterograde memory in which patients showed impairment. This seems an inadequate justification for choosing which tests contribute to the composite measures. It is interesting that the patients are unimpaired on tests of face recognition memory, and as the authors point out, this is in keeping with other findings (e.g. Taylor et al., 2007; Bird and Burgess, 2008; Smith et al., 2014; Bird, 2017). This would constitute a reasonable justification for not including face recognition memory in a composite visual recognition memory measure in patients with hippocampal damage. However, the selection of measures based on performance alone is biased.</p></disp-quote><p>Our aim was to identify explanations of memory impairment in patients, without taking the extra hypothetical step of attempting to identify the neural correlates of normal performance on the tasks. In the same manner, we focused on the brain regions where analyses showed a group difference from controls. We thus correlated abnormal brain structure / function with abnormal behaviour. Since face recognition memory was unimpaired in patients, we did not include it in the composite score of visual recognition memory. We agree with the reviewer that, since normal face recognition is in keeping with findings from other groups, omitting it from the composite score is justified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the description of the methods for &quot;Resting-state Hemodynamic activity: rsALFF&quot; the authors define RsALFF as the total power within the frequency rage (0.01-0.1 Hz). However, in the pre-processing section they say that they apply a temporal band pass filter of 0.01-0.1 Hz. To me, this would appear to affect the signal that they want to analyse. Could the authors justify their procedure and confirm if this procedure is used by other groups reporting the results of RsALFF analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm that the majority of the papers reporting analyses of resting-state ALFF have employed the same preprocessing step, i.e. band-pass filtering to retain frequencies between 0.01Hz and 0.1 Hz. This procedure removes low-frequency drift and high-frequency respiratory and cardiac noise, before examining ALFF within the low-frequency range of oscillations (0.01-0.1 Hz) (e.g. (Cui et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2012; Satterthwaite et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2012; Yi et al., 2012)). We have now added a clarification in our Materials and methods section:</p><p>‘The same pre-processing pipeline was used for both rsALFF and rsFC analyses, including denoising with a temporal band pass filter (0.01-0.1 Hz), as in the majority of studies examining rsALFF [e.g. (Cui et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2012; Satterthwaite et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2012; Yi et al., 2012)].’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study and its results are situated with respect to neural dysfunction at sites separated from the hippocampus. While this is very likely to be the cause of volume loss in the thalamus, it is not necessarily the case for the resting state fMRI results. It is possible that the patients engage different cognitive processes during the resting state scan compared to the controls – and therefore the differences in the engagement of the anterior and posterior midline structures reflects this. These regions are strongly implicated in &quot;mind-wandering&quot; – following undirected trains of thought. There is also evidence that patients with hippocampal damage differ markedly in the form and content of their mind-wandering compared with healthy adults (McCormick et al., 2018). It is also possible that the patients simply forgot what they were doing in the scanner, and spent more time attending to, e.g., the noise of the scanner than the controls did. My point is that functional differences between the patients and controls could reflect the BOLD engagement in different cognitive processes rather than more fundamental differences in neuro/vascular functioning in these regions per se. I would encourage the authors to discuss this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is making an important and interesting point, and we have now acknowledged this interpretation in our Discussion section:</p><p>‘It is important to acknowledge an alternative interpretation of the relationship that we observed between resting-state functional abnormalities and memory measures. McCormick and colleagues recently showed that HPC amnesics differ in the form and content of their ‘mind-wandering’ compared with healthy adults (McCormick et al., 2018). It is possible that ‘resting-state’ functional abnormalities in our patients actually reflect (and are perhaps therefore mediated by) differences between healthy controls and patients with respect to the extent of mind wandering in the scanner, rather than differences in neurovascular functioning in these regions per se. Anterior and posterior midline structures are strongly implicated in mind-wandering. Nevertheless, rsfMRI measures (predominantly rsFC) have repeatedly provided reliable correlates of memory impairment in HPC amnesia [e.g. (Heine et al., 2018; Henson et al., 2016)]. Moreover, this interpretation is not inconsistent with the basic premise of our argument, namely, that the effects of HPC damage on memory are mediated by other processes that are compromised following HPC damage. Our study was not designed to disambiguate the level of disruption that is mediating the effects of HPC atrophy. In other words, the disruption could be at the cognitive level, or at the neurovascular level, or at both levels. Further work is needed to disambiguate those two interpretations.’</p></body></sub-article></article>
