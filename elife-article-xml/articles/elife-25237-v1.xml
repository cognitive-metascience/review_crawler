encoding ribosome proteins (RP). However, the roles of LARP1 in the translation of 5’TOP mRNAs are controversial and its regulatory roles in mTORC1-mediated translation remain unclear. Here we show that LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1. Deep sequencing of LARP1-bound mRNAs reveal that non-phosphorylated LARP1 interacts with both 5’ and 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs and inhibits their translation. Importantly, phosphorylation of LARP1 by mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1 dissociates it from 5’UTRs and relieves its inhibitory activity on RP mRNA translation. Concomitantly, phosphorylated LARP1 scaffolds mTORC1 on the 3’UTRs of translationally-competent RP mRNAs to facilitate mTORC1-dependent induction of translation initiation. Thus, in response to cellular mTOR activity, LARP1 serves as a phosphorylation-sensitive molecular switch for turning off or on RP mRNA translation and subsequent ribosome biogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25237.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25237.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>La-related protein 1</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>S6K1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM088565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>John K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoki</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TS140055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoki</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK083491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoki</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LARP1 turns off and on the translation of an essential class of mRNAs by acting as a key effecter and regulator for mTORC1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) functions as a positive regulator of translation initiation and protein synthesis to promote cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>). Short-term treatment with rapamycin, an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor, only partially inhibits global protein synthesis but effectively blocks the translation of certain 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5’TOP) mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jefferies et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>). In contrast, recent studies using newly developed specific mTOR kinase inhibitors such as Torin1 demonstrate that complete inhibition of cellular mTOR kinase activity results in strong suppression of nearly all mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). However, the sensitivity of translation inhibition by mTOR kinase inhibitors still varies significantly among different mRNAs, and the translation of mRNAs containing pyrimidine-enriched sequence (PES) in their 5’UTRs (i.e., 5’TOP, TOP-like, and pyrimidine rich translation element (PRTE) sequences) is much more effectively inhibited. Moreover, the sensitivity of translation inhibition by mTOR inhibitors also varies within PES-containing mRNAs.</p><p>The 4EBP family of proteins have been proposed to play a key role in suppressing the translation of PES-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which inhibition of active eIF4F complex formation by 4EBPs further potentiates translation inhibition of PES-containing mRNAs remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miloslavski et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that La-related proteins 1 (LARP1), an evolutionarily conserved RNA binding protein, interacts with components of the active eIF4F complex and mTORC1 and regulates the translation of TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>). LARP1 directly interacts with the TOP sequences of 5’TOP mRNAs such as those that encode ribosome proteins (RP) in vitro and stabilizes RP mRNAs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lahr et al., 2015</xref>). However, the roles of LARP1 in mTORC1-mediated RP mRNA translation remain controversial because previous studies propose conflicting models wherein LARP1 functions as either a positive or negative regulator of RP mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, how LARP1 involves in mTORC1-mediated RP mRNA translation also remains unclear.</p><p>In this report, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of LARP1 function in the mTORC1-mediated translation of RP mRNAs. We first identified mRNAs and sequences directly bound by endogenous LARP1 in vivo under normal growing and mTORC1-inhibited conditions using photoactivatable ribonucleoside–enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). As predicted, LARP1 directly interacts with pyrimidine-enriched sequences (PES) of mRNAs such as RP mRNAs that significantly overlap with those regulated by mTOR activity. However, LARP1 interacts with the 3’UTR of RP mRNAs under growth conditions while it also binds to specific PES at the 3’end of their 5’UTRs when mTOR activity is inhibited. Thus, LARP1 may not be a bona fide 5’TOP binding protein in vivo. We identified that these dynamic LARP1 interactions with RP mRNAs are regulated through direct phosphorylations of LARP1 by mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1. Phosphorylation of LARP1 induces its dissociation from the PES in 5’UTRs but enhances its binding to 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs. Importantly, phosphorylated LARP1 also functions as a scaffolding protein for mTORC1 on translationally-competent LARP1-interacting mRNAs to facilitate mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate proteins, 4EBP1 and S6K1, processes that are essential for translation initiation and elongation. Thus, the spatial recruitment of mTORC1 by LARP1 to specific translational machinery may provide significant advantages for the translation of LARP1-associated RP mRNAs. As a unique substrate of mTORC1 and Akt/S6K1, we propose that LARP1 functions as a phosphorylation-sensitive molecular switch in the translation of an essential class of mRNAs as well as an important regulator of mTORC1 itself.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic LARP1 interaction with RP mRNAs in an mTOR activity-dependent manner</title><p>While several recent studies have indicated that LARP1 associates with 5’TOP mRNAs through their TOP sequences or polyA tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lahr et al., 2015</xref>), the comprehensive identity and sequence characteristics of mRNAs that preferentially interact with LARP1 have not been defined. To address this gap, we performed PAR-CLIP of endogenous LARP1 in HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of an mTOR inhibitor (PP242), followed by deep sequencing of the LARP1-bound RNA substrates (The data set was deposited: GEO: GSE59599). One advantage of PAR-CLIP over conventional UV crosslinking methodologies is the signature of specific T-to-C conversions in the resulting sequencing reads that mark where the incorporated 4-thiouracil of RNAs form covalent linkages with the interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>). Sequenced reads were mapped using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) to the human transcriptome, clustered to derive LARP1 binding sites, and filtered to retain clusters containing 0–2 T-to-C conversion events and passing an empirically-derived reads per million mapped reads (RPM) threshold (details in Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In parallel, replicate mRNA-seq experiments were performed in the presence or absence of PP242 to quantify gene expression and normalize LARP1 binding sites to mRNA abundance levels. We identified 1200 and 1,900 LARP1 binding sites on 1000 and 1500 mRNAs in the presence or absence of PP242, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis of genes bound by LARP1 in growing conditions revealed enrichment for terms related to translation.

Strikingly, LARP1 binding at 5’UTRs of TR genes more than doubled upon mTOR-inactivation, and binding on RP genes increased from 0% to 17% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further explore this observation, we plotted the accumulation of LARP1 binding under growing and mTOR-inactive conditions along normalized gene lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Across non-TR mRNAs, LARP1 preferentially associated with CDSs and 3’UTRs, but was almost completely absent from 5’UTRs. In contrast, LARP1 bound most strongly to 3’UTRs of TR and RP mRNAs under growing conditions. Importantly, under conditions of mTOR inactivation, LARP1 accumulated at 5’UTRs, with the majority of 5’UTR binding occurring on RP transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since LARP1 regulates PES-containing mRNAs, including 5’TOP sequences, we searched the 58 and 92 5’UTR LARP1 binding sites under growing and mTOR-inactive conditions, respectively, for a consensus motif using MEME. We identified six consecutive pyrimidines in all 5’UTR LARP1 binding sites, suggesting that LARP1 binds directly to PESs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, 5’UTR LARP1 binding sites rarely overlapped with 5’TOP sequences, which are located at the 5’-most end of 5’UTRs; instead, LARP1 binds predominantly at the 3’-most end of 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In fact, 5’TOP-containing 5’UTRs bound by LARP1 are more pyrimidine-rich at their 3’ ends than those not bound by LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm that LARP1 binds PESs within target 5’UTRs, we compared pyrimidine-richness of LARP1-bound regions to non-LARP1-bound regions of these 5’UTRs and observed a significantly higher proportion of pyrimidines in LARP1-bound regions under both growing (Welch’s two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test: p=1.4e-15) and mTOR-inactive (p=1.2e-18) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that LARP1 specifically recognizes and binds PESs at the 3’-end of 5’UTRs for a subset of TR and RP transcripts and that LARP1 is not a genuine 5’TOP RNA binding protein (RBP) in vivo.</p><p>LARP1 also binds CDSs of non-TR genes and 3’UTRs of TR and RP mRNAs. We identified GA-rich motifs in 9–15% of these sites under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). LARP1-bound 3’UTR regions are slightly, but significantly, enriched for higher G-content than non-LARP1-bound regions on the same 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These motifs are similar to ones identified for RRM domain-containing RBPs in a recent systematic in vitro study characterizing the sequence-specific recognition sites for RBPs across 24 eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ray et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting a possible role of LARP1’s RRM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayfield et al., 2010</xref>) to interact with CDSs and 3’UTRs.</p><p>The relationship between LARP1 binding and decreases in translational efficiency (TE) upon mTOR inactivation are paralleled in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We obtained measurements of changes in mouse transcript TE upon treatment of cells with Torin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). Thirty-three percent of human homologs of mouse genes exhibiting decreased TE were bound by LARP1 in mTOR-inactive conditions compared to only 12% and 14% of genes showing no change in or increased TE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We next wondered if increased pyrimidine richness observed at 3’ ends of LARP1-bound 5’UTRs is functionally linked to mTOR-dependent changes in TE rates. We compared 5’UTR pyrimidine content of mouse RP-encoding mRNAs exhibiting the greatest changes in TE to those exhibiting the least and saw no difference at the 5’-most region of the 5’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Strikingly, however, the 3’-most 5’UTR region of the most affected genes contained a significantly higher proportion of pyrimidines compared to the least affected genes (Welch’s two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test: p=0.036), indicating that pyrimidine richness at LARP1-interacting regions of 5’UTRs is correlated with strong decreases in TE upon mTOR inactivation. Together, these results suggest that the relationship between LARP1 binding and decreased TE is conserved from mouse to human.</p><p>Of the 88 annotated human ribosomal proteins, mRNAs encoding 84 were expressed in our mRNA-seq libraries under both conditions.

Taken together, these observations raise the intriguing possibility that the function of LARP1 in regulating RP mRNA translation may be context-dependent: the interaction of LARP1 with PESs in the 5’UTRs of RP mRNAs may have an inhibitory role, whereas its interaction with 3’UTRs may exert a positive role in RP mRNA translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LARP1 is a direct substrate of Akt/S6K1 and mTORC1</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms by which site-specific LARP1 interaction with RP mRNAs is regulated by the activity of mTOR, we examined the roles of post-translational modifications of LARP1 regulated by mTOR activity. Previous genome-wide phospho-mass spectrometry analyses showed that LARP1 is a highly phosphorylated protein and has Torin1-sensitive phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation of LARP1 may regulate the configurations of LARP1-RP mRNA interaction. Phospho-mass spectrometry analysis targeting endogenous LARP1 revealed that more than 10 LARP1 phosphorylation sites, eight (highlighted by red color) of which were significantly sensitive to short-term Torin1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), were identified. Among the Torin1-sensitive phosphorylation sites, two serine residues (Ser770 and Ser979), which follow the typical consensus motif (RxRxx[S/T]) for AGC kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), were directly phosphorylated by S6K1 or Akt in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further, in vitro kinase assays using multiple polypeptides containing these Torin1-sensitive phosphorylation sites identified that Ser689 and Thr692, which do not match the AGC kinase phosphorylation motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), were directly phosphorylated by mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These observations indicate that LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTOR, S6K, and Akt. Overexpression of active S6K1 or Akt induced phosphorylation of the RxRxx[S] motifs of wild type LARP1 but not the LARP1 2A mutant, where both Ser770 and Ser979 were substituted with alanine, in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Active Akt-induced LARP1 phosphorylation was not inhibited by rapamycin or S6K1 inhibitor (PF-4708671: PF), confirming that Akt is also able to directly phosphorylate LARP1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To investigate the functional roles of endogenous S6K1 and Akt in the phosphorylation of LARP1, we examined the phosphorylation status of LARP1 under acutely stimulated (growth factor/amino acid starvation for 60 min then stimulation with growth factor/amino acid for 10 min) or steady state growth conditions with or without the addition of rapamycin, Torin1, or a specific Akt inhibitor, MK-2206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Upon growth factor/amino acid stimulation, the phosphorylation of both Akt and S6K1 was enhanced compared to those under starvation conditions. Simultaneously, the phosphorylation of LARP1, as detected by both the Akt substrate antibody and the pS979 LARP1 antibody, was enhanced. Importantly, under this acutely stimulated condition, rapamycin, which completely inhibits S6K1, but not Akt, had little effect on S770/S979 phosphorylation of LARP1. In contrast, the Akt inhibitor MK-2206, as well as Torin1, which inhibit both Akt and S6K1, largely inhibited S770/S979 phosphorylation of LARP1.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25237.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTOR, Akt, and S6K1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic position of LARP1 phosphorylation sites identified by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS).

However, alanine substitutions of mTOR (S689/T692) and S6K1/Akt (S770/S979) phosphorylation sites confer the LARP1 4A mutant (open bar) resistant to its dissociation from the 5’UTR in response to amino acid stimulation. Furthermore, the PES located at the 3’ end of the RpL32 5’UTR was essential for its interaction with LARP1 as substitutions of pyrimidines with guanines (5’conv) in the PES region within the 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) dramatically reduced its interaction with both wild type LARP1 and LARP1 4A mutant even under amino acid starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The LARP1 14A mutant, which bears an additional 10 alanine substitutions in the phosphorylation sites identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, also displayed enhanced binding to the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA, similar to the LARP1 4A mutant compared to wild type LARP1 under growth culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results indicate that phosphorylation of these four serine/threonine residues plays a key role in reducing the interaction of LARP1 with the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA through the PES. Further analyses revealed that both mTOR- and S6K1-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation were required to reduce its binding to the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA, while either mTOR- or S6K1-dependent phosphorylation of LARP1 was sufficient to maintain its association with the 3’UTR under steady state growth condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistently, the inhibition of S6K1 activity with PF-4709671 sufficiently blocked the reduction of LARP1’s binding to the 5’ UTR of RpL32 mRNA as did amino acid starvation, rapamycin or Torin1 treatment, which inhibits both S6K1 and mTORC1 activity. However, PF-470961 treatment alone failed to induce the dissociation of LARP1 from the 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together with our PAR-CLIP data, these observations indicate that the affinity of LARP1 binding to the 5’ and 3’ UTR of RpL32 mRNA dynamically changes in a manner dependent on mTOR and S6K1/Akt-dependent phosphorylation.</p><p>To examine the configuration of LARP1 binding to the 5’UTR and 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA, we performed PAR-CLIP assays using endogenous LARP1 with the reporter mRNAs containing both the 5’ and 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA. Interestingly, under cross-linking conditions, LARP1 can bind the wild type (5’/3’) or the 5’UTR-mutated (5’conv/3’) reporter mRNA equally well in the presence or absence of Torin1 treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These observations suggest that the same amount of LARP1 constantly interacts with the UTRs of RpL32 mRNA under both high and low mTOR activity conditions, although the affinity of LARP1 binding to the 5’ and 3’ UTR of RpL32 mRNA significantly changes in response to cellular mTOR/Akt activity. This raises the possibility that non-phospohrylated LARP1 may simultaneously interact with both the 5’ and 3’ UTR of the same RpL32 mRNA under low mTOR activity conditions while phosphorylated LARP1 dissociates from the 5’UTR and mainly interacts with the 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA.</p><p>To examine the significance of LARP1 interaction with the 5’ or 3’UTR in the translation of RpL32 mRNA, we measured luciferase production from the indicated reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Luciferase protein expression from the reporter containing both 5’ and 3’UTRs of RpL32 was consistently higher compared to the reporter with just 5’UTR, suggesting that the 3’ UTR is important for stimulating RpL32 translation. Both the 5’ UTR-mutated reporter (5’conv/3’) and the wild type reporter (5’/3’) generate similar levels of luciferase protein under growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, filled bars) that induce LARP1 dissociation from the 5’UTR. Importantly, under mild serum starvation conditions, the 5’UTR-mutated reporter (5’conv/3’) produces more luciferase protein compared to the wild type reporter (5’/3’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, open bars). Furthermore, phosphorylatable wild type Myc-LARP1 showed some advantages in stimulating translation of the 5’conv/3’ reporter compared to the wild type 5’/3’ reporter in cells lacking endogenous LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In contrast, the phopho-defective Myc-LARP1 4A mutant significantly and equally inhibited the translation of both reporters, regardless of the existence (5’/3’) or absence (5’conv/3’) of the LARP1 binding site in the 5’UTR in these cells. These observations indicate that the dissociation of LARP1 from the PES motif in the 5’UTR and the phosphorylation of LARP1, which enhances LARP1 binding to the 3’UTR, are important processes in stimulating RpL32 mRNA translation. Moreover, the data also suggest that the phosphorylation of LARP1 has an additional key role in stimulating the translation of RpL32 mRNA at the 3’UTR (see Figures 5 and 6). Note that the translation of the 5’conv/3’ mutant reporter was slightly, but significantly, enhanced compared to the 5’/3’ wild type reporter in cells expressing ectopic Myc-LARP1, which was not seen in the cells expressing just endogenous LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We speculate that overexpressed Myc-LARP1 may not be fully phosphorylated in our experimental conditions. As a consequence, non-phosphorylated wild type LARP1 may still bind to the PES in the 5’UTR and reduce the translation of the wild type 5’/3’ reporter. Accordingly, cells expressing the LARP1 4A mutant, which strongly binds to the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA irrespective of cellular mTOR activity, have reduced expression of RP proteins including RpL32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Together with our PAR-CLIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these observations suggest that LARP1 stimulates RP mRNA translation through its interaction with the 3’UTR and that its association with the 5’UTR has a negative role in RP mRNA translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LARP1 recruits mTORC1 to LARP1-interacting mRNPs in a manner dependent of mTORC1 activity</title><p>To stimulate the translation of 5’TOP mRNAs, previous studies have proposed that LARP1 directly interacts with initiation factors and polyA-binding protein (PABP) in response to mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>).

As expected, LARP1 co-IPed not only mTORC1 and PABP1, but also eIF4E, a 5’CAP mRNA binding initiation factor. While LARP1 interaction with mTORC1 was resistant to RNaseA treatment, its interaction with PABP1 and eIF4E was markedly sensitive to RNaseA treatment. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, eIF4G1, a scaffolding protein for forming the eIF4F complex, co-IPed other eIF4F components and LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Although the interaction between eIF4G1 and other eIF4F components such as eIF4E, eIF3B, and PABP1 was RNaseA resistant, the binding of eIF4G1 to LARP1 was abolished by the treatment with RNaseA. Interestingly, LARP1 coIPed more mTORC1 from lysates treated with RNaseA than in untreated lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that a substantial pool of the mTORC1-LARP1 complex is refractory to IP with the LARP1 antibody under standard lysis conditions and may exist in an RNaseA-sensitive pool. Taken together, these data indicate that LARP1 indirectly associates with PABP1 and initiation factors through binding of common mRNAs, while LARP1-mTORC1 interaction occurs through direct protein-protein contacts.</p><p>Importantly, the activity of mTORC1 plays a key role in LARP1’s binding to mTORC1 but not to PABP1. LARP1 failed to interact with mTORC1 but maintained its interaction with PABP1 subjected to mTOR inhibitors, suggesting that LARP1 associates with mRNAs regardless of cellular mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), consistent with our PAR-CLIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction between endogenous LARP1 and mTORC1 was quickly and fully restored by replenishment of amino acids and growth factors after starvation of these activating cues, whereas the interaction between LARP1 and PABP1 was not affected by these cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, recovery of the interaction between LARP1 and mTORC1 by growth factor/nutrient stimulation occurred concomitantly with 4EBP1 phosphorylation but precedes full phosphorylation of S6K1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LARP1 scaffolds mTORC1 to LARP1-interacting mRNAs in a manner dependent on LARP1 phosphorylation</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of the LARP1-mTORC1 complex, we determined regions of LARP1 necessary to associate with mTORC1. Interestingly, serial truncations of the LARP1 carboxyl terminus revealed that the DM15 motif and an N-terminal region adjacent to the DM15 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), where the majority of Torin1-sensitive LARP1 phosphorylations occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), were critical for its association with mTORC1.

While the replacement of LARP1 Akt/S6K1 phosphorylation sites with alanines only slightly reduced LARP1 interaction with mTORC1, mutations in the LARP1 mTOR phosphorylation sites largely abrogated its interaction with mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, both the wild type and LARP1 4A mutant were able to associate with PABP1 equally well through their binding to common mRNAs; however, PABP1 co-IPed mTORC1 only in the presence of wild-type LARP1 but not the LARP1 4A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These observations suggest that LARP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 is critical for tethering mTORC1 to the LARP1-mRNP complex. In support of this hypothesis, under growth conditions where phosphorylated LARP1 mainly binds to the 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>), mTORC1 associated more with the 3’UTR than the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA in Raptor CLIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). mTORC1 association with RpL32 mRNA was dependent on wild type LARP1 but not the LARP1 4A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Moreover, wild type LARP1 supports greater association of mTORC1 with its substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1 than the LARP1 4A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that while non-phosphorylated LARP1 blocks RP mRNA translation through its interaction with the 5’UTR of RP mRNAs, phosphorylated LARP1 is converted into a scaffolding protein for mTORC1 on the 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs to facilitate the accessibility of mTORC1 with 4EBP1 and S6K1.</p><p>To further investigate the roles of LARP1 in mTORC1-dependet phosphorylation of its substrates, endogenous LARP1 was knocked down in mammalian cells with varying degrees of insulin sensitivity. In HEK293T cells (insulin insensitive), ablation of LARP1 slightly decreased phosphorylation of S6K1, S6, and 4EBP1 compared to those in control cells under normal growth culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, in response to growth factor/amino acids stimulation, LARP1 knockdown significantly delayed and attenuated phosphorylation of these proteins in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), LnCap (prostate cancer cell line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and HEK293E cells (insulin sensitive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, Akt phosphorylation (Ser473) was not affected by the ablation of LARP1, indicating that the activity of PI3K and mTORC2 was intact in the LARP1 knockdown cells. In addition, LARP1 knockdown had little effect on intrinsic mTOR kinase activity monitored by mTOR auto-phosphorylation (Ser2481) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Copp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peterson et al., 2000</xref>), or on the integrity of mTORC1 and its kinase activity as measured by in vitro kinase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Consistently, LARP1 knockdown partially decreased eIF4E in fractions containing pre-initiation complex (43S and 48S: fraction 5 and 6) while Torin 1, an mTOR kinase inhibitor, largely eliminated eIF4E from these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data indicate that a fraction of cellular translation initiation is decreased in LARP1 knockdown cells. However, intriguingly, RP mRNAs that interact with LARP1 accumulated more in lighter polysome fractions in LARP1 knockdown cells compared to control cells under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In control cells, acute nutrient/growth factor starvation selectively redistributes RP mRNAs from the polysome fractions to the monosome (80S) fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, middle panels). In contrast, under the same starvation conditions, LARP1 knockdown results in retention of a substantial portion of RP mRNAs in the polysomes fractions while attenuating the accumulation of RP mRNAs in the monosome fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, middle panels). These observations suggest that RP mRNA translation is less sensitive to the inhibition caused by growth factor/nutrient depletion in LARP1 knockdown cells. Furthermore, replenishing growth factors and nutrients following identical starvation conditions showed similar RP mRNA distribution in polysome fractions in both control and LARP1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, right panels). These results suggest that both ribosome dissociation from RP mRNAs and ribosome loading on RP mRNAs are inefficient, and that ribosome stalling may occur during RP mRNA elongation in LARP1 knockdown cells. However, non-LARP1 interacting mRNAs such as FOXO1 and YBX1 did not accumulate in polysome fractions in LARP1 knockdown cells, indicative of the specific roles of LARP1 in preventing ribosome stalling during the translation of LARP1 interacting mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, prolonged LARP1 knockdown decreased RP protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and reduced global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) without significantly affecting levels of RP mRNAs. In multiple cancer cell lines (PC3 (prostate), SW40 (colon), HeLa (cervix), and MDA MB231 (breast)), expression levels of LARP1 and RP proteins were well correlated and often enhanced compared to those in non-transformed normal cells (human normal fibroblasts: HNF, and human normal prostate epithelial cells: PrEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, left upper panels). Furthermore, there was an especially clear trend of higher LARP1 and RP protein expression in multiple prostate cancer cell lines (LnCap, 22RV1, PC3, and Du145) compared with those in non-transformed (PrEC) or transformed (PTN2 and RWPE) normal prostate epithelial cells (left lower panels). Again, there was clear positive correlation between the expression of LARP1 and the RP proteins (e.g. RpS6, right upper panel) but not between LARP1 protein and RpS6 mRNA (right lower panel) in prostate cancer and normal cells.

Together, these observations indicate that LARP1 functions as a phosphorylation-sensitive switch for inhibiting or stimulating the translation of RP mRNAs in response to the mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), thereby titrating cellular ribosomes and the capacity of cellular protein synthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate the critical role of LARP1 in the mTORC1-dependent translation of PES-containing mRNAs, especially those that encode ribosome proteins. Key mechanistic insights from this study reveal that (1) LARP1 is a direct substrate of mTOR and S6K1/Akt; (2) the phosphorylation of LARP1 by the mTORC1 pathway triggers the dissociation of LARP1 from the 5’UTR of the RP mRNAs; (3) concomitantly, phosphorylation of LARP1 induces its stable interaction with mTORC1 and recruits mTORC1 to the 3’UTR of RP mRNAs; (4) LARP1 facilitates mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1, a process essential for inducing translation initiation of RP mRNAs; and (5) while LARP1 is necessary for the blockade of RP mRNA translation in response to starvation, it is required for efficient translation elongation of RP mRNAs. Thus, LARP1 is a unique mTORC1 substrate and regulator, and functions as a molecular switch for turning off or on the translation of RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our data reveal that LARP1 mainly associates with the 3’UTR of mRNAs including RP mRNAs under high mTOR activity conditions, while it also directly binds to PES regions of RP 5’UTRs when mTOR activity is inhibited. Intriguingly, recent reports demonstrate that recombinant LARP1 binds to the TOP sequence of RpL32 and RpS6 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lahr et al., 2015</xref>). However, our PAR-CLIP analyses using endogenous LARP1 showed that LARP1 binding within 5’UTRs of 5’TOP mRNAs, such as RpL32 mRNA, occurs predominantly at PES regions in the 3’ end of the 5’UTRs and not at the 5’TOP sequences themselves in vivo, when mTORC1 activity is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We posit that while LARP1 has a strong affinity for pyrimidine cluster sequences, the 5’TOP sequences of RP mRNAs are likely to be occupied by other 5’TOP-binding proteins in vivo. Alternatively, it is possible that mutations or deletions of 5’TOP sequences might structurally affect the function of the PES motifs of RP mRNAs in vitro. Our data demonstrate that the mutation of the PES in the 3’ end of the 5’UTR largely reduce LARP1’s binding to the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA and renders RpL32 mRNA translation resistant to starvation, suggesting that LARP1 binding to the PES regions in the 5’UTRs of RP mRNAs inhibits their translation. Furthermore, the dissociation of LARP1 from the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA requires both mTORC1- and S6K1/Akt-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that LARP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 and S6K1/Akt relieves its inhibitory role in translation at the 5’UTRs of RP mRNAs.</p><p>Importantly, our data also demonstrate that phosphorylated LARP1 serves as a nucleation site onto which mTORC1 can associate with translationally-competent mRNAs. mTORC1-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation plays a key role in scaffolding mTORC1 on LARP1-interacting RpL32 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, phosphorylated LARP1 and mTORC1 mainly associates with the 3’UTR of RP mRNAs under high mTOR activity conditions. In contrast, phospho-defective mutant LARP1 interacts with the 5’UTR of RP mRNAs regardless of the status of mTOR activity and fails to scaffold mTORC1. Therefore, mTORC1 association with the 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs via LARP1 interaction may allow for a local enhancement of mTORC1 activity to activate the eIF4F complex and thus secure intact translation of LARP1-interacting RP mRNAs. This model provides the mechanistic underpinning for how translation of PES containing mRNAs, such as RP mRNAs, is regulated by LARP1 and may explain why the translation of these mRNAs is sensitive to mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Given that mTORC1-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation to scaffold mTORC1 is important for mTORC1 phosphorylation of S6K1, mTORC1 may phosphorylate LARP1 prior to S6K1-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation. In support of this model, formation of the LARP1-mTORC1 complex precedes full S6K1 activity/phosphorylation by growth factor/nutrient stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Alternatively, Akt may first phosphorylate LARP1 to prepare mTORC1 phosphorylation of LARP1 for its dissociation from the 5’UTR of RP mRNAs. This functional redundancy of S6K1 and Akt in the phosphorylation of LARP1 may explain previous studies where translation of certain 5’TOP mRNAs was shown to be intact in S6K1/2 null cells but still rapamycin sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pende et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Tcherkezian et al. recently proposed that upon mTOR activation, LARP1 associates with the initiation complex as well as polysomes through PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tcherkezian et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, they proposed that the DM15 repeats of LARP1 play important roles for its interaction with PABP, eIF4E, and polysomes. Although Tcherkezian et al. and our study both demonstrate important positive roles of LARP1 in the translation of certain 5’ TOP mRNAs, our data indicate that the direct binding of LARP1 to a subset of mRNAs does not depend on direct binding to PABP. Instead, we demonstrate that endogenous LARP1 interactions with PABP1 and initiation factors are sensitive to RNase A treatment and thus occur indirectly through binding of common shared mRNA substrates. Intriguingly, our biochemical data suggest that the region containing the DM15 motif is necessary for LARP1 to interact with mTORC1. We speculate that reduced translation in cells expressing mutant LARP1 lacking the complete DM15 motif demonstrated by Tcherkezian et al. may be in part due to a loss of LARP1’s scaffolding role for mTORC1, thereby mitigating translation initiation of mRNAs that bind to the mutant LARP1. Moreover, Tcherkezian et al. demonstrated that LARP1 knockdown significantly enhanced the level of 80S monosomes, indicative of a strong inhibition of initiation similar to short-term mTOR inhibitor treatment. They also observed that levels of RP mRNAs associated with polysomes were significantly reduced in LARP1 knockdown cells compared to those in control cells. In contrast, we observed that levels of RP mRNAs in fractions containing polysomes are rather increased in LARP1 knockdown cells, which is consistent with the data more recently published by Fonseca et al., although our data disagreed with the conclusion that LARP1 is a simple suppressor of translation as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonseca et al. (2015)</xref>. While the reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear, our multiple lines of biochemical evidence indicate that loss of LARP1 causes defects in translation at multiple steps, including abnormal translation initiation and inefficient translation elongation likely due to ribosome stalling on LARP1-interacting mRNAs. Therefore, we propose that LARP1 function is context dependent: non-phosphorylated LARP1 acts as a suppressor of translation initiation of RP mRNAs when mTOR activity is inhibited, whereas upon mTOR activation, phosphorylated LARP1 promotes translation of RP mRNAs at both translation initiation and elongation steps.</p><p>Circularization of linear mRNAs through the interaction between the 5’Cap-binding translation initiation factors and PABPs has been recognized as the active conformation for their translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wells et al., 1998</xref>). mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBPs plays a critical role in the induction of this topological change. Our characterization of LARP1 interaction with RpL32 mRNA indicates that LARP1 interacts with both the 5’ and 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA under low mTOR activity conditions. This suggests that certain RP mRNAs that interact with LARP1 under low mTOR activity conditions may form an inactive circular conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although visualization or/and stoichiometric analysis of the LARP1-RP mRNA complex will be necessary to elucidate this proposed inactive circular conformation, it is reasonable to speculate that retaining such a circular conformation with LARP1 may provide an efficient way to rapidly toggle between translationally on and off states.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Matherials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies were purchased from the following sources: Antibodies to mTOR (cat. # 2983, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2105622">AB_2105622</ext-link> for western blotting and immunostaining), Raptor (cat. # 2280, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_561245">AB_561245</ext-link>), pT389 S6K1 (cat. # 9206, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2285392">AB_2285392</ext-link>), S6K (cat. # 9202, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_823592">AB_823592</ext-link>), pS473 Akt (cat. # 9270, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_329824">AB_329824</ext-link>), Akt (cat # 9272, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_329827">AB_329827</ext-link>), phospho-Akt Substrate (RXXS/T) (cat. # 9614, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2225188">AB_2225188</ext-link>), pT37/46 4EBP1 (cat. # 2855, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_560835">AB_560835</ext-link>), 4EBP1 (cat. # 9644, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10691384">AB_10691384</ext-link>), S6 (cat. # 2217, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331355">AB_331355</ext-link>), pS235/236 S6 (cat. # 4856, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2181037">AB_2181037</ext-link> for western blotting), pS240/244 S6 (cat. # 5364, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10694233">AB_10694233</ext-link> for co-IP), RpL13a (cat. # 2765, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_916223">AB_916223</ext-link>), PABP1 (cat # 4992, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2156887">AB_2156887</ext-link>), mLST8 (cat. # 3274, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_823685">AB_823685</ext-link>), PRAS40 (cat. # 2610, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_916206">AB_916206</ext-link>), pULK1 (cat. # 6888, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10829226">AB_10829226</ext-link>), and ULK1 (cat. # 6439, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11178933">AB_11178933</ext-link>) from Cell Signaling Technology;

The role of LARP1 in the translation of TOP mRNAs has been a contentious issue, and the authors bring novel data suggesting a dual function for LARP1, which they describe as a phosphorylation-sensitive molecular switch for mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis. Previous reports have shown both positive and negative functions for LARP1 in TOP mRNA translation. Hong et al. suggest that LARP1 binds the 5'UTR of translation-related mRNAs to repress their translation during nutrient starvation. However, LARP1 phosphorylation by mTOR/S6K decreases this binding to promote 3'UTR binding and enhance translation. They show that LARP1 acts as an mTORC1 scaffold to facilitate mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1. Together, these data suggest that LARP1 functions as a molecular switch that senses mTORC1 activity and act as an effector.</p><p>This manuscript provides very insightful results that increase our understanding of the function of LARP1.</p><p>Some modifications and/or clarifications would be required prior to publication:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the manuscript is well done the main conclusion that LARP1 inhibits or facilitates translation depending on where it binds on the mRNA has not been fully demonstrated. The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are not compelling because different mRNAs containing different 5' or 3' sequences are being compared. Ideally the authors should design a luciferase reporter containing RpL32 5' and 3' UTRs and introduce mutations in the LARP1 binding sites rather than deleting the entire UTRs, so that the mRNAs have all the same length. Alternatively, the authors could test luciferase activity with the same reporter in cells depleted of LARP1 and then perform complementation assays with LARP1 mutants that can or cannot be phosphorylated. Related to this point: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, have the authors verified mRNA levels to ensure that what is being measured is not simply changes in mRNA stability?</p><p>2) The authors repeatedly state that LARP1 is a substrate for both S6K1 and Akt.

In fact, Rap or PP242 abolishes pS979-LARP1 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), which suggests that at least for S979 Akt is not involved in vivo. While Akt may be considered by the authors to potentially explain the behavior of the S6K1/2 double KO cells (Pende et al., 2004), it is not justified to include Akt in the conclusions of the current manuscript unless more direct evidence is provided, such as treatment of cells with an Akt inhibitor or RNAi.</p><p>3) It is not clear why the authors used Torin instead of rapamycin in the reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), and total mTOR instead of mTORC1 or mTORC2 for the kinase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Related to this point: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, have the authors verified mRNA levels to ensure that what is being measured is not simply changes in mRNA stability?</italic> </p><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestions, we examined the roles of LARP1 phosphorylation on its mRNA binding and in the regulation of mRNA translation using the wild type or mutant RpL32 mRNA reporters containing both 5’ and 3’ UTRs. Although our RIP assays using either the 5’ or 3’ UTR reporter of RpL32 mRNA showed dynamic changes in the affinity for LARP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, D</xref>, and E), under in vivo crosslinking conditions (PAR-CLIP), LARP1 constitutively and equally interacts with both the wild type 5’/3’ and the mutant 5’conv/3’ reporters regardless of cellular mTOR activity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> in the revised manuscript). These observations are consistent with the data in our transcriptome-wide PAR-CLIP analyses: LARP1 interacts with the 3’UTRs of RP mRNAs under both mTOR active and inactive conditions, while LARP1 also interacts with the 5’ UTRs, in addition to the 3’UTRs of these mRNAs, under mTOR inactive conditions. Furthermore, LARP1 constitutively associates with PABP1 in an RNAse A-sensitive manner regardless of cellular mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that LARP1 phosphorylation does not induce its complete dissociation from RpL32 mRNA. Rather, LARP1 phosphorylation (i.e., mTOR active condition) induces the dissociation of the 3’UTR-bound LARP1 from the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA.</p><p>To further address the critical point raised by the reviewer, we performed luciferase assays using the RpL32 reporter, which contains full length 5’/3’ or 5’conv/3’ UTRs in cells exclusively expressing the wild type or 4A LARP1 mutant. For this experiment, endogenous LARP1 was first ablated by shRNAs, and the shRNA-resistant Myc-LARP1<sub>resist</sub> or Myc-LARP1<sub>resist</sub> 4A mutant was co-transfected with the indicated reporters in HEK293T cells. Levels of luciferase activity were monitored under growth cell culture conditions. As performed in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> in the revised manuscript), the luciferase activity was also normalized by luciferase mRNA levels determined by qPCR.</p><p>The data demonstrated that phosphorylatable wild type Myc-LARP1<sub>resist</sub> has some advantages in stimulating translation of the 5’conv/3’ reporter compared to the wild type 5’/3’ reporter. In contrast, the phopho-defective Myc- LARP1<sub>resist</sub> 4A mutant significantly and equally inhibits the translation of both reporters, regardless of the existence (5’/3’) or absence (5’conv/3’) of the LARP1 binding site in the 5’UTR. These observations indicate that the dissociation of LARP1 from the PES motif in the 5’UTR and the phosphorylation of LARP1, which enhances both LARP1 binding to the 3’UTR and to mTORC1, are important processes in stimulating RpL32 mRNA translation. Note that the translation of the 5’conv/3’ mutant reporter was slightly, but significantly, enhanced compared to the 5’/3’ wild type reporter in cells expressing ectopic Myc-LARP1<sub>resist</sub>, which was not seen in the cells expressing just endogenous LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We speculate that overexpressed Myc-LARP1 may not be fully phosphorylated in our experimental conditions. As a consequence, non-phosphorylated wild type LARP1 may still bind to the PES in the 5’UTR and reduce the translation of the wild type 5’/3’ reporter. These new data have been included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors repeatedly state that LARP1 is a substrate for both S6K1 and Akt. However, Akt as a kinase for LARP1 is only shown by in vitro kinase assays and overexpression of a constitutively active Akt in cells – both are artifact-prone. In fact, Rap or PP242 abolishes pS979-LARP1 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), which suggests that at least for S979 Akt is not involved in vivo. While Akt may be considered by the authors to potentially explain the behavior of the S6K1/2 double KO cells (Pende et al., 2004), it is not justified to include Akt in the conclusions of the current manuscript unless more direct evidence is provided, such as treatment of cells with an Akt inhibitor or RNAi.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an important question. Our original data suggested that Akt and S6K1 may function redundantly to phosphorylate the S770/S979 sites of LARP1 that are required for its dissociation from the 5’UTR and subsequent tight association with the 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA. We showed that mTORC1 associates with the 3’UTR of RpL32 mRNA in a manner dependent on phosphorylated LARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>) and proposed that this configuration may play a key role in initiating mTORC1-dpendent 4EBP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation. Therefore, it is plausible that Akt is the responsible kinase initially phosphorylates S770/S979 of LARP1 and then S6K1 takes over that role in phosphorylating these residues to sustain the configuration that is important RpL32 mRNA translation.</p><p>To demonstrate that Akt is responsible for phosphorylating S770/S979 of LARP1 in a physiological in vivo context, we examined the phosphorylation status of LARP1 under acutely stimulated (growth factor/amino acid starvation for overnight/60 min, respectively, then stimulation with growth factor/amino acid for 10 min) or steady state growth conditions with or without the addition of a specific Akt inhibitor, MK-2206.</p><p>As shown in the left panel of the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> in the revised manuscript, upon growth factor/amino acid stimulation, the phosphorylation of both Akt and S6K1 (lane 3) was enhanced compared to those under starvation conditions (lane 2). Simultaneously, the phosphorylation of LARP1, as detected by both the Akt substrate antibody and the pS979 LARP1 antibody, was enhanced. Importantly, under this acutely stimulated condition, rapamycin, which completely inhibits S6K1, but not Akt, had little effect on S770/S979 phosphorylation of LARP1. In contrast, the Akt inhibitor MK-2206, as well as Torin1, which inhibit both Akt and S6K1, largely inhibited S770/S979 phosphorylation of LARP1.</p><p>Under the steady state growth condition (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> in the revised manuscript, right panel), inhibition of S6K1 with rapamycin or PF 4708671, a S6K inhibitor, equally and significantly decreased LARP1 phosphorylation (lane 3 and 6), and Torin1 and MK-2206 further blocked these phosphorylations (lane 4 and 5). Taken together, these observations indicate that Akt is indeed a physiologically relevant primary kinase for S770/S979 phosphorylation of LARP1 especially under acute stimulatory conditions. Under steady state conditions, S6K plays a major role while Akt also partially contributes to the phosphorylation of LARP1. These data are now included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and 2J</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear why the authors used Torin instead of rapamycin in the reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), and total mTOR instead of mTORC1 or mTORC2 for the kinase assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It seems obvious from early on that mTORC1, and not mTORC2, is responsible based on the sensitivity to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Also, the S6K1 inhibitor PF could have been included in the reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) to distinguish the role of mTORC1 and S6K1. There shouldn't be any technical hurdle. Perhaps the authors did perform those experiments and had a reason not to include the data?</italic> </p><p>In response to the reviewer’s question, we examined the effect of rapamycin or PF4708671 on the interaction between endogenous LARP1 and the 5’ or 3’ UTR of RpL32 mRNA reporter. As expected, rapamycin or Torin1 treatment produced the same effect on the interaction of LARP1 with the 5’ and 3’UTRs of RpL32 mRNA: rapamycin enhanced the affinity of LARP1 for the 5’UTR but suppressed LARP1’s binding to the 3’UTR under steady state growth conditions.</p><p>However, PF4708671, a specific S6K inhibitor, had little effect on LARP1’s binding to the 3’UTR, although PF4708671 did enhance LARP1’s binding to the 5’UTR, as does rapamycin, Torin1, and amino starvation. These data are consistent with the previous observations in our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, which showed that dephosphorylation of either S6K1 or mTOR sites of LARP1 is sufficient for LARP1 to interact with the 5’UTR of RpL32 mRNA. However, dephosphorylation of both S6K- and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation sites is required for LARP1 dissociation from the 3’UTR. These new data are now added in the revised manuscript as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref></p><p><italic>4) What is the proposed mechanism by which LARP1 phosphorylation decreases 5'UTR binding and increases mTORC1 and 3'UTR binding? Have the authors tested phospho-mimetic mutants? Related to this point: The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> showing LARP bridging the 5' and 3' UTRs of an mRNA is not supported by any experimental evidence. Do the authors have any evidence that LARP1 can bind simultaneously two mRNAs or that LARP1 dimerizes?</italic> </p><p>How LARP1 phosphorylation by Akt/S6K1 and mTOR triggers its dissociation from the 5’UTR but keeps the LARP1-mTORC1 complex on the 3’UTR of mRNA remains unclear. LARP1 possesses two RNA binding motifs (La and RRM-like). La protein (LARP3), which also contains La and two RRMs, has been shown to interact with 5’TOP mRNAs (Intine et al. Mol Cell 2003), suggesting that one or both of these RNA binding motifs may play a role in LARP1 association with the 5’TOP structure. However, recent structural studies demonstrated that the LARP1 DM15 motif, which is specific to LARP1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and is positioned adjacent to the Raptor binding and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation sites on LARP1, also interacts with the 5’ cap structure as well as the TOP sequence of RpS6 mRNA in vitro. Although future LARP1 structure/function studies – including the region important for mTORC1 binding and LARP1 phosphorylation sites – may shed additional mechanistic insights, the phosphorylation of LARP1 likely induces conformational changes that reduce LARP1’s affinity for the 5’UTR of LARP1- interacting 5’TOP mRNAs. Simultaneously, mTOR- dependent LARP1 phosphorylation may allow LARP1 to serve as a scaffold for mTORC1 on translationally- competent mRNAs. Such a mechanism would support mTORC1-dependent formation of the eIF4F initiation complex, where eIF4G outcompetes LARP1 for interacting with the 5’UTR, as recent studies have proposed (Lahr. et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2017, Fonseca et al. JBC 2015). Additional studies will obviously be required to understand the precise molecular mechanisms underlying phosphorylation-dependent alterations of LARP1-RP mRNA configuration.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s questions, we examined whether LARP1 dimerizes and found that HA-LARP1 interacts with MYC-LARP1 in vivoin a manner independent of LARP1’s RNA binding (lane 4) or cellular mTOR activity (lane 3), indicating that LARP1 indeed forms at least a homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25237.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>LARP1 forms at least a dimer.</title><p>HEK293T cells co-transfected with HA- and MYC-LARP1 were treated with Torin1 for 1 hour before harvest.

These observations suggest that the LARP1 that binds to the wild type 5’/3’ reporter can also bind the 3’ UTR of the 5’conv/3’UTR reporter, even under low mTOR activity conditions.</p><p>Taken together, we considered two models of LARP1 interaction with its substrate mRNA. First, in the “Bridging Model,” one LARP1 molecule of the homodimer binds the 5’ UTR, while the other LARP1 molecule of the homodimer binds the 3’UTR of a single RpL32 mRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>, top left panels). In this configuration, one LARP1 homodimer would bind <italic>both</italic> the 5’ and 3’ of one RpL32 mRNA and “bridge” these two ends of the mRNA. In our luciferase assay, both the 5’ and 3’ UTR of the reporter would be bound by LARP1 in low mTOR conditions. In the Bridging Model, we would predict that the ratio of luciferase mRNA bound to LARP1 homodimer to be 1-to-1. In the alternative, “non-Bridging Model,” LARP1 homodimer would bind <italic>either</italic> the 5’ or 3’ UTR of RpL32, such that a single RpL32 mRNA would be bound by one LARP1 homodimer at its 5’UTR and another homodimer at its 3’UTR. Here, we would predict that the ratio of luciferase mRNA and LARP1 to be 0.5-to-1, i.e. for every mRNA there would be two LARP1 homodimers bound.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25237.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>A Hypothetical model for LARP1-RpL32 configuration.</title><p>The data presented in this study support “One unit LARP1-one mRNA bridging” configuration under low mTOR activity conditions (left).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25237.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25237.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25237-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p>Our luciferase assays support the Bridging Model: we find that in cells treated with Torin1 as shown in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>), we always find the ratio of luciferase mRNA to LARP1 homodimer to be a 1-to-1 correlation.</p><p>As we discussed in our original manuscript, single-molecule visualization or/and more detailed stoichiometric analysis of LARP1 substrate binding will be necessary to fully test the Bridging Model. Nevertheless, our current biochemical data suggest a model where LARP1 is likely bridging the 5’UTR and 3’UTR of the same RpL32 mRNA.</p><p>Finally, in response to the reviewer’s question regarding the phospho-mimetic LARP1 mutant, we have substituted serine and threonine phosphorylation sites to aspartic and glutamic acids, respectively (LARP1 3D-E mutant). However, the phospho-mimetic mutant (3DE) behaved the same way as the phospho-defective mutant (4A): the LARP1 3DE mutant displayed reduced binding to mTORC1 much like the LARP1 4A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>). This is unfortunate but a common phenotype of phospho-defective and mimetic mutants as, in many reported cases, substitutions of S/T phosphorylation sites with aspartic or glutamic acid do not mimic the functions of phosphorylated residues.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25237.022</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Wild type but not phopho-defectitve or phospho-mimetic LARP1 interacts with mTOR in a rapamycin sensitive manner.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25237.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25237.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25237-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
