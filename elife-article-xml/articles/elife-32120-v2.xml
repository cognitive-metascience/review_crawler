This system may have evolved together with high heart rates to support their endothermic state (warm-bloodedness) and is seemingly lacking in ectothermic vertebrates from which first mammals then birds independently evolved. Here, we studied the conduction system in crocodiles (<italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic>), the only ectothermic vertebrates with a full ventricular septum. We identified homologues of mammalian conduction system markers (<italic>Tbx3-Tbx5, Scn5a, Gja5, Nppa-Nppb</italic>) and show the presence of a functional atrioventricular bundle. The ventricular Purkinje network, however, was absent and slow ventricular conduction relied on trabecular myocardium, as it does in other ectothermic vertebrates. We propose the evolution of the atrioventricular bundle followed full ventricular septum formation prior to the development of high heart rates and endothermy. In contrast, the evolution of the ventricular Purkinje network is strongly associated with high heart rates and endothermy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32120.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammals and birds are referred to as ‘warm-blooded’ animals, because they maintain a constant high body temperature. This requires a lot of energy, so their bodies need to be well supplied with blood at all times. The hearts of mammals and birds contain two important structures that help them do this. The first is a full wall of muscle – called the ventricular septum – that divides the heart into left and right sides. The second is an electrical circuit made of specialized muscle cells that ensures that the heart beats fast enough by sending rapid electrical signals to the rest of the heart muscle. The circuit contains one group of cells in the ventricular septum, called the bundle of His, and another group termed the Purkinje network.</p><p>Reptiles, however, do not maintain high body temperatures and are instead often thought of as ‘cold-blooded’ animals. The hearts of reptiles do not need to pump blood around the body as quickly and have different structures from warm-blooded animals. For example, most reptile hearts do not have a fully developed ventricular septum. The only exceptions are crocodiles, alligators and their relatives (the ‘crocodilians’), which do.</p><p>Jensen, Boukens et al. therefore wanted to determine if a crocodilian heart also contained a specialized electrical circuit like those of birds and mammals. Previous studies that attempted to answer this question using only anatomical and electrical methods had yielded ambiguous results. As such, Jensen, Boukens et al. combined these methods with genetic techniques for a more detailed study.</p><p>First, the ventricular septum of American alligators, a species of crocodilian, was examined, and found to contain a narrow tissue structure that strongly resembled the bundle of His. Indeed, if this presumptive bundle of His was cut, the electrical circuit was broken. Additional genetic analysis of this structure confirmed that genes similar to those active in the mammalian bundle of His were also switched on in alligators. However, recordings of heart activity showed that heart rates and the spread of electrical signals were both slower in alligators than in warm-blooded animals. This suggests that, although alligators have evolved some specialized muscle cells (in the form of a bundle of His), their electrical circuit is still ‘incomplete’. The lack of a Purkinje network, for example, would explain why their heart rates remain slow like other reptiles’.</p><p>Together these findings add to the current understanding of how the heart works in different animals with varying requirements for energy and blood flow. Also, since crocodiles and warm-blooded birds both evolved from ancient reptiles, detailed descriptions of their heart structures could shed more light on how warm-bloodedness first developed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>American alligator</kwd><kwd>conduction system</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>Ventricular septum</kwd><kwd>Tbx3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Bjarke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christoffels</surname><given-names>Vincent M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CVON HUSTCARE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christoffels</surname><given-names>Vincent M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002996</institution-id><institution>Hartstichting</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COBRA3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christoffels</surname><given-names>Vincent M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002996</institution-id><institution>Hartstichting</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016T047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boukens</surname><given-names>Bastiaan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002996</institution-id><institution>Hartstichting</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONCOR-genes, CVON2014-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Postma</surname><given-names>Alex V</given-names></name><name><surname>Christoffels</surname><given-names>Vincent M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-02972S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sedmera</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A specialized conduction pathway for the electrical impulse in the heart, previously thought to be associated with the endothermic mammals and birds only, is also present in the ectothermic crocodiles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The muscle of the vertebrate heart initiates and conducts the electrical impulse that initiates contraction. It has regionally distinctive properties, such as conduction velocity, underlying coordinated alternating contraction of atrium and ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gillers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keith and Flack, 1907</xref>). In addition, hearts of mammals and birds have specialized atrioventricular conduction system tissues composed of distinctive cardiomyocytes (e.g. glycogen-rich, less developed contractile apparatus, highly conductive) that can be morphologically distinguished from the working myocardium. These components, the atrioventricular bundle, bundle branches and Purkinje fiber network, rapidly conduct and distribute the impulse to the ventricular muscle, coordinating cardiac contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiodi and Bortolami, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Weerd and Christoffels, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rentschler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miquerol et al., 2010</xref>). They enable the high heart rates that set mammals and birds apart from similarly sized ectothermic vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies and Francis, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lillywhite et al., 1999</xref>). The anatomical and electrophysiological analyses that unequivocally demonstrated the specialized atrioventricular conduction system in mammals and birds, yielded, in contrast, highly divergent interpretations when applied to ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiodi and Bortolami, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, the most prevalent view appears to be that the vertebrate taxa that independently gave rise to mammals and birds, represented by extant amphibians and reptiles, are without a specialized cardiac conduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burggren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The atrioventricular bundle and its branches in both mammals and birds are located in the ventricular septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1952</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that the presence of a ventricular septum, rather than high heart rates, resulted in the development of a specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway. Among ectotherms, only crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials) have a full ventricular septum and the electrical activation of the ventricle of the freshwater crocodile has been reported to propagate differently from that of other reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christian and Grigg, 1999</xref>). Early anatomical works suggested that atrioventricular canal myocardium of the American alligator projects onto the ventricular septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greil, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swett, 1923</xref>), but there was no mention of bundle branches and the later investigators that unequivocally show the specialized conduction system in mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies and Francis, 1946</xref>), could not find specialized tissues in crocodilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 1951</xref>). Here, we investigated the ventricles of the American alligator for the presence of atrioventricular conduction system components to address the question of their origin. To identify any specialized components in the alligator heart, we analyzed the expression of conserved gene markers for the mammalian and chicken atrioventricular bundle and its branches (<italic>Tbx3</italic>, <italic>Tbx5</italic>, <italic>Scn5a</italic>, <italic>Cntn2</italic>), and for the Purkinje network and its trabecular precursor (<italic>Gja5</italic>, <italic>Cntn2</italic>, <italic>Nppa</italic> and <italic>Nppb</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park and Fishman, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we assessed impulse conduction patterns to investigate its origin and spread in the ventricles. Because previous anatomical investigations led to contradictory interpretations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we use complementary functional and molecular criteria to define 'specialization'. We conclude that the alligator has a functional atrioventricular bundle but lacks a specialized Purkinje network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Atrioventricular conduction pathway in alligator hearts</title><p>To investigate the possible presence of a specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway in the crocodilian heart, we made an incision in the dorsal ventricular myocardium near the crux. The crux is the intersection of the atrioventricular sulcus and the dorsal descending coronary artery, and it indicates the position of the atrioventricular node and atrioventricular bundle in the mammalian heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crick et al., 1998</xref>). The dorsal incision disrupted only 10–20% of the atrioventricular junctional myocardium, yet resulted in complete atrioventricular block in three out of three hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In three other hearts, extensive ventral and lateral incisions did not result in atrioventricular block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Optical mapping of isolated hearts showed the impulse appearing at the dorsal epicardial surface at the midpoint of the ventricle along the interventricular sulcus, consistent with an origin of the impulse from the atrioventricular bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). On the ventral side of the heart, the activation wave propagated from the ventricular apex toward the major arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>). These activation patterns resemble those of mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rentschler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reckova et al., 2003</xref>), but differ from those of the <italic>Anolis</italic> lizard, where epicardial activation starts in the ventricular base region closest to the atria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>]). Measurements in an opened ventricle revealed the occurrence of first activation near the crest of the septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>).

Our results reveal the presence of a specialized conduction pathway connecting the atria with the ventricular septum, that is, an atrioventricular bundle, that is functionally and genetically comparable to that of mammals and birds. We found no indications of the presence of bundle branches. The ventricular conduction system component and the associated genetic wiring of alligators is similar to that of other ectothermic vertebrates, but unlike the Purkinje system in mammals and birds.</p><p>Longstanding as well as recent literature has shown that in hearts of ectotherms a non-insulated muscular atrioventricular junction delays and propagates the impulse from the atria to the ventricular base in the absence of anatomically specialized conduction system parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AlanisAlanís et al., 1973</xref>). This resembles the situation in the embryonic heart of both mammals and birds. While some reports have claimed to have observed specialized atrioventricular bundles components in non-crocodilian reptiles on the basis of anatomy, the large majority of studies do not support these claims (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The presence of an atrioventricular bundle in an ectotherm, as our data indicates, is incompatible with our current understanding of the evolution of the conduction system.</p><p>Based on the comprehensive anatomical studies in the first half of the 20th century, it has been concluded that specialized atrioventricular conduction systems are an adaptation to high heart rates and are therefore only found in the endothermic mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiodi and Bortolami, 1967</xref>). As mammals and birds evolved independently from ectothermic ancestors, the simplest yet perhaps unsatisfying conclusion is that their highly similar conduction systems evolved independently as well in relation to endothermy. However, crocodilians are ectotherms and have much lower heart rates than mammals and birds of comparable size and, unique among ectotherms, have a full ventricular septum, which in mammals and birds is the structural substrate of the atrioventricular bundle and branches. Our study shows the presence of a specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway within the broad myocardial connection between the atria and ventricles, its position corresponding to the mammalian and avian atrioventricular bundle. In contrast to the settings of mammals and birds, the crocodilian atrioventricular bundle is not fully insulated by connective tissues. Nevertheless, specific cuts through the <italic>Tbx3-</italic>positive bundle caused atrioventricular block, implicating the <italic>Tbx3</italic>-negative myocardial continuity between the atria and ventricles was not sufficient to maintain atrioventricular conduction. Thus, although not being fully insulated, the <italic>Tbx3-</italic>positive myocardial connection acts as an atrioventricular bundle, as it does in mammals and birds.</p><p>Century-old anatomical studies on alligators already described dorsal atrioventricular myocardium extending onto the ventricular septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greil, 1903</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in a manner that much resembles the domain of <italic>Tbx3</italic>-expressing myocardium described here. Much later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christian and Grigg (1999</xref>) used plunge electrodes to show in the freshwater crocodile that ventricular activation initiates in the top of the septum and propagates from there in a manner that we have also recorded in the American alligator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The presence of a specialized atrioventricular conduction axis, the main finding of this manuscript, was not investigated in that study. Building on the previous findings, our results suggest that the evolution of the atrioventricular bundle predates that of endothermy and instead correlates with the formation of a full ventricular septum. It would be interesting to investigate whether other reptiles with partial ventricular septums, such as varanids, show signs of a <italic>Tbx3</italic>-positive atrioventricular bundle as well.</p><p>In mammals and birds, the atrioventricular bundle ramifies into bundle branches which express <italic>Tbx3</italic> and drape the left and right surface of the ventricular septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogaars et al., 2004</xref>).

One anatomical study claimed the presence of bundle branches in crocodilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathur, 1971</xref>), but the most prevalent view is that the crocodilian heart is without a histologically distinct atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christian and Grigg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greil, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swett, 1923</xref>).</p><p>The question remains to what extent the trabecular myocardium of the alligator can be equated to the mammalian and bird Purkinje network. In mammals, the embryonic trabecular myocardium gives rise to the Purkinje network that can be identified by the expression of key genetic markers <italic>Cntn2, Nppa</italic> and <italic>Gja5</italic> (Cx40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Weerd and Christoffels, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miquerol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pallante et al., 2010</xref>). In the alligator, <italic>Cntn2</italic> is absent, <italic>Nppa</italic> is scattered rather than confined to the myocardium around the central lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen et al., 2017b</xref>), and <italic>Gja5</italic> (Cx40) is expressed in the trabeculated and compact myocardium rather than confined to a miniscule subset of the ventricular myocytes. Therefore, the trabecular myocardium of the alligator is unlike the Purkinje system, but resembles that of other ectotherms. The activation of the ventricles of ectotherms relies on relatively slow conduction in trabecular myocardium instead of fast conduction through the atrioventricular bundle branches and Purkinje system as seen in mammals and birds. Indeed, the QRS duration, a functional measure for Purkinje system, was substantially longer in alligators than in comparatively sized mammals, even when heated to mammalian body temperatures. In other crocodilians, the QRS duration is also approximately 100 ms suggesting that the speed of ventricular activation is similar across crocodilians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christian and Grigg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heaton-Jones and King, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Syme et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 1991</xref>). It further suggests that the specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway does not have an appreciable effect on ventricular activation time. Taken together, we conclude that the mammalian and avian ventricular Purkinje network evolved from the ancient trabeculated ventricle still present today in ectotherms, including crocodiles. This is in line with the unexpected finding that the cardiac natriuretic peptide locus, which specifically marks the trabecular layer, has remained unchanged during alligator evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, this locus has changed independently after the branching of birds within the archosaur group (to which also crocodilians belong), which lost <italic>Nppa</italic>, and of mammals, which lost <italic>CNP-I</italic> and other genes.</p><p>We interpret the biphasic upstroke in the alligator heart as resulting from early trabecular activation and late activation of the compact myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reconstructed activation maps show that the recorded biphasic upstrokes are not the result of two subepicardial activation waves propagating next to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Efimov et al., 1999</xref>). Instead, each part of the upstroke belongs to a distinct activation wave from which separate activation maps can be reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, a large fraction of the excited and emitted light can traverse more than 1 mm of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walton and Bernus, 2015</xref>), which exceeds the thickness of the compact myocardium in the alligator hearts (290–860 µm). Of six hearts tested, only the two largest animals showed fractionated upstrokes, possibly because the smaller animals had a less thick compact wall, which did not provide sufficient emission light to overcome the noise. Thus, we conclude that in crocodiles first the atrioventricular bundle and trabecular myocardium activates, and subsequently the compacted myocardium, a sequence resembling that of mammalian and bird hearts where the atrioventricular bundle, its branches, and Purkinje network activate prior to the bulk of the compact wall. We speculate that the slowly conducting trabecular ventricle with a thin compact layer of fish and amphibians and the fast-conducting small Purkinje system with thick compact walls of mammals and birds represent two extreme situations of a spectrum. The alligator would be in-between those extremes. Investigation of the presence of bi-phasic upstrokes in other ectotherms with significant compact walls, such as some species of fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Icardo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell and Smith, 2017</xref>), may provide indications for such a spectrum. This would imply that precursor components of the Purkinje system were present before the evolution of endothermy and could stem from the earliest trabeculated ventricles as seen in jawless fish.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show the presence of a molecularly distinctive functional atrioventricular conduction system in the alligator heart. The presence of such a system in the crocodilian heart challenges our understanding of cardiac evolution. It suggests the development of the specialized atrioventricular conduction system predates the development of endothermy and correlates instead with the formation of a full ventricular septum. From this insight, one may be able to predict a relation between the degree of development of the ventricular septum and the presence of the atrioventricular bundle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The investigation conforms with the guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 8523, revised 1996) and was approved by the Institutional Animal Studies Care and Use Committee of the University of North Texas (IACUC #1403–04).

On the day of study four alligators (mass = 2.7 ± 1.0 kg) were lightly anaesthetized by placing them in a sealed container with gauze soaked in isoflurane (Isoflo; Abbott laboratories, North Chicago, IL). The animal's trachea was then intubated and the lungs artificially ventilated using a ventilator (Model 552; Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA) downstream of a vaporizer (Ohmed Fluotec 4 Anesthetic Vaporizer; GE Healthcare; Buckinghamshire, UK) providing 2% isoflurane at 5–10 breaths min<sup>−1</sup>. A modified air pump was used to continuously pull room air through the vaporizer. Once a surgical plane of anesthesia was achieved the animal was placed ventral side up on a heat pad (Homeothermic Blanket Control Unit, Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA). In addition, a lamp with a 40-watt bulb was placed above the animal at approximately the midpoint of the thoracic cavity. Three 12 mm surgical steel needle electrodes (29 gauge) were inserted subcutaneously in the animal. Two electrodes were place approximately 2 cm below the posterior end of the sternum one on left and right lateral side of the body wall. A third electrode was placed posteriorly at the intersection of the right rear limb and the body wall. Each electrode was connected to an amplifier (Animal Bio Amp, Adinstruments Colorado Springs, CO) connected to a PowerLab data recording system (4 ST Adinstruments Colorado Springs, CO, USA) connected to a Macintosh computer running Chart software (Chart 8 Adinstruments Colorado Springs, CO). Data was collected as a sampling rate of 1000 Hz with a low pass (1 Hz) and a high-pass (50 Hz) filter setting. Once electrodes were in place a thermocouple was advanced approximately 3 cm into the cloaca and connected to a temperature meter (BAT-12, Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ). Output for the temperature meter was connected to the PowerLab data recording system. Once the instrumentation was completed the thermal blanket and lamp were turned on. Animal core body temperature was then increased gradually from ~21.5°C to 36.0°C. At the completion of the study animals were euthanized with an intravenous injection of pentobarbital (350 mg/kg).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optical and electrical recordings <italic>ex vivo</italic></title><p>For the <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments, we used seven juvenile alligators (±1.3 kg).

Subsequently the hearts were excised through a ventral incision. The excised hearts were placed in a bath of a custom-made Ringer solution at room temperature (22° Celcius) and perfused through PE90 catheters inserted in the ventral wall of the left and right atria (Ringer, in mmol/l: NaCl 120, Tris 5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1, KCl 2.5, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.5, Glucose 5, pH adjusted to 7.5 with HCl).

After loading, the excitation-contraction uncoupler blebbistatin (10–100 µM, Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) was added to the perfusate but failed to remove motion artifacts. Excitation light was delivered by a 520 ± 5 nm light emitting diode (Prizmatix, Southfield, MI) and emitted fluorescence was filtered &gt;610 nm and recorded by a CMOS-sensor, (100 × 100 elements, 1 kHz, MICAM Ultima, SciMedia Ltd, Costa Mesa CA). One heart ceased spontaneous beating and was excluded from further experiments. After the first measurement, 5 out of the remaining six hearts were loaded for a second time by perfusion of 10–20 µM di-4-ANEPPS to load the trabeculations of the ventricular lumen. Local electrograms were recorded from the epicardium of the ventral and dorsal side using a Franz electrode. In the bath, a ECG was recorded between two electrodes placed at the 2.5 cm from the left and right side of the heart. In three hearts, we stimulated on the apex (dorsal) at 0.5 Hz.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Tobias Wang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Jensen at el. examine atrioventricular conduction in the hearts of crocodiles, a rare example of an ectothermic vertebrate species that contains a complete ventricular septum. Using an appropriate (and impressive) array of experimental techniques, the authors demonstrate that the crocodilian heart has a specialized atrioventricular bundle that provides for electrical signals to be conducted from the atria to ventricle in a timely fashion, insuring the necessary delay required for blood to be transmitted between these chambers. Through histology and gene expression analysis, the authors establish that the AV bundle is found immediately above the ventricular septum, and its location is verified by ablation studies that show complete inhibition of electrical propagation upon mechanical lesion of the relevant area. Thus, the authors conclude that an AV conduction apparatus, similar to the His-bundle of mammals, exists within the crocodile heart. Since crocodiles display a slow heart rate, this argues that the atrioventricular bundle did not evolve in response to the high heart rates that attended the evolution of endothermy amongst the closely related birds (although this has been the dominant view for the past decade). This is an important conclusion with a significant impact on our view of the evolution of the cardiac conduction system in vertebrates. However, several points remain to be addressed in order to support the authors' conclusions more fully.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In mammals, the AV bundle is a specialized myocardial bridge that is electronically insulated and connects the AV node to the ventricular Purkinje system. The authors have concluded that the TBX3-positive myocardium running through the ventricular septum of the crocodile denotes a specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway. However, a similar TBX3-positive region is noted in the dwarf caiman which seems to lack a defined atrioventricular conduction pathway. The authors also note that no insulation is present around the crocodile AV-conducting pathway, which should allow for direct electrical communication with any adjacent myocardial population. This leads to two major concerns that the authors should address. First, could the authors more clearly articulate the criteria with which they would define a specialized AV bundle? Is it simply the myocardial continuity present between atria and ventricle, or does it need to have specialized conduction characteristics? Second, it is difficult to resolve whether the key evolutionary feature for AV conduction in the crocodile heart is that it has a ventricular septum which serves as the substrate for AV conduction, or that it contains components similar to an annulus fibrosus that can prevent broader AV conduction and restrict the region of AV myocardium capable of transmitting an impulse from atrium to ventricle. Could the authors clarify their thoughts on this issue? Also, could the authors provide data supporting their statement in the discussion that the crocodilian atrioventricular bundle is not insulated? Can the authors shed light on how the crocodilian heart avoids an inadvertent spread of the atrial depolarization outside the bundle?</p><p>2) In mammals, the atrioventricular bundle and Purkinje fiber network are connected by right and left bundle branches. It is unclear in this study whether these latter structures would have evolved with the atrioventricular bundle or with the Purkinje fiber network. This topic should be investigated and incorporated into the manuscript. Is there any histological evidence in favor of structures like bundle branches being present in the crocodile? How do the authors envisage that the activation wave is propagated to the ventral ventricular apex? How would the authors compare the scenario in the crocodile to the fast conducting network seen in the zebrafish ventricle, which seems to include base-to-apex propagation? What do the authors see as the functional benefit of the AV bundle in a heart with low frequencies of contraction?</p><p>3) On a somewhat related topic, could the authors include data from additional species to reinforce their broad evolutionary conclusions based on analysis of (albeit difficult to obtain) crocodile and caiman material? Discussion of data from the literature would be fine in this regard, if these direct comparisons can strengthen the evolutionary conclusion.</p><p>4) The authors use the biphasic nature of the electrogram upstroke as a demonstration of potential multilayer conduction. It is important to include the details of this analysis. What were the parameters used to separate the components of the upstroke? Can the derivative of these upstrokes be separated to demonstrate the actual temporal difference between inner and outer activation? How does this vary between where the surface myocardium overlays the septum vs where it overlays the trabeculae? Are similar biphasic electrograms present in other adult organisms lacking septum (fish, frog, lizards)? In addition, it would be helpful for the authors to indicate from which regions the provided upstroke recordings were taken.</p><p>5) The authors conclude that the epicardial breakthrough in the crocodile heart is towards the apex of the heart, which would be indicative of a conduction pathway through the ventricular septum/trabeculae. However, the data provided in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 seems to indicate epicardial breakthrough first occurs closer to the atria. Could the authors clarify this point?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Specialized impulse conduction pathway in the alligator heart&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, Deborah Yelon as the Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>All three reviewers were pleased with the revisions made to your manuscript, and two out of the three reviewers were completely satisfied with the revised version.

This study makes an interesting evolutionary point about the separate origin of distinct components of the ventricular conduction system relevant to its modular development in mammals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have revised the manuscript in accordance with the comments/suggestions provided in the previous round of review. I have no additional comments or queries.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The resubmitted manuscript by Jensen et al. revises a previous text in which the presence of a specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway is claimed to exist in the alligator heart. It was noted in the previous draft that the authors had generated an interesting panel of data, indicating the presence of conduction pathway along the crest of the ventricular septum, however, several concerns were raised. The authors have provided some additional information and modified the text in response to these concerns. In general, the newly incorporated data and text clarify some of issues raised by the reviewers, resulting in an improvement to the study. A few points still remain confusing.</p><p>1) Based on the initial manuscript, the impression given was that <italic>Alligator mississippiensis</italic> was selected for the study as &quot;the only ectothermic vertebrates with a full ventricular septum.&quot; The response provided by the reviewers to point &quot;1&quot; seems to indicate that the dwarf caiman might also process a specialized AV pathway (in the absence of a septum). Is this a misreading of the response, or are the authors saying that a ventricular septum is in fact not required for and AV bundle? The authors have also now noted that the QRS for the American alligator is largely the same as QRS times recorded in ectotherms species that presumably lack a full septum (response to concern 3). This is again confusing; does this indicate that the AV bundle reported in this manuscript has little function consequence on ventricular conduction? If so, this should be emphasized in the text.</p><p>2) Regarding whether the myocardial bridge across the AV meets the criteria of a specialized conduction system: in fairness to previous work, the authors should state that they have used different criteria then historical work on this topic. The authors have defined &quot;specialized&quot; to mean the expression of TBX3 and the point of ventricular activation. As these are not the lineage criteria designated by earlier anatomists, this new definition should be clearly stated.</p><p>3) Given the lack of insulation, the lack of bundle branches, and how slow internal conduction in Figure 1I is, the mechanisms by which impulses would preferentially propagate down the septum and secondarily activate the compact layer remains difficult to understand.</p><p>4) Sample numbers and statistics related to physiological data remain a concern.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32120.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In mammals, the AV bundle is a specialized myocardial bridge that is electronically insulated and connects the AV node to the ventricular Purkinje system.

The lack of consensus reflects the very heterogeneous quality of the previous studies and different definitions of “specialization” (see also de Haan, Circulation, 1961). To claim specialization, anatomists placed much emphasis on how pale (glycogen rich, fewer sarcomeres) cells are, that is how Purkinje cell-like they are, whether the tissue could be discriminated from the surrounding muscle mass by insulating connective tissue, etc., whereas many electrophysiologists placed emphasis on function, for instance whether there is an atrioventricular delay under the influence of nervous activity. Currently, “specialization” is much informed by molecular data. The criteria for specialization used in this study is twofold:1) Specific location of preferential conduction as indicated by incisions and 2) the presence of <italic>Tbx3</italic>, a highly conserved transcription factor that is the main marker of the developing and mature AV bundle in mammals and birds (Hoogaars, Cardiovasc Res. 2004; Bakker, Circulation Research 2008). To address this matter we have added the following to the Introduction section:</p><p>“[…]specialized atrioventricular conduction system tissues composed of distinctive cardiomyocytes (e.g. glycogen rich, less developed contractile apparatus, highly conductive) that can be morphologically distinguished from the working myocardium.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it is difficult to resolve whether the key evolutionary feature for AV conduction in the crocodile heart is that it has a ventricular septum which serves as the substrate for AV conduction, or that it contains components similar to an annulus fibrosus that can prevent broader AV conduction and restrict the region of AV myocardium capable of transmitting an impulse from atrium to ventricle. Could the authors clarify their thoughts on this issue? Also, could the authors provide data supporting their statement in the discussion that the crocodilian atrioventricular bundle is not insulated? Can the authors shed light on how the crocodilian heart avoids an inadvertent spread of the atrial depolarization outside the bundle?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional histological analyses of insulating tissue (collagen by picro-sirius red) combined with detection of <italic>Tbx3</italic> on neighboring sections, and added a new figure (Figure 3). This shows connective tissue ventral and dorsal to the AV-conducting pathway identify by the expression of <italic>Tbx3</italic>. However, on the left and right of the dorsal <italic>Tbx3</italic> defined pathway, there is myocardial continuity between the atria and ventricles that does not express Tbx3. Therefore, the AV-conducting pathway is not fully insulated as it is in mammals and birds.</p><p>It is unclear whether inadvertent spread of the atrial depolarization outside the bundle occurs. However, specific cuts through the <italic>Tbx3</italic> positive bundle caused AV block, implicating that possible conduction through the <italic>Tbx3</italic> negative myocardial continuity was not sufficient to maintain AV conduction. The latter indicates that, although not being fully insulated, the <italic>Tbx3</italic> positive myocardial connection acts as an AV bundle. We have added the following text to the manuscript:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Dorsally, the atrioventricular canal myocardium was nestled between collagen of the atrioventricular valves and the atrioventricular sulcus (Figure 3). The Tbx3 identified atrioventricular bundle extended from this sheet of atrioventricular canal myocardium (Figure 3). Laterally, the Tbx3 identified atrioventricular bundle was not insulated by connective tissue in contrast to the setting in mammals and birds.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Nevertheless, specific cuts through the Tbx3 positive bundle caused atrioventricular block, implicating the Tbx3-negative myocardial continuity between the atria and ventricles was not sufficient to maintain atrioventricular conduction. Thus, although not being fully insulated, the Tbx3 positive myocardial connection acts as an atrioventricular bundle, as it does in mammals and birds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In mammals, the atrioventricular bundle and Purkinje fiber network are connected by right and left bundle branches. It is unclear in this study whether these latter structures would have evolved with the atrioventricular bundle or with the Purkinje fiber network. This topic should be investigated and incorporated into the manuscript. Is there any histological evidence in favor of structures like bundle branches being present in the crocodile?</p></disp-quote><p>The proximal parts of the mammalian and bird bundle branches specifically express Tbx3 and other markers. We never found similar branches in the crocodilians, neither with histology nor <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for <italic>Tbx3, Tbx5, Gja5</italic>, and <italic>Scn5a</italic>. We now make this point explicitly in Results and Discussion.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“In mammals and birds, the atrioventricular bundle and Purkinje network are connected by the Tbx3-expressing bundle branches on the left and right flanks of the ventricular septum. We never observed similar branches in the crocodilians, neither with histology nor in situ hybridization for Tbx3, Tbx5, Gja5, and Scn5a.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In mammals and birds, the atrioventricular bundle ramifies into bundle branches which express Tbx3 and drape the left and right surface of the ventricular septum (Hoogaars et al., 2004). […] One anatomical study claimed the presence of bundle branches in crocodilians (40), but the most prevalent view is that the crocodilian heart is without a histologically distinct atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches (Davies, Francis and King, 1952; Christian and Grigg, 1999; Greil, 1903; Swett, 1923).”</p><p>At least on this point there appears to be agreement in literature. (Concerning histological evidence, as reported in literature, Christian and Grigg (1999) identified two “channels” of preferential conduction by plunge electrodes within the crocodilian ventricular septum, but could not identify these with histology. Greil (1903) and Swett (1923) observed that atrioventricular canal-like myocardium projected onto the ventricular septum in the American alligator. However, they did not find bundle branches. Davies et al. (1952) did not find any evidence for specialized tissues in the American alligator. Importantly, Davies et al. are the same investigators who provided major contributions to the description of the specialized conduction system of mammals and birds. Only, Mathur (1971), who studied two species of crocodile, claimed to have found an atrioventricular node and atrioventricular bundle – and further claimed these to be homologous to those of mammals and birds – but he did not claim to have found any bundle branches).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do the authors envisage that the activation wave is propagated to the ventral ventricular apex?</p></disp-quote><p>We envision early propagation predominantly, if not exclusively, within the septum and the trabeculated myocardium. The earliest activation of the compact myocardium is dorsal and where the septum fuses with the compact wall. On the ventral side, the compact myocardium is activated later, via the apex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How would the authors compare the scenario in the crocodile to the fast conducting network seen in the zebrafish ventricle, which seems to include base-to-apex propagation?</p></disp-quote><p>The ventricular muscle of all vertebrates propagates the electrical impulse much faster than the atrioventricular junctional muscle, but our heating experiment, shown in Figure 6, shows that the alligator ventricle has a larger activation time (QRS duration) than the ventricles of mammals of comparable size. This strongly suggests that impulse propagation in the alligator is slower than in mammals. We do not know of similar heating experiments in zebrafish, but we would expect them to show a longer QRS duration than would be expected for a similarly sized mammal (obviously, adult zebrafish are much smaller than the smallest mammals so this is theoretical only). In fish of approximately 1kg, the QRS interval is as long as in alligators (trout, Comp Biochem Physiol A 145 (2006): 158–165; pike, Comp Biochem Physiol A 159 (2011) 39–45) or longer (African lungfish, Am J Physiol-Heart Circ Physiol 232 (1977): H24-H34). Alligators nonetheless show elements of the apex-to-base activation that characterizes mammals and birds. This unusual pattern of activation, for an ectotherm, is presumably explained to a large extent by the presence of the specialized Tbx3-positive pathway. Zebrafish appear without a comparable manner of activation, although the exact manner of activation of the zebrafish ventricle is a point of contention; please see the discussion in Jensen et al. 2012.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What do the authors see as the functional benefit of the AV bundle in a heart with low frequencies of contraction?</p></disp-quote><p>A particular structure does not necessarily have to have a functional benefit in itself, if its presence is related to a trait that has been selected for (Gould and Lewontin, 1979, Proc Roy Soc London B). We currently do not see an advantage to the AV bundle in the crocodilians, nor do we rule out an advantage, but for the time being, we are content with the notion that the AV bundle may simply relate to the presence of a full ventricular septum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) On a somewhat related topic, could the authors include data from additional species to reinforce their broad evolutionary conclusions based on analysis of (albeit difficult to obtain) crocodile and caiman material? Discussion of data from the literature would be fine in this regard, if these direct comparisons can strengthen the evolutionary conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Electrocardiograms have been recorded in a number of crocodilian species and the QRS duration of the electrocardiogram is indicative of whether there is a mammal-like specialized ventricular conduction system (this manuscript, Figure 6). The QRS durations we recorded from American alligators, approximately 100 ms, were of similar magnitude to reported previously for the American alligator (Heaton-Jones and King, 1994; Syme et al. 2002), the Chinese alligator (Wang et al., 1991), the saltwater crocodile (Christian &amp; Grigg, 1999), and the Nile crocodile (Davies et al., 1951). As requested by the reviewer, we have discussed data from literature to strengthen the evolutionary conclusion. We comment on this in the Discussion section:</p><p>“In other crocodilians, the QRS duration is also approximately 100 ms suggesting that the speed of ventricular activation is similar across crocodilians (Christian and Grigg, 1952; Davies, Francis and King, 1951; Heaton-Jones and King, 1994; Syme, Gamperl and Jones, 2002; Wang et al., 1991).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use the biphasic nature of the electrogram upstroke as a demonstration of potential multilayer conduction. It is important to include the details of this analysis. What were the parameters used to separate the components of the upstroke? Can the derivative of these upstrokes be separated to demonstrate the actual temporal difference between inner and outer activation? How does this vary between where the surface myocardium overlays the septum vs where it overlays the trabeculae? Are similar biphasic electrograms present in other adult organisms lacking septum (fish, frog, lizards)? In addition, it would be helpful for the authors to indicate from which regions the provided upstroke recordings were taken.</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether biphasic upstrokes could be separated from upstrokes with one phase we first performed a principle component analysis. This is shown in the newly added Figure 7 of the revised manuscript. After that we separated the upstrokes with one phase from those with two phases based on the dV/dt. We have generated a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) showing multiple dV/dt max calculated from the signals with a biphasic upstroke. Distinct activation maps, based on the maximum positive derivative (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), could be generated from both the first and the second part of the fractionated upstrokes. The activation maps on the left of Figure 7—figure supplement 1 show the reconstructed activation patterns from the first part of the upstroke and the activation maps on the right of Figure 7—figure supplement 1 shows the reconstructed activation patterns from the second part of the upstroke. To explain this topic better we have added the following to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Optical mapping analysis indicated the presence of two functional layers. In 2 out of 6 animals, we observed action potentials with fractionated (biphasic) upstrokes, in which an initial steep deflection was followed by a lessening of the inclination only to be followed by a second steep deflection (Figure 7A-C, Figure 7—figure supplement 1). […] Together with the gene expression data, these data suggest the presence of two layers, a trabecular myocardial layer and a compact layer, which are activated in subsequent order.”</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32120.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Fractionated upstrokes measured from the epicardium.</title><p>The traces in A and B shows the optically recorded action potential (upper) and its the derivative (lower).

However, the data provided in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 seems to indicate epicardial breakthrough first occurs closer to the atria. Could the authors clarify this point?</p></disp-quote><p>The activation map shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 shows at the left the pattern based on the first part of the upstroke and at the right the pattern based on the second part of the upstroke. The earliest breakthrough is based on the first part of the upstroke and observed in the mid of the ventricle (Figure 7—figure supplement 1 right top). The first activation based on the second part of the upstroke is, as noted by the reviewer, at the base of the heart close to the atria (Figure 7—figure supplement 1D left top). This breakthrough, however, occurred later than at the mid of the ventricle. We have addressed this issue in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Distinct activation maps could be generated from both the first and the second part of the biphasic upstrokes showing first activation in the mid of the ventricle at the dorsal side.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Based on the initial manuscript, the impression given was that Alligator mississippiensis was selected for the study as &quot;the only ectothermic vertebrates with a full ventricular septum.&quot; The response provided by the reviewers to point &quot;1&quot; seems to indicate that the dwarf caiman might also process a specialized AV pathway (in the absence of a septum). Is this a misreading of the response, or are the authors saying that a ventricular septum is in fact not required for and AV bundle?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not made it sufficiently clear that the full septum is found in all crocodilians, which comprise 23 species of alligators, caimans (technically also alligators), crocodiles, and gharials. In the Introduction, we now write “Among ectotherms, only crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials) have a full ventricular septum…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have also now noted that the QRS for the American alligator is largely the same as QRS times recorded in ectotherms species that presumably lack a full septum (response to concern 3). This is again confusing; does this indicate that the AV bundle reported in this manuscript has little function consequence on ventricular conduction? If so, this should be emphasized in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The QRS duration is mainly defined by the conduction system components downstream of the AV bundle (in mammals, the Purkinje fibre network) in combination with the conduction velocity in the working myocardium. We have now added the following sentence to the sixth paragraph of the Discussion, where the QRS duration is discussed: “It further suggests that the specialized atrioventricular conduction pathway does not have an appreciable effect on ventricular activation time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding whether the myocardial bridge across the AV meets the criteria of a specialized conduction system: in fairness to previous work, the authors should state that they have used different criteria then historical work on this topic. The authors have defined &quot;specialized&quot; to mean the expression of TBX3 and the point of ventricular activation. As these are not the lineage criteria designated by earlier anatomists, this new definition should be clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the following sentence to the last paragraph of the Introduction: “Because previous anatomical investigations led to contradictory interpretations (Supplementary file 1), we use complementary functional and molecular criteria to define “specialization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the lack of insulation, the lack of bundle branches, and how slow internal conduction in Figure 1I is, the mechanisms by which impulses would preferentially propagate down the septum and secondarily activate the compact layer remains difficult to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>Insulation is not necessarily an effect of fibro-fatty tissues alone, but can also be brought about by so-called source-sink mismatches and poor coupling between cells (Kléber, A.G. and Rudy, Y., 2004. Physiological reviews, 84(2), pp.431-488.). The propagation of the impulse from the specialized atrioventricular pathway to the ventricular surface is the least investigated part of our study. It remains difficult for us to assess the relative contribution of insulating tissues, source-sink mismatches, and cellular coupling, and we are therefore reluctant to speculate on this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Sample numbers and statistics related to physiological data remain a concern.</p></disp-quote><p>The scale of our efforts reflects that American alligators are not readily available for experimentation. Nonetheless, the pattern of activation we report is fully consistent with the previous study of Christian and Grigg (1999) and the QRS durations we measured are similar to those reported previously (5 references cited in Discussion), strongly suggesting that our physiological data is sound.</p></body></sub-article></article>
