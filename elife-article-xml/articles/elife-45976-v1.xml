spatially to restore tissue homeostasis. Previously we reported that thermal damage of the larval zebrafish fin disrupts collagen organization and wound healing compared to tail transection (LeBert et al., 2018). Here we characterize different injury models in larval zebrafish to dissect temporal and spatial dynamics of repair in complex damage. We found that each damage model triggers distinct inflammatory and tissue responses, with Stat3 and TGFβ playing key roles in the regulation of mesenchymal cells during simple repair. While thermal injury disrupts collagen fibers initially, healing is recovered as inflammation resolves, and mesenchymal cells and collagen fibers align. By contrast, infected wounds lead to persistent inflammation and loss of mesenchymal cells, resulting in minimal tissue repair. These wound models have broad physiological relevance, thereby providing a valuable advance in our toolkit to probe the dynamics of inflammation and wound repair in complex tissue damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>thermal injury</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM1 18027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huttenlocher</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Thermal injury and infected wounds induce distinct inflammatory and remodeling mechanisms that alter the dynamics of wound repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wound repair requires the integration of complex cellular networks and extracellular matrix remodeling to mediate resolution of damage. Caudal fin transection or sterile needle wounding of larval zebrafish have become invaluable in vivo models of inflammation and wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">LeBert and Huttenlocher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Renshaw et al., 2006</xref>). These models have led to key insights into early wound signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>) and mechanisms of resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mathias et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tauzin et al., 2014</xref>) due, in part, to the unique capability for monitoring the wound response over a long duration. These sterile wounds are akin to controlled surgical wounds, lacking complexities associated with traumatic injuries or complications such as infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Velnar et al., 2009</xref>). We recently introduced a burn wound assay that disrupts collagen organization to study the role of collagen-based epithelial projections during wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>). We found that, unlike the simple transection, thermal injury at the caudal fin led to a dramatic loss of collagen fibers in the wound region, accompanied by a marked impact on healing progression at 48 hr post wound (hpw). This unexpected finding provided an opportunity for exploring alternate caudal fin injuries with the goal of developing wound models with added clinical and physiological relevance. Here, we characterize the kinetics of repair in the thermal injury model in comparison to the simple transection. Additionally, we examined how the presence of infection alters healing dynamics following a simple transection by applying <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> bacteria in the caudal fin transection model. We evaluated three aspects of these injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), representing key stages of wound healing – new tissue formation, inflammation and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ellis et al., 2018</xref>). We also began to investigate pathways that regulate the dynamics of tissue reorganization, and identified a role for Stat3 and TGFβ. Thermal injury and infected transection elicited different responses compared to the simple transection in all aspects that we characterized, allowing for new insights into the mechanisms of wound repair.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45976.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Caudal fin recovers from thermal injury, while wound healing is impaired in the presence of infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematic and analyses.

We performed caudal fin wounding on wild-type larvae at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) and monitored individual larvae daily by bright-field imaging. The healing dynamics following burn wound or <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm)</italic>-infected transection were different from simple transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Wound healing in the burn wound was attenuated between 24 and 72 hpw, but unexpectedly recovered such that the tissue regrowth area was comparable to that of simple transection by 96 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). This observation suggested that events leading up to 72 hpw were critical to facilitating the healing process. In contrast, we did not observe similar recovery following transection in the presence of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. The tissue regrowth area post <italic>Lm</italic>-infected transection remained markedly diminished relative to simple transection, even at 168 hpw (7 days post infection, dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Importantly, the infection had no measurable impact on the survival of larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We monitored the course of infection after rinsing away bacteria. We found that bacteria entered at the wound site and expanded, peaking at 72–96 hpw, and were largely cleared from the host by 120–168 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although the infection remained localized, limited dissemination of bacteria occurred in small patches along the neural tube (17 out of 47 larvae, three biological replicates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> did not infect unwounded larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Overall, while the burn wound was ultimately able to recover and heal, the damage caused by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection was sufficient to lead to a significant and long-lasting defect in wound healing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Thermal injury and infection trigger distinct inflammatory responses</title><p>The differential capacity for repair suggested that the inflammation in response to the burn wound or <italic>Lm</italic>-infected transection may also vary from the simple transection. To characterize the inflammatory response, we quantified neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the wound site. Although the inflammation in the burn wound followed a similar trend as that in the simple transection, the burn wound recruited significantly more neutrophils and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, while neutrophil recruitment peaked at different times, it appeared to resolve by 24 hpw in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The number of macrophages reached peak levels at 6 hpw and were clearing by 96 hpw in both injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The leukocyte infiltration at the wound site over time appeared to be related to wound repair, as we detected minimal recruitment at the caudal fin of age-matched unwounded larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Furthermore, we monitored differentially activated subpopulation of macrophages using a transgenic reporter line for TNFα expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marjoram et al., 2015</xref>) to identify pro-inflammatory M1-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kratochvill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murray, 2017</xref>). We considered TNFα-positive macrophages to be M1-like macrophages as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nguyen-Chi et al., 2015</xref>), and TNFα-negative as a differentially activated macrophage population. This TNFα-negative population may represent the anti-inflammatory M2-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murray, 2017</xref>) however, due to the current lack of a reporter line for M2-like macrophages in zebrafish, we simply distinguished macrophage populations as TNFα-positive or negative. The response appeared to be more pro-inflammatory in the burn wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). While mostly TNFα-negative macrophages are recruited to a simple transection throughout the course of the wound response, the burn wound recruits a more polarized population of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>), where at least 50% of macrophages in the burn wound were TNFα-positive by 24 hpw. There is also a shift in the proportion of differentially activated macrophages in the burn wound; TNFα-positive macrophages were most prominent 6–48 hpw and began to subside by 72 hpw, while the total number of macrophages was maintained over this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and by 96 hpw most macrophages in the burn wound were TNFα-negative. Interestingly, this shift in macrophage activation (72–96 hpw) appears to coincide with the time period when healing begins to recover in the burn wound (72–96 hpw; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). This is consistent with evidence that macrophages undergo a phenotypic switch (switch from M1- to M2-like activation) during the different phases of wound repair to support optimal healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Krzyszczyk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Novak and Koh, 2013</xref>). The course of inflammation was drastically different in response to the <italic>Lm</italic>-infected transection. Both neutrophil and macrophage infiltration increased over time, to the extent that we were not able to count individual leukocytes reliably beyond 48 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, we quantified TNFα expression in macrophages by measuring the area of fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Unlike in the simple transection, the majority of macrophages were TNFα-positive and the proportion remained similar throughout the time course at the infected tail wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The inflammation began to clear by 168 hpw (7 dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>), suggesting that regenerate growth may recover beyond 168 hpw. However, to avoid the complication of feeding larvae, we did not monitor wound repair past this time point. In sum, the burn wound triggered significantly more inflammation relative to the simple transection, while the inflammatory response was most extensive both in magnitude and duration in response to <italic>Lm</italic>-infected transection. In addition, inflammation resolution is initiated in all three injuries, albeit with different temporal dynamics. Moreover, the persistent presence of TNFα-positive macrophages appears to negatively correlate with wound repair.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45976.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Caudal fin injuries trigger distinct inflammatory responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sum-projections of z-stacks acquired by laser scanning confocal microscope using triple transgenic larvae (<italic>Tg(tnf:GFP) x Tg(lysC:BFP/mpeg1:mCherry-CAAX)</italic>) over time in response to simple transection or thermal injury.

Our previous work showed that proper collagen fiber organization is essential for functional wound repair in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">LeBert et al., 2015</xref>) and that induction of vimentin expression in cells at the wound edge plays an important role in collagen (I and II) production and fiber reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the observed differences in healing capacity of the wound models, we reasoned that collagen organization and vimentin expression at the wound edge would differ. We examined the impact of the various wounds on collagen fiber organization by performing SHG microscopy. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>), collagen fibers were completely disrupted upon thermal injury but without the loss of the tissue, as measured by the area devoid of fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Collagen fibers began to reappear over time and were clearly visible by 72–96 hpw, extending progressively outward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Despite this initial disruption in collagen integrity, the collagen fiber organization relative to the wound edge was comparable to the simple transection during repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Interestingly, this time line for the progression in collagen fiber reappearance coincides, similarly as the shift in macrophage activation, with the time period when healing recovers in the burn wound (72–96 hpw; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>).

The number of vimGFP-positive cells at the wound edge was similar between the simple transection and the burn wound, but markedly different in response to the <italic>Lm</italic>-infected transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The number of vimGFP-positive cells progressively declined to nearly undetectable levels in the <italic>Lm</italic>-infected wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Examination of the <italic>Lm</italic>-infected tail wound at later time points revealed that <italic>vimentin</italic> expression at the wound microenviroment recovers by 120 hpw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). These observations are consistent with, and extend, our previous findings that vimentin supports collagen fiber production and organization during wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>). The absence of vimGFP-positive cells at the <italic>Lm</italic>-infected wound temporally correlates with a defect in collagen fiber remodeling accompanied by impaired wound repair. The loss of vimentin-expressing cells at the wound edge in the presence of infection was unexpected. This is likely due to combination of multiple factors, such as cell death and inflammation. Identifying the mechanisms that lead to this effect on vimentin-expressing cells will be the focus of future studies. Interestingly, when we infected with the <italic>hly</italic> mutant of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, a mutant that fails to escape from the phagosome and enter the cytosol of the host cell resulting in attenuated <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Theisen and Sauer, 2016</xref>), we failed to observe the loss and delay in the appearance of vimGFP-positive cells at the wound edge, while detecting drastically reduced inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) compared to wild-type <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection. These findings indicate that the excessive inflammation associated with <italic>Lm</italic>-infected tail wound may contribute to the loss and delay of the vimentin-expressing cells, providing evidence that there is a crosstalk between the immune response and the presence of vimentin-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Disrupting Stat3 or TGFβ pathways impairs wound healing and diminishes wound-associated vimentin-expressing cells</title><p>Our findings suggest that the appearance of vimentin-expressing cells correlates with repair, suggesting a key role in wound healing. To begin identifying pathways that regulate the dynamics of vimentin-expressing cells at the wound microenvironment and their effects on repair, we examined the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor reported to enhance the expression of the vimentin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). We tested the role of STAT3 in wound healing following simple transection using the recently developed <italic>stat3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>). Tissue regrowth at 72 hr post tail transection (hptt) of <italic>stat3<sup>stl27/+</sup></italic> (stat3+/-) larvae was similar to that of wild-type (stat3+/+) larvae, while it was significantly impaired in <italic>stat3<sup>stl27/stl27</sup></italic> (stat3-/-) larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This defect is most likely wound-specific and not due to hindered development as the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants were reported to exhibit normal development up to 15 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>), although we did detect a small reduction in tail fin area of age-matched unwounded larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The inhibition of tissue regrowth following tail transection suggested that vimentin-expressing cells at the wound edge may be affected in the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants. To test this, we outcrossed <italic>stat3</italic> mutant with the <italic>vimentin</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>) and examined the presence of vimGFP-positive cells at the wound following simple transection at 72 hptt. The number of vimGFP-positive cells were reduced in the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants compared to wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). The vimGFP-positive cells at the wound did not arise early and then disappear by 72 hptt, as their numbers were also lower at 24 hptt in the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We did not evaluate the number of vimGFP-positive cells in stat3+/- larvae as we did not detect a defect in tissue regrowth in the heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). These data suggest that Stat3 regulates the presence of vimentin-expressing cells specifically during wound responses, as vimGFP-expressing cells along the edge of the caudal fin of age-matched unwounded larvae appear unaffected in the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the wound edge of the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants was smoother and appeared to lack collagen-based projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore we examined collagen fiber integrity and organization by SHG microscopy. Interestingly, while collagen fibers failed to grow and exhibited less projections in the <italic>stat3</italic> mutants, they appeared to have normal organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Using ALK5/TGFβ receptor I inhibitor, we found that disrupting the TGFβ pathway leads to impaired tissue regrowth and significantly diminished number of vimGFP-positive cells at the wound edge following tail transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). This outcome appears to be wound-specific, as the tail fin area and vimGFP-positive cells in age-matched unwounded control appear normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Since TGFβ is known to modulate STAT3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>), in future studies we plan to examine whether TGFβ regulates the dynamics of wound-associated vimentin-expressing cells via Stat3. It will be interesting to examine whether dysregulated Stat3 and/or TGFβ signaling contributes to the delay in wound-associated vimentin-expressing cells and impaired healing in the infected tail wound. Furthermore, it will be important to address the origin of these wound-associated vimentin-expressing cells, as that remains currently unknown. Our collective observations, that diminishing vimentin-expressing cells at the wound edge either by infection, or disrupting Stat3 or TGFβ pathways leads to impaired wound healing, support the idea that wound-associated vimentin-expressing cells are necessary for proper wound healing.</p><p>In summary, here we present the burn wound and the infected transection as alternative tail wound models in larval zebrafish with characteristic inflammatory and tissue responses that are different from the classical tail transection (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The burn wound was associated with an intermediate inflammatory response, loss of collagen fibers with no effect on vimGFP-positive cells, and delayed healing as compared to tail transection. The infected wound had the least regenerative capacity with the most extensive inflammation and tissue damage. Most striking was the loss of vimGFP-positive cells and impaired collagen reorganization that correlated with the defect in repair. In addition, we identified Stat3 and TGFβ as important signaling pathways in regulating the dynamics of vimentin-expressing cells during wound response, since disrupting either pathway leads to diminished numbers of vimentin-expressing cells at the wound site accompanied by impaired healing. Collectively, the wound models presented here expand our toolkit to study tissue healing and regeneration, and provide a useful in vivo approach to investigate mechanisms of crosstalk between the innate immune system and the remodeling machinery in response to complex injuries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (10403S)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (strain 10403S)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vincent et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">was be obtained from JD Sauer Lab, University of Wisconsin - Madison</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (D.

Caudal fins were imaged using a custom-built multiphoton microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conklin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">LeBert et al., 2016</xref>) at the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation using a 40X long working distance water immersion lens (1.2 NA, Nikon, Melville NY). Backwards SHG was collected with the multiphoton source laser (Chameleon UltraII, Coherent Inc, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to either 890 nm, with a 445/20 nm bandpass emission filter (Semrock, Rochester NY), or 740 nm with 370/10 nm bandpass emission filter (Semrock). The fluorescent signal from the vimentin:GFP expression was sequentially collected using a 520/35 nm bandpass emission filter (Semrock) and both signals were detected using a H7422P-40 GaAsP Photomultiplier Tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu, Japan). Brightfield images were simultaneously collected using a separate photodiode-based transmission detector (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA). Imaging parameters remained constant across imaging days for a given replicate. Data were collected as z-stacks with optical sections two microns apart, at 512 × 512 resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Quantification</title><sec id="s3-13-1"><title>Tissue regrowth area measurement</title><p>Tissue regrowth area during wound healing was measured using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) by outlining the total fin tissue area distal to the notochord using the polygon tool.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13-2"><title>Leukocyte recruitment and TNFα expression</title><p>Leukocyte recruitment was quantified in the caudal fin tissue area distal to the caudal vein loop by counting individual cells or area thresholding of fluorescence intensity using FIJI. TNFα expression was quantified by scoring cells TNFα-negative in the absence of GFP signal, or TNFα-positive when GFP signal was detected within macrophages, or by area thresholding. In area thresholding, a single slice from the z-stack of brightfield channel was selected to outline the area of measurement in the caudal fin using the polygon tool; this region of interest (ROI) was copied onto the sum z-projection of the z-stack from the corresponding macrophage (mCherry) channel; fluorescence intensity was thresholded to measure macrophage area within the outlined caudal fin area; macrophage area was outlined using ROI manager and copied onto the sum z-projection of the z-stack from the corresponding TNFα (GFP) channel, fluorescence intensity was thresholded to measure TNFα area within the outlined macrophage area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-13-3"><title>Area devoid of fibers</title><p>To measure the area between the wound tissue edge and the ends of the SHG detected fibers, sum z-projections of multiphoton SHG z-stacks, with the notochord vertically centered, were generated using FIJI. A free hand line was drawn along the ends of the fibers. This line was applied to the corresponding brightfield image and the area between this fiber-end boundary and the wound edge was drawn and measured. Because these measurements were collected on z-projections, the curling up of the tissue with thermal injury was not taken into account, thus the measurements on those samples may be an underestimation of the actual area devoid of fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13-4"><title>Fiber angle relative to wound edge</title><p>The angle of SHG detected fibers relative to the wound edge were quantified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, sum z-projections of SHG image stacks (generated using FIJI) of the larval caudal fin were analyzed using CurveAlign software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2017a</xref>), which extracts and measures various aspects of fiber orientation, including orientation to a user designated boundary. The corresponding bright field image was used to mark the wound edge boundary and fibers within 50 microns of the boundary were included in the analysis. Detection sensitivity was set to maximize fiber detection but with an emphasis on minimizing false positives. The sensitivity setting was maintained for all samples within an experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13-5"><title>Vimentin-expressing cell counts</title><p>To assess the presence of vimentin-expressing cells at the wound edge, using FIJI sum z-projections of z-stacks collected using either multiphoton microscopy or spinning disk confocal microscopy were used to count the number of vimGFP-positive cells present within a 50 × 100 micron rectangle, with the long axis bordered on the wound edge and centered vertically in line with the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). If any part of the cell was present within the rectangle it was counted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13-6"><title>Wound contour length</title><p>To assess the relative convolution of wound edge as an indicator of projections, the length of the wound edge was measured using the freehand line tool in FIJI to trace the contour of the wound edge on the z-projected SHG image, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LeBert et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All experiments in the main text and figures consist of at least three biological replicates. We define biological replicates as the inclusion of three separate clutches from three separate days. All data were graphed using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA) with statistical analyses performed using SAS/STAT 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Analysis of variance using the SAS proc mixed procedure was used for area devoid of fibers, fiber angle, macrophage area data and wound contour length, accounting for the variation due to fixed effects (condition, time, condition by time interaction) and random effects (replicate, replicate by treatment). For tissue regrowth area data, where measurements were made on the same larva over time, the same model was used but included a repeated measures statement with an ar(1) error structure to account for autocorrelated errors. If the normality assumption of errors failed, then a non-parametric analysis was performed using the ranks. Where appropriate, this distinction is indicated in the figure legends. Immune cell count data were analyzed using SAS GLIMMIX (General Linear Mixed Model) procedure, using the same model structure as above, with negative binomial distribution. If values failed to converge using negative bionomial distribution, Poisson distribution was used and it is indicated in the figure legends. For vimGFP-positive cell counts, a similar GLIMMIX procedure was used, stratified by time due to nonlinearity. p values are displayed as *&lt;0.05, **&lt;0.01, ***&lt;0.001 and ****&lt;0.0001 in the graphs. Actual p values are reported in the source data files.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Pui-ying Lam for technical assistance, and Peter Crump and Dr. Jens C Eickhoff for valuable guidance in statistical analysis.</p></ack><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.

The Huttenlocher group recently extended this model to more complicated cases of wounding burns (published previously). In the follow up study presented here they carefully compared different wound responses in three models: transections; burns; and infected transections. Readouts include area of tissue outgrowth, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, TNFα expression, and collagen (vimentin-GFP) matrix organization. The kinetics and magnitude of these diverse wound responses are distinct among these healing paradigms, with infection having the largest negative impact on healing. The reviewers find that conclusions are supported by the data and that the detailed temporal and spatial description of basic events at these different wound types should be of interest to the tissue repair community. However, they have raised concerns about the descriptive nature of the study, lack of mechanistic insight, and low levels of neutrophil recruitment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would benefit from a more comprehensive description and more mechanistic insight, perhaps actual cellular level look at re-epithelialization and epidermal morphology near these wounds, and some tie of one or more of these processes to known molecular pathways that orchestrate healing. An example might be H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, explored by this group before. Can differences in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production account for any of the observed differences in inflammatory responses?</p><p>2) According to Figure 1E, the tissues did not growth between 72-168 hpw. Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Figure 1D and shows that the bacteria levels were very low at 120 and 168 hpw, respectively. However, it may be helpful to examine the 96 hpw since this may also clarify the temporal relationships between the infection clearance and the reappearance of vimGFP-positive cells in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C.</p><p>3) Figure 2A: the level of neutrophil recruitment in the transection model is surprisingly low. Also, the claimed second wave of neutrophil recruitment at 72 hpw is not obvious. The authors should provide additional data or more compelling statistical analysis to highlight the differences in neutrophil (and macrophage) recruitment.</p><p>4) Subsection “Thermal injury and infection trigger distinct inflammatory responses”: it is claimed that the reduction of TNFα-positive macrophages coincides with recovering of tissue damage. However, there is no recovery according to Figure 1E.</p><p>5) Figure 4: the nature and origin of the vimentin-positive cells is very unclear. Why is their appearance delayed in the infection model? Are they recruited to the wound or were already present there? More information about the identity of these cells is required, for example, lineage tracing or single cell transcriptomics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45976.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper would benefit from a more comprehensive description and more mechanistic insight, perhaps actual cellular level look at re-epithelialization and epidermal morphology near these wounds, and some tie of one or more of these processes to known molecular pathways that orchestrate healing.

Our lab is actively pursuing the mechanistic aspects that contribute to the commonalities and differences observed in these wound models. Since we found that infection both impaired the appearance of vimentin-positive cells and regeneration, we focused on identifying pathways that mediate induction of vimentin-positive cells at the wound edge with tail transection.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we identified STAT3 and TGFβ as playing a role in the regulation of vimentin-positive cells at the wound environment. We found that disruption of both of these pathways leads to reduction of vimentin-positive cells and defect in tissue regrowth following tail transection, providing important mechanistic insight into these processes. We include this data in the subsection “Disrupting STAT3 or TGFβ pathways impairs wound healing and diminishes wound associated vimentin-positive cells”, and it is shown in the new Figure 4. To accommodate this additional data, the content of the original Figure 4 has been moved to Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. New experiments are reflected in the Abstract, Introduction and Materials and methods sections as well. We plan to study the role of these pathways more in depth, and how they may be altered in the burn and the infected wounds, in future studies. We also plan to address whether TGFβ signals via STAT3 to regulate the presence of vimentin-positive cells at the wound. However, this major undertaking is beyond the scope of this current short report. Also see response to major point #5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to Figure 1E, the tissues did not growth between 72-168 hpw.

In terms of the level of neutrophil recruitment, the values shown in this current manuscript are consistent with what we have previously reported in several recent works from our lab (Powell et al., Cell Reports 2017; Barros-Becker et al., JCS 2017; Rosowski et al., JI 2016; Tauzin S et al., Cell Biol 2014). However, we are aware of the variability in wound responses in the zebrafish community, which may be due to several factors, including specific fish facility, type of wound and individual handling of zebrafish embryos. In addition, these low numbers may be attributed to the way the tail transection is performed. All wounds in the current manuscript are performed without injury to the notochord. We are also studying tail wounds that include injury to the notochord, which elicit a larger inflammatory response. We stated in the Materials and methods section that the wounds are performed without injury to the notochord, (subsection “Caudal fin transection and thermal injury”). To further emphasize this information, it is also stated now in the experimental schematic in Figure 1A. We consider tail transection with injury to the notochord to be different and more complex compared to tail transection without injury to the notochord.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Thermal injury and infection trigger distinct inflammatory responses”: it is claimed that the reduction of TNFα-positive macrophages coincides with recovering of tissue damage.

Why is their appearance delayed in the infection model? Are they recruited to the wound or were already present there? More information about the identity of these cells is required, for example, lineage tracing or single cell transcriptomics.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree that these are extremely interesting questions and we are actively trying to identify the origin of vimentin-positive cells. Our previous work (LeBert et al., 2018) indicates that the vimentin cells do not migrate into the wound site but rather arise there. In addition, in terms of lineage tracing that work also showed that these cells did not appear to arise from epithelial cells or macrophages, but further work will need to be done to define their origin. While we are excited about pursuing the origin of these cells, we are unable to address this question within the scope of this current manuscript. Currently we are developing the tools to be able to carry out some of the suggested approaches, such as cell transcriptomics. We also agree with the reviewers that the delay in the vimentin-positive cells at the infected wound is intriguing. Multiple factors may contribute to that outcome, including cell death and excessive inflammation. We have included some initial data in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 using a mutant form of <italic>Listeria</italic> with attenuated virulence where we show that infection with the mutant <italic>Listeria</italic> induces much reduced inflammation and no delay in the vimentin-positive cells. This suggests that excessive inflammation is a contributing factor in the observed delay, further suggesting a potential crosstalk between immune cells and vimentin-positive cells, an area we plan to further explore. Based on having identified STAT3 and TGFβ to play a role in the appearance of vimentin-positive cells at the wound edge (see response to major point #1), we are currently in the process of examining the possibility that STAT3 and TGFβ signaling is disrupted at the infected tail wound. These new wound models provide the opportunity to address interesting questions in wound healing and we are excited to utilize these models to further explore these questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
