new antibiotics. Tuberculosis (TB) lung lesions are made of various immune cell types, some of which harbor persistent forms of the pathogen, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. By combining high resolution MALDI MSI with histology staining and quantitative image analysis in rabbits with active TB, we have mapped the distribution of a fluoroquinolone at high resolution, and identified the immune-pathological factors driving its heterogeneous penetration within TB lesions, in relation to where bacteria reside. We find that macrophage content, distance from lesion border and extent of necrosis drive the uneven fluoroquinolone penetration. Preferential uptake in macrophages and foamy macrophages, where persistent bacilli reside, compared to other immune cells present in TB granulomas, was recapitulated in vitro using primary human cells. A nonlinear modeling approach was developed to help predict the observed drug behavior in TB lesions. This work constitutes a methodological advance for the co-localization of drugs and infectious agents at high spatial resolution in diseased tissues, which can be applied to other diseases with complex immunopathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>drug distribution</kwd><kwd>fluoroquinolones</kwd><kwd>rabbit model</kwd><kwd>MALDI mass spectrometry imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-HL131072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dartois</surname><given-names>Veronique Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI111967</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dartois</surname><given-names>Veronique Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1174780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dartois</surname><given-names>Veronique Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Penetration of the fluoroquinolones in tuberculosis lesions is heterogeneous even in fully cellular areas, is driven by macrophage content and decreases as the distance from lesion outer rim increases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In human tuberculosis (TB), necrotic granulomas and cavities are the most prominent and treatment recalcitrant lesion types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canetti, 1955</xref>). The major histopathological features of these lesions are a caseous or necrotic core surrounded by a cuff of immune cells including lymphocytes, epithelioid macrophages, foam cells or lipid-laden macrophages, and interspersed neutrophils and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dannenberg, 2006</xref>). In these lesions, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the etiologic agent of TB, is found intracellularly in macrophages and foamy macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dallenga and Schaible, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2010</xref>), epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scordo et al., 2016</xref>) and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tailleux et al., 2003</xref>). Mtb can establish a durable infection in foamy macrophages leading to replication and/or long term survival in a dormant state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russell, 2007</xref>). TB granulomas present with increasingly abnormal vasculature from the periphery inward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2015</xref>). Most vessels are compressed along the lesion periphery and collapsed within the interior of the cellular rim. This leads to impaired vascular function and a gradual decrease of small molecule penetration as the distance from the granuloma outer edge increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2015</xref>). Vascular dysfunction culminates in a complete lack of blood vessels in the necrotic core. Mtb-infected foam cells or foamy macrophages largely concentrate along the interface between the cellular and caseous regions of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Efficacy and drug distribution studies in animal models of TB disease have shown that reaching adequate drug concentrations at the sites of infection is critical in achieving sterilization and clinical utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irwin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irwin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prideaux et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimmerman et al., 2017</xref>). Using analytical approaches and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), we previously showed that most TB drugs exhibit differential partitioning between the cellular and necrotic regions of pulmonary lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irwin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prideaux et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimmerman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prideaux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prideaux et al., 2015b</xref>). In these studies, TB drugs were imaged at low spatial resolution and quantified in cellular regions treated in aggregate, without taking immune cell type into consideration. Given the heterogeneous cellular composition of the cellular rim, we posit that the spatial distribution of TB drugs within the cellular compartment of lesions is a function of immune cell type, and likely reflects differential uptake in each cell type. In addition, decreased vascular function may affect drug penetration. To quantify antibiotic distribution at high spatial resolution and link the distribution patterns to immune cell types, we selected the fluoroquinolones (FQ), which constitute the mainstay of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB treatment. In MDR-TB patients, treatment success is associated with the use of FQs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2012</xref>) and, not surprisingly, it follows that FQ resistance is associated with poor clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falzon et al., 2013</xref>). Moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) and gatifloxacin (GTX), three later generation FQs, are used to treat MDR-TB, although GTX production for systemic administration was recently terminated due to its side effect profile. In addition, MXF is included in many ‘universal’ regimens under clinical evaluation to treat both drug susceptible and MDR-TB ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillespie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diacon et al., 2012</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.endtb.org/clinical-trial">http://www.endtb.org/clinical-trial</ext-link>; ClinicalTrials.gov), and thus has the potential to become a pivotal TB drug. We have recently shown that MXF kills non-replicating Mtb persisters in ex vivo caseum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarathy et al., 2018</xref>) at concentrations that are achieved clinically in caseous foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prideaux et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heinrichs et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the complex partitioning of MXF and other FQs in the cellular compartments of these lesions where intracellular pathogens reside constitutes one of the major remaining knowledge gaps to fully elucidate the lesion-centric pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug class.</p><p>Here we combine high resolution MALDI MSI with histology staining, and quantitative image analysis, to study the spatial distribution of small molecule drugs in distinct cellular clusters of TB lesions and understand spatial drug partitioning in relation to where the pathogen resides. We then recapitulate the observed distribution patterns using new drug uptake assays in human primary macrophages, foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and an epithelial cell line, with the objective of developing in vitro tools to rapidly predict relative drug partitioning at the cellular level in vivo. The findings provide interesting clues on how partitioning into lung lesions can contribute to clinical efficacy, and validate immune cell uptake assays as a suitable tool to study drug distribution patterns in complex diseased tissues. The methods are not only applicable to antibiotics and host-directed therapy used in the treatment of TB and other infectious diseases, but could also be adapted to cancer and other diseases with complex immunopathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FQs exhibit heterogeneous distribution in the cellular cuff of TB lesions</title><p>In previous studies, we have shown that FQs preferentially partition into the cellular layers of necrotic granulomas and cavities, compared to caseous foci, both in rabbit and human lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prideaux et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prideaux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prideaux et al., 2015b</xref>). To refine the spatial distribution of this drug class in the cellular margins of granulomas, we first applied high resolution MALDI MSI. In two-dimensional MALDI MSI ion maps, MXF, LVX and GTX each formed a narrow rim of high signal intensity directly adjacent to the caseous center of the granuloma, as well as additional rings or pockets of higher intensity further outward from the necrotic center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>). Although MALDI MSI does not deliver absolute drug quantitation, relative drug abundance can be compared by measuring signal intensity (drug ion counts/internal standard ion counts) in defined regions of a MALDI MSI ion map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further characterize the visual partitioning observed for each FQ, signal intensity was measured in uninvolved lung, cellular lesion rims and necrotic foci of several lesions isolated from rabbits treated with each FQ. In this analysis, cellular and necrotic regions were treated in aggregate, and signal intensity ratios between lung, cellular and necrotic areas were calculated. We found approximately 1.5 to 2-fold higher signal in cellular lesions than in uninvolved lung and caseum for all three FQs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Since this approach only delivers relative quantitation data, we next turned to laser capture microdissection coupled with standard mass spectrometry to measure the concentration of each FQ in caseous foci, cellular rims and uninvolved lung areas at various time points following an oral drug dose. Overall, MXF and GTX concentrations were higher in cellular areas than in caseum and uninvolved lung, although only marginally so. LVX exhibited irregular patterns of distribution between the cellular and caseous regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, although MALDI images clearly reveal higher FQ abundance in distinct rings and pockets within the cellular layers of TB lesions, when the cellular rim is analyzed as a whole, the heterogeneous FQ distribution masks the favorable penetration of this drug class in the cellular cuff of mature lesions. These images and quantitative results uncovered the need for high resolution drug mapping in the cellular envelope of TB lesions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41115.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution of fluoroquinolones in infected rabbit lung and lesions.</title><p>(<bold>a–b–c</bold>) Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) histology staining of lesions and surrounding lung tissue resected from rabbits that received a single dose of moxifloxacin (MXF) (<bold>a</bold>), levofloxacin (LVX) (<bold>b</bold>) or gatifloxacin (GTX) (<bold>c</bold>).

The MXF [M + K]<sup>+</sup> ion map was co-registered with the H and E image and the 35 ROI contour lines were redrawn onto the H and E image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Using this image, a blinded veterinary pathologist scored the fraction of histiocytes (foamy and non-foamy macrophages), neutrophils, lymphocytes, epithelial or stromal cells, and necrosis in each ROI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). We also measured the absolute and relative distance of each ROI from the outer edge of the lesion, where the relative distance was calculated as the ratio of the distance from ROI to edge by the total distance from caseum to edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Lastly, in the MALDI MSI ion map, we measured the relative abundance (drug/internal standard ion counts) of MXF in each ROI, expressed as the mean pixel intensity per ROI (each ROI containing 48 to 429 pixels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that average MXF contents were significantly different across the majority of ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) with a between-ROI variability of 43.4%. These data were compiled to search for correlations between MXF abundance, measured as mean pixel intensity, and each of the recorded parameters (i.e. fraction of histiocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, epithelial cells and necrotic area, and distance from lesion outer edge, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), with the objective of identifying the major drivers of MXF distribution in TB lesions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41115.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Heterogeneous distribution of MXF in the cellular cuff of a necrotic lesion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H and E staining of a cavitating necrotic granuloma.

There was no significant association between MXF intensity signal and the percentage of other immune cell types in ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These observations prompted us to use a nonlinear modeling approach to broadly interrogate the dataset and build a model of MXF partitioning in lesions. Using nonlinear mixed effect modeling (nonMEM) with the full dataset, we found that accounting for histiocyte fraction reduced the between-ROI MXF variability from 44.0% to 28.3%, which further decreased to 20.0% when relative distance of ROI to lesion edge was integrated in the model. This was consistent with vascular function and small molecule penetration decreasing as the distance from the granuloma outer edge increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2015</xref>). Factoring the fraction of the ROI occupied by necrotic tissue further reduced the variability from 20.0% to 18.9% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), significantly improving the correlation. Integrating the fraction of other immune cell types further decreased the residual unexplained variability but not significantly so (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggested that immune cells other than macrophages do not significantly influence the partitioning of MXF. The absolute distance between ROIs and lesion periphery did not correlate with MXF signal intensity, which is not surprising given the highly variable thickness of the cellular rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The validation dataset was then used to confirm the predictive value of the model equation. We found that the model could predict ROI-specific MXF abundance using histiocyte fraction, relative distance from lesion margin and necrosis content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>).

Since foamy macrophages are a privileged reservoir for Mtb bacilli in TB lung lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>), we specifically measured FQ uptake in foamy macrophages to determine whether foamy macrophages are as FQ-avid as their non-foamy counterparts.

Cellular content, vascular function and multidimensional tissue architecture all affect drug penetration in a drug class-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saggar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rippley and Stokes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dartois, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). There is a need for in vivo, in vitro and in silico methods to study drug partitioning at diseased sites. In previous studies of antibiotic penetration in TB lesions, we showed higher accumulation of MXF in the cellular layers than in necrotic foci (caseum). MALDI MSI and traditional mass spectrometry analysis of human lesions revealed a correlation between diffusion into caseum and caseum cellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prideaux et al., 2015a</xref>). Here we have combined high resolution MALDI MSI, qualification of cell types in H and E stained sections, quantitative image analysis and nonlinear modeling to show that (i) the distribution of FQs within the cellular cuff of mature TB lesions is uneven and (ii) the heterogeneous distribution of MXF in TB lesions is driven by the macrophage content, the distance from lesion border and the extent of necrosis. In vitro uptake assays in human blood cells were developed to confirm that the FQs are preferentially taken up by macrophages relative to other immune cell types typically found in TB lesions, and even more strongly so in foamy macrophages where Mtb establishes long term infection and dormancy. Our results are consistent with published data on the accumulation of FQs in macrophage cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlier et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michot et al., 2006</xref>), constitute an advance over assays relying on immortal cell lines in which expression of transporters and efflux pumps can be significantly altered, and demonstrate that uptake is significantly lower in human neutrophils and lymphocytes.</p><p>High-resolution co-localization of drug and immune cell type was achieved by MALDI imaging and H and E staining of the same tissue section. While ‘same-section’ drug imaging and histology staining has been used to map the distribution of PIK-3 inhibitors in brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salphati et al., 2014</xref>), the precise superimposition of drug and cell types hasn’t been reported to date. In the cancer field, several studies have focused on drug mapping with reference to next-section H and E staining to achieve relative quantitation of drugs in ROIs but without qualification of cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinsenkamp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marko-Varga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giordano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The clear correlation between MXF abundance and relative distance from the outer lesion border is in keeping with previous studies showing that functionally abnormal vasculature increases as the distance from granuloma border increases, leading to correspondingly impaired small molecule distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies, the authors showed that therapies thought to achieve vessel normalization, and thus improve vascular function, appear to improve small molecule delivery to TB lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Datta et al., 2015</xref>) or potentiate TB therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). These observations are reminiscent of oncology drug penetration concepts, where excessive angiogenesis generates a disorganized and leaky blood vessel network leading to poor drug delivery to the tumor core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Paolo and Bocci, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, FQ uptake was higher in foamy than non-foamy macrophages. This may be due to differential regulation of transporters and efflux pumps since FQs are actively transported in and out of eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weiner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulgaonkar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michot et al., 2005</xref>), and foamy macrophages are known to differentially express selected transporters such as ABCG1 and ABCA1 (cholesterol efflux transporters) compared to non-foamy phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorkowski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canfrán-Duque et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, processes such as pinocytosis have been implicated in foam cell biogenesis and could be upregulated in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michael et al., 2013</xref>). Lastly, many FQs carry a basic amine and could undergo enhanced trapping in the acidic organelles of foamy macrophages if the pH is more acidic than in non-foamy macrophages, which remains to be determined. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the finding that FQs are preferentially taken up by all phagocytes has positive clinical implications since drug tolerant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> persisters are present in the foam cells of human lung lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacilli are also found in viable and necrotic neutrophils, which constitute a privileged site of bacterial replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mishra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimmey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diedrich et al., 2016</xref>) and where MXF uptake was significantly lower than in macrophages.</p><p>There are a few limitations to this study. If MXF uptake is higher in foamy than in non-foamy macrophages in vivo, one should detect a ring of higher signal intensity in MALDI ion maps, corresponding to the ring of foam cells that directly subtend the caseum, visible in superimposed H and E images. However, because foam cells are mostly concentrated at the caseum border where vascularization is least effective, this confounding factor prevents the visualization of higher MXF signal at the cellular-caseum interface in MXF ion maps. Second, a single lesion was used to establish the correlation between MXF abundance and histological parameters, and cell types were identified and quantified based on H and E staining which is less accurate than immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. In addition, the method is resource intensive and not amenable to serial analyses of H and E images. This however creates an opportunity as much as it is a limitation. Our objective is to demonstrate proof-of-concept in order to harness the power of emerging technologies that rely on multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI-TOF) for revealing immune environment structure and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keren et al., 2018</xref>) coupled to artificial intelligence and convolutional neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wainberg et al., 2018</xref>) for image recognition applied to H and E and MALDI MS images. Future efforts will focus on exploring these approaches to automate interpretation of overlaid MALDI MS, MIBI-TOF and H and E images. While the model needs to be tested with additional lesions and other FQs, the successful train-and-test approach validates the modeling strategy as a starting point to initiate similar types of investigations with other drug classes and disease indications.</p><p>The methodology is broadly applicable to the high-resolution mapping of any drug in diseased tissue, particularly when multiple cell types are present in complex lesions, tumors, atherosclerotic plaques, to name a few.

LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Sciex Applied Biosystems 4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1260 HPLC system to quantify LVX, GTX and MXF levels in the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical and correlation analyses</title><p>Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between MXF abundance and each of the parameters recorded for the 35 ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Nonlinear Mixed Effect Modeling (nonMEM) correlation analysis</title><p>The entire dataset included 5053 observations (pixel intensities) from 35 ROIs. Each ROI contained between 48 and 429 pixels. Data points below the limit of quantitation (BLOQ) were set to ‘zero’. Non-linear mixed effect modeling was applied, where two levels of random effects were implemented: a first level describing within-ROI variability and a second level of mixed effects describing between-ROI variability. All variability terms were assumed to be log normally distributed, where the median and variance terms were estimated. First, a constant baseline model was developed (the ‘base’ model) where the typical value of drug abundance is the median value of pixel intensity across all ROIs, and the between-ROI variability term represents the deviation of each individual ROI compared to the typical value. The covariate model was built using a step-wise model building procedure where all continuous predictors were tested using linear and non-linear functions (exponential, power, hockey stick). The predictors included into the covariate search were: % histiocytes, % lymphocytes, % necrotic cells, % neutrophils, % epithelial or stromal cells, relative distance to lesion border (or distance ratio), absolute distance to lesion border in pixels or in μm. The % necrotic cell values were categorized into four groups – no necrosis, low necrosis (&lt;5%), medium necrosis (&gt;5% and&lt;90%) and high necrosis (≥90%) and treated as categorical covariates. The predictors were retained in the model if they met two criteria: (i) significance level of p&lt;0.05 in the likelihood ratio test used to compare the goodness of fit of the model with and without the corresponding predictor, and (ii) ability to decrease unexplained between-ROI variability. To visualize the contribution of each potential predictor, we built empirical Bayes estimate (EBE) plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Savic and Karlsson, 2009</xref>), based on up to 150 repeated observations in each ROI, thus representing the true measured value. The estimate of EBE shrinkage was &lt;1%, confirming the biological relationship between drug abundance in ROIs and each of the predictors selected in the final model. Once finalized, the covariate model was validated using residual diagnostic plots and visual predictive checks. We employed model diagnostics which included plots of typical predictions and individual predictions versus observed values, as well as plots of conditional weighted residuals versus typical prediction and visual predictive checks.

The training data set included 3277 measurements from 24 ROIs and the validation data set included 1776 measurements from 11 ROIs.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Bree Aldridge (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Effective distribution of drugs to the site of infection is critical to control TB disease, which presents with complex lung pathology, often with heterogeneous lesions at different stages of development. In their submission, Dartois and colleagues attempt to explore tissue distribution of fluoroquinolones (FQs), which are central to the treatment of drug resistant TB. Using imaging mass spectrometry, combined with histological assessment of the same sections, the authors study tissue distribution of FQs in tuberculous lesions from infected rabbits. Previous work demonstrated that FQs distribute into the cellular cuff of necrotic granulomas and in this current submission, the authors further unravel these observations. They also develop and apply interesting statistical analysis algorithms to spatially locate quantify drug distribution.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) Moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) and gatifloxacin (GTX) distribute to a region adjacent to the caseous center of the granuloma.</p><p>2) FQs preferentially distribute into foamy macrophages close to the caseum or into less-foamy macrophages in the outer layers of the granuloma.</p><p>3) MXF appears to be preferentially taken up by macrophages in the granuloma cuff over other immune cell types. These observations were confirmed in drug uptake assays where FQ uptake was higher in macrophages when compared to other cell types.</p><p>4) Preferential accumulation of FQs in foamy macrophages isolated from human PBMCs.</p><p>The study is clearly presented and the following should be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mention is made of &quot;same-section&quot; analysis by MALDI and histopathology but the workflow in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 suggests that MALDI is done on one section and histopathology is done on a distinct adjacent section. Adjacent is also mentioned in some figure legends. This becomes confusing again when the legend in Figure 3 mentions &quot;same-section&quot;. From the text in the first paragraph of the subsection “Macrophage content and distance from lesion margin drive the penetration of MXF”, it seems clear that the same section was used for MALDI and histopathology, this should be kept consistent throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors report a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in FQ distribution in cellular lesions when compared to uninvolved lung and caseum. This difference seems relatively small. Does it translate to meaningful differences in effective killing concentrations (MICs) in the different components of the lesion? Can statistics be provided for Figure 1—figure supplement 2? What do these differences mean for bacterial clearance in these regions?</p><p>3) Better images need to be provided for Figure 2—figure supplement 1H – it's hard to see the bacilli, very fuzzy.</p><p>4) Various quantitative analyses were conducted, which are referred to and found under different sections like statistical analysis, correlation analysis and modelling. It is difficult for the reader to follow these different sections and the manuscript would benefit of a re-arrangement of Materials and methods and Results into one section called Statistical analysis where the different types of analysis could have subsections and be presented. It is accepted that some of the statistical analysis have been presented before but as an example, the modeling part is unique to this article. As such, the description of the analysis needs to be somewhat more extensive. A more detailed model development section illustrating the development of the base model and the covariate analysis as well as information about the software used and how model diagnostics were done would be good.</p><p>5) The validation step of the analysis is not clear. What does this add? The statement in the manuscript that the validation confirmed the predictive value of the model equation is somewhat questionable. A proper validation step would have required a distinct data set, generated separately from those used to build the model but with a different condition. As an example, this can include comparison of a different dose in PKPD than was used to build the model but still within the covered dose range used for model development. It would be more appropriate if all data in the current manuscript were used for model development and no validation step made. This would also most likely reduce the uncertainty in the model parameters and perhaps change the covariate analysis with respect to statistical power. Please address this.</p><p>6) It seems that immune cells in tissues were identified by their morphologic characteristics on H&amp;E which is inaccurate. A more appropriate approach, which may be technically difficult, would be to use specific immune-stains or preferably, flow cytometric separation of cells from tissue homogenates and subsequent measurement of drug levels. Flow cytometry was performed for human blood samples but not for rabbit tissues. Given that these methods were not used, please clearly state in the Abstract and concluding remarks that only H&amp;E staining was used to differentiate cell types in rabbits and that this is a limitation of the study.</p><p>7) The significance of the human blood data is unclear. In tissues, the drug distribution is affected by the tissue architecture, fibrosis, etc. but this is not accounted in the blood data. Also explain how this is an advance over Carlier et al. (1990) and Michot et al. (2006). How much drug is protein bound? Are these data simply reflecting drug lipophilicity? Finally, please add a statement regarding IRB approval/exemption.</p><p>8) Supplementary figures show the tissue to plasma ratios at several time-points after drug administration. However, except at early time-points (&lt;2 hours), wouldn't these ratios be significantly affected by the plasma clearance (half-lives ~few hours)? The tissue concentration effect noted over time may simply be due to a lower plasma level (denominator) rather than a true, absolute increase in tissue levels. Can the authors address this possibility?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41115.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mention is made of &quot;same-section&quot; analysis by MALDI and histopathology but the workflow in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 suggests that MALDI is done on one section and histopathology is done on a distinct adjacent section.

From there on, same-section MALDI and H&amp;E was carried out throughout the rest of the manuscript. We initially opted to show the ‘adjacent-section’ workflow in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and referred to Blanc et al. (2018) for same-section workflow. However, this was not the best decision and is likely at the root of the confusion. We have now inserted a new supplementary figure describing the same-section workflow (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), reorganized and expanded the Materials and methods to better describe this workflow, and clarified the use of adjacent section versus same section throughout the manuscript.</p><p>This begs the question of why we did not use same section MALDI and H&amp;E to achieve high-resolution mapping for all three FQs shown in Figure 1. The reason is technical and due to a significant decrease in analytical sensitivity when using glass slides for MALDI MS imaging, which is required if the same section is to be stained by H&amp;E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors report a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in FQ distribution in cellular lesions when compared to uninvolved lung and caseum.

Can statistics be provided for Figure 1—figure supplement 2? What do these differences mean for bacterial clearance in these regions?</p></disp-quote><p>a) “This difference seems relatively small.” When cellular lesions are taken in aggregate, i.e. when FQ signal intensity is averaged across all cell types present in cellular granulomas or in the cellular cuff of necrotic granulomas, the difference in FQ abundance between cellular lesions and caseum is indeed small. The purpose of Figure 1—figure supplement 2 is to highlight that this quantitative difference is <italic>small</italic> in comparison to the MALDI ion maps where the visual impression suggests a more striking contrast between the high intensity pockets in the cellular rim and the caseous core. This apparent discrepancy is later on explained by the discovery that FQ uptake is much higher in macrophages than in lymphocytes, neutrophils or epithelial cells.</p><p>b) “Does it translate to meaningful differences in effective killing concentrations (MICs) in the different components of the lesion? What do these differences mean for bacterial clearance in these regions?” Since macrophages are the major cell type infected by Mtb in lung lesions, the preferential distribution of FQs in macrophage-rich pockets that are part of the cellular rim does result in higher killing efficiency of Mtb in cellular than in necrotic lesions by the FQs. This differential effect is reported in a manuscript currently in review, and provided as supporting material with the present submission (“Comparative lesion-centric pharmacology and efficacy of fluoroquinolones for tuberculosis”).</p><p>c) “Can statistics be provided for Figure 1—figure supplement 2?” These comments and questions made us rethink the way we plotted and analyzed the data. In addition to plotting concentration ratios (lung-to-cellular and caseum-to-cellular), we have also compiled the absolute values of average pixel intensities in lung, cellular and caseum ROIs, for each FQ, now provided in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. To detect statistically significant differences between FQ signal intensities in lung versus cellular lesion, and cellular lesion versus caseum. The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. <italic>P</italic> values are shown in the figure and figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Better images need to be provided for Figure 2—figure supplement 1H – it's hard to see the bacilli, very fuzzy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced panel H with a clearer image at higher magnification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Various quantitative analyses were conducted, which are referred to and found under different sections like statistical analysis, correlation analysis and modelling.

Please address this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point, we debated whether to present the correlation analysis as training and validation, or model building only. We agree that formal validation would require a separate dataset from another lesion. Thus we have repeated model building with the full dataset, then split the dataset in training and validation subsets, and determined that model parameters were not affected when only 2/3 of the data were used for training (compare Supplementary file 1 – Tables 2 and 3). We believe there is still merit in internally validating the model within this particular lesion, because it would allow predicting MXF signal intensity in the entire lesion based on immune cell composition and distance from granuloma edge, not only the 35 regions of interest. The training/validation approach is now shown in supplementary figures and tables only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It seems that immune cells in tissues were identified by their morphologic characteristics on H&amp;E which is inaccurate.

We agree that this method is subject to human error and is in addition slow and resource intensive. This is both a limitation and an opportunity. Our objective was to demonstrate proof-of-concept despite these limitations, uncovering the power of emerging technologies that rely on (i) multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI-TOF) for revealing immune environment structure and composition (Keren et al., 2018) coupled to (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) and convolutional neural networks (Wainberg et al., 2018) for image recognition applied to H&amp;E and MALDI MS images. We are currently exploring these approaches in collaboration with teams at the Gates Foundation to automate interpretation of overlaid MALDI MS, MIBI-TOF and H&amp;E images.</p><p>We have revised the Abstract to clearly state that H&amp;E was used for cell type identification, and expanded the Discussion to highlight the associated limitations as well as the opportunity to bring the concept to the next level with MIBI-TOF and AI approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The significance of the human blood data is unclear. In tissues, the drug distribution is affected by the tissue architecture, fibrosis, etc. but this is not accounted in the blood data. Also explain how this is an advance over Carlier et al. (1990) and Michot et al. (2006). How much drug is protein bound? Are these data simply reflecting drug lipophilicity? Finally, please add a statement regarding IRB approval/exemption.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we assume that by ‘blood data’, the reviewer refers to in vitro assays of FQ uptake in immune cells isolated from human blood. We acknowledge that purified human cells do not recapitulate the environment of the granuloma, such as fibrosis, tissue architecture, differential blood supply, etc. Our objective was to determine whether the preferential partitioning of FQs in macrophage-rich regions could be predicted in vitro by comparing simple drug uptake in the major immune cell types found in human blood (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and foamy macrophages). We also included an epithelial cell line. If these in vitro assays would indeed predict drug behavior at the tissue level, the benefit-to-workload ratio would be high compared to in vivo studies such as those presented here.</p><p>These assays are an advance over Carlier et al. (1990) and Michot et al. (2006) in that they rely on purified leucocytes from human blood, rather than immortal cell lines in which expression of transporters and efflux pumps can be significantly altered. We have added a note in the Discussion to highlight this.</p><p>Fluoroquinolones exhibit low PPB (plasma protein binding) and low cLogP across the class (see table below, our data). While it is likely that macrophage uptake is – to some extent – a function of protein binding which in turn correlates with lipophilicity, the value of the uptake assays relies more in comparing uptake of a given fluoroquinolone in different immune cell types, than in comparing uptake of the three fluoroquinolones in a given cell type. Here we show that preferential partitioning of FQs in macrophage rich regions could be predicted in vitro by comparing drug uptake in neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and foamy macrophages purified from human blood.</p><p>Fresh packed leucocytes from anonymized blood donors were <italic>purchased</italic> (we edited the Materials and methods to indicate this important detail) from the New York Blood Center and are IRB exempt.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Drug</td><td>Hu PPB <sup>(1)</sup> <break/>% free (SD)</td><td>Rb PPB <sup>(1)</sup> <break/>% free (SD)</td><td>cLogP (ACD)</td></tr><tr><td>MXF</td><td>71.68 (0.56)</td><td>69.53 (0.03)</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>LVX</td><td>62.60 (0.61)</td><td>61.02 (3.34)</td><td>0.84</td></tr><tr><td>GTX</td><td>76.25 (2.43)</td><td>78.75 (0.89)</td><td>1.09</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p><sup>(1)</sup>at 2 μg/mL, or approximately the C<sub>average</sub> across the dosing interval</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Supplementary figures show the tissue to plasma ratios at several time-points after drug administration.

Can the authors address this possibility?</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, the tissue-to-plasma ratios remain quite similar throughout the dosing interval. There are slight variations but no consistent trend. This was also observed for MXF in the clinical study we published a couple of years ago (Prideaux et al., 2015). Given that FQs exhibit low protein binding, they equilibrate rapidly between the plasma and tissue compartments, but accumulate in cellular regions because they are actively transported inside cells (see the work of Paul Tulkens et al. spanning the past 20 years). The main message of Figure 1—figure supplement 2 is to show that FQ concentrations are higher in cellular than necrotic compartments, regardless of time points post dose, and regardless of plasma concentrations. We do not comment on the tissue to plasma ratios for these reasons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
