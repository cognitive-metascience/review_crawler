Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) direct cell fate decisions by binding <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements, known as enhancers, in order to activate or repress gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith and Shilatifard, 2014</xref>). Two types of interactions recruit and organize transcriptional regulatory complexes: protein<bold>–</bold>DNA interactions and protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions. Protein<bold>–</bold>DNA interactions allow TFs to decipher the sequence information presented by non-coding DNA — namely the number, order, and affinity of TF binding sites — and build appropriate regulatory complexes at the correct genomic locations. Protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions among TFs serve multiple purposes. For example, cooperative or antagonistic interactions can respectively increase or decrease TF occupancy, whereas other layers of interaction can recruit cofactors and general regulators of RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funnell and Crossley, 2012</xref>). We currently have a poor understanding of how each TF’s protein<bold>–</bold>DNA and protein<bold>–</bold>protein interaction affinities are tuned to assemble regulatory complexes that have the composition and dynamics needed to shift gene expression patterns as development proceeds.</p><p>As eukaryotic genomes encode a small number of TFs relative to the number of genes to be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charoensawan et al., 2010</xref>), TFs must be used reiteratively in distinct contexts throughout development. Furthermore, many TFs are organized into large families that are defined by similarity in DNA-binding preference. This presents a complicated specificity problem, as not only must each TF regulate a particular gene in some cells but not in others, but TFs from the same superfamily, when coexpressed in a cell, may need to regulate distinct sets of target genes.</p><p>Recent manipulations of enhancer sequences across multiple organisms have emphasized the importance of low- and medium-affinity protein<bold>–</bold>DNA interactions in generating specific developmental expression patterns without ectopic induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorberbaum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farley et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to sub-optimized protein<bold>–</bold>DNA interactions, these studies have also noted that the clustering of multiple low-affinity sites (or multiple enhancers) is capable of restoring robust activation while maintaining specificity. Because protein<bold>–</bold>DNA affinity is held constant, these results suggest that enhancer activity can be profoundly shifted by favoring or dis-favoring cooperative protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions among TFs. In support of this idea, the abolition of TF protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions decreases TF occupancy in vitro and in vivo, for a wide variety of TF families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lebrecht et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgunova and Taipale, 2017</xref>). In addition, careful dissection of model enhancers across organisms have shown that changing the spacing of TF binding sites can have strong effects on enhancer output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thanos and Maniatis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuh and Davidson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Swanson et al., 2010</xref>), and the conservation of binding-site motifs is thought to preserve cooperative TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazemian et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although clustered TF binding sites almost certainly affect enhancer output by favoring TF protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions, direct manipulation of these interactions is rarely attempted because of the inherently greater complexity of tuning a protein<bold>–</bold>protein interaction interface relative to manipulating DNA sequence. Thus despite their importance, fundamental questions of how protein<bold>–</bold>protein interaction affinity impacts regulatory dynamics or target gene specificity in vivo remain unanswered. For example, do higher-affinity interactions stabilize transcriptional complexes to increase activating or repressive output? Or, alternatively, do they compromise regulatory dynamics or target gene specificity and thereby dysregulate enhancer output, analogous to what has been found with protein<bold>–</bold>DNA interactions?</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> E-Twenty-Six (ETS) family TF Yan, also referred to as Anterior open (Aop), provides a well-characterized system that is ideally suited to exploring these ideas because its protein<bold>–</bold>DNA and protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions can be controlled directly. Yan is a conserved transcriptional repressor that works downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling to regulate cell fate decisions during embryonic and retinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai and Rubin, 1992</xref>). Upon RTK activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylates Yan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Neill et al., 1994</xref>). This dismantles repressive complexes that involve Yan and allows their export from the nucleus and subsequent degradation in the cytoplasm, which in turn enables activating TFs and cofactors to access and turn on previously repressed target genes thereby initiating cell fate transitions. If MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Yan is blocked, Yan remains nuclearly localized, constitutively represses transcription, and blocks the fate switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rebay and Rubin, 1995</xref>). By contrast, insufficient repressive activity involving Yan permits the inappropriate induction of gene expression programs with ensuing ectopic fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai and Rubin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rogge et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Two motifs mediate Yan’s protein<bold>–</bold>DNA and protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions to organize its functions and dynamics: the ETS DNA-binding domain and the sterile alpha motif (SAM). The ETS domain binds to DNA motifs with a core GGAA/T sequence and also provides a nuclear localization sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>). An intriguing feature of the Yan SAM is that the isolated domain forms long helical polymers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>). How SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM interaction affinity shapes the distribution of polymer length to ensure proper regulation of Yan targets in vivo is not well understood. Mutations that completely block SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM association and limit Yan to a monomeric state abrogate Yan's repressive ability and show strong loss-of-function phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>). Mutations that restrict Yan to dimers have close-to-wildtype function, although higher-order Yan complexes exist in cells and can influence repressive output at certain target enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a recent modeling effort by our group predicted that longer TF polymers are less able to discriminate specific versus non-specific DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hope et al., 2017</xref>), whereas dissection of the regulatory syntax of a classic Yan target enhancer suggests that an intricate balance of site affinity and spacing is necessary for proper function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lachance et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these results hint that the strength of Yan self-association must be calibrated to balance DNA occupancy, binding site specificity and repressive output.</p><p>In this study, we combined computational and experimental strategies to explore how increasing Yan’s protein<bold>–</bold>protein interaction affinity impacts its DNA occupancy and repressive function. First, mathematical modeling uncovered a regime of affinity in which strong SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM interactions drive the sequestration of Yan complexes away from DNA. To test this prediction, we exploited structural conservation between Yan and its human ortholog TEL/ETV6 in order to identify four residues whose substitution increased Yan SAM affinity over four orders of magnitude. Increasing SAM affinity impaired Yan’s repressive activity and function, and strikingly redistributed Yan into punctate structures in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition to these global effects, cellular analysis of high-affinity Yan<bold>–</bold>SAM mutants in the eye uncovered a novel <italic>yan</italic> loss-of-function phenotype, which we propose reveals different requirements for Yan polymerization at different target genes. Taken together, our results suggest that a spectacular range of affinities lies latent within the SAM, and that these affinities must be tuned to preserve transcriptional repression and biological function during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modeling Yan DNA occupancy predicts a requirement for tuned protein<bold>–</bold>protein interaction affinities to limit off-DNA aggregation</title><p>To explore the functional consequences of altering TF protein<bold>–</bold>protein interactions, we first updated our in silico model of Yan occupancy on DNA at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hope et al., 2017</xref>) to also consider oligomerization off DNA. Briefly, the published model calculates DNA occupancy using four parameters: the strengths of sequence-specific DNA binding, non-specific DNA binding, and polymerization, as well as the concentration of Yan. The model is then parameterized using measured values of these affinities from Yan and other ETS-family TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De et al., 2014</xref>). Given that isolated SAM domains are sufficient to undergo polymerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>), it is likely that SAM-mediated self-association of Yan occurs both on and off DNA, and that competition for Yan molecules between the two pools could be a key feature that shapes Yan DNA occupancy, and ultimately repression.</p><p>To incorporate this behavior, we reassessed Yan occupancy using the dual approach of calculating ‘on-DNA’ microstates as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hope et al., 2017</xref>) while also treating the distribution of off-DNA polymers analytically (see 'Materials and methods'). A key assumption of the approach is that smaller-order Yan species can diffuse effectively in order to bind their targets on DNA, but as Yan oligomers increase in size, the inverse relationship between particle size and diffusion rate, as described by the Stokes–Einstein relation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berg and von Hippel, 1985</xref>), will eventually prevent diffusion and DNA binding. Although there have been no direct measurements of Yan diffusion rates on a precise polymer-species basis, differences in bulk diffusion rates have been observed in vivo for Yan wildtype, monomers, and dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we assume that at some limiting size of Yan polymer, the diffusion rate will be substantially attenuated.</p><p>The results of the calculation predict that Yan fractional occupancy will differ substantially when polymerization on- and off-DNA is considered versus when only on-DNA polymerization is allowed. To show this, we calculated fractional occupancy for a single ETS site in a larger element for three values of Yan SAM affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In the case of wildtype Yan SAM affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), fractional occupancy at ETS sites was predicted to be almost the same at lower concentrations of Yan, regardless of off-DNA polymerization. However, at higher concentrations of Yan, the calculation that included polymerization off of DNA predicted a drop in occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, black solid curve), whereas that in which only on-DNA polymerization was permitted predicted sustained high occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, grey dashed curve). This trend held true when SAM affinity was either decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), although the concentration at which the two curves diverged shifted. When SAM affinity was weaker, a greater concentration of Yan was required to achieve substantial fractional occupancy, and vice versa for stronger SAM affinity. Despite these distinctions, all three calculations revealed a regime in which fractional occupancy becomes attenuated by off-DNA polymerization.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37545.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Equilibrium modeling shows that increasing polymerization affinity decreases Yan’s DNA occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Fractional occupancy of Yan for given values of self-association as a function of concentration.

The results show that for any given SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM affinity, there was a defined range of Yan concentration capable of producing substantial occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, black vertical bars), and that as SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM affinity increased, this range narrowed and shifted to a progressively lower Yan concentration. For example, low values of self-association affinity (0 to −5 kcal/mol) produced occupancy only at the high end of the physiological Yan concentration range, whereas increased self-association strength (−10 to −14 kcal/mol) permitted occupancy only at sub-physiological Yan concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue shading). Thus in contrast to the previous model’s prediction that increasing Yan concentration will drive saturated DNA binding across the SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM affinity range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hope et al., 2017</xref>), the incorporation of off-DNA polymerization suggests this will only occur under regimes of moderate self-association where adequate pools of lower-order Yan species remain available to bind DNA.</p><p>For simplicity in these calculations, we considered only Yan monomers to be capable of nucleating DNA-bound complexes. To test how this assumption impacted the results, we performed control calculations in which species up to trimers were allowed to search and bind DNA. Similar trends were revealed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Providing further validation to our assumption, prior work has found that Yan monomers show genome-wide chromatin occupancy patterns that are similar to those of wildtype polymerization-competent Yan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>), although repressive function is compromised. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that monomerizing mutations in the SAM domain, which is outside of the DNA-binding ETS domain, do not alter Yan’s DNA binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>). Together, these data suggest that smaller-order Yan species are likely to nucleate DNA-bound complexes in vivo, as we have modeled in silico.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A screen for Yan mutants that increase SAM-SAM affinity</title><p>Our model predicted that a wide range of polymerization affinities can support occupancy at target enhancers, but that extreme values of SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM affinity are likely to preclude the formation of functional regulatory complexes. Previous experimental work confirms this at the low end of the affinity spectrum, as mutations that prevent the SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM interaction in Yan produce strong loss-of-function phenotypes owing to impaired regulation of target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>). However the second prediction of the tuning hypothesis, that increased SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM affinity will also be deleterious to Yan function, remains untested.</p><p>To engineer Yan mutants with increased affinity, we capitalized on the three orders of magnitude difference that has been measured for the Yan SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM interaction versus that of its human counterpart TEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>). We reasoned that of the 22 residues at the SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM interface in the TEL crystal structure, the nine that were divergent between TEL and Yan were probably responsible for this affinity difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Four of the nine clustered in a small region at the periphery of the SAM<bold>–</bold>SAM interface, and three of these made salt-bridge contacts that span that interface. Mutating a subset of these residues had previously been shown to decrease TEL’s polymerization affinity in vitro and to block the transformation ability of TEL oncogenic fusions in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cetinbas et al., 2013</xref>).

Purifying SAMs fused to a super-negative GFP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>), which imparts a standard amount of charge to each SAM molecule, allows separation by polymer size and direct visualization on a native PAGE gel (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We included two controls as reference points to mark the lower and upper limits of polymerization: an unequal mixture of two monomeric forms of TEL SAM (TEL A93E and TEL V112E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2001</xref>) to indicate the mobility of monomers and dimers, and the wildtype TEL SAM to show the limited migration of higher-order polymers. The wild type Yan SAM domain ran primarily as monomers and dimers, with some high-order species, consistent with its low μM affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The mobility shifts observed in the negGFP native gel assay identified Yan SAM variants that matched and exceeded the polymerization strength of TEL SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although two individual mutants, R92K and G96R, modulated mobility on their own (YT7 and YT8, respectively), multiple mutations were required for greater shifts, with simultaneous mutation of all four residues (YT15) surpassing the extent of polymerization by TEL SAM. Three of the mutant SAMs, designated YT1–3, migrated with mobilities that were indistinguishable from that of the wildtype Yan SAM. The next five (YT4–8) shifted mobility toward the dimer form, whereas YT9–11 exhibited a gradation of reduced mobility. Finally, YT12–14 showed mobility indistinguishable from that of TEL SAM, and YT15 migrated even more slowly.</p><p>To measure these affinities quantitatively, we turned to pair-wise Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. We selected five mutants whose native gel mobility suggested that they spanned the full affinity range: YT8, YT10, YT12, YT13, and YT15, which we refer to as SuperYan (SY) 1 – 5, respectively. Following the published strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiao et al., 2004</xref>), we blocked higher-order polymerization by introducing the monomerizing mutations, A86D and V105R, into each SY construct and then measured the affinity between each SY monomer pair; native gels confirmed that each protein ran as a monomer alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The K<sub>d</sub>s measured by SPR followed the rank order predicted by the native gel shift assay and revealed that four orders of magnitude separate the binding affinities of wildtype Yan and SY5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Striking differences were noted. First, overall Yan levels appeared increased in the SuperYan mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>); using SY4 as the example, a side-by-side quantification in mitotic clones confirmed ~50% increases in both total and nuclear levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Second and more striking, the density of punctal structures increased 10 – 20 fold for SuperYan mutants when compared to wildtype Yan, with the phenotype most pronounced in SY5, the highest-affinity SAM mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). Thus in contrast to wildtype control discs in which Yan localized diffusely throughout the nucleus, with only a few puncta detected in nuclei closest to the morphogenetic furrow where Yan levels are highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), in the <italic>yan<sup>SY</sup></italic> mutants, punctal structures were detected throughout the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). This cellular phenotype matches the modeling predictions of a loss of function resulting from a sequestration mechanism in which the excessive off-DNA aggregation of SuperYan reduces productive binding to target enhancers.

First, because <italic>yan<sup>SY</sup></italic> alleles are fully recessive, we predicted wildtype subcellular localization in the heterozygote. Consistent with expectations, the extent of punctal formation in discs from heterozygous animals carrying one copy of <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic> and one copy of wildtype <italic>yan</italic> was dramatically lower than that in discs from <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and showed a modest increase when compared to the frequency of puncta in disks from wildtype homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In light of our detection of Yan<bold>–</bold>SY co-complexes in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), we interpret this result to mean that endogenous Yan can effectively intercalate into SY polymers, and that this capping effect limits polymerization-driven puncta formation. This then restores an adequate pool of Yan for proper transcriptional regulation, resulting in normal development. Second, given that MAPK directly phosphorylates Yan in close proximity to the SAM domain to attenuate repressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rebay and Rubin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tootle et al., 2003</xref>), we asked whether overexpression of <italic>rolled</italic> (<italic>rl</italic>) <italic>sevenmaker</italic> (SEM), a hyperactive form of MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunner et al., 1994</xref>), could reduce puncta formation.

Robust enrichment was seen in the wildtype, validating <italic>salm</italic> as a bone fide Yan-bound gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Strikingly, SY5 occupancy at <italic>salm</italic> was less than half that measured for wild type Yan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), suggesting that Yan binding at regions associated with <italic>salm</italic> is sensitive to the polymerization state of Yan.

Failure to detect Yan occupancy at <italic>pros</italic> at the validated enhancer suggests that Yan binding may be either transient and/or occur in only a small number of cells, making the signal too weak to distinguish in a disc-wide analysis.</p><p>Because the majority of <italic>yan<sup>SY3–5</sup></italic> animals survive to adulthood, most Yan targets must be adequately regulated, and by extension normally bound, by SY.

Feedback regulation at <italic>aop</italic> is also presumably used throughout development, and MACS-called peaks at <italic>aop</italic> are some of the most enriched genome wide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>).

Together, these data suggest that regulatory complexes that are needed for proper occupancy and regulation of <italic>salm</italic> are less likely to form when SAM affinity is strong, whereas adequate regulatory complexes can still assemble at <italic>aos</italic> and <italic>aop</italic>, and perhaps at most target genes.</p><p>To confirm the reduced ability of SY5 to bind and repress the <italic>salm</italic> element, we placed it upstream of a luciferase cassette and performed transcription assays in cultured cells.

Our results support a loss-of-function by sequestration model in which increased SAM–SAM affinity drives excessive off-DNA self-association, thereby limiting Yan’s ability to form effective regulatory complexes at its target enhancers. Focusing on the developing eye, although both very low- and very high-affinity SAM mutants produce <italic>yan</italic> loss-of-function phenotypes, the patterns of the photoreceptor specification defects are distinct. We propose that different distributions of Yan polymeric species regulate different target genes and hence different cell fates, and that tuning SAM–SAM affinity to a middle regime optimizes these requirements.</p><p>Our results highlight a fundamental principle for the operation of TFs during development, which is that protein–protein interaction affinity must be tuned through evolution to balance robust occupancy of transcriptional complexes with the ability to assemble those complexes in the first place. A priori it was possible to hypothesize that TF protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions operate independently, with the former required for finding the correct genomic binding sites and the latter stabilizing DNA-bound complexes. This view predicts gain-of-function behavior from mutations that increase protein–protein interaction affinity, with more stable transcriptional complexes exerting stronger effects on RNA polymerase. Instead, we find that the SuperYan (<italic>yan<sup>SY</sup></italic>) alleles exhibit loss-of-function behaviors that we propose are the result of impaired ability to form functional transcriptional complexes at appropriate DNA sites. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increase in self-association affinity shifts the distribution of Yan polymer species in vivo, thus depleting (but not abolishing) Yan complexes of the correct size for target gene repression and resulting in the observed hypomorph phenotypes.</p><p>Although our experiments focused on a polymerizing TF, we expect that the requirement for tuned protein–protein interaction affinity will extend to many TFs, including those that do not polymerize. Our reasoning relies on three observations. First, although TF polymerization is a relatively uncommon behavior, many TFs operate as obligate dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funnell and Crossley, 2012</xref>). For these, protein interaction affinity will probably impact specificity and output, just as it does with Yan. Second, even for monomeric TFs, because of the fact that transcriptional regulatory complexes are dominated by combinatorial TF binding during eukaryotic development, heterotypic interactions between different TFs are common and critical to regulatory output. Third, TFs are used iteratively to regulate many different genes throughout development, with each TF participating in different complexes at different target enhancers. In all of these scenarios, we predict that homo- and heterotypic interaction affinities must be tuned to optimize transcriptional regulatory fidelity across enhancers. Mutations that shift this balance thus have the potential to change dramatically the landscape of competition and collaboration between TFs at different enhancers. In extreme cases, excessive affinity will increase off-DNA TF interactions, thus slowing diffusion and hampering the search for target sites on DNA. Thus, although the polymerization of TFs such as Yan may have a dramatic effect on their tuned protein–protein interaction affinity, we expect that many other TFs navigate similar tradeoffs during development.</p><p>Recent advances in imaging techniques have highlighted the dynamic nature of transcriptional complex assembly in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morisaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loffreda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paakinaho et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, eukaryotic TFs rely heavily on 3D diffusion to assemble regulatory complexes in the crowded environment of the nucleus, with transient chromatin associations predominating over stable interactions with specific DNA binding sites. Interpreting our results in this context, SAM–SAM interaction affinity must be tuned to maximize success in both the stochastic search for target enhancers and the assembly of appropriately labile yet functional repressive complexes at those elements. Specifically, strong SAM–SAM affinity should increase the proportion of time that a given SuperYan molecule spends in higher-order complexes, thereby limiting the effectiveness of a diffusion-based search. When Yan is limited to a monomeric state, genome-wide chromatin occupancy patterns appear largely unperturbed, at least as visualized in bulk assays from many cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>), yet repressive output is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that in the absence of SAM-mediated self-association, despite effective diffusion and search behavior, the residence time of DNA-bound Yan molecules is insufficient to form stable transcriptional complexes. Single-cell- and single-molecule-based comparisons of the diffusion, DNA binding, and repressive activity of Yan across the SAM-affinity spectrum will be needed to explore these ideas further.</p><p>Despite the difficulties of directly observing polymerized Yan complexes in vivo, the distinct patterns of photoreceptor-specification defects in low- versus high-affinity <italic>yan</italic> mutants provide important hints as to how Yan polymerization may be used to regulate distinct target genes. Focusing on the regulation of target genes relevant to R7 fate specification, and regulation of the R3/R4 determinant <italic>spalt major</italic> (<italic>salm</italic>) (a novel direct Yan target identified in this study), we speculate that there may be context-specific requirements for polymerization. We propose that target genes whose regulation requires lower-order Yan species will be compromised most by increasing SAM–SAM affinity, whereas those that require higher-order species will be most sensitive to reductions in affinity. Our data suggest that genes that are involved in R3/R4 specification, such as <italic>salm</italic>, belong to the first category, whereas those that are important for R7 fate fall into the second. In other words, the shift in mean size distribution toward larger species that are associated with the <italic>yan<sup>SY</sup></italic> alleles results in insufficient smaller-order species to repress R3/4 elements, but sufficient higher-order polymers to regulate R7 elements. The reduced SY occupancy detected at <italic>salm</italic> supports the first assumption, but unfortunately the lack of ChIP sensitivity at <italic>pros</italic> precluded us from testing the second. At the other end of the affinity spectrum, we suggest that the complete loss of SAM–SAM self-association in Yan monomers prevents the formation of the higher-order complexes that are required to repress R7 regulatory elements. For R3/R4 regulation, SAM-independent associations between Yan monomers, perhaps mediated by heterologous interactions with other TFs, must be largely adequate for repression. This model also explains the strong derepression of R7 fate noted in <italic>yan</italic> hypomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai and Rubin, 1992</xref>), as global Yan depletion should preferentially impact regulation at elements that require higher-order species, because by definition, higher Yan levels are needed to form such complexes.</p><p>Below, we discuss two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms that could produce these distinct modes of Yan-mediated regulation: regulatory grammar and signaling environment. In the first case, we envision that different regulatory elements will require Yan oligomers of different lengths to repress transcription, with the specific preferences encoded by the arrangement of TF binding sites. In the second case, we speculate that cell-to-cell signaling could modulate the polymerization of Yan to bias the distribution toward longer or shorter oligomers, as needed in the particular context.</p><p>In the case of differential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA elements, we speculate that the regulatory grammar that produces target-gene-specific differences in Yan occupancy could be as simple as using heterotypic versus homotypic binding sites, which would facilitate smaller and larger Yan complexes, respectively. Previous studies have noted the importance of tandem or multiple ETS sites in Yan regulation of classic target genes such as <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lachance et al., 2017</xref>), as well as enrichment for binding motifs of other TFs such as Mothers against Dpp (Mad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webber et al., 2013</xref>), hinting that Yan may participate in both hetero- and homotypic complexes depending on the format of the element in question. In addition to Mad, we speculate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> AP-1 TFs <italic>kayak</italic> and <italic>jun-related antigen</italic> might also play key roles in setting up heterotypic Yan complexes, as <italic>kayak</italic> has a critical role in establishing R3/4 fate and these factors genetically interact with <italic>yan</italic> and <italic>pnt</italic> in R3/4-dependent planar cell polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 2008</xref>). Given the extensive evidence of physical associations between AP-1 TFs and ETS family factors in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2000</xref>), these are prime candidates for exploration in the context of the <italic>yan<sup>SY</sup></italic> mutants.</p><p>The second mechanism that may enforce the differential regulation of target genes could stem from the different signaling levels across cell types. For example, in R7 precursors, which experience higher levels of RTK signaling than other photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman, 1996</xref>), activated MAPK may more effectively phosphorylate and disrupt SY polymers, thus shifting Yan towards a more wildtype distribution, whereas the lower RTK signaling associated with R3/4 specification would be unable to do so. Consistent with this, overexpression of <italic>rl</italic><sup>SEM</sup> reduced SY puncta, suggesting that RTK signaling can directly modulate polymerization, with the assumption that the prevalence of puncta correlates positively with Yan polymerization. Given that one of the most important MAPK phosphorylation sites in Yan is immediately adjacent to the SAM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rebay and Rubin, 1995</xref>), we speculate that this site might be properly positioned to either destabilize Yan polymerization or prevent additional polymerization once phosphorylated.</p><p>Further experiments will be required to determine the extent to which these two mechanisms contribute to Yan’s context-specific regulation of gene expression, but our mathematical models offer some insight into the role of DNA target recognition. Our previous work suggested that the extent of on-DNA polymerization is a trade-off between occupancy and specificity, with dimers best distinguishing specific from non-specific DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hope et al., 2017</xref>). As SAM affinity strengthens, the model predicts that higher-order Yan polymers will spread repression into non-specific DNA sites, producing gain-of-function effects. By contrast, the model presented in this study suggests that off-DNA polymerization can provide an effective buffering mechanism to prevent such gain-of-function effects and that in the extreme case of very strong SAM affinity, as exemplified by the SY alleles, it can actually reduce DNA occupancy to drive loss-of-function effects.</p><p>Even though the original model that considers only on-DNA polymerization cannot explain the loss-of-function phenotypes of SY mutants, it still provides useful insight into the different repressive complexes that may underlie the R7 versus R3/R4 cell-type specific sensitivity to SY. Specifically, we speculate that Yan may utilize both smaller and larger species to accomplish different goals with respect to repression. Specifically, the accurate recognition and repression of a single enhancer site, such as the one identified at <italic>salm</italic>, may rely on monomers or lower-order oligomers, whereas coordinated repression across a locus with broader patterns of occupancy, such as <italic>aos</italic> or <italic>aop</italic>, may require longer polymers. This idea is consistent with our prior work that demonstrated that although Yan monomers have an overall ‘wildtype’ DNA occupancy pattern, the density with which peaks clustered across extensively occupied loci such as <italic>aos</italic> and <italic>aop</italic> was reduced. Deeper mechanistic understanding of how polymerization impacts the context-specificity of Yan DNA binding and repression will require both further mathematical modeling to incorporate heterotypic interactions with other TFs and high-resolution genome-wide occupancy studies.</p><p>If Yan requires micromolar SAM–SAM affinity for normal function and regulation across a range of signaling environments, then how does its human counterpart TEL operate with nanomolar affinity? One possibility is that TEL evolved a dramatically stronger protein–protein affinity because of the need to form stronger regulatory complexes, either because of the larger size of the mammalian genome or the greater number of co-expressed, competitive ETS factors therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, TEL could be expressed at much lower levels than Yan, thereby limiting off-DNA aggregation while requiring stronger affinity for effective repression. Finally, heterotypic interactions, for example association with the ETS factor FLI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwiatkowski et al., 1998</xref>) or post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation by MAPK or sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wood et al., 2003</xref>), could moderate affinity to limit off-DNA polymerization. It is also possible that TEL polymerizes extensively off-DNA and that this polymerization provides a regulatory strategy that moderates the extent of on-DNA binding and repression. It should also be noted that SY5 exhibited sub-nanomolar affinity and migrated slower than the TEL SAM in the native gel assay, and so even though TEL polymerization is quite strong, it is still tuned to sub-maximal affinity.</p><p>From a structural perspective, our in vitro results emphasize the importance of charged residues at the periphery of the SAM–SAM interface in determining affinity. Previously, mutation of TEL residues K99, E100, and R103 (Yan residues R92, A93, R96) was shown to reduce both TEL polymerization in vitro and the transforming potential of the TEL-NTRK3 oncogenic fusion protein in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cetinbas et al., 2013</xref>). Our results confirm the importance of these three residues to high-affinity polymerization and add Yan H97Y to the suite of residues that control SAM–SAM interactions. In addition, we note that SY5 is the strongest quantitatively measured SAM–SAM interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowie and Qiao, 2005</xref>), which suggests evolutionary selection against sub-nanomolar affinities, presumably to prevent excessive self-aggregation.</p><p>Last, it is interesting to consider Yan polymerization in the context of the phase separation model for transcriptional control that has been proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the assembly of proteins into dynamic aggregates known as membrane-less organelles, or liquid-like droplets, is thought to provide a general regulatory strategy for organizing and partitioning specific biochemical reactions and functions within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaganovich, 2017</xref>). It has been proposed that phase separation of TF complexes could underlie many aspects of transcriptional regulation, including super-enhancer formation and function, transcriptional bursting and long-range interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that Yan may participate in granule-like complexes, and that SY could have an increased propensity to phase-separate when off-DNA. In support of this idea, nuclear puncta are detected with wildtype Yan, although not nearly as frequently as with SY. Furthermore, low-complexity domains or intrinsically disordered regions are especially important for phase-separation behavior and are frequently enriched in TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Staby et al., 2017</xref>), including Yan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai and Rubin, 1992</xref>).

High-resolution live imaging and biochemistry will be necessary to assess whether the sub-nuclear dynamics of Yan and SuperYan match expectations for phase-separated complexes and how this impacts the context-specific repression of target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Modeling of Yan fractional occupancy</title><p>Fractional occupancy of Yan was calculated largely in accordance to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hope et al., 2017</xref>), which use an equilibrium approach that depends solely on the affinities of protein–DNA and SAM–SAM affinity, as well as on the concentration of Yan and size of DNA element. For all calculations, the size of the element was set to 24 sites, with a single ETS site in the first position, followed by 23 non-specific DNA sites. For clarity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> show fractional occupancy just at the single ETS site. In addition, the wildtype values of Yan-specific and -non-specific protein–DNA affinity used to calculate Yan occupancy previously (α<sub>wt</sub> and β<sub>wt</sub>) were set to −9.955 kcal/mol and −5.837 kcal/mol, respectively, for all calculations.</p><p>The modification of the model to account for polymerization off of DNA takes the form of a multiplier on the effective concentration of free Yan to bind DNA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Steve Gisselbrecht (Reviewer #1). Two other reviewers remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting case study of a polymerizing transcription factor (Yan) in a developmental system with relevance to human cancer (TEL), where the function of monomeric, dimeric, higher-order polymer filaments is unknown. The authors create Super-Yan mutants (SY) with increasing protein-protein affinity to characterize the biochemistry, gene dosage effects (homo/heterozygote, overexpression), and phenotypes of different Yan alleles. The data in this paper are of high quality and the conclusions are well justified by the data. The paper brings out some interesting ideas about the role of protein-protein interactions in regulating binding site occupancy and specificity.</p><p>Overall, it was felt that the authors really should integrate mathematical modeling with their data to address Yan mechanism and function. Their previous model (Hope et al., 2017) suggested that Yan polymerization on DNA better repressed transcription (thus, higher affinity equals stronger repression). Here, they consider an alternative where cytoplasmic Yan polymer sequesters monomers away from DNA (thus, higher affinity equals weaker repression). Each mechanism alone or in combination will exhibit different quantitative responses to allele concentration and affinities, which the authors have measured. It should be possible for the authors to update their model to include multiple Yan alleles (diploid genetics) and measured protein-protein affinities (k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>off</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>) of these alleles. Their model, if correct, should be able to quantitatively explain the collective data (monomeric Yan, wild-type Yan, Super-Yan alleles in homo-/ heterozygote, overexpression strains).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The hypomorphic and recessive nature of SY alleles (despite a 10000x increase in SY-SY affinity) is surprising, which suggests the current model (Hope et al., 2017) is incomplete or wrong. What is the affinity of WT and SY allele for each other? What happens to Yan polymerization and repression in a heterozygote in the mathematical model and experiments?</p><p>2) The modeling relies on an assumption about which oligomer species can bind DNA. The sentence in the second paragraph of the subsection “Modeling Yan DNA occupancy predicts a requirement for tuned protein-protein interaction affinities to limit off-DNA aggregation”, which states that the assumption that only monomers can find their DNA binding sites is supported by the observation that monomeric species bind substantially the same sites as those that can oligomerize, does not seem to obviously follow. Can the model address this monomer binding assumption and the observation that monomeric Yan species bind the same sites as wild-type Yan that can polymerize, but not repress?</p><p>3) A more detailed explanation of the assumptions that went into the equilibrium modeling is needed. It is not obvious why there should be both an upper and a lower bound on the concentration of Yan that will allow 50% or greater binding site occupancy and why both of these bounds should be dependent on SAM-SAM affinity. Perhaps graphs of binding site occupancy as a function of Yan concentration for different SAM-SAM affinities would be useful.</p><p>4) In addition to showing the Yan SAM-SAM affinity on the graph in Figure 1, it would be interesting to see the where the SAM-SAM affinities for the various SuperYan mutants fall (especially the three that were used in the genetic analysis).</p><p>5) The authors suggest two different models to explain the differential effects of monomeric and SuperYan mutants on R3/4 vs. R7 fate. In the second model, they propose that different levels of Ras signaling in the two cell types results in differential ability to disrupt Yan oligomerization. Is there, in fact, evidence that Ras signaling disrupts Yan oligomerization? Is this something that the authors could examine, perhaps using the S2 cell system in conjunction with the SuperYan mutants?</p><p>6) Are there candidate Yan target genes responsible for the ability of Yan to suppress the R3/4 fate and other target genes responsible for the ability of Yan to suppress the R7 fate. If so, would it be possible to test the predictions that the authors make regarding the effect of SuperYan mutations on the occupancy of these genes either by in silico modeling or by Yan ChIP?</p><p>7) The vast majority of transcription factors do not contain polymerization domains such as the SAM domain. Do the authors believe that the findings presented here about tuned protein-protein interactions are only relevant to the small subset of factors that contain polymerization domains? Or do they believe that the findings can be generalized to other types of transcription factors? This is something that should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37545.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The hypomorphic and recessive nature of SY alleles (despite a 10000x increase in SY-SY affinity) is surprising, which suggests the current model (Hope et al., 2017) is incomplete or wrong.

The key assumption of that original model was that Yan polymerization only occurs on DNA. Using that simple premise, higher affinity was predicted to promote Yan occupancy and repression, in essence producing gain-of-function effects. By considering only DNA-bound complexes, the original model ignored the non-DNA bound pool of transcription factor from which regulatory DNA-bound complexes are assembled. In this paper we present a revised model that also considers off-DNA polymerization.</p><p>To clarify the differences in the predictions that these two models make, we have expanded Figure 1. Panels 1A-C have been added to compare the predictions of the two models under wild type, weak or strong SAM affinity. The key difference emerges when considering strong SAM affinity (1C). While the original model predicts high occupancy, the new model predicts the opposite, namely a loss of DNA occupancy, and hence loss-of-function. These polar opposite predictions set the perfect stage for the experimental analysis presented in the rest of the paper. In brief, the project was designed to test which model better recapitulates the actual biology. The results are unequivocal – only the new model that has been updated to consider Yan polymerization both on and off of DNA can explain the loss of function behavior of the SuperYan alleles. The striking increase in Yan puncta observed in SuperYan discs appears consistent with the idea that stronger SAM affinity will promote excessive aggregation, thereby precluding the formation of effective transcriptional complexes, although formal proof of the subcellular basis of the SuperYan phenotypes remains a non-trivial task for the future. However, even though the old model does not predict the SuperYan loss-of-function effect, some of its conclusions may still be relevant in considering mechanisms of Yan occupancy and repression at different enhancers. To discuss these points more thoroughly, two new paragraphs have been added to the Discussion (tenth and eleventh paragraphs).</p><p>The reviewers also commented that the recessive nature of the SuperYan alleles was surprising and suggested we consider whether the affinity of the wild type Yan-SuperYan interaction predicts this behavior. To address this point, we first confirmed that Yan and SuperYan can associate in common complexes by performing heterotypic co-immunoprecipitation experiments between wild type Yan and the strongest SuperYan allele SY5. These new results are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and are described in the last paragraph of the subsection “A screen for Yan mutants that increase SAM-SAM affinity”. Second, we examined puncta in <italic>yan/yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic> discs and found although there is measurable 50% increase in the number of puncta per area relative to wild type there is much larger (~8x) reduction relative to <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic> homozygotes (these new data are shown as Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and described in the last paragraph of the subsection “High affinity SAM-SAM interactions promote nuclear and cytoplasmic Yan aggregation”. Assuming puncta reflect SAM-SAM driven aggregates, this argues that wild type Yan effectively interacts with and interrupts SY5 polymers to support wild type function, thereby at least partly explaining why only SY homozygotes have obvious phenotypes. Third, although attempting direct biochemical measurements was beyond the scope of what we felt we could accomplish in the revision period, it is possible to make inferences about Yan-SY affinity from our existing SPR data set because the affinities of WT to SY5 at either the EH or ML surface will differ from our measurements by one mutation. We remind the reviewers that three of the mutations in SY5 (R92K, G96R, and H97Y) are found at the EH surface, while the fourth (A93E) is found at the ML surface. Since the measurement of SY3 affinity as ~10nM has two of the relevant mutations for the WT-SY5 interaction (R92K and G96R) but lacks the third (H97Y), we expect the WT-SY5 interaction to be at least 10nM. Conversely at the ML surface, our measurement of the SY2 interaction has one relevant mutation (A93E) and one extra mutation (G96R), so we expect WT-SY5 affinity to be weaker than the ~60nM measured for SY2. Because of its complexity and detail, we have not included this third point in the revised manuscript, but if the reviewers feel it should be added, we are happy to do so.</p><p>Finally the reviewers suggested that we include heterotypic interaction between Yan and SuperYan in our model. While at one level this would be “easy” to do, the reality is that our current calculations are already straining the memory limit of our computing resources. Consideration of heterotypic and homotypic interactions on DNA would triple the number of microstates to be calculated, making it prohibitively expensive with current computing resources. Thus while we strongly concur with the reviewers that future models must incorporate heterotypic interactions (not just Yan-SY, but also with other transcription factors) doing that will require substantial algorithmic changes to how DNA occupancy is calculated, something we did not feel was a feasible short-term goal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The modeling relies on an assumption about which oligomer species can bind DNA. The sentence in the second paragraph of the subsection “Modeling Yan DNA occupancy predicts a requirement for tuned protein-protein interaction affinities to limit off-DNA aggregation”, which states that the assumption that only monomers can find their DNA binding sites is supported by the observation that monomeric species bind substantially the same sites as those that can oligomerize, does not seem to obviously follow. Can the model address this monomer binding assumption and the observation that monomeric Yan species bind the same sites as wild-type Yan that can polymerize, but not repress?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers request clarification of our assumptions regarding which oligomer species can bind DNA. We have done so (subsection “Modeling Yan DNA occupancy predicts a requirement for tuned protein-protein interaction affinities to limit off-DNA aggregation”, second paragraph). Briefly, as described by the Stokes-Einstein relation, the inverse relationship between particle size and diffusion size means that as Yan oligomers increase in length, diffusion and DNA binding will be reduced and eventually prevented. To elaborate, the assumption that smaller Yan species will be free to diffuse and bind their targets on DNA stems from the equation of 3D diffusion of small particles. The root mean square displacement of a particle is inversely proportional to its size. Therefore as the size of a Yan polymer complex grows larger, the rate of diffusion will shrink until the complex is so large as to prevent Brownian diffusion. We assume this would also preclude binding to target DNA. We do not have an empirical measurement as to what size of Yan polymer would be unable to diffuse, but Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows that if species including monomers, dimers, and trimers are allowed to bind DNA, the results are not substantially different from monomers alone.</p><p>In contrast to Stokes-Einstein based assumptions, the observation that Yan monomers bind the same regions of DNA as wild type Yan, but do not repress effectively, is an empirical one based on genome-wide ChIP data and phenotypic analysis (Webber et al., Genetics 2013) (subsection “Modeling Yan DNA occupancy predicts a requirement for tuned protein-protein interaction affinities to limit off-DNA aggregation”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A more detailed explanation of the assumptions that went into the equilibrium modeling is needed. It is not obvious why there should be both an upper and a lower bound on the concentration of Yan that will allow 50% or greater binding site occupancy and why both of these bounds should be dependent on SAM-SAM affinity. Perhaps graphs of binding site occupancy as a function of Yan concentration for different SAM-SAM affinities would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers recommended we add graphs of occupancy as a function of Yan concentration for different SAM-SAM affinities to clarify the equilibrium modeling results. We have done so. Figure 1A-C now present fractional occupancy curves that clearly show a rise in Yan occupancy, saturation, and then decrease in Yan occupancy, as a function of Yan concentration and SAM-SAM affinity. The results are also described more extensively (subsection “Modeling Yan DNA occupancy predicts a requirement for tuned protein-protein interaction affinities to limit off-DNA aggregation”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In addition to showing the Yan SAM-SAM affinity on the graph in Figure 1, it would be interesting to see the where the SAM-SAM affinities for the various SuperYan mutants fall (especially the three that were used in the genetic analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have marked the affinity of the five SuperYan mutants SY1-5 on the graph in Figure 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest two different models to explain the differential effects of monomeric and SuperYan mutants on R3/4 vs. R7 fate. In the second model, they propose that different levels of Ras signaling in the two cell types results in differential ability to disrupt Yan oligomerization. Is there, in fact, evidence that Ras signaling disrupts Yan oligomerization? Is this something that the authors could examine, perhaps using the S2 cell system in conjunction with the SuperYan mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers asked us to test whether increased Ras signaling disrupts Yan oligomerization. To do so, we overexpressed an activated allele of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAPK, <italic>rolled</italic>, known as <italic>Sevenmaker (rl<sup>SEM</sup></italic>) throughout the developing <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic> eye and then quantified the number of puncta per area. A striking 10-fold decrease relative to <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic>alone was measured, with the number of puncta almost indistinguishable from that measured in a wild type background. This result suggests that the signaling environment can influence the extent of SAM-driven Yan polymerization. These new data are included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D and described in the last paragraph of the subsection “High affinity SAM-SAM interactions promote nuclear and cytoplasmic Yan aggregation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Are there candidate Yan target genes responsible for the ability of Yan to suppress the R3/4 fate and other target genes responsible for the ability of Yan to suppress the R7 fate. If so, would it be possible to test the predictions that the authors make regarding the effect of SuperYan mutations on the occupancy of these genes either by in silico modeling or by Yan ChIP?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers asked whether there are R3/R4-specific Yan targets where we could measure occupancy directly by ChIP. We put significant effort into addressing this point, and have added extensive new data that strongly bolster our argument of context-specific requirements for different Yan polymers. Briefly, we identified <italic>salm</italic>, a known regulator of R3/R4 specification, as a novel direct Yan target, and showed by ChIP that occupancy is reduced in <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic>discs and that a <italic>salm&gt;GFP</italic> reporter transgene (that we generated) is derepressed in <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic>. Control ChIP experiments showed wild type SY5 occupancy at target genes like <italic>argos</italic> and <italic>aop</italic> that are expected to be involved in most Egfr-mediated cell fate decisions, arguing strongly for context-specificity to Yan repressive complexes at different target genes. Finally, although we were unable to detect a ChIP signal at the known R7-specific Yan target <italic>pros</italic>, we showed that in contrast to <italic>salm&gt;GFP,</italic> a <italic>pros&gt;GFP</italic> reporter was not significantly derepressed in <italic>yan<sup>SY5</sup></italic> mutant discs. These new data are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplements 1 and 2 and described in a new Results section titled “Spalt major is a direct target of Yan, and is preferentially sensitive to increased Yan polymerization”. The ChIP experiments were performed by Jemma Webber, who has been added as an author.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The vast majority of transcription factors do not contain polymerization domains such as the SAM domain.
