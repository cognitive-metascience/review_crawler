Peptidoglycan, the principal constituent of virtually all bacterial surfaces, is a specific molecular signature recognized by dedicated host receptors, present in animals and plants, which trigger an immune response. Here we report that autolysins from Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, enzymes capable of hydrolyzing peptidoglycan, have a major role in concealing this inflammatory molecule from <italic>Drosophila</italic> peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). We show that autolysins trim the outermost peptidoglycan fragments and that in their absence bacterial virulence is impaired, as PGRPs can directly recognize leftover peptidoglycan extending beyond the external layers of bacterial proteins and polysaccharides. The activity of autolysins is not restricted to the producer cells but can also alter the surface of neighboring bacteria, facilitating the survival of the entire population in the infected host.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02277.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02277.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02277.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>While most bacteria are harmless, some can cause diseases as varied as food poisoning and meningitis, so our immune system has developed various ways of detecting and eliminating bacteria and other pathogens. Receptor proteins belonging to the immune system detect molecules that give away the presence of the bacteria and trigger an immune response targeted at the invading pathogen.</p><p>Peptidoglycan is one telltale molecule that betrays the presence of bacteria. Peptidoglycan is found in the bacterial cell wall, and for many years it was assumed that the immune system detected stray fragments of peptidoglycan that were accidentally shed by the bacteria. However, it was later shown that the immune system could, under certain conditions, detect peptidoglycan when it is still part of the cell wall. This raised an interesting question: do bacteria use other methods to stop peptidoglycan being detected by the immune system?</p><p>Now, Atilano, Pereira et al. have found that enzymes called autolysins can conceal bacteria from the receptor proteins that detect peptidoglycan. These enzymes are needed to break the bonds within the peptidoglycan present in the rigid bacterial cell wall to allow the bacteria to grow and divide. ‘Knocking out’ the genes for autolysins allowed the receptor proteins from the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, to bind to the bacteria; however, the mutant bacteria were able to evade the immune system after they had been treated with the purified enzymes.</p><p>Atilano, Pereira et al. suggest that the autolysins trim the exposed ends of the peptidoglycan molecules on the surface of the cell wall, which could otherwise be detected by the host. The experiments also show that bacterial pathogens—including a strain of MRSA—with mutations that knock out autolysin activity trigger a stronger immune response in fruit flies, and are therefore less able to infect this host. Autolysins also help to conceal <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>—a bacterial pathogen that is a common cause of pneumonia and infant deaths in developing countries—from detection by fruit flies.</p><p>The findings of Atilano, Pereira et al. highlight how bacteria employ a number of ways to evade detection. If similar behavior is observed when bacteria infect humans, autolysins could represent a new drug target for the treatment of bacterial diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

macromolecule composed of long glycan strands, cross-linked by short peptides, which surrounds most bacterial cells and forms a load-bearing mesh that sustains their shape. Enlargement and remodeling of the PGN mesh during bacterial growth and division requires not only the synthesis of new material, catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), but also PGN hydrolysis to allow insertion of new material, carried out by PGN autolysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite its essential role, PGN may also be viewed as an ‘Achilles heel’ of bacteria during infection, as different hosts have specialized receptors that recognize PGN as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and initiate an inflammatory response to eliminate invading bacteria. Examples of these receptors include LysM proteins in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>), intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaput and Boneca, 2007</xref>), and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) in insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dziarski and Gupta, 2006</xref>).</p><p>PGRPs, originally isolated due to their high affinity to PGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 1998</xref>), are used by <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies to distinguish between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, directly at the level of PGN detection. This is achieved through specific PGRPs: PGRP-LC specifically recognizes DAP-type PGN, usually found in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacilli, and activates the Imd pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leulier et al., 2003</xref>), while PGRP-SA recognizes lysine-type PGN, which surrounds most Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the Toll pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). Activation of either pathway results in a series of multiple defense reactions that include the production and secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>). In mammals, PGRPs can act as antibacterial agents due to their bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic activity, mediated by PGN hydrolytic activity (e.g. PGLYRP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dziarski and Gupta, 2006</xref>]) or by the binding of PGRPs to targets on the bacterial cell surface, which causes the activation of specific bacterial two-component systems, resulting in bacteria killing through a mechanism that includes membrane depolarization and production of hydroxyl radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashyap et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial PGN is concealed by an outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, or by layers of proteins and glycopolymers in Gram-positive bacteria. It is therefore usually assumed that an infected organism only recognizes PGN in the form of fragments released into the surrounding medium by the activity of different bacterial or host enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nigro et al., 2008</xref>). However, it has been recently shown that PGRP-SA can directly bind PGN at the bacterial surface in conditions such as the absence of wall teichoic acids (WTAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atilano et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that bacteria may have developed different strategies to prevent host receptors from binding PGN on the bacterial surface, thus avoiding detection by the host innate immune system.</p><p>In order to look for molecules with a role in preventing bacterial recognition by the host, we used PGRP-SA, a host receptor circulating in the hemolymph of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, to test if specific proteins involved in the metabolism of bacterial cell wall were required to conceal the PGN at the surface of the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. We have identified the major autolysin Atl as an essential protein for concealing the bacterial PGN at the cell surface from host detection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PGN hydrolytic enzymatic activities encoded by the <italic>atl</italic> gene are required to conceal <italic>S. aureus</italic> from Drosophila PGN receptor PGRP-SA</title><p>In order to identify factors that Gram-positive bacteria use to conceal their PGN present at the bacterial cell surface from host recognition, we have constructed <italic>S. aureus</italic> null mutants lacking non-essential genes involved in PGN metabolism and determined the ability of a fluorescent derivative of PGRP-SA (mCherry_PGRP-SA) to bind to their surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

(1) <italic>S. aureus</italic> wild type bacteria produce amidases that cleave the stem peptide moiety of soluble PGN fragments.

In contrast, the <italic>atl</italic> mutant would release intact muropeptides, easily detected by PGRP-SA, and therefore would be unable to evade detection by the innate immune system. (2) Amidases produced by <italic>S. aureus</italic> wild type bacteria would shave and remove the most accessible PGN fragments at the surface of bacteria, eliminating the binding sites for PGRPs. As the <italic>atl</italic> mutant does not produce the Atl amidase, it would have extending PGN fragments at its surface, which would be easily detected by PGRP-SA, inducing an immune response.</p><p>If the first hypothesis is correct, inactivation of the amidase activity, but not of the glucosaminidase (which cleaves the glycans and therefore releases intact, inflammatory PGN fragments), should result in decreased virulence. Alternatively, if the second hypothesis is mainly correct, inactivation of either the amidase or the glucosaminidase activity should result in decreased virulence, as both activities can remove fragments of detectable PGN (containing peptides) from the bacterial surface. We therefore tested the virulence of bacteria with either impaired amidase activity (AM<sup>H265A</sup>) or impaired glucosaminidase activity (GL<sup>E1128A</sup>) and observed that both had a reduced ability to kill flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) in accordance with the second hypothesis.

Nevertheless, the amount of PGRP-SA present at the surface of the injected bacteria may not have been sufficient to result in full complementation of the ability of <italic>seml</italic> flies to survive infection.

We have previously shown that the presence of glycopolymers, such as WTAs, at the bacterial surface contributes to <italic>S. aureus</italic> evasion from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atilano et al., 2011</xref>). We now show that Atl also protects bacteria from host recognition but by a different mechanism, given that simultaneous deletion of <italic>tagO</italic> (essential for teichoic acid biosynthesis) and <italic>atl</italic> had a synergistic effect on exposing the surface PGN to host recognition, when compared to individual deletion of each of these genes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. This new role for Atl is in accordance with previous reports that have shown in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> infection model that <italic>S. aureus atl</italic> mutants are impaired in their virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tabuchi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial autolysins, or murein hydrolases, are present in most bacteria and have been recognized as important players in bacterial metabolism. Autolysins are required, among other roles, to cleave the pre-existing PGN structure so that new PGN subunits are incorporated during synthesis, to ensure daughter cell separation after complete bacterial division or to prompt antibiotic-induced lysis of bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uehara and Bernhardt, 2011</xref>). Autolysins have also been recognized as important virulence factors, as they may act as adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hell et al., 1998</xref>) or be required for biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uehara and Bernhardt, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The new role for Atl uncovered in this work was surprising, since it has been previously suggested that PGN fragments, released by host enzymes capable of degrading PGN or shed by dividing bacteria during the course of infection, may facilitate host recognition in the context of both NOD receptors and insect PGRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nigro et al., 2008</xref>). However, we have now shown that it is precisely this autolysin-mediated ‘trimming’ of PGN (which presumably releases PGN fragments) that renders <italic>S. aureus</italic> inaccessible to the host.</p><p>Direct recognition of PGN seems less likely to play a role in mammalian cells, where PGN is recognized by the intracellular pattern-recognition NOD factors, or in the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria, whose PGN is concealed by the outer membrane, by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> innate immune system.</p><p>We propose that a major mechanism of Gram-positive bacteria recognition in innate immunity is the direct binding of PGRPs to PGN on whole bacteria, which have dedicated proteins, namely amidases or glucosamidases, to trim exposed fragments of PGN. These fragments may extend beyond the teichoic acids layer and, through their removal, bacteria avoid their own recognition and possibly that of their neighbors, by the host innate immune system. Therefore, targeting bacterial autolysins in order to prevent their activity may constitute a new approach to decrease bacterial virulence and potentiate the effectiveness of the host immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains were grown in Luria–Bertani broth (LB; Difco, France) or Luria–Bertani agar (LA; Difco) medium at 37°C with aeration.

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 peer reviewers. One of them was Roberto Kolter, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of two remaining reviewers was Bruno Lamaitre. The third wished to remain anonymous. They reached their consensus decision after discussions amongst them.</p><p>In short, they have decided to reject the submission in its present form. They felt that there was still significant amount of experimental work to be done to fully support your interpretation that the autolysin Atl is serving to mask <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> from Drosophila's innate immune system.</p><p>However, they felt that if the additional work would indeed support this main tenet of your conclusions it would be of great interest. Thus, they would be willing to consider a new submission. Specifically, these are the key experiments that they saw lacking in the current work:</p><p>1) Complement PGRP-SA null flies with an <italic>atl</italic> mutant strain pre-coated with PGRP-SA.</p><p>2) Use sub-inhibitory concentrations of mutanolysin to trim the outer layer of peptidoglycan and then determine if that abolishes PGRP-SA binding to the <italic>atl</italic> mutant</p><p>3) Infect with a heat-killed <italic>atl</italic> mutant to determine if that protects the flies from infection with wild-type.</p><p>4) Check that the AM or GL mutated proteins are indeed deficient for the enzymatic activity.</p><p>5) The levels of Toll pathway activity should be monitored upon injection of wt and <italic>atl</italic> mutant</p><p>6) The persistence of the wt and <italic>atl S. aureus</italic> should be monitored over time</p><p>7) Performing survival experiments using the yw DD as a wild-type fly or use appropriate control</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic> <italic>(Roberto Kolter):</italic></p><p>In general I liked the “bottom line” results of this paper: that an autolysin has the unexpected function of “trimming” peptidoglycan part that would otherwise be exposed on the cell surface. In this way, the cell can better evade the fly's innate immunity. The authors not only show the effect of autolysin mutants on binding by purified fly protein, they also work with purified autolysin and fragments. Importantly, they show effect on adult flies and they extend the findings to Streptococcus. From the perspective of an outsider (I am no expert in cell wall nor innate immunity) these results do appear to have wide implications. However, I did find that the paper could use some polishing in the written style.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>2:</italic></p><p>Atilano et al present an elegant study on the role of autolysins in escaping innate immune response. The authors extend their observations from their model organism <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> and present a model for their results. The model proposes that autolysins trim the exposed peptidoglycan to remove any potential binding sites for innate immune receptors of the PGRP family, in this particular case, PGRP-SA. The authors conclude that it is rather binding to the exposed peptidoglycan than detection of release peptidoglycan that is important for host response. I do not agree with their conclusion and model. The authors can only conclude that autolytic activities such as amidases are important for innate immune escape (not novel) but not on the structural nature of the peptidoglycan relevant for detection in vivo (soluble versus surface attached). PGRPs such as PGRP-SA require the stem peptide for detection. Hence, amidase activities are bound to reduce the biological activity of the peptidoglycan, both of the attached as the release one. Amidase treated peptidoglycan or peptidoglycan fragments are no longer ligands for PGRP-SA due to the absolute requirement of both the stem peptide and the sugar backbone for binding. In fact, the Drosophila produces also amidases to dampen the biological activity of circulating peptidoglycan such as PGRP-LB. To conclude that it is PGRP-SA binding to the outer layers of the peptidoglycan rather soluble circulating peptidoglycan fragments that are important for innate immune detection by PGRP-SA, the authors should perform a series of experiments:</p><p>First, the authors should functionally complement PGRP-SA null flies with <italic>atl</italic> mutant strain pre-coated with PGRP-SA. The authors would have to demonstrate that the same amount of circulating recombinant PGRP-SA is unable to initiate alone a host response and that none of the pre-coated PGRP-SA is released into circulation from the bacterial surface during the period of the experiment. Otherwise, the authors should moderate their conclusions on the nature of the peptidoglycan that is important for PGRP-SA mediate response.</p><p>Second, if their model is correct, the trimming of the outer layers of the peptidoglycan by sub-inhibitory concentrations of mutanolysin should abolish PGRP-SA binding to the <italic>atl</italic> mutant without affecting the biological activity of the released peptidoglycan. The supernatants should induce a PGRP-SA-dependent host response, while the <italic>atl</italic> mutant would see its virulence restored in vivo because it would not be able to bind circulating PGRP-SA on its surface.</p><p>Third, if surface binding alone is important, then co-infection of lethal doses of the wild type <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain should be countered by the host response triggered by co-administration of the heat-killed <italic>atl</italic> mutant. The heat-killed <italic>alt</italic> mutant should recruit to the surface PGRP-SA triggering a host response able to coop with the wild type strain. By definition, heat-killed <italic>atl</italic> mutant should not release circulating peptidoglycan at all.</p><p>Fourth, the authors should confirm that the mutations introduced in Atl to inactivate the amidase and the glucosaminidase activity do indeed abolish their activity (zymogram assay for example). More importantly, the authors must provide evidence that these mutations do not create overall protein misfolding in which case the authors can not conclude that it is the two activities that are required, only the entire protein. Atl has the R1, R2 and R3 domains that besides mediating Atl binding to the bacteria cell surface, they mediate also interactions with matrix proteins or biofilm formation, among other properties. If the protein fold is maintained, these properties that are independent of the enzymatic activity should not change.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>3:</italic></p><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a highly pathogenic bacterium to many hosts including Drosophila and mammals.

More work should be performed to substantiate this point by adding the following experiments:</p><p>- Experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> show that Atl contributes to <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence but they do not show if this is linked to a higher activation of the Toll pathway.

If I am right, I would recommend performing survival experiments using the yw DD as a wild-type. Note that the use of the yw background is far from being ideal (the y mutation tends to make flies more susceptible to infection). Ideally, survival should be performed in y+,w+ background (easy to do by comparing wild-type with ywDD,PGRP-SA/Def(PGRP-SA).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Bacterial autolysins trim cell surface peptidoglycan to prevent detection by the Drosophila innate immune system” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this way, the cell can better evade the fly's innate immunity. The authors not only show the effect of autolysin mutants on binding by purified fly protein, they also work with purified autolysin and fragments. Importantly, they show effect on adult flies and they extend the findings to Streptococcus. From the perspective of an outsider (I am no expert in cell wall nor innate immunity) these results do appear to have wide implications. However, I did find that the paper could use some polishing in the written style</italic>.</p><p><bold>Answer 1</bold>. All suggested changes were made in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>Atilano et al present an elegant study on the role of autolysins in escaping innate immune response. The authors extend their observations from their model organism</italic> Staphylococcus aureus <italic>to</italic> Streptococcus pneumonia <italic>and present a model for their results. The model proposes that autolysins trim the exposed peptidoglycan to remove any potential binding sites for innate immune receptors of the PGRP family, in this particular case, PGRP-SA. The authors conclude that it is rather binding to the exposed peptidoglycan than detection of release peptidoglycan that is important for host response. I do not agree with their conclusion and model. The authors can only conclude that autolytic activities such as amidases are important for innate immune escape (not novel) but not on the structural nature of the peptidoglycan relevant for detection</italic> in vivo <italic>(soluble versus surface attached). PGRPs such as PGRP-SA require the stem peptide for detection. Hence, amidase activities are bound to reduce the biological activity of the peptidoglycan, both of the attached as the release one. Amidase treated peptidoglycan or peptidoglycan fragments are no longer ligands for PGRP-SA due to the absolute requirement of both the stem peptide and the sugar backbone for binding. In fact, the Drosophila produces also amidases to dampen the biological activity of circulating peptidoglycan such as PGRP-LB</italic>.</p><p><bold>Answer 2.</bold> We thank the reviewer for making an important point regarding two possible mechanisms for the role of Atl, which indeed were valid and we had not addressed in the original manuscript.</p><p>The second paragraph in the Results section entitled “Trimming of the bacterial cell surface by Atl PGN hydrolytic activities recovers the ability of <italic>S. aureus atl</italic> mutant bacteria to kill infected Drosophila” now clearly state two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for the decreased virulence of the <italic>atl</italic> mutant:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: <italic>S. aureus</italic> wild type bacteria produce amidase that cleaves the stem peptide moiety of soluble PGN fragments, which is required for binding of PGRPs to PGN, therefore reducing the inflammatory activity of the soluble PGN. However, the <italic>atl</italic> mutant would release intact muropeptides, easily detected by PGRP-SA, and therefore would be unable to evade detection by the innate immune system;</p><p>Hypothesis 2: <italic>S. aureus</italic> wild type bacteria shave and remove accessible PGN fragments at the surface of bacteria, eliminating the binding sites for PGRPs. However, the <italic>atl</italic> mutant would have extending PGN fragments at its surface, which would be easily detected by PGRP-SA, inducing an immune response.</p><p>We performed the experiments suggested by the reviewer (see below) to address this question, but we also tried to come up with a more direct way of distinguishing the two hypotheses. We reasoned that if the first hypothesis was predominantly correct, inactivation of the amidase activity, but not of the glucosaminidase (which cleaves the glycans and therefore releases intact, inflammatory PGN fragments), should result in decreased virulence. Alternatively, if the second hypothesis was predominantly correct, as favored in our manuscript, inactivation of either the amidase or the glucosaminidase activity should result in decreased virulence, as both activities shave detectable PGN (containing peptides) from the bacteria surface.</p><p>We therefore infected flies with bacteria with impaired amidase activity (AM<sup>H265A</sup>) or impaired glucosaminidase activity (GLE<sup>1128A</sup>) and observed that both were impaired in their ability to kill flies, similarly to the <italic>atl</italic> null mutant, in accordance with the second hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Indeed, phagocytosis might be more important than Toll activation and antimicrobial peptide production. Thus, binding of PGRP-SA would be essential and the wild-type</italic> S. aureus <italic>would still escape. However, the Toll activation should be restored. Is that the</italic> <italic>case?</italic></p><p>The reviewer had initially asked us to test the following whether: “co-infection of lethal doses of the wild type <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain should be countered by the host response triggered by coadministration of the heat-killed <italic>atl</italic> mutant”.</p><p>Therefore the experiment done was co-infecting wt flies with wt <italic>S. aureus</italic> mixed with heat killed <italic>atl</italic> mutants cells. Given that the flies were wt, the Toll pathway was intact from the beginning. Given that wt <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells were injected, activation of the Toll pathways was expected and observed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that there might indeed be multiple reasons why the heat-killed experiment did not work. As mentioned by the reviewer one other such factor is phagocytosis. However, there is no link between PGRP-SA and phagocytosis as shown by Dominique Ferrandon and colleagues (Nehme et al PLoS One 6, e14743, 2011). We also don´t think opsonisation is happening here. In our PLoS Pathogens paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atilano et al 2011</xref>, PLoS Pathog 7, e1002421) we described how during host defence against another <italic>S. aureus</italic> mutant (TagO) that binds more PGRP-SA, bacterial killing by the host is dependent on PGRP-SA but not on Toll/NF-kB. This shows that as long as there is good access to peptidoglycan for PGRP-SA to bind around the cell surface of the bacterium, bacteria can be eliminated quickly and so Toll signalling is dispensable. Evidence from other insects (especially the very detailed work on the beetle <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> by the Lee lab over a number of years – for a very nice review of their work see Park et al Adv Exp Med Biol 708, p163, 2010) point towards the assembly of a “killing” complex that has to do with melanisation, an insect-specific response resembling complement activation. Ligoxygakis and Atilano are actively pursuing this line of research but we believe that it is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>3) The authors have indicated that they have performed statistical analysis of their experiments and added it to the figure legends.

However, we have discussed the point on melanisation extensively in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atilano et al 2011</xref>, PLoS Pathog 7, e1002421. Wild type <italic>S. aureus</italic> may activate Toll via the protease route. However, host killing of the <italic>atl</italic> (this work) and TagO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atilano et al 2011</xref>, PLoS Pathog 7, e1002421) mutants is PGRP-SA dependent but Toll-independent. The point we want to make is not about host killing of wild type <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The point we want to explore by generating these bacterial mutants is how host defense changes when the bacterial surface is changing. This reveals not only the requirement for concealing pathogen-associated molecules from the host but also how the host might compensate when bacteria try to evade recognition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
