processes. Here, we identify an unanticipated wound-specific notochord sheath cell subpopulation that expresses Wilms Tumor (WT) 1b following injury in zebrafish. We show that localized damage leads to Wt1b expression in sheath cells, and that <italic>wt1b</italic><sup>+</sup>cells migrate into the wound to form a stopper-like structure, likely to maintain structural integrity. <italic>Wt1b</italic><sup>+</sup>sheath cells are distinct in expressing cartilage and vacuolar genes, and in repressing a Wt1b-p53 transcriptional programme. At the wound, <italic>wt1b</italic><sup>+</sup>and <italic>entpd5<sup>+</sup></italic> cells constitute separate, tightly-associated subpopulations. Surprisingly, <italic>wt1b</italic> expression at the site of injury is maintained even into adult stages in developing vertebrae, which form in an untypical manner via a cartilage intermediate. Given that notochord cells are retained in adult intervertebral discs, the identification of novel subpopulations may have important implications for regenerative spine disorder treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>notochord</kwd><kwd>sheath cells</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>Wilms Tumor 1</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>vertebrae</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_PC_U127585840</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez-Baez</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeng</surname><given-names>Zhiqiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Brombin</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name><name><surname>Rybski</surname><given-names>Witold</given-names></name><name><surname>Patton</surname><given-names>E Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_PC_U127527180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez-Baez</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Hastie</surname><given-names>Nicholas D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Training Programme in Percision Medicine</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZF-MEL-CHEMBIO -

In the developing kidney, WT1 is required for the maintenance of mesenchymal nephron progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kreidberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Motamedi et al., 2014</xref>) as well as differentiation of these progenitors into the epithelial components of the nephron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Essafi et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, in the developing heart, WT1 is expressed in the epicardium (mesothelial lining) and required for the production, via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), of coronary vascular progenitors (EPDCs) that migrate into the myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez-Estrada et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, WT1-expressing mesothelium is the source of mesenchymal progenitors for specialised cell types within several other developing organs. These include stellate cells within the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asahina et al., 2011</xref>), interstitial cells of Cajal in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carmona et al., 2013</xref>) and adipocytes within visceral fat depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). WT1 expression is down-regulated in the epicardium postnatally but reactivated in response to tissue damage in both mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smart et al., 2011</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnabel et al., 2011</xref>). In both organisms, this activation of WT1 in response to damage is associated with new rounds of epicardial EMT, leading to the production of coronary vascular progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnabel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smart et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given the reactivation of <italic>Wt1/wt1b</italic> in the damaged epicardium we set out to investigate whether Wt1 programmes are initiated in response to other sources of tissue damage in zebrafish, and uncovered a novel Wt1 response to wounding of the notochord. The notochord is a transient embryonic structure that provides axial support and signalling information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stemple, 2005</xref>). The notochord comprises two cell populations, the inner vacuolated cells that provide rigid support to the embryo, and the outer sheath cells, a single cell epithelial layer that surrounds the vacuolated cells and secretes components of the extracellular matrix to provide turgor pressure to the vacuolated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apschner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis et al., 2013</xref>). This rigid axial structure becomes functionally replaced by vertebra of the axial skeleton over time. In zebrafish, a row of metameric mineralized rings, known as chordacentra, forms around the notochord in an anterior to posterior fashion and constitutes the first signs of the definitive vertebral column. The chordacentra delineate the future sites where mature vertebra will form and ossify as the larva grows, while the notochord cells develop into the nucleus pulposus of the adult intervertebral disc, a soft gel-like tissue that provides cushioning and flexibility for the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsons, 1977</xref>).</p><p>Degeneration of the intervertebral disc leads to extensive back pain, one of the top global causes of years lived with disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawson and Harfe, 2015</xref>). Treatment primarily consists of managing the pain symptoms, or in more progressed disease includes extensive surgery. One of the major goals of the tissue-engineering field is to identify cells and tissues that will enable novel regenerative therapies to slow down and possibly reverse the degenerative process. Here, we uncover a novel cellular subpopulation in the notochord sheath that emerges at the site of damage and is maintained until formation of a repaired adult vertebra structure. Surprisingly, this subpopulation expresses <italic>wt1b</italic> despite no evidence of <italic>wt1b</italic> expression in physiological notochord development or ossification. Our findings suggest that the zebrafish notochord is protected by a novel wound-specific programme that seals the notochord wound in the embryo and contributes to the subsequent adult vertebra at the injury site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wound-specific expression of <italic>wt1b</italic> in the notochord</title><p>Given the expression of <italic>wt1b</italic> in the regenerating heart, we wanted to explore the expression of <italic>wt1</italic> in other regenerating tissues, and began with the tail fin regenerative processes. There are two <italic>wt1</italic> paralogues in zebrafish, <italic>wt1a</italic> and <italic>wt1b</italic>, and so we performed tail fin amputations on zebrafish larvae 3 days post fertilization (dpf) using <italic>Tg(wt1a:gfp)</italic> and <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp)</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perner et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Surprisingly, we discovered that tail fin amputations including partial removal of the notochord triggered a change of cellularity in the notochord, coupled with the specific, de novo upregulation of GFP in a <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp)</italic> transgenic line. This response was specific to <italic>wt1b</italic> because we did not observe expression of GFP in the notochord of <italic>Tg(wt1a:gfp)</italic> tail fin amputated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–f</xref>).</p><p>Next, we developed a needle-based assay to induce localized damage in the developing zebrafish notochord independent of tail fin amputation. Needle injury was induced in 3 dpf <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp)</italic> that had been crossed with <italic>casper</italic> fish to remove pigmentation and imaged at 72 hr post injury (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Needle induced wounds triggered a similar, albeit stronger <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> response compared to the tail fin amputations, that was specifically localised to the site of the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Time course imaging showed a progressive expansion of the damaged area over 72 hr, with an increasing expression of GFP signal, concomitant with a change of cellularity in the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Importantly, this was not observed in uninjured zebrafish controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) or in notochord injured <italic>Tg(wt1a:gfp)</italic> transgenic larvae (data not shown). Histological staining of the damaged area revealed the presence of a subpopulation of cells at the site of injury, which contrasted morphologically with the uniform, vacuolated inner cells of the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Expression of genes in signaling pathways, such as the TGF-ß pathway were reduced, while vacuolar and lysosomal pathway components were highly enriched in the GFP<sup>+</sup>mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells comparing gene sets from multiple databases. To explore the possibility of lysosome activity in more detail, we performed confocal imaging analysis of the wound site at 7 dpi and observed some GFP<sup>+</sup>mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells with large inclusions (presumably vacuoles), in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).

WT1 can function with co-factors to repress or activate gene expression, and this new signature suggests that Wt1b may function as a repressor in the notochord damage response.

Similarly, the alizarin red dye identified the anterior to posterior forming chordacentra rings during larval development. However, in injured zebrafish larvae, the normally uniform mineralization pattern was interrupted around the site of damage, leading to delayed formation of the chordacentra at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). By 18 dpi, the injured site began to express bone matrix, and was visibly flanked by cartilage expressing segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

In this context, sheath cells invade the vacuolated cell layer and differentiate into vacuolated cells to maintain turgor pressure. While we observe that most <italic>wt1b</italic>-expressing cells are tightly associated with a stopper-like (scar-like) structure from embryo to adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we find some <italic>wt1b</italic> expressing cells appear vacuolated at the injury site at later stages (7 days post injury; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), and that <italic>wt1b</italic>-expressing cells express vacuolar genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). We also detected <italic>entpd5a</italic> expressing cell subpopulations at the wound that are distinct from <italic>wt1b</italic> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These studies highlight a previously unknown complex and heterogeneous nature of the sheath cell populations, and suggest that the notochord sheath can sense and respond to different types of damage. Motion-dependent shear stress in <italic>caveolin</italic> mutants causes loss of vacuolated cells that are replaced by new vacuolated cells that arise from the sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>), while acute damage (i.e. needle injury) that encompasses sheath and vacuolated cell damage, leads to sheath cells forming a seal that marks the site of new cartilage and vertebra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We show that <italic>wt1b</italic> expression marks a subpopulation of sheath cells in both damage responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and suggest that additional factors are involved in the ultimate fate of <italic>wt1b</italic>-expressing cells (i.e. vacuolated cells versus scar like structure).</p><p>To address the function of Wt1b in the wound response, we generated a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic mutant that removes part of the C-terminal zinc-finger domains that are essential for WT1 function in mammalian systems. We find homozygous <italic>wt1b</italic> mutant zebrafish show no overt difference from wild type fish in the wound response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, given the dramatic up-regulation of <italic>wt1b</italic> upon wounding, and given the continued expression up to adult stages, we consider it unlikely that Wt1b has no role in the process. Compensatory mechanisms have to be considered, and indeed, we find a small, but significant increase in <italic>wt1a</italic> in <italic>wt1b<sup>∆5/∆5</sup></italic> wounded tissue. Furthermore, compensatory mechanisms downstream the Wt1b-p53 axis could mask a role, and further analysis beyond the scope of this study will be required to fully understand the functional significance of Wt1b in this subpopulation of cells.</p><p>By leveraging gene expression profiling, and single-cell and 10 cell sequencing of the wounded tissue, we discovered a mechanism for vertebra formation via a cartilage intermediate at the injury site. This is completely unexpected as in zebrafish, ossification of the chordacentra does not require the establishment of a cartige anlagen, but form via the direct mineralization of the fibrous notochord sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bensimon-Brito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). The activation of <italic>wt1b</italic> in sheath cells that migrate towards the center of the notochord is reminiscent of the situation where <italic>wt1b</italic> expression is reactivated in epicardial cells that undergo EMT to produce vascular progenitors and migrate into the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martínez-Estrada et al., 2010</xref>). This raises the question whether notochord sheath cells may also be mesothelial in nature and if the invading <italic>wt1b</italic> expressing cells are produced via an EMT or, perhaps more accurately, a mesothelial to mesenchyme transition. While <italic>wt1b</italic>-positive cells express some mesenchymal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), we did not find evidence that these cells express classical gene signatures related to known EMT processes in the damaged tissue. This may be evidence of an as of yet unknown process in the wound response, or possibly because the EMT process was primarily completed by the time of our analysis at 3 days post injury.</p><p>Surprisingly, we have uncovered a new Wt1b-p53 gene expression signature that is specifically repressed in <italic>wt1b</italic><sup>+</sup> sheath cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). p53 is a transcription factor that in addition to its well-established role as a tumor suppressor, functions to inhibit premature osteoblast differentiation and bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Li, 2010</xref>). Several lines of evidence support a direct WT1-p53 interaction, and that p53 can modify activity of WT1 transcriptional activity from an activator to a repressor on select promoters in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maheswaran et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maheswaran et al., 1993</xref>). However, the in vivo function for the WT1-p53 interaction is not yet understood, and loss of <italic>p53</italic> in <italic>wt1</italic>-null mutant mice does not alter the <italic>wt1-</italic>null phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menke et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we identify a Wt1b-p53 axis specifically in the repair of a notochord wound. The Wt1b-p53 gene signature includes repression of genes that regulate osteogenesis in mammals, including <italic>myc</italic> (<italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>), <italic>egr1</italic> and <italic>igfrb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reumann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that repair-specific transcription factors participate in notochord healing by co-ordinating expression of cartilage genes such as <italic>sox9</italic> and <italic>mgp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schurgers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sweatt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zebboudj et al., 2002</xref>), with a Wt1b-p53 transcriptional axis repressing premature expression of osteogenesis genes in the first few days following wounding. We see <italic>entpd5</italic><sup>+</sup> notochord sheath cells in the wound area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and since <italic>entpd5</italic> is essential for mineralization, it seems likely that these cells, in conjunction with cartilage formation at the site of injury, play a role in centrum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Eventually, smaller vertebra form at the wound site, and <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> cells remain tightly associated with this/these vertebra(e) into adulthood. This mode of notochord wound healing and vertebra formation may be a salvage structure to effectively maintain structural integrity of the developing axial skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (Danio Rerio)</td><td><italic>sagff214a</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-110315–2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Danio Rerio)</td><td><italic>wt1a</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-980526–558</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Danio Rerio)</td><td><italic>col2a1a</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-980526–192</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Danio Rerio)</td><td><italic>entpd5a</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-100419–1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Danio Rerio)</td><td><italic>sox9b</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-001103–2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Danio Rerio)</td><td><italic>wt1b</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENE-050420–319</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (Danio Rerio)</td><td>Tg(entpd5:kaede)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>doi: 10.1242/dev.105817</td><td>ZFIN ID: ZDB-ALT-150223–1: hu6867</td><td>Same BAC used as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huitema et al.

Were the <italic>wt1b/col2a1a</italic> reporter fish presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> followed over to determine whether <italic>col2a1a</italic> positive / <italic>wt1b</italic> negative cells become vacuolated at the site of injury?</p><p>5) Is <italic>wt1b</italic> induced in sheath cells following vacuolated cell ablation (e.g. genetic ablation using SAG214:Gal4 and UAS:NTR)?

It is also unclear whether the cartilage that is rapidly observed after injury is directly giving rise to the centrum that later forms at that site.

The authors should provide some more details about this phenotype, particularly regarding the variability of extra vertebrae. The damage from the injury could cause a single centrum precursor population to be split into two, resulting in the formation of two small centra and an extra vertebra. If the damage occurs at the natural border between two centra, the split in the precursor population would not occur and there would be no extra vertebra. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows that the extra vertebra is smaller in size, and it also appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">image 4D</xref> that the vertebra adjacent to the ectopic vertebra is also smaller in size. This seems to suggest that an original centrum population is being split into two smaller populations and would imply a wound healing process rather than de novo generation/regeneration of a precursor population. In addition, they should use Safranin-O staining in sections during supernumerary vertebrae formation to better support their conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Wilms Tumor 1b</italic> defines a wound-specific sheath cell subpopulation associated with notochord repair&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

To summarize the changes we have made, we would like to highlight the following major new revisions to our work:</p><p>1) Significance of the <italic>wt1b</italic> induction. We have now proved Wt1b protein and <italic>wt1b</italic> gene expression specifically at the site of injury in the notochord, and we have generated and characterised a <italic>wt1b</italic> mutant line. (Essential revisions 1, 2).</p><p>2) Further substantiation of the formation of the <italic>wt1b</italic>-expressingvertebrae. We present new single-cell and 10-cell sequencing studies in the zebrafish notochord, and together with validated gene expression array data comparing injured and control regions, provide strong evidence that the <italic>wt1b</italic>+ sheath cells express cartilage and vacuolar cellular pathways, and represses a novel Wt1b-p53 transcriptional programme. These <italic>wt1b</italic>-expressing cells are maintained within the injured vertebrae until adulthood. (Essential revisions 3, 4, 6).</p><p>3) Better characterization of the injury model and regenerative response. We have now better characterized the injury model by applying a Caveolin inhibitor to phenocopy the <italic>caveolin</italic> zebrafish mutants and reveal <italic>wt1b+</italic> subpopulations to emerge with and without breach of the sheath. Furthermore, and following an insightful suggestion from one reviewer, we have found that the site of injury does impact upon the final vertebrae number and suggest that the appearance of <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> cells that stay closely associated with the adult vertebrae at the site of damage reflect a wound healing process. (Essential revisions 5, 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The emergence of a wt1b+ positive cell population that is otherwise not detectable within the developing or mature notochord is supported solely by the use of Tg(wt1b:GFP) transgene, the conclusions of the paper would be strengthened by showing that the transgene faithfully recapitulates endogenous wt1b expression.</p><p>1a) Are wt1b mRNA and/or protein excluded from the uninjured, developing notochord?</p><p>1b) Is induction of wt1b mRNA restricted to the injury site as shown by the transgenic reporter?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this critical comment to address the endogenous expression of <italic>wt1b</italic> in the zebrafish notochord. We do already present evidence of endogenous Wt1b protein expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. We have generated our own antibody toward zebrafish Wt1 and show that it is expressed at the damage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30657.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30657-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Building on this, we now include immunohistochemistry of notochord sections stained with anti-GFP and anti-WT1 antibodies in injured and non-injured fish (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This demonstrates that GFP and Wt1b protein is restricted to the injury site in the notochord, and excluded from the uninjured, developing notochord.</p><p>Further, we now provide evidence of endogenous <italic>wt1b</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> -positive cells.As described in more detail below, we have now added new data of single-cell and 10-cell sequencing of FACS sorted cells from the injured <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp; col2a1a:mCherry)</italic> zebrafish. We find <italic>wt1b</italic> is expressed only in cells that express <italic>gfp</italic> or both <italic>gfp</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic> but find no <italic>wt1b</italic> expression in the cells that express <italic>mCherry</italic> alone (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Our antibody and RNA sequencing of sorted cells proves that the transgene faithfully recapitulates endogenous <italic>wt1b</italic> expression in the notochord. Our work proves that <italic>wt1b</italic> expression marks a unique subpopulation in notochord sheath cells following injury in zebrafish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The significance of wt1b induction was not addressed experimentally. Ideally, the authors should attempt a loss of function using a wt1b mutant, or a wt1b:Nitroreductase cell ablation approach. Alternatively, a gain of function experiment driving wt1b mosaically from the col2 promoter may prove revealing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment regarding the function of Wt1b in this process. We had started to generate a mutant line, with the intent to address the notochord effects in a <italic>wt1b</italic> mutant situation. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we have generated a 5 bp deletion mutant line (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). At the time of submission, we had not had time to characterise this line. We have confirmed that only the <italic>wt1∆5</italic> mRNA is expressed in mutant embryos (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We now have adult homozygous <italic>wt1<sup>∆5/∆5</sup> </italic>mutant fish and have analysed these for <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> expression, cellularity at the damage site, cartilage formation at the site of injury and in the <italic>wt1b:GFP</italic> expressing adult vertebrae (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). We do not see an overt phenotype in the <italic>wt1<sup>∆5/∆5</sup> </italic>mutant. However, our new data from the single-cell and 10 cell-sequencing reveals a Wt1 transcriptional signature, coupled with the continued expression of <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> up to adult stages. This suggests that Wt1 may indeed be more than a marker of sheath cell populations in a wounding response. It is possible that compensatory mechanisms exist, and indeed we find a small but significant increase in <italic>wt1a</italic> expression in injured tissue from the <italic>wt1b<sup>∆5/∆5</sup></italic> mutants. We now include a section on this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As stated by the authors, in the heart wt1b expression is linked to EMT. Is this also the case in the injured notochord?</p><p>4) The authors state that they do not see vacuolated wt1b expressing cells at the site of injury, suggesting there are two genetically distinct sheath populations that are involved in different aspects of repair. Were the wt1b/col2a1a reporter fish presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> followed over to determine whether col2a1a positive / wt1b negative cells become vacuolated at the site of injury?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important questions. We address reviewer comments 3 and 4 together for ease of discussion.</p><p>We are also very excited to understand the nature of the <italic>wt1b:gfp; col2a1a:mCherry</italic> cells. To address this in an unbiased fashion, we have now performed single and 10-cell sequencing of FACS sorted cells from <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp; col2a1a:mCherry)</italic> zebrafish 3 days following injury.</p><p>This is now presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The key findings from this experiment are:</p><p>1) The <italic>gfp (wt1b+), mCherry (col2a1a+)</italic> and <italic>gfp,mCherry (wt1b+, col2a1a+)</italic> cells independently cluster into three distinct cell subpopulations of the injured notochord (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C, C</xref>). This is strong evidence that the transgenic makers reveal true cellular subpopulations in vivo.</p><p>2) We do not find evidence of EMT at this stage, but rather observe that the <italic>wt1b+col2a1a+</italic> cell cluster expresses genes that are enriched for genes associated with lysosomes and vacuoles (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and cartilage genes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, G</xref>). This suggests that some of these cells may become vacuolated cells, and we find evidence of this when imaging larvae following injury at a later stage (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>3) The <italic>wt1b+ col2a1a+</italic> cell cluster is significantly associated with repression of Wt1 regulated genes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Wt1 can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor, and our evidence suggests that Wt1b may function as a repressor for a gene subset in <italic>wt1b+ col2a1a+</italic> cells.</p><p>4) Wt1 function is regulated by interactions with transcription co-factors that enable activation or repression of target genes. We screened the <italic>wt1b+ col2a1a+</italic> cell cluster for selective enrichment of Wt1 co-factors and found <italic>tp53</italic> expression specifically enriched in the <italic>wt1b+ col2a1a+</italic> cell cluster (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). Remarkably, a p53 gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) reveals that p53 genes are significantly enriched in the <italic>wt1b+ col2a1a+</italic> cell cluster (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). However, genes co-regulated by Wt1 and p53 are selectively repressed in the <italic>wt1b+ col2a1a+</italic> cell cluster (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). This was completely unexpected and reveals a novel and unknown Wt1-p53 axis that may function together in the notochord wound process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is wt1b induced in sheath cells following vacuolated cell ablation (e.g. genetic ablation using SAG214:Gal4 and UAS:NTR)? This would determine whether wt1b induction is specific to injuries that breach the notochord sheath or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the <italic>Tg(SAG214A:Gal4; USA:NTR)</italic> approach would be informative, however, we do not have the combination of these transgenic lines in house, and to obtain them would have required to cross two different transgenes onto the <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp)</italic> transgenic background (two generation times plus shipping of animals between different sites).</p><p>Instead, we have tried to phenocopy the <italic>cav1</italic> mutant phenotypes (Garcia et al., 2017). In our first attempts, we used a morpholino and a crispant approach to target <italic>cav1</italic>, but we were unable to see the altered cellularity at the notochord site.</p><p>As an alternative approach, we used a small molecule caveolin inhibitor called Nystatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nystatin binds sterols and inhibits caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Remarkably, treatment of <italic>Tg(wt1b:gfp; col2a1a:mCherry)</italic> zebrafish with nystatin showed a dose-dependent increase in cellularity in the notochord, similar to <italic>cav1, cav3</italic> and <italic>cavin1b</italic> mutants. GFP was strongly expressed in a subpopulation of the mCherry-positive sheath cells (white arrows), and cells expressing both <italic>gfp</italic> and <italic>mCherry</italic> were clearly visible at the site of cellularity (yellow arrows).</p><p>Our work now shows that <italic>wt1b</italic> expression defines the subpopulation of sheath cells that fill gaps in the vacuolated notochord following the breach of the notochord sheath and following notochord vacuolar dysfunction. We are excited that our work is applicable to the conditions of vacuolated cell damage and have included this data in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given that multiple cell types contribute to centra development, it is unclear in this report where the cartilage forming cells are derived following injury. It is also unclear whether the cartilage that is rapidly observed after injury is directly giving rise to the centrum that later forms at that site. To address these points, at least partially, the authors should perform whole mount in situ hybridization with sclerotome markers and some of the top cartilage hits from the RNA-seq dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting question, but since the (chorda)centrum is an acellular structure, it is not possible to show which cells contribute to it, at least during the first steps of mineralisation and before any osteocytes appear (which is much later). However, since <italic>entpd5</italic> is essential for mineralization and since we see <italic>entpd5a</italic>+ notochord sheath cells in the wound area, it seems likely that sheath cells, in conjunction with cartilage formation at the site of injury play a critical role in centrum formation. We have extended the Discussion accordingly to discuss this point in more detail.</p><p>In further response to this question, we have isolated sections of the damage site and control undamaged tissue and performed qRT-PCR for the <italic>matrix gla protein</italic> (<italic>mgp)</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic> mRNA expression. We chose these two genes because <italic>mgp</italic> was highly expressed in the microarray analysis and important for bone organisation, and because Sox9b is a master cartilage transcription factor. Our new findings demonstrate that <italic>mgp</italic> RNA is increased in notochord damaged tissue, compared with undamaged notochord tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). This validates the microarray analysis and supports the wound specific upregulation of cartilage genes.</p><p>To address which cells in the wound response express the cartilage genes, we have isolated FACS sorted cells from Tg(<italic>wt1b:gfp; col2a1a:mCherry)</italic> injured fish and find <italic>sox9b</italic> and <italic>mgp</italic> to be selectively upregulated in the GFP<sup>+</sup>mCherry<sup>+</sup> cell populations(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).These findings indicate that the <italic>wt1b</italic>-positive sheath cells express the cartilage genes and may co-ordinate the cartilage response at the wound site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors state that one extra vertebra forms at the site of injury (albeit smaller than normal). The authors should provide some more details about this phenotype, particularly regarding the variability of extra vertebrae. The damage from the injury could cause a single centrum precursor population to be split into two, resulting in the formation of two small centra and an extra vertebra. If the damage occurs at the natural border between two centra, the split in the precursor population would not occur and there would be no extra vertebra. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows that the extra vertebra is smaller in size, and it also appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">image 4D</xref> that the vertebra adjacent to the ectopic vertebra is also smaller in size. This seems to suggest that an original centrum population is being split into two smaller populations and would imply a wound healing process rather than de novo generation/regeneration of a precursor population. In addition, they should use Safranin-O staining in sections during supernumerary vertebrae formation to better support their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful question regarding the possibility that we are damaging a precursor population upon injury. At 3 dpf, we do not have a means to visualise a centrum precursor population, however, by day 5 and 7 pf we can visualize the patterned expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> in the notochord using Tg(<italic>entpd5a:kaede</italic>). New evidence demonstrates that metameric expression of <italic>entpd5a</italic> in notochord sheath cells is an essentialrequirement for the patterned formation of chordacentra rings (Lleras Forero et al., submitted). Indeed, the reviewer is correct, and we find that the extra vertebrae is present only upon damaging an <italic>entpd5a</italic> expression domain (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that the wound response alone is not sufficient to induce an extra vertebra, and that <italic>entpd5a</italic> cell population domains are likely to be important in the vertebra formation at the wound site.</p><p>Nonetheless, we consistently find that the vertebra(e) that forms at the site of the damage is/are significantly smaller in a given space interval and have quantified this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Further, we find it remarkable that the <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> response is long-lasting over time, and that <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> expressing cells remain associated with the vertebra(e) at the damage site. To address this phenomenon, we have been able to improve our confocal imaging of Tg(<italic>wt1b:gfp</italic>) and alizarin staining in live adult fish (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) and continue to observe <italic>wt1b:gfp</italic> expressing cells associated with the single vertebra or two vertebrae at the site of damage until adulthood, and (at least one of) these vertebrae are smaller. We have now amended the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to incorporate this change and emphasise what we believe are the first steps to understanding this important wound-healing process.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors were fully responsive to the critiques raised by three reviewers and made substantial improvements to their original manuscript which resulted in a much-improved story.

We tested the antibody by western blot and see a very strong band at 43kDa, consistent with the molecular weight of Wt1 proteins in zebrafish. We used a peptide competition assay by immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the antibody is highly selective for the Wt1 epitope.</p><p>“αWt1 zebrafish antibody</p><p>The Wt1 antibody was synthesised by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (CRB) antibody production services (http://www.crbdiscovery.com/home). […] Immunofluorescence on paraffin-embedded sections with Wt1 antibody (diluted 1:33,000) revealed cell specific staining in the kidney and notochord wound site that was depleted by co-incubation of the Wt1 antibody with the Wt1 epitope peptide.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
