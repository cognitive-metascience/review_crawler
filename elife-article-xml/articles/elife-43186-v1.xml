sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kidneys are necessary for the maintenance of homeostasis in vertebrates. The functional loss of this organ leads to severe defects in systems vital to all vertebrates, including human. During evolution, vertebrates evolved the following three complex kidney structures: pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. Metanephros is the adult kidney in higher vertebrates, such as humans and mice, whereas mesonephros is the adult kidney in fish and amphibians. Pronephros is the simplest and earliest kidney form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desgrange and Cereghini, 2015</xref>). Despite the different levels of complexity of these three kidney types, their functional unit, the nephron, does not differ much (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">BrÃ¤ndli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lienkamp, 2016</xref>). In human, there are approximately one million nephrons per kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">SaxÃ©n and Sariola, 1987</xref>). Each nephron is composed of a glomerulus, a filtering component, and a nephric tubule, which is divided into the following four basic domains: proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and connecting tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">SaxÃ©n and Sariola, 1987</xref>). According to molecular studies, the nephrons of the pronephros in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> can be subdivided into four distinct segments that are homologous to the segments of the metanephric nephrons of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raciti et al., 2008</xref>). Owing to these similarities, <italic>X. laevis</italic> is considered a suitable model for studying renal regeneration for application to human.</p><p>Gentamicin-induced nephropathy and partial nephrectomy showed that numerous vertebrates have the ability to repair damage to nephric structures, although this regenerative ability diverges between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nonclercq et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diep et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). In mammals, nephrons contain mature tubular epithelial cells that have the capacity to regenerate following acute kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeshima et al., 2014</xref>). These epithelial cells rapidly lose their brush border, dedifferentiate into mesenchymal-like cells, and then migrate into regions where cells are damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeshima et al., 2014</xref>). Recent cell lineage studies have also suggested that renal stem cells and progenitor cells were found in the metanephric mesenchyme, limb of Henleâs loop, and distal convoluted tubule in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barker et al., 2012</xref>). Although mammalian nephrons possess cells that contribute to repair after injury, the regenerative capacity is restricted to the reconstruction of nephric epithelial cells in damaged regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maeshima et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to mammals, which merely reconstitute tubular epithelial cells after injury, previous studies showed that <italic>X. laevis</italic> and zebrafish regenerate fully coiled and functional nephric tubule architecture after severe damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diep et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). In zebrafish, the transplantation of <italic>lhx1a-</italic>positive or <italic>six2</italic> mesenchymal cells, which are considered stem cells, into adult fish in which the kidney has been injured by gentamicin reconstructs functional nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diep et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>X. laevis</italic> also regenerates the functional pronephros that can uptake albumin again after the mechanical loss of proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). Both amphibians and fish have a high regenerative capacity, but their regenerative mechanisms appear to differ. Zebrafish use kidney stem cells to repair the functional nephrons, whereas <italic>X. laevis</italic> appear to use remaining tubule cells to regenerate the functional pronephros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diep et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). Thus, despite the different regenerative mechanisms, numerous vertebrates have the ability to repair injured nephrons.</p><p>Recently, studies have established protocols for generating the nephric structure derived from induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem (ES) cells by the combined application of the Wnt activator and other signaling factors such as BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takasato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, direct reprogramming from fibroblasts into renal tubular epithelial cells, called induced renal tubular epithelial cells (iRECs), has been successfully achieved using a combination of transcription factors whose expression in the kidney is evolutionarily conserved between mice and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaminski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lienkamp, 2016</xref>). However, although the molecular factors for the construction of nephrons <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> have been identified, the molecular mechanisms that allow the reactivation of developmental genes during regeneration in highly regenerative animals remain unclear.</p><p>Genetic studies have shown that BMP and canonical Wnt and Fgf signals first specify intermediate mesoderm to form the pronephric primordium, followed by epithelialization, during kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krause et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to signaling factors, transcription factors such as Osr1, Osr2, Pax8, Hnf1b, Lhx1, and WT1 also coordinately regulate kidney formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lienkamp, 2016</xref>). These developmental genes for the kidney are evolutionarily conserved between pronephros formation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and the more complex nephrons in mammalian meso- and metanephros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lienkamp, 2016</xref>). During the regeneration of nephrons in zebrafish, transplanted <italic>lhx1a-</italic>positive mesenchymal cells begin to express developmental genes such as <italic>pax2a</italic>, <italic>wt1a</italic>, and <italic>fgf8a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diep et al., 2011</xref>). In order to use developmental genes during regeneration, the genes have to be expressed again in regenerating tissues, which requires <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements called enhancers. Enhancers are known to determine the tissue specificity and timing of gene expression, and over 43,000 active enhancers have been identified in the human genome alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>). To date, numerous enhancers for tissue and organ development have been identified by the deletion mapping of upstream genomic regions and/or candidate screening using the epigenetic landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kleftogiannis et al., 2016</xref>), whereas only a few enhancers for tissue regeneration have been reported, such as tissue regeneration enhancer elements for zebrafish heart reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). Although it is generally assumed that the genome of vertebrates contains more enhancers that promote gene expression in regenerating tissues, the difficulty in identifying the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of enhancers prevents us from revealing the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory architecture for regeneration. We have previously established an <italic>in vivo</italic> enhancer mapping system using <italic>X. laevis</italic> transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ochi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we extended this strategy for identifying enhancers for the regeneration of nephric tubules and for examining the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the enhancer activities during regeneration. We first found that <italic>lhx1</italic> expression was induced within 24 hr after the surgical removal of nephric tubules. In order to explore the induction mechanisms of <italic>lhx1</italic> in regenerating nephric tubules, we screened enhancers in genomic loci using a transgenic mapping system and found that genomic elements that are conserved from fish to human, called regeneration signal-response enhancers (RSREs), were activated in regenerating nephric tubules. A putative binding motif of Arid3a, a member of the AT-rich interaction domain family, is commonly found in RSREs for <italic>lhx1</italic>. We found that Arid3a directly binds to RSREs and Arid3a with H3K9me3 demethylases Kdm4/Jmjd2 reducing H3K9me3 levels on RSREs. We further found that the conditional knockdown of a<italic>rid3a</italic> during regeneration suppressed the regeneration of nephric tubules. We now demonstrate that Arid3a is required for the regeneration of nephric tubules through the RSREs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proximal tubules and intermediate tubules have different regenerative capacities</title><p>The pronephric kidneys of <italic>X. laevis</italic> become functional from Nieuwkoop and Faber stages 37â38. A previous study showed that proximal tubules that have been partially nephrectomized at stages 37â38 can regenerate functional nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raciti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). Since we have previously established the <italic>Xla.Tg(Xtr.pax8:EGFP)</italic> transgenic line that can be used to trace nephric tubule formation, we first confirmed the regenerative process of nephric tubules using live imaging of stage 37 transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ochi et al., 2012</xref>). Our careful nephric tubule surgery did not damage the glomus, which is situated medially to the tubules displaying <italic>podocin</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). When the proximal tubules were partially nephrectomized, a coiled structure appeared at around 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, B and E</xref>). This coiled tubule continued to extend from 24 to 48 hr, and then the regenerated tubules reconstructed the nephron between 72 and 120 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). In contrast, completely nephrectomized proximal tubules failed to form a coiled structure, whereas the remaining tubules, the intermediate tubules, continued to extend from the back to the front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). Conversely, when the intermediate tubules were completely removed, no tubule extension was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Thus, although <italic>Xla.Tg(Xtr.pax8:EGFP)</italic> cannot capture all of the cells that contribute to the reconstruction of nephric tubules, our results indicate that the proximal tubules are essential for the regeneration of the coiled structure of the nephric duct. In addition, the intermediate tubules also have the capacity to regenerate nephric tubules, although this capacity is limited compared with that of the proximal tubules. It has been shown in a previous study that apoptotic cells and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase nine dramatically increase within 12 hr after nephrectomy, and these events continue until 24â48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). Our observation that regenerative tubules exhibit a coiled structure at around 24â48 hr together with previous findings suggests that the genetic mechanisms that occur within 48 hr after nephrectomy are crucial for nephron regeneration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43186.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live imaging of nephric tubules using transgenic <italic>X. laevis.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic image of <italic>X. laevis</italic> nephron.

These previous findings prompted us to focus on the mechanisms of <italic>lhx1</italic> expression in regenerating nephric tubules. In order to explore the enhancers that activate <italic>lhx1</italic> gene expression in regenerating nephric tubules, we first searched for evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) as candidates for the enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woolfe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ochi et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we focused on two categories of CNSs. The first one is evolutionarily conserved between frog and zebrafish, which have a high regenerative capacity, and the other is conserved among human, mice, frog, and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In order to identify CNSs, we compared the genomic sequence of a 365 kb segment encompassing the human LHX1 gene with the orthologous intervals in mice, opossums, frog (<italic>X. tropicalis</italic>), and zebrafish genomes using the MultiPipMaker alignment tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2000</xref>). This analysis identified 20 CNSs conserved between human and fish and 17 CNSs conserved between frog and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In order to find the enhancers that genuinely activate gene expression, we used an efficient transgenesis technique for a nonmosaic founder assay of <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kroll and Amaya, 1996</xref>). Each <italic>X. tropicalis lhx1</italic>-CNS was cloned into a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid carrying a <italic>Î²</italic>-actin basal promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogino et al., 2008</xref>). Each construct was used to generate transgenic embryos, and the left side of the nephrons was then resected, after which the embryos were allowed to proceed to stage 37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Their GFP expression was examined 48 hr after nephrectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Reporter constructs without a CNS showed no significant GFP expression (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ochi et al., 2012</xref>). When GFP expression was detected in the regenerating nephric duct, we counted this as a positive result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). CNSs for <italic>lhx1</italic> conserved between frog and zebrafish showed enhancer activities, whereas CNSs conserved among vertebrates showed much stronger enhancer activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Therefore, we examined whether CNSs that have enhancer activities in regenerating nephric tubules are also activated in developing pronephros. The transgenic reporter analysis using early tailbud embryos showed that CNS17, CNS20, and CNS35 have enhancer activities in the eyes and somites at this stage, while lacking (CNS20 and CNS35) or showing (CNS17) very weak enhancer activities in developing pronephros, suggesting that these CNSs primarily function after nephrectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We named these elements RSREs. Generally, enhancers activate gene expression by binding transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulger and Groudine, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the RSREs that we identified must also be regulated by transcription factors. In order to examine the transcription mechanisms for RSREs during nephron regeneration, we first searched for the binding motifs of transcription factors on RSREs. To dissect the transcriptional inputs for the RSREs, the open-access database JASPAR ver. 5 was used to define potential transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathelier et al., 2014</xref>). The candidate transcription factors were narrowed down according to their nephric expression using the Expression Atlas (the baseline atlas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petryszak et al., 2014</xref>), and then they were narrowed down further by phylogenetic footprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although many <italic>lhx1</italic>-CNSs showed enhancer activities in regenerating nephric tubules, we focused on the top three <italic>lhx1</italic> RSREsâCNS17, CNS20, and CNS35âwhich showed strong enhancer activities. The motif analysis showed that transcription motifs for Arid3a and Spib were commonly found in RSREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). <italic>arid3a</italic> is known to be expressed in the ectoderm of the early neurula and in the epidermis at the late tailbud stage, whereas <italic>spib</italic> is expressed in the anterior ventral blood islands at the neurula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callery et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa et al., 2008</xref>). We performed an <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization analysis in order to determine whether these genes are also expressed in the nephric tubules and found that <italic>arid3a</italic> is expressed there, whereas <italic>spib</italic> is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we performed immunostaining of Arid3a using <italic>Xla.Tg(Xtr.pax8:EGFP)</italic>, which showed that Arid3a protein was detected in proximal tubules and also in the glomus and/or nephrocoelom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, orange arrows and orange arrowheads, respectively). These results suggest that Arid3a is a good candidate for the input transcription factor for RSREs. Therefore, we next examined whether Arid3a regulates the expression of <italic>lhx1</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and found that <italic>lhx1</italic> was induced by conditionally induced <italic>arid3a</italic> in heat-shock-inducible transgenic <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheeler et al., 2000</xref>).

CNS35 was divided into two segments for qPCR, since it is 580 bp long, which is too long for qPCR. ChIP-qPCR showed that Arid3a directly binds to RSREs, but not to exon 5 and CNS32, which do not include putative Arid3a binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, a luciferase reporter analysis using 293 T cells derived from human embryonic kidneys was performed to examine whether Arid3a functions as a transcriptional activator for RSREs. We found that Arid3a activates CNS17 and CNS20 enhancer activities, whereas no activation was observed in the CNS35 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Arid3a is known to stimulate the expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and is also known to change the accessibility of the IgH enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Tucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2007</xref>).

Therefore, we next investigated whether Arid3a modulates the H3K9me3 level on RSREs.

Thus, we found that Arid3a directly regulates <italic>lhx1</italic> expression through changing the chromatin configuration on CNS17 and CNS20.

In order to investigate whether Arid3a is required for the regeneration of nephric tubules, we applied photo-morpholino oligonucleotide (Photo-MO) that was previously established in zebrafish in order to control the timing of gene knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tallafuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>). The effectiveness of antisense-MO for gene knockdown is blocked by annealing with sense Photo-MO. Since Photo-MO is cleaved by ultraviolet (UV) treatment, we were able to control the timing of gene knockdown. We first designed the splicing-blocking morpholino for <italic>arid3a.L</italic>, since the expression <italic>arid3a.L</italic> in nephrons is stronger than that of <italic>arid3a.S</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

Next, in order to investigate whether the photosensitive subunit is cleaved by 365 nm light, <italic>arid3a.L</italic>-photo-MO/<italic>arid3a.L</italic>-MO-injected embryos were treated with UV for 30 min at stages 29â30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

However, no extensive analysis has been performed on whether highly regenerative animals utilize unique <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements for regeneration and how such <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements become activated during regeneration. Previously, tissue regeneration enhancer elements were identified on the basis of epigenetic profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). The screening of epigenetic profiles on the basis of open chromatin marks is useful to capture the regulatory blueprint in a genome-wide manner, while our one-by-one transgenic screening based on the actual activities in regenerating tissues provides a novel and powerful approach to directly identify tissue specificity and <italic>in vivo</italic> function. Once we identified the functional enhancers in the regenerating tissues, we were able to search for input transcription factors.

This <italic>lhx1</italic> expression pattern prompted us to examine its noncoding DNA sequences. The <italic>Xenopus lhx1/xlim-1</italic> enhancer responding to activin has been reported to encompass approximately 14.2 kb, including 5 kb upstream and the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rebbert and Dawid, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>). Since recent genome-wide analyses have shown that enhancers are located not only near the gene body but also far away from it, we compared the genomic sequence of a 365 kb segment encompassing the human <italic>LHX1</italic> gene with the orthologous intervals in mice, opossums, <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woolfe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ochi et al., 2012</xref>). While the activin-responding <italic>lhx1</italic> enhancer is located in intron 1, enhancers that showed high activities in regenerating nephrons are located 177 kbp (CNS17) and 144 kbp (CNS20) upstream of <italic>lhx1</italic> and are also found in the intron of the next gene <italic>aatf</italic> (CNS35) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is known that many genes have multiple enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulger and Groudine, 2010</xref>). Such multiple enhancers often play different functional roles, while it is also known that they sometimes show overlapping functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). CNS17, CNS20, and CNS35 are activated in regenerating nephric tubules, indicating that these enhancers have overlapping functions. On the other hand, we also found that CNS17 and CNS20 are modified by H3K9me3 but not CNS35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). It has been shown in recent studies that functionally redundant enhancers provide phenotypic robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). Our observation that there are overlapping functions of CNS17, CNS20, and CNS35 in the regenerating nephric tubules, albeit with differential activation mechanisms, suggests that there is a redundancy of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for regeneration. In addition, we also found that many CNSs that are only conserved between frog and fish showed weak enhancer activities in regenerating nephric tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Since these animals have a high regenerative capacity, it is possible that such weak multiple enhancers possessing overlapping activities may also be key to boosting the gene expression in regenerating tissues. Further studies of transcriptional mechanisms for frog/fish CNSs may provide novel insights into the unique trait of high regenerative capacity in fish and frog.</p><p>In zebrafish, <italic>lhx1a</italic> and <italic>six2</italic> mesenchymal cells reconstruct the functional nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diep et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, our live imaging using <italic>Xla.Tg(Xtr.pax8:EGFP)</italic> together with McLaughlinâs previous findings suggests that the wound healing and regrowth of existing tubules occur during the regeneration of the nephric tubules of <italic>X. laevis</italic>, since the remaining nephric tubule cells extend toward the glomus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caine and Mclaughlin, 2013</xref>). In mammals, mature tubular epithelial cells rapidly lose their brush border and dedifferentiate into mesenchymal-like cells following acute kidney injury, and these cells proliferate to regenerating nephric tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeshima et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the regenerative mechanisms of the nephric tubules of <italic>X. laevis</italic> appear to be much closer to the regeneration of nephric tubules in mammals rather than the reconstruction of nephrons from stem cells. Further live imaging studies using transgenic animals with markers of dedifferentiating cells and regrowing cells are required in order to reveal the detailed regenerative mechanisms of nephric tubules in vertebrates.</p><p>Recently developed <italic>in vivo</italic> organ construction technologies enabled us to make nephric structures derived from iPSCs and ES cells by the combined application of the Wnt activator and other signaling factors such as BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takasato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, direct reprogramming from fibroblasts into renal tubular epithelial cells, called iRECs, has successfully converted mouse and human fibroblasts into renal tubular epithelial cells using a combination of transcription factors: Emx2, Hnf1b, Hnf4a, and Pax8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaminski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lienkamp, 2016</xref>).

It has been shown in a recent study that A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 13 (ADAM13) increases the nuclear localization of a cleavage product of Arid3a and promotes the expression of the target gene tfap2 alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khedgikar et al., 2017</xref>). ADAMs are known to control a variety of cell functions by modulating the ectodomain shedding of several membrane-anchored signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blobel, 2005</xref>).

This study indicates that <italic>lhx1</italic> enhancer elements enable binding of Arid3a to activate of <italic>lhx1</italic> gene expression during nephron regeneration. It also shows that Arid3a recruits chromatin modifiers to these enhancer elements to facilitate <italic>lhx1</italic> gene expression and resultant cell proliferation. The topic of the paper is significant in that it is the first paper to indicate a mechanism by which regeneration of nephrons occurs in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. More broadly, this paper is the first to examine how enhancers facilitate regeneration of the nephron. This paper is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the following concerns are addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The manuscript focuses on Arid3a association with a regeneration response enhancer of <italic>lhx1</italic> (and to a certain extent <italic>pax8</italic>), but the Introduction fails to describe the role of <italic>lhx1</italic> (and <italic>pax8</italic>) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development or cite manuscripts related to it known roles in kidney development (Taira et al., 1994; Carroll and Vizeet al., 1999; Carroll, Wallingford and Vize, et al.1999; DeLay et al., 2018).</p><p>2) Results related to Figure 1 do not describe when (what stage) the nephrectomy is performed in <italic>this</italic> study.</p><p>3) Because <italic>pax8</italic> is one of the first genes expressed during kidney development, the <italic>pax8</italic> transgenic line is an excellent choice to examine regeneration. However, since in Figure 2 there is some regenerating tissue that is labeled by <italic>lhx1</italic> probes but not <italic>pax8</italic> probes, is it possible that the transgenic <italic>pax8</italic> line does not label all of the regenerating tissue? If so, this is useful information in the context of Figure 1.</p><p>4) Throughout the manuscript it is unclear whether these enhancer elements are important for <italic>lhx1</italic> expression during normal development or just during regeneration.</p><p>5) In Figure 3C, the image of the control side is not clear as to whether the conserved noncoding sequence drives GFP expression in the nephron in the absence of nephrectomy.</p><p>6) In Figure 4B, kidney expression of Arid3a.L is difficult to see in the images.</p><p>7) The explanation of Figure 5A is unclear. How does inset panel relate to position of larger image? What does the purple indicate?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper identifies enhancers that are used in regeneration of the kidney to drive <italic>lhx1</italic> expression. As an important part of regeneration, this is potentially very interesting. However, I don't see experiments addressing whether the regeneration induced enhancers are also normally used in development? What is the implication if they are also active in Development â does it mean that the enhancer is not specific to regeneration? The authors call the enhancers regeneration specific, so this is a crucial point for the paper as presented. While this may be the main point that needs to be addressed in a revision, there are a number of other points that need to be clarified in the paper.</p><p>Arid3a binding and function:</p><p>Figure 4B: the expression of Arid 3aL in tubules is very hard to see. Perhaps a higher magnification would help.</p><p>Figure 4C: are some of these tadpoles nephrectomized as suggested in the legend? I don't see panels that address this.</p><p>Figure 4C: is CNE35 a negative control? It also binds Arid3a, but this putative enhancer is not activated in expression, so what is the implication here? The possibility that it only activates the gene in which it is resident is attractive but not tested explicitly, though such a specific context effect would be interesting. In any case, such ChIP experiments should address binding to a negative control element or two. As presented, the data are consistent with general binding of the tagged Arid3a to chromatin in a nonspecific way.</p><p>I am confused about the Arid3a expression, according to Xenbase the levels of expression in kidney are similar for Arid3aL and 3aS, and in the figures presented, neither appears to be expressed in the pronephric region, though Arid3aL has an overall higher staining in the ISH than does Arid3aS. However, this is not as well controlled as the RNA seq in Xenbase, though that is for adult kidney.</p><p>The logic of the experiments in Figure 6 would be clearer if it were made clear that the photoMO is the sense strand which binds and inhibits the antisense.</p><p>The results with the photoactivable MO appear quite convincing, though I am still puzzled by how it targets the pronephros, when the evidence for <italic>arid3aL</italic> expression is not so clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents a thorough and interesting analysis of conserved non-coding elements in the <italic>lhx1</italic> locus. This is significant since <italic>lhx1</italic> expression and function is important in kidney development and regeneration. The authors show that CNEs have sites for Arid3a and go on to show that Arid3a can bind and activate <italic>lhx1</italic>CNEs. They also show that a consequence of Arid3a regulation of <italic>lhx1</italic> is increased proliferation. This work will be of interest to kidney development investigators and to labs studying tubule regeneration. The approach is rigorous in that many replicates were performed for each experiment and statistical methods were applied.</p><p>1) What distinguishes the Regeneration Signal Responsive Enhancers described in this work from developmental regulatory elements in the <italic>lhx1</italic> locus? i.e. are these elements the same as <italic>cis</italic>-elements active during development? Since the fish to human enhancer conservation was stronger than the fish to frog enhancer conservation, this seems to suggest the RSREs might simply be developmental enhancers reactivated by injury, raising the question of whether they warrant the name &quot;regeneration signal response enhancers&quot;. Also, wouldn't it have been more interesting to look at the CNEs that were specific to fish and frog (which can regenerate), even if they were not as strong, and look for binding sites in those that were not present in mouse/human (which don't regenerate as well)?</p><p>2) As described by the authors, the rationale for choosing to focus on <italic>lhx1a</italic> as a regeneration gene conflates two different repair mechanisms in frog and fish when the authors say &quot;Among these, the previous finding that <italic>lhx1a</italic>-expressing cells regenerate functional nephrons in zebrafish prompted us to focus on the mechanisms of Lhx1 expression in regenerating [frog] nephric tubules (Diep et al., 2011).&quot; The zebrafish repair mechanism involves Six2-expressing adult kidney stem cells while the frog nephrectomy model appears to be a regrowth of an existing tubule, much like mammalian kidney regeneration/wound healing, and this tubule does not express Six2. It is important to be clear about what each model represents in terms of distinct regenerative mechanisms.</p><p>3) Have the authors tried other unbiased approaches to identifying proteins bound to RSREs?</p><p>4) In Figure 4D, there is no explanation of why CNE35 was split into 56-334 and 314-580.</p><p>5) In Figure 5C why would CNE35 act differently from CNE17 and CNE20 in terms of altered chromatin structure?</p><p>6) From the data shown I am not convinced Arid3a is expressed in the pronephros. The magenta arrows in Figure 4B seem to be pointing at yolk with no blue <italic>in situ</italic> reaction product where the pronephros would be. The cross section is too low resolution to see tubule morphology in the stained cross section. Clearer data should be presented.</p><p>7) In Figure 4C, the experiment is a little difficult to understand. How many hours after heat shock was <italic>lhx1</italic> expression assayed?</p><p>8) Figure 6: What accounts for the loss of message in UV treated photo MO condition? Splice blocking MOs usually alter splicing; is there an altered Arid3a mRNA after UV activation of the MO? Is there a control for UV exposure alone on mRNA abundance? 30 minutes of continuous exposure to 365 nm light could have effects of its own. Also the experimental design at the top of 6A should indicate that both photo and regular MO's were injected together.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43186.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We performed transgenic experiments on the regeneration signal-response enhancer (RSRE) in embryos at the early tailbud stage in order to examine whether RSREs function in developing nephrons.

This regenerative mechanism is much closer to the regeneration of nephric tubules in mammals, rather than the reconstruction of nephrons in zebrafish from stem cells. We have thus amended the âResultsâ section as follows: âIt has been shown in a previous study involving simple mRNA injection using <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos that Lhx1 with Pax8 can induce ectopic pronephron structures (Carroll and Vize, 1999). [â¦] These previous findings prompted us to focus on the mechanisms of <italic>lhx1</italic> expression in regenerating nephric tubulesâ. We have also included the following text in the âDiscussionâ section: âIn zebrafish, <italic>lhx1a</italic> and <italic>six2</italic>mesenchymal cells reconstruct the functional nephrons (Diep et al., 2011). [â¦] Further live imaging studies using transgenicanimals with markers of dedifferentiating cells and regrowing cells are required in order to reveal the detailed regenerative mechanisms of nephric tubules in vertebratesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Have the authors tried other unbiased approaches to identifying proteins bound to RSREs?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that unbiased approaches to identify the enhancers are crucially important. Since we have established the identification of enhancers that are activated in regenerating nephric tubules in this research, we would like to apply unbiased approaches combining ATAC-seq and transgenic reporter analysis in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4D, there is no explanation of why CNE35 was split into 56-334 and 314-580.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The sequence length of CNS35 is 580 bp. Since this is too long for qPCR, CNE35 was divided into two segments. We have included the following text to explain this: âCNS35 was divided into two segments for qPCR, since it is 580 bp long, which is too long for qPCRâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5C why would CNE35 act differently from CNE17 and CNE20 in terms of altered chromatin structure?</p></disp-quote><p>As you have pointed out, the chromatin configuration of CNS35 differs from that of CNS17 and CNS20, and the luciferase reporter analysis also showed that the mechanism of activation of CNS35 also differs from those of CNS17 and CNS20 (Figure 4D). At present, we do not have any explicit data to explain the difference between CNS35 and other RSREs. Therefore, we have included the following text in the âDiscussionâ section: âCNS17, CNS20, and CNS35 are activated in regenerating nephric tubules, indicating that these enhancers have overlapping functions. [â¦] Our observation that there are overlapping functions of CNS17, CNS20, and CNS35 in the regenerating nephric tubules, albeit with differential activation mechanisms, suggests that there is a redundancy of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for regenerationâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) From the data shown I am not convinced Arid3a is expressed in the pronephros. The magenta arrows in Figure 4B seem to be pointing at yolk with no blue <italic>in situ</italic> reaction product where the pronephros would be. The cross section is too low resolution to see tubule morphology in the stained cross section. Clearer data should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization again and provided better images. We also performed immunostaining using anti-Arid3a antibody and found that Arid3a protein was present in the proximal tubules. We have thus amended the text as follows: â<italic>arid3a</italic> is known to be expressed in the ectoderm of the early neurula and in the epidermis at the late tailbud stage, whereas <italic>spib</italic> is expressed in the anterior ventral blood islands at the neurula stage (Callery et al., 2005; Costa et al., 2008). [â¦] In addition, we performed immunostaining of Arid3a using <italic>Xla.Tg(Xtr.pax8:EGFP)</italic>, whichshowed that Arid3a protein was detected in proximal tubules and also in the glomus and/or nephrocoelom (Figure 4B, orange arrows and orange arrowheads, respectively)â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 4C, the experiment is a little difficult to understand. How many hours after heat shock was lhx1 expression assayed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have added the experimental design in Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 6: What accounts for the loss of message in UV treated photo MO condition? Splice blocking MOs usually alter splicing; is there an altered Arid3a mRNA after UV activation of the MO? Is there a control for UV exposure alone on mRNA abundance? 30 minutes of continuous exposure to 365 nm light could have effects of its own. Also the experimental design at the top of 6A should indicate that both photo and regular MO's were injected together.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We designed the splicing-blocking morpholino to the <italic>arid3a.L</italic> exon2-intron2 donor site and also designed RT-PCR primers to exon 2 and exon 4. Therefore, exon 3 of <italic>arid3a.L</italic> is skipped by <italic>arid3a.L-</italic>MO, and the level of exon 3-containing transcripts is decreased. In order to confirm whether UV exposure affects mRNA abundance, we performed RT-PCR using UV-untreated and UV-treated wild-type tadpoles. This analysis showed that UV does not affect the abundance of spliced mRNA. We added the result on this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A) A diagram of the experimental design.</title><p>B) RT-PCR analysis was performed.
