persist in the liver, cause malaria relapse and represent a major challenge to malaria elimination. Our previous transcriptomic study provided a novel molecular framework to enhance our understanding of the hypnozoite biology (Voorberg-van der Wel A, et al., 2017). In this dataset, we identified and characterized the Liver-Specific Protein 2 (LISP2) protein as an early molecular marker of liver stage development. Immunofluorescence analysis of hepatocytes infected with relapsing malaria parasites, in vitro (<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>) and in vivo (<italic>P. vivax</italic>), reveals that LISP2 expression discriminates between dormant hypnozoites and early developing parasites. We further demonstrate that prophylactic drugs selectively kill all LISP2-positive parasites, while LISP2-negative hypnozoites are only sensitive to anti-relapse drug tafenoquine. Our results provide novel biological insights in the initiation of liver stage schizogony and an early marker suitable for the development of drug discovery assays predictive of anti-relapse activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic></kwd><kwd>hypnozoite</kwd><kwd>liver stage</kwd><kwd>Malaria relapse</kwd><kwd>molecular marker</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1141292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roma</surname><given-names>Guglielmo</given-names></name><name><surname>Kocken</surname><given-names>Clemens HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Diagana</surname><given-names>Thierry Tidiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1137694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mikolajczak</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LISP2 expression marks the beginning of awakening of dormant hypnozoite to developing malaria liver stages, which are susceptible to a novel prophylactic drug, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> PI4K inhibitor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> is the second most prevalent malarial pathogen, with a wider geographical distribution than <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> suggested to be a risk of malaria infection for 2.5 billion people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howes et al., 2016</xref>). According to the WHO report (2017), an estimated 8.5 million new clinical cases of <italic>P. vivax</italic> was reported in 2016 globally. Despite its high prevalence in many malaria endemic countries, <italic>P. vivax</italic> research is restricted to few laboratories and limited progress has been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armistead and Adams, 2018</xref>). Notwithstanding, the FDA recently approved tafenoquine as a radical cure therapy and prophylactic for <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frampton, 2018</xref>). This is a significant advance as tafenoquine is administered as a single dose regimen, which is a very important improvement for patient compliance when compared to the lengthy 14-day drug regimen of its closely related predecessor primaquine. However, tafenoquine is only approved for patients over the age of 16 and, like primaquine, it cannot be administered to patients who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a common genetic disorder in malaria endemic countries, due to serious adverse side-effects and life-threatening drug-induced hemolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wells et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mazier et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, new drugs are critically needed to enable malaria elimination.</p><p>Malaria transmission begins when uni-nucleated sporozoites are transmitted by mosquito bite, reach the liver and invade hepatocytes within which they transform into multi-nucleated hepatic schizonts. Mature schizonts release merozoites that infect red blood cells (RBCs) and lead to the onset of clinical symptoms associated with malaria. Remarkably, sporozoites of <italic>P. vivax, P. ovale and P. cynomolgi</italic> can generate latent forms known as hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prudêncio et al., 2011</xref>). Hypnozoites, triggered by unknown signals, periodically activate several weeks (or even months) after the initial infection to cause malaria relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wells et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shanks and White, 2013</xref>). Activation of hypnozoites was suggested to be responsible for 90% of the global clinical burden associated with relapsing malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adekunle et al., 2015</xref>). Despite recent advances in development of models to study hepatic relapses in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dembélé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gural et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roth et al., 2018</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mikolajczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">March et al., 2013</xref>), the quest for novel radical cure therapies is stymied by our poor understanding of the molecular determinants of hypnozoite persistence and activation.</p><p>The simian relapsing malaria parasite <italic>P. cynomolgi (Pcy)</italic>—closely related to the <italic>P. vivax</italic> human malaria parasite—has been crucial to our current understanding of the hypnozoite biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dembélé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krotoski et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cogswell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Voorberg-van der Wel et al., 2017</xref>) and the discovery of novel liver-stage active compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zeeman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zeeman et al., 2016</xref>) and anti-relapse drug candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campo et al., 2015</xref>). Here, using in vitro and in vivo liver stage infection models, we demonstrated that LISP2 is a molecular marker of initiation of liver-stage development in relapsing malaria parasites. As proof of concept, using known drugs that have differential effect on hypnozoites, we showed that the LISP2 marker could assess anti-relapse drug activities in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver</title><p>To increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that may be underlying the physiological regulation of hypnozoite persistence and activation, we and others have recently carried out comparative transcriptomics analysis of persistent, non-replicating and replicating liver-stages of the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Voorberg-van der Wel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cubi et al., 2017</xref>). Searching for potential markers specific to dormancy in our transcriptomic dataset has proven to be difficult because hypnozoites appear to globally suppress transcription and very few genes are specifically up-regulated in hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Voorberg-van der Wel et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that markers of hypnozoite activation and schizogony might be easier to identify as we speculated that they would be significantly enriched in large replicating parasites albeit detectable at least in a fraction of smaller parasites that might be activating hypnozoites or earliest developing forms. Looking for genes with such an expression pattern, we looked for genes that were detected above &gt;10 FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Per Million) in hypnozoite (727 genes) and that were in the top 5% genes expressed in schizonts (134 genes). Amongst the seven genes fulfilling these criteria (most of them were encoding hypothetical proteins; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we identified the gene PcyM_0307500, the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> ortholog of the rodent <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> Liver-Specific Protein 2 (LISP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orito et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>P. cynomolgi,</italic> LISP2 is dramatically upregulated (over 72-fold, p-value 0.0009) in replicating schizonts but, nonetheless, detectable at significant level (average FPKM 12) in hypnozoites. A similar expression pattern was reported for the <italic>P. vivax</italic> LISP2 (PVP01_0304700) in the recently published liver stage transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gural et al., 2018</xref>). PVP01_0304700 was found to be highly expressed in (&gt;150, Transcripts per million, TPM) mix population (mixture of all hepatic stages), whereas it was significantly detected (&gt;25 TPM) in hypnozoite enriched samples above threshold (25 TPM).</p><p>LISP2 protein is 2038 amino-acids (aa) and 2519 aa long in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>, with an N-terminal signal peptide and a conserved C-terminal 6-cysteine domain (6-cys) found in a family of apicomplexan-specific proteins which are mostly surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arredondo and Kappe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thompson et al., 2001</xref>). To determine the subcellular localization of LISP2 in relapsing malaria parasites, we raised antibodies against the conserved 6-cys domain for both predicted proteins encoded by the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> (PcyM_0307500) and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (PVP01_0304700/PVX000975) LISP2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed the specificity of both <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> LISP2 antibodies against the recombinant antigen by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Cultivated simian hepatocytes infected with <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> B-strain sporozoites (spz) were then analyzed in immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with anti-LISP2 and anti-HSP70 antibodies to monitor LISP2 expression over time. <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> infected simian hepatocytes from three different macaques were maintained in vitro from day 1 to day 12 in monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and switched to the previously reported long term in vitro sandwich culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dembélé et al., 2014</xref>) from day 13 to day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). LISP2 immunostaining was only observed starting at day 3 in a characteristic crescent-shape asymmetrically located on one side of the early developing liver parasites, or trophozoites (LISP2+). By day 4, LISP2 protein is distributed all around the peripheral membrane in a circular pattern around the parasites that were all very clearly multinucleated (&gt;3 nuclei). By day 5 in larger schizonts, LISP2 appears to accumulate in peripheral vacuolar membrane structures that were not labeled by DAPI or HSP70 antibody (LISP2++). We observed those vacuoles from day 6 onwards, as the parasites mature and grow to larger schizonts. During this intensive parasite growth phase (Day 4 to Day 10), LISP2 staining was observed in the same vacuolar and peripheral membrane pattern (LISP2++) in multinucleated parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the resolution of DAPI staining does not allow for an accurate count of the number of nuclei, LISP2+ parasites generally appear to have few nuclei (see representative images on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The HSP70 protein is detected during all the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver life-cycle stages and HSP70 immunostaining is seen for all parasites from day 1 and throughout the entire 21 days period. We independently confirmed this expression pattern at the RNA level in Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) experiments in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> cultures.

As expected the total number of parasites decreased over time as they grew to mature schizonts and merosomes. In the first 2 days following the sporozoite infection, we detected only small LISP2- parasites positively stained with the HSP70 antibody.

PV1 was previously reported to be resident protein of PV in blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2011</xref>). Further demonstrating that LISP2- stained parasites are not artifact staining but bona fide constructive infections, parasites were stained positively with PV1 and similarly to the staining pattern observed in blood stages PV1 antibodies specifically highlight the circumference of the parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nyalwidhe and Lingelbach, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Importantly, we observed that both LISP2- hypnozoites and LISP2+ trophozoites show identical PV1 staining patterns. Strikingly, PV1 protein co-localizes with LISP2 in LISP2++ schizonts, which suggests that LISP2 could be a PV resident protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>).

Anti-malarial drug discovery efforts against established hypnozoites and thus preventing relapse is hampered by numerous roadblocks, including lack of high-throughput screening assays that can predict relapse. Most importantly, drug development is hindered by lack of tractable markers that can assess hypnozoite reactivation and monitor the therapeutic efficacy of anti-relapse compounds. The data presented here, and graphically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> suggest that the LISP2 protein expression could be a powerful tool to distinguish dormant hypnozoites from activated hypnozoites that differentiated to developing forms in relapse drug assays.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43362.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic model to distinguish hypnozoites from other liver stages based on PI4K drug susceptibility.</title><p>Malaria liver stage infection begins when infective sporozoites injected by mosquitoes invade host hepatocytes.

Sporozoite transformation into early liver stage development coincides with LISP2 expression. LISP2 expression marks the beginning of liver stage development at day 3 and its expression increases as liver stage progresses into complete maturation. Sporozoites of relapsing malaria species such as <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> can generate dormant hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wells et al., 2010</xref>). LISP2- Hz exhibits UIS4 prominence on PVM (shown in green) and grows till day 5 and remains persistent and unchanged from day 5 onwards. LISP2 +Tz display crescent staining pattern (shown in red) which colocalizes with UIS4 protein on PVM. Beyond day 6 post-sporozoite infection, both LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz have identical size and can only be discriminated on the basis of susceptibility to PI4K inhibitor. The shaded areas (in orange) represent the parasite that can be eliminated by both PI4K inhibitors and 8-aminoquinoline drugs.

We show that LISP2 is first detected in a characteristic crescent-shape pattern in a subset of small parasites (LISP2+) at day 3 post sporozoite infection, suggesting that LISP2 expression marks the beginning of liver stage development. From day 4 to days 9–10, LISP2 expression increases as parasites mature and grow, and LISP2 distribution drastically expands throughout the parasite membrane and cytosolic vacuoles (LISP2++). The cellular function of these previously reported vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tarun et al., 2006</xref>) is unclear but it has been proposed that this is the cellular compartment in which LISP2 6-cys domain is cleaved and mediates LISP2 N-terminal region export to the hepatocyte cytosol through its signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orito et al., 2013</xref>). Throughout the 21-day period, we found that a significant proportion of persistent small parasites do not express LISP2 (LISP2-). This LISP2 pattern of developmental expression in liver-stages is fully recapitulated in vivo in the liver of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infected human-chimeric liver mice. We also observed that in early developing parasites (LISP2+ trophozoites), UIS4 and LISP2 co-localize at the previously reported <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) prominence which was proposed to play a crucial role in the biogenesis and initial development of liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mikolajczak et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, LISP2- hypnozoites and LISP2+ trophozoites appear as two different subpopulations of parasites which are of similar size range and both exhibit the UIS4-prominence characteristic of hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mikolajczak et al., 2015</xref>). Although the UIS4 prominence was initially regarded as a marker of established <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites, recent reports have shown that it is also present in small developing forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gural et al., 2018</xref>). We could confirm these observations in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> parasites and further establish that the presence of LISP2 in the UIS4 prominence uniquely distinguishes the early trophozoites from the similarly sized population of established hypnozoites that remain LISP2 negative.</p><p>In <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages we found that the PV protein PV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morita et al., 2018</xref>), localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole, which is a critical interface that separates parasite from host hepatocyte cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, we found that LISP2 and PV1 proteins extensively co-localize throughout schizogony, from early developing trophozoites (LISP2+) to late schizonts (LISP2++). PV1 interacts with the export machinery required for the trafficking of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins across PVM to infected erythrocytes during blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morita et al., 2018</xref>) and further functional studies will be required to determine whether LISP2 and PV1 play similar roles in liver stages.</p><p>In both, in vitro P. cynomolgi culture and in vivo P. vivax model, we observe LISP2+ trophozoites throughout the time course of our studies. Although we cannot entirely rule out that some of the LISP2+ trophozoites observed are developmentally arrested forms, our data showing (1), active transcription with positive H3K9 staining and (2), the emergence of LISP2+ trophozoites after prophylactic drug treatments, strongly suggest that LISP2+ trophozoites result from hypnozoite activation or relapse. Given the large difference in the inoculum used in our experimental models it is however not clear how the observations reported above relate to clinical malaria relapse rates. Indeed, it is well known that the size of the sporozoites inoculum critically influences the relapse rate observed in simian <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schmidt, 1986</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of our study is that we could not monitor LISP2 expression in real-time at the cellular level to unambiguously establish the progressive transition from LISP2- persistent hypnozoites, to LISP2+ trophozoites. Nonetheless, the kinetics of LISP2 expression in vitro (<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>) and in vivo (<italic>P. vivax</italic>) suggests that LISP2 protein expression is an early event of liver-stage development. Genetic engineering of GFP-expressing parasites reporting the protein localization of LISP2 over time will more firmly establish this developmental sequence and it will help to better delineate the transition from activating hypnozoite to early schizont.</p><p>Finally, we show that in <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> infected hepatocytes, the radical cure drug TQ was potently active on all hepatic stages irrespective of LISP2 expression. In sharp contrast KDU691, a selective inhibitor of the PI4K enzyme, potently clears LISP2 positive (LISP2+ and LISP2++) parasites, but is inactive on persistent LISP2-negative (LISP2-) parasites.</p><p>Taken together our data show that the LISP2- parasites display the morphological characteristics and the pharmacological susceptibility profile—sensitivity to 8-aminoquinoline drugs and phenotypic resistance to the prophylactic drug KDU691—of dormant hypnozoites. LISP2 expression closely coincides with the beginning of liver-stage development and is a marker of malaria relapse. These findings will enable the design of novel in vitro assays that directly measure the anti-relapse drug effects in vitro by measuring and following LISP2 activation. Finally, and importantly, our study provides an additional molecular feature to our definition of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> hypnozoites, now defined as small, uni-nuclear persistent hepatic parasites with a UIS4-prominence lacking the LISP2 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Primary simian hepatocytes</td><td valign="top">Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Netherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated from Macaca mulatta,</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Primary simian hepatocytes</td><td valign="top">SingHealth, Singapore</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated from Macaca fascicularis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>)</td><td valign="top">sporozoites</td><td valign="top">Armed forces research institute of medical sciences (AFRIMS) Bangkok</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> mosquito infected with <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological <break/>sample (<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>)</td><td valign="top">sporozoites</td><td valign="top">Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Netherlands</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquito infected with <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>P. vivax</italic>)</td><td valign="top">sporozoites</td><td valign="top">Mahidol University</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>Anopheles dirus</italic> mosquito infected with <italic>P. vivax</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse anti-LISP2 antibody (monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">synthesized by genscript; IFA (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-PV1 antibody <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">synthesized by genscript; IFA (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-HSP70 antibody (polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">synthesized by genscript; IFA (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti-H3K9ac <break/>antibody (monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam,</td><td valign="top">ab177177</td><td valign="top">IFA (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">11034</td><td valign="top">IFA (1:4000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">11032</td><td valign="top">IFA (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence- <break/>based reagent</td><td valign="top">RNA FISH probes</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">CCK-8 kit</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">96992 100TESTS-F</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">KDU691</td><td valign="top">Novartis internal chemical library</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Synthesized by Novartis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Atovaquone (ATQ)</td><td valign="top">Novartis internal chemical library</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Synthesized by Novartis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Tafenoquine (TQ)</td><td valign="top">Novartis internal chemical library</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Synthesized by Novartis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DMSO</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">D8418</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Nonhuman primates were used because no other models (in vitro or in vivo) were suitable for the aims of this project.

The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by Envision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Parasite immuno-fluorescence assay (IFA) and RNA FISH</title><p><italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages were detected with anti-<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> HSP70 (PcyM_0515400) polyclonal antibody, anti-<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> LISP2 (PcyM_0307500) monoclonal antibody, anti-H3K9ac monoclonal antibody (Abcam, ab177177) and anti-<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> PV1 (PcyM_0933600) polyclonal antibody. The polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies used in our study were synthesized by Genscript. Briefly, using codon optimization and BacPowerTM bacterial protein expression technology, the selected epitopes were synthesized and used for immunization of animals as per Genscript established methods. Following 100% cold methanol fixation at the defined time points, <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> cultures were first incubated for two hours at 37°C with the primary antibodies. Anti-<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> HSP70 polyclonal antibody diluted 1:2000 in 1XPBS, anti-<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> LISP2 monoclonal antibody diluted 1: 500 in 1XPBS, anti-H3K9ac monoclonal antibody diluted in 1:1000 in 1X PBS and anti-<italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> PV1 polyclonal antibody diluted 1: 500 in 1XPBS. Subsequently to 2 hr of incubation with these antibodies was followed by three washing with 1X PBS. To reveal hepatic stages parasites, cultures were then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (11034 Invitrogen) and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin and supplemented with 1 μg per ml of DAPI (Sigma) to stain parasites and cells nuclei for 1 hr. Secondary antibodies were removed by three washing with 1X PBS. Infected plates were kept with 1X PBS at 4°C for further parasite imaging and quantification. RNA-FISH was performed in the 96-well plates using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Assay v2 kit from Advanced Cell Diagnostics essentially according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following rehydration protease digestions were performed using pretreatment solution three from the kit at 1:10 dilution for 20 min at room temperature. Hybridizations were 2 hr at 40°C. Probes used were directed against <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> HSP70 (PcyM_0515400, region 606–1837 of XM_004221103.1) and LISP2 (PcyM_0307500, region 2866–3853 of XM_004220801.1). After hybridization, TSA amplification steps were performed as described by the manufacturer. Following DAPI staining, cells were kept in PBS for imaging or immunofluorescence analysis. Images were acquired with a Leica DMI6000B inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a DFC365FX camera using a HC PL APO 63x/1.40–0.60 oil objective. To evaluate specificity of RNA FISH signal, we have carried out RNAse A treatment before hybridization and we observe total loss of signal as compared to without RNAse A treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This negative control confirms the specificity of the LISP2 signal.</p><p>For visualization of <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages in huHep mouse livers, livers were harvested and fixed for 24 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde. Liver lobes were cut into 50 µm sections using a Vibratome apparatus (Ted Pella Inc, Redding, CA). For IFA, sections were permeabilized in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were then blocked in TBS containing 5% dried milk at least 1 hr and incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight. <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages were detected with polyclonal LISP2 antibody (PVX_000975) (1:200) and monoclonal antibody specific for <italic>P. vivax</italic> UIS4 protein (PVX_001715) (1:500). Secondary antibodies were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. Fluorescence images were acquired using an Olympus Delta Vision microscope equipped with deconvolution software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Parasite imaging and quantification</title><p>Enumeration of <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stage parasites was done under a fluorescence NIKON ECLIPSE TS100 microscope with a 40X magnification.

The authors describe a protein, LISP2, that appears to be a reliable marker of hypnozoite reactivation in liver stage malaria parasites. This is an exciting discovery since two human malaria species (<italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. ovale</italic>) produce dormant hypnozoites that can reactivate days or months later, greatly complicating malaria treatment and diagnosis. Although 8-aminoquinolines like primaquine and tafenoquine are active against hypnozoites, drug discovery of new compounds and compound classes would be facilitated by the discovery of a molecular marker able to discriminate between hypnozoites and similarly sized cells that are in the early stages of reactivation. The authors describe the discovery of LISP2 in a transcriptomic study of liver stage <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> malaria parasites (a simian model for <italic>P. vivax</italic>) and examine LISP2 expression by IFA and FISH in a primary simian hepatocyte culture system. These data and particularly the quantitative analysis shown in Figure 3B make an excellent case for hynozoites remaining LISP2 negative until reactivation and similar phenomena are shown for <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites in an in vivo humanized mouse infection system. Consistent with these findings, the authors show that LISP2 negative <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> parasites (presumably hypnozoites) are sensitive to tafenoquine, but not to other antimalarial drugs. The drug susceptibility data in particular highlight the utility of LISP2 as marker for hypnozoite reactivation. For this purpose, it would be even better if LISP2 was actually a maker of hypnozoites rather than a marker of non-dormant parasites, but the authors state in their Introduction that transcriptomic studies have so far failed to identify a marker for the hypnozoites themselves. There is one area where the authors do not do a good job of highlighting their discovery. I would assume that a whole host of genes are expressed at high levels in metabolically active liver stage parasites compared to dormant hypnozoites. The significance of the LISP2 discovery would be that it is an earlier marker of reactivation. Can the authors show that reactivating cells become LISP2 positive prior to the increased abundance of other potential protein markers of active growth (enzymes of processes like glycolysis or nucleotide metabolism)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the reactivation of dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) in the in vitro <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> model as well as in in vivo (humanized mice) <italic>P. vivax</italic> model. Identification of markers distinguishing between arrested and developing liver stages is of great importance for the development of drugs targeting hypnozoites. Previous transcriptional profiling of small (early and dormant) and large (schizont) liver stages revealed that the lisp2 transcript is abundant in large stages and is also expressed in small stages. Remarkably, the lisp2 expression could distinguish three populations of <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stages, two of which were previously described – 1) small dormant hypnozoites, 2) developing multinucleated liver schizonts and an additional new population of 3) small liver trophozoites in the process of reactivation. Similar results were obtained in <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected humanized mice. The notion that LISP2 marks parasites that are actively developing in the liver is further supported by the selective drug susceptibility of these stages. The manuscript is written clearly, presented data are of good quality and conclusions are valid. The authors should address some spelling mistakes within the manuscript text.</p><p>There are a few weak points that should be addressed:</p><p>1) While authors state that transcriptional activity is much weaker in dormant hypnozoites than in developing trophozoites, they only show H3K9Ac staining for hypnozoites and schizonts (not trophozoites) in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. This marker could be very useful to identify the point of reactivation (hypnozoite to trophozoite transition) and shed more light on whether the lisp2 expression indeed tightly correlates with this transition.</p><p>2) All LISP2 detection was performed using staining with a single antibody (two antibodies for <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic>, respectively). These antibodies were raised against recombinant proteins corresponding to a part of the LISP2 protein. Importantly, the specificity of the antibodies was verified by western blots using the same recombinant proteins. To make sure that the native protein is specifically recognized, lysates of infected liver cells should be used for verification. Given the high LISP2 abundance, its detection should be possible despite the low amount of parasite material in the infected liver cells lysate.</p><p>3) <italic>P. berghei</italic> LISP2 protein has been shown to be exported to the host cell cytoplasm and the nucleus (Morita et al., 2018), however, this does not seem to be the case for <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> LISP2 in this study. Detection of LISP2 in infected liver cells by Western blot (as suggested in point 2) would additionally shed light on the processing of LISP2 in the liver stages of <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and allow to speculate on the causes of differential localization (while ruling out the option that the observed localization is an artefact based on cross-reactivity with other antigens).</p><p>4) Antibody recognizing PV1 is not well characterized. Western blotting using lysates of infected liver cells (see point 2) should be used to verify its specificity.</p><p>5) Authors speculate that LISP2 localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole or its extensions (cytoplasmic vacuoles) based on colocalization with PV1. However, the localization in most images resembles vesicles of the secretory pathway (which were also suggested for localization of both LISP2 in Morita et al., 2018 and PV1 (dense granules) in Chu, Lingelbach and Przyborski, 2011). Assuming that the antibody specifically stains LISP2 (see point 2), imaging of z-stacks followed by 3D reconstruction could shed more light on whether LISP2 truly localizes to the PV and its extensions or rather to isolated vesicles of the secretory pathway.</p><p>6) Adding references to figures in the conclusions would, in my opinion, increase the clarity of the text for the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>LISP2 is a protein specifically expressed by plasmodial hepatic stages, required for the hepatic <italic>P. berghei</italic> merozoite formation. The manuscript entitled &quot;The Plasmodium Liver-Specific Protein 2 (LISP2) is an early marker of liver stage development&quot; shows that this protein is differentially expressed in uni-nucleated hypnozoites and growing hepatic trophozoites/schizonts, using two species of relapsing parasites (<italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>). Parasite stages were both defined/characterized morphologically and pharmacologically. This negative marker of hypnozoites and positive marker of growing liver stages can be used together with the parasite size and ploidy to discriminate these two populations, e.g., in anti-parasite/relapse drug-screening assays.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: <italic>P. vivax</italic> does not affect 2.5 billion people. Please revise.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: The argument that <italic>P. vivax</italic> research remains neglected does not seem to be justified based on the authors' rational. According to the authors, <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria represents only ~4% of the global malaria cases (8.5 M/ 219 M), which roughly matches the 5% of global investment. Please revise or better justify.</p><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, first paragraph: Please cite the manuscript of Orito et al., 2013 after the mention of PbLISP2. The description of PbLISP2 localization and function is also missing.</p><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, last paragraph: The way the phrase is constructed gives the impression that relapsing-plasmodial species have more similar LISP2 amino acid sequence when compared to other non-relapsing species. This does not seem to be the case, since the LISP2 of <italic>P. ovale</italic>, another relapsing-plasmodial species, has only 55% of AA identity with Pv LISP2 6-cys domain, while <italic>P. coatneyi</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, two non-relapsing parasites, have 76 and 74% of identity, respectively. This stronger similarity is probably due to their closer genetic origin than relapsing-capacity. Please rectify.</p><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, last paragraph: Anti-Pv and Pc LISP2 antibodies were tested against the respective recombinant proteins used to generate them, but not against the respective parasites/ infected hepatocytes. Since the 6-cysteine domain is conserved among plasmodial proteins, it would be judicious to test the antibodies in a Western Blot using infected hepatocytes to assess the complexity of the antibody binding.</p><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, last paragraph: What is the peripheral membrane? The parasitophorous vacuole membrane? It is not clear in the figures if LISP2 is colocalizing with UIS4, apart from the inset of Figure 2B (prominence).</p><p>Subsections “Assessment of LISP2 expression in <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages”, “LISP2 expression differentiates dormant hypnozoites from developing liver stages”, last paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph: LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz does not seem to have identical size according to the Figure 3B and scheme of Figure 5 (&lt;8 days). Please apply a statistical analysis and clarify.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;schizonts were remarkably more transcriptional active than hypnozoites&quot; based on the number of H3K9ac structures. Since schizonts are multinucleated, a more informative way to strengthen this point would be to normalize the staining intensity of H3K9 per nucleus.</p><p>Subsection “LISP2 expression differentiates dormant hypnozoites from developing liver stages”, last paragraph: Please justify the fact that LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz are identical in size. Additionally, remove the &quot;only&quot; in the phrase since these two populations can apparently be distinguished based on the parasite size (Days 3-6), and also by the intensity (ploidy) of nuclear staining (please see the parasite nuclei in Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Please compare the intensity of the nuclear staining of LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz and correct the scheme of Figure 5 accordingly.</p><p>Discussion, fifth paragraph: No data presented in the manuscript allows inferring the essentiality of LISP2 in the liver-stage development. Please remove &quot;essential&quot; from the phrase.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2 legend: At day 15, the pattern of LISP2 staining in the merged panel resembles the host cytoplasmic staining published by Orito et al., 2013. It would be important to confirm if Pv/Pc LISP2 is also exported to the cytoplasm/nucleus of the infected host cell.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43362.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In support of your claim, please address the question of antibody specificity experimentally to demonstrate that the protein is a marker for actively developing liver parasites.

We have tried to generate antibodies against such proteins with limited success so far and the PV1 antibodies reported here is the result of those efforts. The Ferredoxin antibodies we have previously reported (Voorberg et al., 2017) were made in mouse, like the LISP2 antibodies, which unfortunately precludes double staining IFA experiments. Nonetheless, we would like to point out that in these experiments we have not observed expression of Ferredoxin in the early developing liver-stage forms in an expression pattern that is consistent with the LISP2 expression we report here. Although we agree that only double staining could unambiguously prove this point, our data seem to suggest that indeed LISP2 expression precedes Ferredoxin protein expression in liver schizonts. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no other available <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> (or <italic>P. vivax</italic>) specific antibodies that would allow us to make such a statement more definitively. We will certainly try to address this question as soon as such reagents would become available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the reactivation of dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) in the in vitro P. cynomolgi model as well as in in vivo (humanized mice) P. vivax model.

The manuscript entitled &quot;The Plasmodium Liver-Specific Protein 2 (LISP2) is an early marker of liver stage development&quot; shows that this protein is differentially expressed in uni-nucleated hypnozoites and growing hepatic trophozoites/schizonts, using two species of relapsing parasites (P. vivax and P. cynomolgi). Parasite stages were both defined/characterized morphologically and pharmacologically. This negative marker of hypnozoites and positive marker of growing liver stages can be used together with the parasite size and ploidy to discriminate these two populations, e.g., in anti-parasite/relapse drug-screening assays.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: P. vivax does not affect 2.5 billion people. Please revise.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence as follows:</p><p>“<italic>P. vivax</italic> is the second most prevalent malarial pathogen, with a wider geographical distribution than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, suggested to be a risk of malaria infection for 2.5 billion people.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, first paragraph: The argument that P. vivax research remains neglected does not seem to be justified based on the authors' rational. According to the authors, P. vivax malaria represents only ~4% of the global malaria cases (8.5 M/ 219 M), which roughly matches the 5% of global investment. Please revise or better justify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this clarification and have thus revised the sentence as follows:</p><p>“Despite its high prevalence in many malaria endemic countries, <italic>P. vivax</italic> research is restricted to few laboratories and limited progress have been made.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, first paragraph: Please cite the manuscript of Orito et al., 2013 after the mention of PbLISP2. The description of PbLISP2 localization and function is also missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the requested changes in the first paragraph of the subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, last paragraph: The way the phrase is constructed gives the impression that relapsing-plasmodial species have more similar LISP2 amino acid sequence when compared to other non-relapsing species. This does not seem to be the case, since the LISP2 of P. ovale, another relapsing-plasmodial species, has only 55% of AA identity with Pv LISP2 6-cys domain, while P. coatneyi and P. knowlesi, two non-relapsing parasites, have 76 and 74% of identity, respectively. This stronger similarity is probably due to their closer genetic origin than relapsing-capacity. Please rectify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this point.</p><p>We agree with that the 6-cys domain is highly conserved across <italic>Plasmodium</italic> orthologs and we have thus removed this sentence to avoid the possible confusion highlighted by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, last paragraph: Anti-Pv and Pc LISP2 antibodies were tested against the respective recombinant proteins used to generate them, but not against the respective parasites/ infected hepatocytes. Since the 6-cysteine domain is conserved among plasmodial proteins, it would be judicious to test the antibodies in a Western Blot using infected hepatocytes to assess the complexity of the antibody binding.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to reviewer 2 point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “LISP2 is an early marker of parasite development in the liver”, last paragraph: What is the peripheral membrane? The parasitophorous vacuole membrane? It is not clear in the figures if LISP2 is colocalizing with UIS4, apart from the inset of Figure 2B (prominence).</p></disp-quote><p>Here the peripheral membrane represents LISP2 staining around the parasite body in a circumferential manner. We later showed co-localization of LISP2 with PV1, a parasitophorous vacuole marker (Figure 3C).</p><p>We observed only partial overlap of LISP2 and UIS4 at the so-called prominence as seen in Figure 2B. In developing stages, these two proteins do not overlap as shown in Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsections “Assessment of LISP2 expression in P. vivax liver stages”, “LISP2 expression differentiates dormant hypnozoites from developing liver stages”, last paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph: LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz does not seem to have identical size according to the Figure 3B and scheme of Figure 5 (&lt;8days). Please apply a statistical analysis and clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we meant to say that these two parasite populations’ sizes range similarly. We apologies for this confusion. In the updated manuscript, we have amended the sentences accordingly to clarify this point (subsection “Assessment of LISP2 expression in <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages”, subsection “LISP2 expression differentiates dormant hypnozoites from developing liver stages”, last paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that &quot;schizonts were remarkably more transcriptional active than hypnozoites&quot; based on the number of H3K9ac structures. Since schizonts are multinucleated, a more informative way to strengthen this point would be to normalize the staining intensity of H3K9 per nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated earlier in response to reviewer 2 (point 1), we do not suggest that H3K9 allows for the quantitative assessment of transcriptional activity across liver-stages and our statement regarding the lower transcriptional activity of hypnozoites is based on our previously reported transcriptomic analysis (Voorberg et al., 2017 and Bertschi et al. 2018). Thus we not believe that a normalization of the signal is warranted at this stage. Nevertheless, in the revised figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), we provided additional images of all three liver-stages (i.e. Hz, Tz and Sz) which allows for the visual resolution of individual nuclei so the reader can directly compare the distribution and expression of this marker across the development of the parasite in the liver. We also reconstructed 3-D images of schizonts using de-convoluted Z stack images co-stained with H3K9ac and LISP2. These Z stacks clearly showed LISP2 staining surrounding the cellular body in a circumferential pattern while H3K9ac localized to what appears to be individual nuclear structures within schizonts. In the revised manuscript, we have included this additional video (see Video 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “LISP2 expression differentiates dormant hypnozoites from developing liver stages”, last paragraph: Please justify the fact that LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz are identical in size. Additionally, remove the &quot;only&quot; in the phrase since these two populations can apparently be distinguished based on the parasite size (Days 3-6), and also by the intensity (ploidy) of nuclear staining (please see the parasite nuclei in Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Please compare the intensity of the nuclear staining of LISP2- Hz and LISP2+ Tz and correct the scheme of Figure 5 accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>See our seventh response to reviewer 3 (above).
