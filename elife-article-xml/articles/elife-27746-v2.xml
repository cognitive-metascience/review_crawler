While this can be prevented by enforced expression of the related SOXB1 proteins, SOX1 or SOX3, the roles of SOXB1 proteins in epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) pluripotency are unknown. Here, we show that <italic>Sox2</italic> can be deleted from EpiSCs with impunity. This is due to a shift in the balance of SoxB1 expression in EpiSCs, which have decreased Sox2 and increased Sox3 compared to ESCs. Consistent with functional redundancy, <italic>Sox3</italic> can also be deleted from EpiSCs without eliminating self-renewal. However, deletion of both <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox3</italic> prevents self-renewal. The overall SOXB1 levels in ESCs affect differentiation choices: neural differentiation of <italic>Sox2</italic> heterozygous ESCs is compromised, while increased SOXB1 levels divert the ESC to EpiSC transition towards neural differentiation. Therefore, optimal SOXB1 levels are critical for each pluripotent state and for cell fate decisions during exit from naïve pluripotency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pluripotency</kwd><kwd>Sox</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>Embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>Epiblast stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corsinotti</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Frederick CK</given-names></name><name><surname>Halbritter</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><name><surname>Colby</surname><given-names>Douglas</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullin</surname><given-names>Nicholas P</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall-Ponsele</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Japan partnering award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic manipulations show that endogenous transcription factors of the SoxB1 class act redundantly to maintain primed pluripotency and reveal differential effects on transitions between pluripotent and differentiation states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pluripotent cells have the unique ability to differentiate into every cell type of an adult organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). During mouse development, the embryo contains pluripotent cells in the epiblast until the onset of somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osorno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers and Tomlinson, 2009</xref>). Distinct pluripotent cell types can be isolated in culture from the preimplantation and postimplantation epiblast. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Kaufman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin, 1981</xref>) from preimplantation embryos are termed ‘naïve’ pluripotent cells. Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brons et al., 2007</xref>), commonly isolated from the post-implantation epiblast, are known as ‘primed’ pluripotent cells. Naïve and primed cells differ dramatically in responses to extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). ESCs self-renew in response to a combination of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and either foetal calf serum (FCS), bone morphogenic protein (BMP) or Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ying et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">ten Berge et al., 2011</xref>) and differentiate in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kunath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stavridis et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, FGF together with Nodal/Activin A are required for EpiSCs self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vallier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Pluripotency is regulated by a pluripotency gene regulatory network (PGRN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers and Tomlinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Festuccia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). While some transcription factors such as Esrrb and T (Brachyury) are associated more closely with naïve or primed pluripotent states respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Festuccia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osorno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsakiridis et al., 2014</xref>), the core TFs of the PGRN, Nanog, Sox2 and Oct4 (the <italic>Pou5f1</italic> gene product, also referred as Oct3/4) are expressed in both naïve and primed pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avilion et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karwacki-Neisius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Osorno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Festuccia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>). While the role of Sox2 has been extensively characterised in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wong et al., 2016</xref>), its role in primed pluripotency is less well known.</p><p>Sox2 is a member of a family of twenty Sox TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pevny and Lovell-Badge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamachi and Kondoh, 2013</xref>). All SOX proteins contain a High-Mobility-Group (HMG) box DNA-binding domain closely related to the founding member of the Sox family, SRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondoh and Lovell-Badge, 2016</xref>). While some SOX proteins contain a transcriptional activation domain, others contain repression domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uchikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambrosetti et al., 2000</xref>). The paradigm of action for SOX proteins is that they bind to target gene sequences through a DNA-mediated interaction with a partner protein, to specify target gene selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamachi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reményi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamachi and Kondoh, 2013</xref>). In pluripotent cells the principal interaction of SOX2 with OCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambrosetti et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2000</xref>) is considered to positively regulate expression of many pluripotency-specific genes including <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomioka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chew et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okumura-Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rodda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuroda et al., 2005</xref>). Loss of SOX2 in ESCs induces trophoblast differentiation, phenocopying OCT4 loss and supporting the idea of a mutually dependent mode of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masui et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of sequence conservation within the HMG box has divided the Sox family into eight groups that can be further divided into subgroups based on homology outside the HMG box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kondoh and Lovell-Badge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamachi, 2016</xref>). SOX1, SOX2 and SOX3 belong to the SOXB1 group and also contain transcriptional activation domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uchikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambrosetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kondoh and Kamachi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamachi and Kondoh, 2013</xref>). SOXB1 proteins bind the same DNA sequence in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamachi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamachi, 2016</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that SOXB1 factors are co-expressed during embryonic development and can substitute for each other in different biological systems, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wood and Episkopou, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Niwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adikusuma et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we investigate the requirements of naïve and primed pluripotent states for SOXB1 expression. Our results indicate that the essential requirement of SOXB1 function for naïve pluripotent cells extends to primed pluripotent cells. SOX3, which is highly expressed in primed pluripotent cells, functions redundantly with SOX2, rendering SOX2 dispensable in these cells. We further provide evidence that critical SOXB1 levels are required to specify the identity of cells exiting the naïve pluripotent state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A fluorescent reporter of SOX2 protein expression</title><p>To investigate the expression of Sox2 in pluripotent cells, a live cell reporter that retained Sox2 function was prepared by replacing the <italic>Sox2</italic> stop codon with a T2A-H2B-tdTomato cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Decreased SOXB1 concentrations are insufficient to enable neural differentiation due to increased activity of neural antagonists (BMP and Nodal). A further reduction in SOXB1 is tolerated in the primed state due to SOX2/SOX3 functional redundancy but complete loss of the predominant SoxB1 forms is incompatible with self-renewal of both naïve and primed pluripotent cells.

This was hypothesised to be due to the fact that neither Sox1 nor Sox3 were expressed sufficiently at the time of embryonic failure and therefore no redundantly acting SOXB1 protein could compensate for the SOX2 absence. Additional instances of potential SoxB1 redundancy have been reported in vivo. Replacement of an endogenous <italic>Sox2</italic> allele with a Sox1 ORF produced no phenotype, suggestive of functional interchangeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekonomou et al., 2005</xref>). SOXB1 redundancy is likely to be evolutionarily conserved since in the chick, Sox2 and Sox3 both promote development of ectoderm and neurectoderm at gastrulation, although interestingly, in this case Sox3 expression occurs before Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acloque et al., 2011</xref>).

ComBat was used to account for batch effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leek and Storey, 2007</xref>) between microarrays run at different dates. Differential expression in the log2-transformed data was assessed with the limma algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smyth, 2005</xref>). Probes were considered differentially expressed if they showed a FDR-adjusted p-value of ≤ 0.1 and an absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change ≥ log2(1.5). Primary analysis results were uploaded to GeneProf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halbritter et al., 2011</xref>) and mapped to Ensembl-based reference genes, collapsing multiple probes for the same gene by picking the most responsive probe (i.e., the probe with the highest absolute fold change across all pair-wise comparisons).

The authors show that Sox2 can be deleted from EpiSCs without affecting their potential, which is due to functional redundancy with Sox3. This is claimed to be a surprising result, but it is really quite predictable, given the co-expression of the two genes, and that they are known to be functionally equivalent (see for example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515211;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10446282), with Sox3 at slightly higher levels and slightly more extensively expressed than Sox2. Indeed, compared to the mouse, the two genes have swapped prominence in the chick embryo, with Sox3 preceding Sox2, and with both acting in the same way antagonistically to Snail, in helping to promote ectoderm/neurectoderm development during gastrulation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920318).</p><p>The authors show that Sox3 can also be deleted from EpiSCs without eliminating self-renewal.

Several of the in vivo findings are at odds with the claims being made here for the role of Soxb1 genes in ESCs and EpiSCs in vitro. This begs the question as to the relevance of this current work. If the authors had gone on to define the downstream genes required for neurectoderm, etc., fate, or the mechanisms involved in crosstalk or feedback regulation between Sox2 and Sox3, then this would be important.

We refer to this work as indicated below (Introduction, last paragraph and subsection “SOXB1 redundancy in vivo”). The second paper referred to above is Wood and Episkopou, a classic RNA in situ hybridisation study that we have cited in our manuscript and that shows overlapping Sox2 and Sox3 expression domains in the post-implantation epiblast. We accept the reviewer’s point that these overlapping expression domains, together with other studies referred to later by the reviewer are sufficient to suggest our findings are unsurprising. Therefore, we have deleted the relevant instances of ‘surprising’ from our manuscript and reframed our discussion in light of the papers that the reviewer has kindly brought to our attention. However, neither of the studies above, nor any of the studies that the reviewer refers to below have tested the functional redundancy of Sox2 and Sox3 in postimplantation pluripotency and therefore our results are novel.</p><p>We have reserved the use of the word ‘surprising’ in the revised manuscript for the unexpected up-regulation of Sox2 mRNA upon deletion of Sox3, rescuing neural differentiation of <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells and indicating a novel cross-regulatory relationship between the SoxB genes (subsection “<underline>Modulating SOXB1 levels affects differentiation and can prevent capture of primed pluripotency, fifth paragraph</underline> and subsection “Low SoxB1 levels permit entry to the EpiSC state”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, compared to the mouse, the two genes have swapped prominence in the chick embryo, with Sox3 preceding Sox2, and with both acting in the same way antagonistically to Snail, in helping to promote ectoderm/neurectoderm development during gastrulation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920318).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is relevant background and have included a reference to the Acloque paper in the Discussion, ‘in the chick, Sox2 and Sox3 both promote development of ectoderm and neurectoderm at gastrulation, although interestingly, in this case Sox3 expression occurs before Sox2 (Acloque et al.).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that Sox3 can also be deleted from EpiSCs without eliminating self-renewal.

(shows Sox3 is required for pituitary function), Rizzoti &amp; Lovell-Badge (shows that Sox3 is required for correct craniofacial morphogenesis) and Adikusuma et al. (knock-in of Sox2 to the Sox3 locus referred to above). While each of these papers indicates that <italic>Sox3</italic>-null mice can be viable and that therefore there may not be an essential requirement for Sox3 in the epiblast, there are suggestions that things may not be so simple.</p><p>Rizzotti et al. (2004) state as an unpublished observation that there is early gastrulation lethality of Sox3 on 129 genetic background and that a viable phenotype was only observed in conditional nulls on an outbred background. Adikusuma et al. also report failure to generate Sox3<sup>Sox2KI</sup> mice from targeted clones via conventional gene targeting in ES cells, followed by blastocyst injection of these cells. Subsequently, Adikusuma et al. obtained the <italic>Sox3<sup>Sox2KI</sup></italic> allele using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy via pronuclear injection of C57Bl/6 zygotes. The failure of two independent groups to establish mice from knock-out Sox3 on a 129 background points to a requirement for Sox3 that goes beyond the reported viability on an outbred background.</p><p>We have shown that Sox3 contributes to the total SoxB1 levels required for postimplantation pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that subtle strain-specific variations in Sox2 levels/timing in postimplantation embryos may exist, which permit maintenance of Sox3 KO ES cells but not embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Deletion of both Sox2 and Sox3 was found to prevent self-renewal of EpiSCs.

Moreover, our results point to a model wherein both genes contribute to maintain threshold SoxB1 levels required for postimplantation pluripotency – as alluded to by Avilion et al.

We have taken on board the reviewers’ suggestions and have now discussed previous in vivo findings in relation to our results (we have indicated these in response to detailed points elsewhere in this document).</p><p>To address whether we were indeed chasing an artefactual inability of SCKO to undergo neural differentiation, we independently generated <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> ESCs using CRISPR. Two new <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> ESC clones derived independently using two different sgRNAs confirmed our findings that mutation of a <italic>Sox2</italic> allele in ESCs causes a defect in neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whether this was due to Sox2 protein level being insufficient to drive neural differentiation remained an open question that we have addressed as outlined below.</p><p>in vitro findings can highlight cellular requirements that are difficult to unpick in vivo. A key difference between in vitro and in vivo experiments is the ability to control the extracellular environment. Through in vitro studies using inhibitors of BMP and Nodal signalling, we have uncovered endogenous BMP and Nodal signalling in Sox2 heterozygous cells that block neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This establishes that the inability of <italic>Sox2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> ESCs to undergo neural differentiation is not an intrinsic cellular defect, but is due to an anti-neural environment. In the embryo, such an environment exists in the anterior epiblast and does not depend on Sox2.

Rizzoti et al.’s unpublished data suggests in fact that Sox3 may in fact be required in postimplantation pluripotent cells in specific genetic backgrounds (in this case, 129sv/ev).
