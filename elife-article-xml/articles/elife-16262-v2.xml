neuronal activity, but it has remained unclear whether NG2 glial cells integrate and respond to synaptic input. Here we show that NG2 cells perform linear integration of glutamatergic synaptic inputs and respond with increasing dendritic calcium elevations. Synaptic activity induces rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated by low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels under strict inhibitory control of voltage-gated A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can be global and originate throughout the cell. However, voltage-gated channels are also found in thin dendrites which act as compartmentalized processing units and generate local calcium transients. Taken together, the activity-dependent control of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by A-type channels and the global versus local signaling domains make intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in NG2 cells a prime signaling molecule to transform neurotransmitter release into activity-dependent myelination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16262.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16262.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NG2 cells</kwd><kwd>synaptic integration</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>A-type potassium channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BONFOR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Wenjing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoch</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ0806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoch</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP 1757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dietrich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dietrich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DI853/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dietrich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 1172/15-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dietrich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHO820/5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoch</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NG2 glial cells respond to synaptic input with calcium signals in the absence of action potentials and process synaptic depolarizations with somatic and dendritic voltage gated channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NG2-expressing glial cells (NG2 cells) are a large population of self-renewing cells present in substantial numbers in all white and grey matter regions of the CNS throughout development and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nishiyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trotter et al., 2010</xref>). NG2 cells are precursor cells to all oligodendrocytes, which exclusively provide isolating myelin to axons and are thereby essential for rapid conduction velocity while maintaining small axon diameter in compact brains. Recent evidence suggests that myelination is plastic and activity-dependent and that synaptic transmission to NG2 cells plays a key role in detecting patterns of activity. However, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity is integrated by NG2 cells and transformed into precisely tuned axonal conduction velocities via myelination is not known.</p><p>NG2 cells stand out from other glial cells as they receive direct vesicular synaptic input from neighboring axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin and Bergles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jabs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kukley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ziskin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karadottir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kukley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>), and based on these findings, it has recently been proposed that release of neurotransmitter onto NG2 cells may be the key signal mediating activity-dependent myelination and instructing the cells about the need to generate more oligodendrocytes and myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>). NG2 cells are also unique amongst glial cells as they express a large number of voltage-gated ion channels (VGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chittajallu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jabs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karadottir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke et al., 2012</xref>). However, while it is textbook knowledge that neurons use VGCs to integrate synaptic input and to transform it into a pattern of action potentials and associated calcium signals, the functional significance of VGCs and synaptic input in NG2 cells has so far remained obscure. NG2 cells are not capable of firing action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>) and their postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) are so small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jabs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haberlandt et al., 2011</xref>) that it has been questioned whether synaptic input can even achieve a relevant depolarization to recruit VGCs. Furthermore, previous attempts to elicit calcium signals in NG2 cells by synaptic stimulation failed and led the authors to conclude that the synaptic input was too weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haberlandt et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, at present, we do not know how NG2 cells could transform synaptic input into activity-dependent myelination.</p><p>On the other hand, the density of synapses might be massively underestimated, as the low frequency of spontaneous synaptic events may be due to the smaller surface area of NG2 cells when compared to that of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kukley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kukley et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the high-input impedance of the delicately thin dendritic branches could result in strong local depolarization even if the response arriving at the soma is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Dietrich, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Deciphering how NG2 cells can integrate and process synaptic input is of fundamental importance for understanding brain development and for improving re-myelination of damaged white matter. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether synaptic depolarizations recruit VGCs in the somatic or dendritic compartment of NG2 cells. We report that NG2 cells possess a dedicated signal integration machinery, different from that of neurons and other types of glial cells, and generate local dendritic or global Ca<sup>2+ </sup>responses depending on the pattern and type of incoming activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first set out to obtain a measure of the maximal level of synaptic depolarization of NG2 cells.

Realistic mock PSPs were generated by deriving the current injection waveform from miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded in NG2 cells representing the average conductance change in response to release of a single glutamate-filled vesicle. Upon increasing the amplitude of the injected current waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, grey shaded area) the response increased concomitantly, and we observed an obvious shortening of the voltage response (black line) reminiscent of the activation of VGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To analyze the impact of VGCs, we compared these mock PSP responses to tiny hyperpolarizations, which we produced by injecting very small negative mock currents designed to avoid activation of VGCs. We arithmetically scaled up such small voltage responses by the ratio of the injected current strengths (see Materials and methods for details) to create a hypothetical, large response unaffected by VGCs (dashed grey line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the contribution of different types of VGCs to the shortening of mock PSPs, we bath-applied established blockers of VGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The A-type K<sup>+</sup>-channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) potently reversed the shortening of the mock PSP and significantly increased the half-width from 2.4 ± 0.2 ms to 3.8 ± 0.5 ms (n=4, Paired <italic>t</italic>-test). In addition, 4-AP increased the amplitude of the mock PSP from 65.8 ± 2.1 mV to 78.7 ± 4.3 mV (significantly different, s.d., Paired <italic>t</italic>-test). By contrast, blocking Na<sup>+</sup> channels by using tetrodotoxin (TTX) significantly reduced the amplitude from 66.1 ± 0.9 mV to 57.9 ± 1.1 mV (n=7, Paired <italic>t</italic>-test), and also slightly increased the half width of PSPs (from 2.3 ± 0.3 ms to 3.0 ± 0.2 ms, s.d., Paired <italic>t</italic>-test). The latter is likely secondary to the reduced amplitude, which results in reduced recruitment of A-type channels. Delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels are not recruited by individual mock PSPs because tetraethylammonium (TEA) affected neither their amplitude nor their half-width (n = 6, Paired <italic>t</italic>-test).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16262.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels shorten mock PSPs in NG2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Blocking A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels with 4 mM 4-AP strongly broadens mock PSPs and increases their amplitude, while blocking Na<sup>+</sup> channels with 1 µM TTX slightly reduces their amplitude.

The grey line represents the average of the scaled passive responses for all examples shown (shaded area indicates standard error of the mean (SEM), n=4 cells).

We quantified VGC-induced changes of mock PSPs by dividing their amplitude and half-width by the amplitude and half-width of scaled passive responses (negative current injection as above) and plotted the resulting half-width- and amplitude-ratio against the membrane potential reached at the peak of the recorded mock PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). These plots clearly showed that in the absence of channel blockers, the durations of mock PSPs were increasingly shortened when the membrane depolarization exceeded −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, black line), consistent with the low-voltage activation range of A-type channels. Near the maximally attainable average depolarization of −16.5 ± 1.0 mV, the half-width ratio of mock PSPs was substantially shortened to 47.1 ± 3.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This shortening is almost exclusively due to the action of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, whereas blocking Na<sup>+</sup> and delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels did not detectably change the duration of mock PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In contrast to the half-width, the amplitude of mock PSPs was only slightly reduced, as indicated by an amplitude ratio near 1 even for large PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, black line). This linear scaling of the amplitude of mock PSPs in control conditions is a result of a balanced interplay of fast Na<sup>+</sup> and A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>): if A-type or Na<sup>+</sup> channels are blocked, the amplitude of mock PSPs is increased or decreased by ~15% and ~30%, respectively. Taken together, these results demonstrate a prominent role of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels in shaping synaptic input and suggest that even medium-sized synaptic input (∆ 20–30 mV) is accelerated by A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, while the amplitude of synaptic depolarizations faithfully encodes the input strength due to mutual antagonism of A-type K<sup>+</sup> and fast Na<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p>In neurons, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels are responsible for generating an action potential waveform upon integration of synaptic input. Action potentials are potent openers of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and elicit prominent calcium signals. Since NG2 cells do not fire action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>), we wondered whether PSPs may directly trigger intracellular calcium signals, and therefore combined 2-photon Ca<sup>2+ </sup>imaging with our mock PSP stimulation paradigm. During injection of a robust stimulus (10 mock PSPs at 100 Hz), we monitored the fluorescence of the calcium indicator dye Fluo-4 (200 µM) with line-scans across proximal dendrites and the soma of NG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Indeed, we detected clear calcium transients in the soma and proximal dendrites (3.9 ± 1.3% and 12.7 ± 1.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals required the activation of VGCCs, as they were highly sensitive to a cocktail of VGCCs blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>).

Scanning areas and focus planes were selected to almost fully contain at least one primary dendrite which extended up to ~35 µm from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Injection of 10 mock PSPs as above generated an almost immediate increase in fluorescence throughout all scanned dendrites, which decayed on the order of several seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). We quantified this signal within regions of interest (ROIs) covering successive 5 µm segments along dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This analysis showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude remained constant throughout the dendritic tree, or even increased towards the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>), and that the signal started almost simultaneously, irrespective of the distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In particular, the spread of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was much faster than expected from pure diffusional propagation from the soma into dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Together with the undiminished amplitude and steep rise of the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the data suggest that the membrane depolarization of the mock PSPs rapidly spreads throughout the dendritic tree and opens local dendritic VGCCs. The minimal delay and the rapid rise of dendritic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in NG2 cells is comparable to the fast dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded and stimulated under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>), suggesting that NG2 cells are capable of similar dendritic signal processing.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16262.006</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transients are global and instantly occur in distal dendrites of NG2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Scheme showing the strategy for selecting frames for fast time-lapse acquisition of calcium indicator dye-filled NG2 cells stimulated in current clamp mode (inset on top shows waveform of injected current, as used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We therefore stimulated NG2 cells with a more realistic pattern of synaptic input. We allowed firing of presynaptic neurons to deviate from perfect synchrony and modeled a temporal distribution of presynaptic activity using a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 25 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We progressively increased the number of injected Gaussian-distributed quanta (Q) and monitored intracellular calcium levels with 2-photon microscopy in line-scan mode. In the control group, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>responses were seen only rarely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). By contrast, when blocking A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, we observed larger depolarizations often carrying prominent spikelets (in five out of seven cells, average amplitude 40.2 ± 6.7 mV), which were accompanied by substantial intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When plotting the peak depolarization against the current injection strength (being similar across groups, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), voltage responses in the control and 4-AP groups were indistinguishable as long as they did not exceed ~−45 mV, consistent with the threshold for recruitment of A-type channels as determined above. As expected, larger current injections (injections equivalent to &gt;600 glutamate quanta, see Materials and methods) much more effectively depolarized NG2 cells in the presence of 4-AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To discriminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses from non-responding trials, we analyzed the line-scan profiles with a template-fitting algorithm. This analysis revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) that for both groups Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (filled symbols) are much more frequent if NG2 cells are depolarized beyond approximately −45 mV, suggesting that blocking A-type channels facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by allowing for stronger depolarizations. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not only significantly more frequent in the presence of 4-AP (control: 9/40; 4-AP: 22/43; Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but the responding trials also showed a significantly larger amplitude: 10.1 ± 0.7% and 14.1 ± 1.5% in the control and 4-AP groups, respectively (Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Further analysis showed that the fraction of trials that responded with a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signal steadily increased towards unity with the quantal content of the stimulus in both groups. However, 4-AP treatment left-shifted this curve, lowered the 50% threshold from ~1200 to ~600 quanta, and thereby strongly increased the propensity of NG2 glial cells to generate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Interestingly, re-plotting the fraction of responding trials against the peak depolarization minimizes the difference between the two groups seen when plotting the fraction against injection strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), further indicating that 4-AP does not change the voltage dependence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal but does change the recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The strength of the template-fitting algorithm lies in its ability to identify clear responses unambiguously, but as a result, 'non-responding' trials do not enter the analysis. To characterize the whole population of NG2 cell dendrites, we therefore undertook an additional analysis including all dendrite recordings. We binned trials according to stimulus strength, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, but calculated the average ∆F/F ratios across all trials. This analysis revealed a small but statistically significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the control group and also showed that dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels linearly increased with input strength when A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels were blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels tightly gate the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to synaptic input to NG2 cells.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16262.007</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A-type channels restrictively gate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are induced by coincident firing of presynaptic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Cartoon illustrating how active synapses (colored dots) may be distributed across the dendritic tree of a NG2 cell.

Thus the largest fraction of synaptic currents originates in dendrites and its integration is difficult to study with somatic current injection. To explore dendritic integration of synaptic input by NG2 cells, we employed 2-photon-based MNI-glutamate uncaging. This technique allowed us to produce very localized, diffraction-limited, and brief (0.65 ms, at 720 nm) photo-release of glutamate onto dendritic segments, mimicking the rapid liberation of glutamate from presynaptic vesicles.

Under control conditions, the addition of six uEPSPs to the mock PSP hardly increased the depolarization (−40.8 ± 1.4 mV vs −39.6 ± 1.3 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), as expected from the small amplitude of the uEPSP, and also did not generate an increased calcium response in the stimulated dendrite (6.0 ± 1.2% vs 8.8 ± 2.5% ∆F/F, one-way ANOVA for correlated samples, Tukey HSD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and D</xref>).

When plotting the half-width of the mock PSP voltage responses in a train (10 PSPs at 100 Hz), we found a clear increase of 26.3 ± 3.3% (n=7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). This progressive broadening of PSPs is very likely to reflect an increasing fraction of inactivated A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels as this broadening was not observed in the 4-AP-treated group (n=8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). Such an increase in half-width is very likely to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via an increased tail current during the repolarization phase (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels opened, prolonged period with large and increasing driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Indeed, with broadened PSPs in the 4-AP treated group, we observed a significantly increased Ca<sup>2+ </sup>response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D</xref>, 12.7 ± 1.4% vs 24.2 ± 4.2% in the control and 4-AP groups, respectively, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test).

Therefore, we designed an experiment to show that synaptic transmitter release can trigger local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cell dendrites. We placed a small glass electrode in the immediate vicinity of a small dendritic branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>) and elicited a brief train of EPSPs (five or six stimuli at 100 HZ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). As seen with local glutamate uncaging, these dendritically induced EPSPs were recorded with small amplitudes by the electrode attached to the soma (7.1 ± 1.1 mV, n=4). Nevertheless, in the nearby dendrite, these EPSPs were accompanied by a clear Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signal with kinetics and size similar to those shown above for Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals induced by current injection or glutamate uncaging (21.1 ± 3.4%, n=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, 1 µM thapsigargin in the pipette). Furthermore, as argued above, this observation also suggested that the local depolarization in the dendrite is much larger than that observed at the soma and that there is strong voltage attenuation along a dendrite. More importantly, this experiment substantiates the physiological relevance of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in NG2 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The key finding of the present study is that NG2 cells, which were previously believed to be electrically unexcitable, are effective integrators of synaptic activity. Moreover, they possess two elaborate integration modes governed by A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels: local compartmentalized integration in individual dendritic subunits, versus global integration leading to massive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx throughout the entire dendritic arborization of NG2 cells.</p><p>It has been known for a long time that NG2 cells, formerly also called 'complex astrocytes' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steinhauser et al., 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Dietrich, 2013</xref>), express considerable levels of VGCs but their physiological role has not yet been identified. Further, it has been questioned whether the typically small synaptic events in NG2 cells ever recruit VGCs. Earlier studies even proposed that some voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (delayed-rectifier- but not A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels) may serve functions other than modifying membrane potential and the authors proposed their involvement in controlling cell cycle timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knutson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghiani et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1999b</xref>).</p><p>Mock PSPs mimicking glutamatergic input, the most widespread neurotransmitter released onto NG2 cells in the CNS, allowed us to systematically study how different types of VGCs shape synaptic input. Given that NG2 cells show voltage-activated Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>) and that some reports even found regenerative electrical activity when stimulating NG2 cells with rectangular current injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chittajallu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karadottir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2009</xref>), it could be assumed that these fast channels prominently amplify PSPs. By contrast, we observed that the amplitude of mock PSPs increases linearly with input strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) due to a fine balance of the fast but low amplitude Na<sup>+</sup> currents and the much larger but slightly slower A-type K<sup>+</sup> currents, with the latter counteracting the amplifying effect of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels. </p><p>While neurons possess a variety of signaling routes, they primarily integrate synaptic input by summation of electrical signals and generation of an action potential when the summed input crosses the threshold. Single action potentials regularly open VGCCs and are associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of constant size. Therefore, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in neurons are proportional to the number of action potentials in a brief burst or to the frequency of action potentials in a long train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helmchen et al., 1996</xref>). NG2 cells also sum incoming electrical synaptic input but, in contrast to neurons and in the absence of action potentials, there is no threshold function for synaptic potentials. The above-described interplay of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels allows the size of PSPs to grow proportionally with input strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in NG2 cells gradually increases with input strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, in contrast to neurons, NG2 cells use Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to gradually encode the level of synaptic activity itself. Both locally induced and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cells decay with a time constant on the order of seconds, while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in neurons usually return to baseline within several hundred milliseconds. Their low incremental amplitude, their slow return to baseline, and their reliable occurrence even in distal dendrites are characteristics displayed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cells that are key to effectively integrating synaptic input of a wide range of frequencies across their dendritic tree.</p><p>Even though the presence of VGCCs in NG2 cells has previously been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haberlandt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larson et al., 2016</xref>), their recruitment by synaptic activity has so far remained obscure. Our results demonstrate for the first time that synaptic-like (mock) depolarizations trigger robust and rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the soma and dendrites of NG2 cells. We furthermore provide evidence that the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are mediated by low-threshold VGCCs: (1) they were triggered solely by current injection; (2) they started to appear when cells were depolarized beyond −50 to −40 mV; (3) they were blocked by nickel/cadmium and by a cocktail of the R- and T-type channel blockers SNX-482 and TTA-P2; (4) they were potentiated by blocking K<sup>+</sup> channels and showed a rapid rise, implying that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source was active for only a few milliseconds; (5) they were resistant to blocking Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>exchangers or Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by 10 µM KB-R7943 and thapsigargin, respectively. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals we recorded in NG2 cells are quite distinct from the store-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations seen in astrocytes, which occur and decay over many seconds. Haberlandt et al. reported that depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in NG2 cells are very sensitive to thapsigargin, seemingly contradicting our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haberlandt et al., 2011</xref>). However, the aforementioned study used a much stronger stimulus and depolarized NG2 cells for 100 ms to +20 mV (voltage clamp), and the resulting Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signal showed kinetics an order of magnitude slower than those reported here. Thus, it is conceivable that NG2 cells generally can generate store-dependent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals but that store-dependent signaling is not readily recruited by synaptic activity studied here.</p><p>The kinetics and magnitude of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals in NG2 cell dendrites, induced by local synaptic stimulation or local glutamate uncaging, match those evoked by somatic current injection very well, suggesting that they are also caused by recruitment of VGCCs. Under the conditions used here, mimicking the activity of a very small number of synapses, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry through glutamate receptors appears not to be involved because 4-AP boosted the response and because executing the glutamate uncaging protocol alone never triggered a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (unpublished observations). However, this does not imply that glutamate receptors cannot be a source of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>entry if more widespread opening of receptors is achieved (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ge et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cells are restrictively gated by A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. This may be one of the reasons why previous publications concluded that synaptically driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in NG2 cells are unlikely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Velez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haberlandt et al., 2011</xref>). By which mechanisms do A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels gate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals? Since the voltage-dependence of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signal itself remained unchanged after blocking A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), it is very likely that A-type channels under control conditions render synaptic input less effective in causing Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals by shortening and decreasing the associated synaptic depolarization. In consequence, the impact of synaptic transmission on Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling in NG2 cells is dependent on the activity of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. Considering that Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels have been implicated in the developmental behavior and gene expression of NG2 cells, A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels are likely to play a key regulatory role in whether and how neuronal transmitter release affects oligodendrogenesis and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pende et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paez et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2010</xref>). The fact that NG2 cells are most responsive to synaptic input from neurons when A-type channels are suppressed raises the question of under which conditions such suppression is achieved. Activity of A-type channels can temporarily be reduced when depolarizations bring them into a state of inactivation. Thus, those patterns of synaptic input that maximize inactivation of A-type channels enhance the impact of axonal activity on NG2 cell behavior. Based on previous reports on the kinetics of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Steinhauser et al., 1994b</xref>), our data allows us to predict that brief trains of action potentials (50–100 ms) should be very effective at inactivating A-type channels and will open the 'calcium-gate' in NG2 cells. Apart from functionally and temporarily reducing A-type currents by inactivation, transcriptional regulation may be another way to control A-type current amplitude in NG2 cells. Indeed, there is evidence for developmental and reactive regulation of K<sup>+</sup> channels in response to ischemia/injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lytle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pivonkova et al., 2010</xref>). Such regulated expression of A-type K<sup>+ </sup>channels may allow NG2 cells to permanently tune their responsiveness to incoming neuronal activity. This adaptation is probably required to match the responsiveness of NG2 cells to patterns of activity, which vary across regional neuronal circuits throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Dietrich, 2013</xref>).</p><p>When performing glutamate uncaging along NG2 cell dendrites, we regularly observed depolarizations with similar size and kinetics to miniature EPSPs. For the first time, this directly demonstrates that there are many synapse-like clusters of glutamate receptors along many dendrites of NG2 cells. Such widespread responsiveness to glutamate throughout the dendritic tree indicates that NG2 cells may be capable of dendritic computation. Dendritic computation in NG2 cells is further suggested by the fact that local glutamate uncaging boosted the dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response despite the small amplitude of the associated somatic voltage responses. In particular, the tiny incremental depolarization caused by adding dendritic uncaging (∆ 2.5 mV) is far too small to significantly enhance the recruitment of VGCCs at the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). This implies that the dendritic voltage excursion caused by glutamate uncaging is actually substantially larger than that measured at the soma, and that this more pronounced local depolarization recruits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the dendrite. Considering the thin diameter of NG2 cell dendrites, such severe attenuation of dendritic voltage is not surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun and Dietrich, 2013</xref>). A larger dendritic voltage excursion is also suggested by the level of the absolute depolarization of the soma (as opposed to the uncaging-induced increment in depolarization considered above), which is clearly below the voltage range typically required to reliably induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Further, all Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals recorded in dendrites – regardless of whether induced by synaptic stimulation, by a train of mock PSPs, by gaussian distributed mock PSPs, or by glutamate uncaging – display a rapid rise, implying that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source must be very close to the optical recording site, the dendrite. Finally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals induced in the soma rapidly spread into all dendrites and reached even the distal ends with undiminished amplitudes. This can only be achieved if VGCCs are present all along the dendrites to regenerate the signal. As we did not detect any dendrites that did not generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, the data indicate that most, if not all, dendrites of NG2 cells are equipped with VGCCs.</p><p>There is a similar line of argument for a dendritic localization of A-type channels in NG2 cells. Blocking these channels with 4-AP allowed glutamate uncaging to boost the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, i.e. to recruit more Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels by a stronger depolarization compared to control conditions. However, the resulting depolarization measured at the soma was negligibly increased by the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker when compared to control conditions and thus cannot explain additional recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, application of 4-AP must have allowed for a larger depolarization of the local membrane in the dendrite in response to uncaging, which was not visible in the somatic recording. The most parsimonious explanation is that 4-AP was also acting on dendritic A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, which renders dendritic glutamate uncaging more effective in generating a larger local depolarization and recruiting dendritic VGCCs. Taken together, our data show that NG2 cells express voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and K<sup>+</sup> channels in their dendrites and that these channels actively shape synaptic input as independent processing units.</p><p>It has been put forward that synaptic transmission from unmyelinated axons to NG2 cells may play a pivotal role in triggering these responses of NG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>), also reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida and Lyons, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petersen and Monk, 2015</xref>). Based on our present findings, we propose that synaptically induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is well-suited to initiate actions of NG2 cells in the context of activity-dependent myelination. First, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in NG2 cells allow for optimal temporal and spatial summation of incoming neuronal input and their dependence on the functional state of A-type channels provides certain types of plasticity for synchronized activity. Second, NG2 cells seem to generate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in at least two different spatial domains, which may serve distinct roles in the context of activity-dependent myelination. Dendritic input, possibly even induced by an individual axon, can trigger local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Such local Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signals could be involved in stabilizing or enhancing contact sites with individual axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>) and could enable axon-specific integration and computation. On the other hand, global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which are induced by a larger number of active synapses throughout the dendritic tree, spread within the NG2 cell and involve the soma, are particularly qualified for triggering global cellular actions, such as division, differentiation, survival or motility of NG2 cells in response to neuronal activity. Further, our finding of local processing of synaptic input raises the question of how local dendritic computation in NG2 cells is relevant for myelination and whether the spatial arrangement of synaptic junctions on NG2 cells affects myelination of the connected axon.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that NG2 cells possess a dedicated synaptic integration repertoire, distinct from that of neurons and other types of glial cells, by encoding the number of active synapses in a graded fashion. This integration builds on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in different spatial domains and appears as a specialized type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitability of NG2 cells. Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels dampen Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals but this can be overcome by temporally and spatially coincident synaptic depolarizations. Thus, specific patterns of axonal activity may promote myelination by instructing NG2 cells to interact with axons or generate new oligodendrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Post-natal 7–15-day old (male and female) transgenic mice expressing DsRed fluorescent protein under control of the promoter of mouse <italic>Cspg4</italic> gene were used in this study (NG2-DsRed transgenic mouse line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>]).

The average resting potential (no current injection) was −83.8 ± 0.7 mV (n=132).</p><p>In order to evoke a maximal Schaffer-collateral mediated PSP, a mono-polar or bi-polar stimulating electrode was placed in the CA1 Stratum Radiatum region approximately 20–30 µm from the NG2 cell soma (isolated stimulator, A-M systems Model 2100, 0.2 to 0.5 ms). Starting from low values, stimulation intensity was gradually increased until a maximal response was reached. For local synaptic stimulation, a mono-polar stimulating electrode was placed close to the target dendritic segment (~5 µm in distance). A train of 5–6 stimuli (0.1 ms) at 100 Hz was applied during 2-photon Ca<sup>2+ </sup>imaging of the target dendritic segment. To remove any endogenous suppression of transmitter release by ambient adenosine, 1 µM 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) was added to the perfusion medium during all synaptic stimulation experiments. 1 µM thapsigargin was added to pipette solution for local synaptic stimulation experiments.</p><p>For mock PSP recordings, the injected current waveform template was derived from previously recorded miniature EPSCs in NG2 cells. The amplitude of this current, the quantal amplitude, was set to 12 pA according to the range of values reported for miniature EPSCs previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Passlick et al., 2016</xref>). To achieve a stronger stimulation, the current waveform was multiplied with an integer number, Q, representing the number of quanta contained in the stimulus. The electrical impact of a synapse depends on the individual passive membrane properties of the NG2 cell, membrane resistance, R<sub>in</sub>, and membrane capacitance. Because membrane resistance, but not capacitance, varies greatly among NG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>) and the resistance has a larger impact on the voltage response, we calculate the strength of our mock current injection as the product Q * R<sub>in</sub>. To facilitate interpretation of this product, i.e. to determine the quantal content, we express it in multiples of 250 MΩ, the population average input resistance of NG2 cells. For example, injecting 100 Q into R<sub>in</sub>=250 MΩ yields Q * R<sub>in</sub>=25,000 (Q * MΩ) and injecting 50 Q into R<sub>in</sub>=500 MΩ yields the same product, Q * R<sub>in</sub>=25,000 (Q * MΩ). Therefore, the stimulations are equally effective and both would be expressed as 100 Q * R<sub>in</sub> (Q * 250 MΩ). For simplicity, we neglected changes in Q due to varying driving force. We also injected a small inverted, hyperpolarizing EPSC waveform to produce a purely passive voltage deflection in each recording. The average hyperpolarizing response size was −6.4 ± 0.2 mV (54 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To comparatively illustrate the amplitude and waveform of a voltage response to an arbitrarily-sized mock current injection not affected by voltage-gated channels, we multiplied the small passive response obtained in the same cell by the (negative) amplitude ratio of the arbitrary injection over the small inverted EPSC injection.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that increased osmolarity of the ACSF due to the addition of TEA changes mock PSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), we ran a set of control experiments with increased osmolarity by adding sucrose (20 mM), which did not affect mock PSPs (n=5, Paired <italic>t</italic>-test).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>After recording, slices were fixed and stained for NG2 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kukley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>).

Stability of resting membrane potential, morphology and resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (baseline fluorescence) were used to rule out damage to the cell potentially caused by stopping the perfusion. The pointing function of the second scan head was used to direct the uncaging laser to the target locations through the 'Triggersync' control software (Bruker).

Background was estimated from line-scans obtained with the laser off, which for 2-photon microscopy, provides a close to optimum approximation of the background signal at the position of the scanned structure. Fluorescence responses (∆F/F) in line-scan profiles were quantified as (Fpeak-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>,where F<sub>peak</sub> was estimated by the mean fluorescence value during a 150 ms interval starting 100 ms after the beginning of the current injection, and F<sub>0</sub> by an average of the fluorescence during a 150 ms baseline period before the current injection. Calcium responses in frame-scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were quantified as ∆G/R ratios per region of interest (ROI). ∆G was calculated for each ROI from the Fluo-4 fluorescence as G<sub>peak</sub>–G<sub>0</sub>, where G<sub>peak</sub> and G<sub>0</sub> represent mean fluorescence values per ROI obtained from two series of successive frames after and before the current stimulus, respectively, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The two reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript addresses and important and topical issue. However, the impact of the work is somewhat reduced by a previous study that showed that VGCCs regulate NG2 calcium signals (Haberlandt et al., 2011). The authors' novel &quot;mock PSP&quot; approach is of interest, but the conclusions are limited to the role of A-type potassium channels modulation of VGCCs and the visualization of calcium signaling in NG2 cell processes. A more thorough characterization of mechanisms underlying NG2 cell calcium signaling and a more physiological stimulation paradigm (e.g. stimulation of synaptic input to NG2 cells) would increase the significance. Overall we think that these concerns will require substantial additional experiments that would exceed the <italic>eLife</italic> benchmark of 2 months. The full reviews are included below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The study by Sun et al. investigates a very important question in the field of neuron-glia communication. It is now well established that NG2 cells receive glutamatergic or GABAergic synaptic inputs in different regions of the brain, including both grey and white matter. However, how these synaptic inputs are encoded in these cells, and how synaptic responses are integrated intracellularly is still completely unknown. Furthermore, NG2 cells display significant cell process extension and most of the synapses are located on these processes. Therefore, it has been postulated that NG2 cell processes are major sites of synaptic integration in NG2 cells, but this has never been demonstrated.</p><p>Across glial types, intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> increase has been shown to be an established response signal to external input – from other glial cells or from neighboring neurons. In this vein, it would be logical to propose that NG2 cells also display robust Ca<sup>2</sup> signals in response to synaptic activity. However, Ca<sup>2</sup> signals in NG2 cells in the context of synaptic communication have not previously been systematically characterized. Sun et al. have attempted to do precisely this in their report.</p><p>Overall, the study is a detailed characterization of NG2 cell responses to synaptic inputs performed by using advanced experimental approaches. The biophysical results should be complemented by further analysis to broaden the physiological and neurobiological impact of this excellent study.</p><p>The entire study is performed by using either 1. Photo-release/2-photon uncaging of glutamate on different subdomains of NG2 cells or 2. Current injection in NG2 cells to elicit &quot;mock PSPs&quot;. While these techniques are valid and important, they provide indirect evidence of a synaptic event. It would be very important to determine whether the observed Ca<sup>2</sup> responses and the physiological role of A-type K channels are reproduced upon activation of glutamatergic synapses on NG2 cells by neuronal stimulation, i.e. under a more physiological stimulation paradigm. Does use-dependent inactivation of A-type channels occur under physiological (axonal) activation of NG2 cells?</p><p>A further important question is whether A-type K channels also play a modulatory role in NG2 cells of the white matter, i.e. whether this is an intrinsically conserved function of all NG2 cells in different brain regions.</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) Discussion. The Discussion is too long and does not include the crucial point of the potential physiological and developmental role of the physiological mechanisms investigated in this study. Significant advance has been made in our understanding of the potential physiological/developmental role of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on NG2 cells. Therefore, the authors should discuss more extensively the role of A-type channels in the context of: i) Glu-mediated synaptic transmission on NG2 cells, and ii) the role of A-type K channels in cell cycle regulation/cell proliferation, as Glu synapses have been shown to regulate NG2 cell proliferation (Mangin et al., 2012).</p><p>2) Abstract. The Abstract should be more specific, in particular should include the information that A-type K channels control regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> levels upon synaptic activity in NG2 cells.</p><p>3) Ca<sup>2</sup> Imaging: It is laudable that the authors have recorded Ca<sup>2</sup> increases at thin NG cell processes. It is also understandable that SNR (signal to noise ratio) for Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging experiments conducted at thin cell processes such as distal dendrites may be relatively low. However, in the context of synaptic communication, it is important that the authors address this. This is especially problematic when drawing conclusions from imaging traces beyond a binary result (responsive vs. non-responsive cells or dendrites). Example: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> – there does appear to be a clear increase in fluorescence in 3E &quot;d&quot; upon current injection. However, the basal calcium trace i.e. pre-current injection also seems to have changes in ΔF/F. This can also be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> – &quot;2.5 um&quot; vs 32.5 &quot;um&quot; [What ROI does the &quot;32.5 um&quot; trace correspond to in the panel?]. Does this unstable ΔF/F signal constitute &quot;basal&quot; Ca<sup>2</sup> activity? Alternatively, is this simply noise or a result of averaging lesser number of dendritic pixels? Is the definition of a &quot;spikelet&quot; – also based on an objective analysis or is it based on visual inspection of the trace?</p><p>4) Ca<sup>2</sup> kinetics: Since the authors have used the template based method to detect calcium responses (Clements and Bekkers, 1997), it is appropriate to report and perform further analysis on the temporal aspects of the Ca<sup>2</sup> response.</p><p>i) Although the authors mention that the response decays &quot;on the order of many seconds&quot;, they never mention if they have performed a detailed analysis of the decay constant, which they mention in passing (under sub-section &quot;Estimating peak free calcium concentration of mock PSP induced signals in NG2 cells&quot;). How was the decay quantified? Given that in many representative traces, the ΔF/F signal does not return to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> &quot;d&quot;, 4 D more obvious in &quot;12.5 um&quot; and &quot;32.5 um&quot;, is there substantial variability in the decay constant? Similar to the claim that Ca<sup>2</sup> onset time is more or less constant across distance, does the decay constant also remain the same across distance from the NG2 cell body? Since the authors distinguish NG2 cell dendritic Ca<sup>2</sup> response from neuronal Ca<sup>2</sup> kinetics (– Discussion section), it would be appropriate to show a neuronal dendrite Ca<sup>2</sup> response as an inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>ii) In all the Ca<sup>2</sup> traces displayed, only single responses are shown. Have the authors attempted to elicit consecutive Ca<sup>2</sup> events at dendrites?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Calcium signaling has been shown to regulate many aspects of NG2 cell behavior from proliferation to differentiation and myelination. However, the link between synaptic input to NG2 cells and modulation of their behavior remains unclear. This manuscript seeks to add an important piece to the puzzle, directly linking depolarization via synaptic inputs to increases in intracellular calcium signaling in NG2 cells. The authors used clever approaches to simulate the effects of synaptic inputs to NG2 cells (mock PSPs) by injecting current. The authors discovered that A-type potassium channels modify intracellular calcium events mediated via voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). They also explored calcium dynamics in the processes (and somata) of NG2 cells for the first time. These studies add to our understanding of how VGCCs regulate calcium events in both the somata and processes in NG2 cells and how A-type potassium channels modulate their activity.</p><p>Major Points</p><p>1) Intracellular calcium rises can be initiated by several potential mechanisms: i) Influx of extracellular calcium, ii) voltage or iii) ligand gated channels, and iv) release from internal stores.</p><p>i) the role of the Na -Ca<sup>2</sup> exchanger (NCX) in NG2 cell calcium signaling remains controversial (Ge et al., 2006; Tong et al., 2009; Haberlandt et al., 2011). The authors should at minimum discuss the potential role of NCX.</p><p>ii) This manuscript focuses on the contribution of voltage-gated A-type potassium channels via inhibition by extracellular applied 4-AP. Since TEA does not affect mock PSP amplitude or duration, it would be helpful to confirm the effects on these parameters are mediated by A-type potassium channels are blocked by internal Cs . This would rule out effects on neuronal A-type potassium channels (and subsequently properties of spontaneous release onto NG2 cells) and also potential direct effects of 4-AP on VGCCs (Wu et al., 2009, PMCID: PMC2794761).</p><p>iii) The authors state that the contribution of ligand-gated channels to NG2 cell calcium elevations was minimal as 4-AP boosted the responses and their uncaging protocol did not elicit calcium signals (unpublished observations). A branch specific uncaging protocol may not activate enough glutamate receptors to cause a calcium event; the authors should use full field photo-uncaging to test whether glutamate receptor activation during control conditions can cause NG2 an intercellular calcium increase.</p><p>iv) The extended duration of NG2 calcium signals (2.5 seconds) suggests involvement of internal calcium stores. Indeed, Haberlandt et al., 2011 showed that thapsigargin reduced depolarization induced NG2 calcium signaling. The authors should at minimum comment on this in the Discussion section.</p><p>2) Whether stimulation of synaptic input to NG2 cells results in calcium events remains controversial. While Velez-Fort et al., 2010 report did not elicit somatic increases in calcium in the barrel cortex, Haberlandt et al., 2011 did document tetanic stimulation resulted in somatic calcium increases in some NG2 cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, though responses were variable). The authors should attempt similar experiments to examine whether this type of synaptic stimulation results in increases in calcium in NG2 cell processes. Additional experiments using full field photo-uncaging or application of hypertonic aCSF would also greater contribute to determining whether stimulation of synaptic inputs results in NG2 cell calcium signaling under control conditions.</p><p>3) Previous studies have explored the involvement of calcium channel subtypes in mediating the calcium events in NG2 cells (Fulton et al., 2010; Haberlandt et al., 2011). Pharmacological experiments using the author's novel protocol would further strengthen the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16262.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[...] The entire study is performed by using either 1.

Does use-dependent inactivation of A-type channels occur under physiological (axonal) activation of NG2 cells?</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We agree with the reviewer that the manuscript would be strengthened by using a more physiological stimulation paradigm. Therefore, we have now included data showing calcium signals in NG2 cells upon synaptic stimulation. Local synaptic stimulation produces calcium signals in dendrites which are comparable to the uncaging- and current injection-induced calcium signals reported so far.</p><p>These experiments were performed during pharmacological inhibition of calcium stores and thus provide further evidence that calcium stores are not essential for the calcium signal reported here which is caused by voltage-gated calcium channels.</p><p>We are not yet showing use-dependent inactivation of A-type channels by synaptic input as these experiments, as detailed below, are technically challenging and would have exceeded the time available for the revision. Our trial experiments suggest that the stimulation of two independent but nearby synaptic inputs will be required. One input will inactivate A-type channels but its vesicle pool will be exhausted thereafter. The second input can then serve as test input to elicit a calcium response without previous activation of input 1. Because both inputs need to target the same dendritic segment this is a difficult and time consuming experiment which we feel would possibly be most appropriate for a follow-up manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A&amp;B</xref> does show that at least mock PSPs inactivate A-type channels, which partly addresses the question of the reviewer (we have shown that mock PSPs are comparable in size and kinetics to real synaptic input).</p><p><italic>A further important question is whether A-type K channels also play a modulatory role in NG2 cells of the white matter, i.e. whether this is an intrinsically conserved function of all NG2 cells in different brain regions.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> So far the main characteristics of NG2 cells have been found to be similar across many brain regions including white and grey matter. However, there are slight systematic differences between white and grey matter, with NG2 cells in the white matter showing a higher input resistance (Chittajallu et al., 2004) making the recruitment of voltage gated channels even more likely. We believe a follow-up study would be best suited for systematically exploring differences between white and grey matter.</p><p><italic>Major points</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Discussion. The Discussion is too long and does not include the crucial point of the potential physiological and developmental role of the physiological mechanisms investigated in this study.

In particular the following new paragraph addresses this point:</p><p>“Ca<sup>2</sup> signals in NG2 cells are restrictively gated by A-type potassium channels. […] This adaptation likely is required to match the responsiveness of NG2 cells to patterns of activity which vary across regional neuronal circuits throughout the brain (Sun and Dietrich, 2013).”</p><p> <italic>ii) the role of A-type K channels in cell cycle regulation/cell proliferation, as Glu synapses have been shown to regulate NG2 cell proliferation (Mangin et al., 2012).</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> The above paragraph addresses the potential role of A-type channels in regulating cell cycle or proliferation. However, to our knowledge there is so far no published data addressing the possible role of A-type potassium channels in regulating the cell cycle or proliferation of NG2 cells available. The series of papers by Gallo and coworkers did not look at the role of A-type channels as they found that cultured OPCs did not survive 4-AP treatment (Gallo et al., Ghiani et al., Knutson et al., Pende et al).</p><p><italic>2) Abstract. The Abstract should be more specific, in particular should include the information that A-type K channels control regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> levels upon synaptic activity in NG2 cells.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We have revised our Abstract as suggested.</p><p>“[…]Synaptic activity induces rapid Ca<sup>2</sup> signals mediated by low-voltage activated Ca<sup>2</sup> channels and under strict inhibitory control of voltage-gated A-type K channels[…] “and “[…]Taken together, the activity-dependent control of Ca<sup>2</sup> signals by A-type channels and the global versus local signaling domains make intracellular Ca<sup>2</sup> in NG2 cells a prime signaling molecule to transform neurotransmitter release into activity-dependent myelination.”</p><p><italic>3) Ca<sup>2</sup> Imaging: It is laudable that the authors have recorded Ca<sup>2</sup> increases at thin NG cell processes. It is also understandable that SNR (signal to noise ratio) for Ca<sup>2</sup> imaging experiments conducted at thin cell processes such as distal dendrites may be relatively low. However, in the context of synaptic communication, it is important that the authors address this. This is especially problematic when drawing conclusions from imaging traces beyond a binary result (responsive vs. non-responsive cells or dendrites). Example: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, E and F</xref> – there does appear to be a clear increase in fluorescence in 3E &quot;d&quot; upon current injection. However, the basal calcium trace i.e. pre-current injection also seems to have changes in ΔF/F. This can also be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> – &quot;2.5 um&quot; vs 32.5 &quot;um&quot; [What ROI does the &quot;32.5 um&quot; trace correspond to in the panel?]. Does this unstable ΔF/F signal constitute &quot;basal&quot; Ca<sup>2</sup> activity? Alternatively, is this simply noise or a result of averaging lesser number of dendritic pixels?</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> The small upward deflection seen pre-current injection in 3E-d referred to by the reviewer represents classical noise as frequently appearing in PMT-based detection of weak light signals, when the overall photon count is low. This can clearly be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (formerly 4D) – &quot;2.5 um&quot; vs 32.5 „um“: these spurious spike-like “events” occur when normalizing the trace on a low pre-stimulus baseline which has been recorded from a small distal process with weak emission by Fluo-4. We now have included identical recordings from neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) which show qualitatively the same noise. However, as the signals in neurons are larger the noise is less obvious. How the visibility of the noise increases with decreasing photon count can also nicely be seen along the neuronal dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, 2.5 µm -&gt; 32.5 µm). We are confident that these spurious ∆F/F changes do not reflect basal calcium activity.</p><p>We have simplified the ROI labelling in the new version of the figure. The 32.5 µm trace corresponds to ROI 7 (7 * 5 µm increments minus 2.5 µm half of increment/ROI length).</p><p><italic>Is the definition of a &quot;spikelet&quot; also based on an objective analysis or is it based on visual inspection of the trace?</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> The term “spikelet” refers to the electrical recording in which we have seen this type of response when A-type channels had been blocked in an all-or-nothing fashion, so strictly speaking it was based on visual inspection.</p><p>We now have included a quantitative analysis of the spikelets which we observed in 5/7 NG2 cells upon injection of the gaussian-shaped current in the presence of 4-AP and report the amplitude to be 40.2 ± 6.7 mV.</p><p><italic>4) Ca<sup>2</sup> kinetics: Since the authors have used the template based method to detect calcium responses (Clements and Bekkers, 1997), it is appropriate to report and perform further analysis on the temporal aspects of the Ca<sup>2</sup> response.i) Although the authors mention that the response decays &quot;on the order of many seconds&quot;, they never mention if they have performed a detailed analysis of the decay constant, which they mention in passing (under sub-section &quot;Estimating peak free calcium concentration of mock PSP induced signals in NG2 cells&quot;). How was the decay quantified? Given that in many representative traces, the ΔF/F signal does not return to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> &quot;d&quot;, 4 D more obvious in &quot;12.5 um&quot; and &quot;32.5 um&quot;, is there substantial variability in the decay constant? Similar to the claim that Ca<sup>2</sup> onset time is more or less constant across distance, does the decay constant also remain the same across distance from the NG2 cell body?</italic></p><p><bold>Response:</bold> In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel C now provides longer recordings of calcium signals in which the decay to baseline is clearly seen. We have quantified the decay time constant from these new recordings by fitting an exponential function (𝜏<sub>decay</sub> = 3.2 ± 0.5 s, n = 9).</p><p>We would not like to draw firm conclusions on the decay time across distance from soma. The signal size and the recording duration of the frame scan experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggest the decay is at least on the same order of magnitude but do not allow quantitative assessment.</p><p>The calcium signals obtained in line scan mode were specifically acquired from proximal dendrites (~7-10 µm) and do not yield the required spatial information.</p><p><italic>Since the authors distinguish NG2 cell dendritic Ca<sup>2</sup> response from neuronal Ca<sup>2</sup> kinetics (Discussion section), it would be appropriate to show a neuronal dendrite Ca<sup>2</sup> response as an inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> Following the reviewer’s suggestion we have recorded CA1 neurons and performed an identical experiment to compare signal kinetics, SNR and how neuronal calcium signals back propagate into dendrites, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>.</p><p><italic>ii) In all the Ca<sup>2</sup> traces displayed, only single responses are shown. Have the authors attempted to elicit consecutive Ca<sup>2</sup> events at dendrites?</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We have now included new data where we demonstrate the consecutive reproducibility of the calcium signal in NG2 cells over 12 min of recording time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Intracellular calcium rises can be initiated by several potential mechanisms: i) Influx of extracellular calcium, ii) voltage or iii) ligand gated channels, and iv) release from internal stores.</italic></p><p><italic>i) the role of the Na -Ca<sup>2</sup> exchanger (NCX) in NG2 cell calcium signaling remains controversial (Ge et al., 2006; Tong et al., 2009; Haberlandt et al., 2011). The authors should at minimum discuss the potential role of NCX.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We have conducted additional experiments and now demonstrate that NCX is not involved in the calcium signals we report here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This is in line with extra pharmacological experiments showing our calcium signals are mediated by T-/R-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) and with the previous observations of the rapid rise times, the block by Cd/Ni and the absence of activation of ligand-gated receptors.</p><p>Furthermore, we now also show that calcium signals elicited by synaptic stimulation and by current injection are not dependent on calcium stores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C-E</xref>, thapsigargin) in agreement with our former conclusions.</p><p>Since Haberlandt et al. reported store-dependent signals upon depolarizing NG2 cells we have devoted an extra paragraph of the discussion on this apparent discrepancy:</p><p>“Haberlandt et al. reported that depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2</sup> signals in NG2 cells are very sensitive to thapsigargin seemingly contradicting our findings (Haberlandt et al. (2011). […] Thus, it is conceivable that NG2 cells generally can generate store-dependent Ca<sup>2</sup> signals but that store-dependent signaling is not readily recruited by synaptic activity studied here.”</p><p> <italic>ii) This manuscript focuses on the contribution of voltage-gated A-type potassium channels via inhibition by extracellular applied 4-AP. Since TEA does not affect mock PSP amplitude or duration, it would be helpful to confirm the effects on these parameters are mediated by A-type potassium channels are blocked by internal Cs . This would rule out effects on neuronal A-type potassium channels (and subsequently properties of spontaneous release onto NG2 cells) and also potential direct effects of 4-AP on VGCCs (Wu et al., 2009, PMCID: PMC2794761).</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We have now performed calcium imaging experiments where Cs was included in the patch pipette to block potassium channels from the intracellular side. Current injection strength was adjusted to compensate for the resulting higher input resistance of NG2 cells when perfused with Cs. These experiments show that also Cs potentiates the calcium signals in NG2 cells and thereby exclude that an effect of 4-AP on neuronal potassium channels (Cs did not reach neurons, applied from inside the NG2 cell) or on calcium channels in NG2 cells (Cs has never been shown to facilitate calcium channels) is required.</p><p><italic>iii) The authors state that the contribution of ligand-gated channels to NG2 cell calcium elevations was minimal as 4-AP boosted the responses and their uncaging protocol did not elicit calcium signals (unpublished observations). A branch specific uncaging protocol may not activate enough glutamate receptors to cause a calcium event; the authors should use full field photo-uncaging to test whether glutamate receptor activation during control conditions can cause NG2 an intercellular calcium increase.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We seem to have caused a misunderstanding. We did not want to imply that a calcium increase in NG2 cells via glutamate receptors is not possible under any circumstances. Rather we wanted to point out that with a weak, branch-specific glutamate uncaging protocol we did not observe calcium increases via glutamate receptors alone – just as the reviewer would also not have expected it.</p><p>We now clarify this in the Discussion section:</p><p>“The kinetics and magnitude of Ca<sup>2</sup> signals in NG2 cell dendrites induced by local synaptic stimulation or local glutamate uncaging match those evoked by somatic current injection very well suggesting that they are also caused by recruitment of VGCCs. […] However, this does not imply that glutamate receptors cannot be a source of Ca<sup>2</sup> entry if more widespread opening of receptors is achieved (see Ge et al. 2006).”</p><p><italic>iv) The extended duration of NG2 calcium signals (2.5 seconds) suggests involvement of internal calcium stores. Indeed, Haberlandt et al., 2011 showed that thapsigargin reduced depolarization induced NG2 calcium signaling. The authors should at minimum comment on this in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We now experimentally show that calcium stores are not involved in the calcium signals we report: Both synaptically- and mock PSP-induced calcium signals are seen in the presence of thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C-E</xref>). We also discuss potential differences to the Haberlandt study:</p><p>&quot;Haberlandt et al. reported that depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2</sup> signals in NG2 cells are very sensitive to thapsigargin seemingly contradicting our findings (Haberlandt et al. (2011). However, the aforementioned study used a much stronger stimulus and depolarized NG2 cells for 100 ms to +20 mV (voltage clamp) and the resulting Ca<sup>2</sup> signal showed kinetics an order of magnitude slower than reported here. Thus, it is conceivable that NG2 cells generally can generate store-dependent Ca<sup>2</sup> signals but that store-dependent signaling is not readily recruited by synaptic activity studied here.&quot;</p><p><italic>2) Whether stimulation of synaptic input to NG2 cells results in calcium events remains controversial. While Velez-Fort et al., 2010 report did not elicit somatic increases in calcium in the barrel cortex, Haberlandt et al., 2011 did document tetanic stimulation resulted in somatic calcium increases in some NG2 cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, though responses were variable). The authors should attempt similar experiments to examine whether this type of synaptic stimulation results in increases in calcium in NG2 cell processes. Additional experiments using full field photo-uncaging or application of hypertonic aCSF would also greater contribute to determining whether stimulation of synaptic inputs results in NG2 cell calcium signaling under control conditions.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref> we now show that synaptic stimulation elicits the same type of calcium signal as mock PSPs do (kinetics and amplitude). We have used local stimulation close to a dendrite and obtained local dendritic calcium responses using a substantially briefer stimulus when compared to the Haberlandt et al. study (6 vs 100 stimuli).</p><p><italic>3) Previous studies have explored the involvement of calcium channel subtypes in mediating the calcium events in NG2 cells (Fulton et al., 2010; Haberlandt et al., 2011). Pharmacological experiments using the author's novel protocol would further strengthen the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><bold>Response:</bold> We have included a pharmacological characterization and can now show that the calcium signals in NG2 cells are largely mediated by T- and R-type calcium channels using the blockers SNX-482 and TTA-P2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
