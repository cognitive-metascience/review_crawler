We investigated the lasting effects of a single bout of neonatal inflammation on adult respiratory control in the form of respiratory motor plasticity induced by acute intermittent hypoxia, which likely compensates and stabilizes breathing during injury or disease and has significant therapeutic potential. Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation at postnatal day four induced lasting impairments in two distinct pathways to adult respiratory plasticity in male and female rats. Despite a lack of adult pro-inflammatory gene expression or alterations in glial morphology, one mechanistic pathway to plasticity was restored by acute, adult anti-inflammatory treatment, suggesting ongoing inflammatory signaling after neonatal inflammation. An alternative pathway to plasticity was not restored by anti-inflammatory treatment, but was evoked by exogenous adenosine receptor agonism, suggesting upstream impairment, likely astrocytic-dependent. Thus, the respiratory control network is vulnerable to early-life inflammation, limiting respiratory compensation to adult disease or injury.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45399.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Breathing is essential to life. At birth, the brain quickly adapts and learns to control breathing in different situations. This adaptability is called neuroplasticity. Most breathing-related adjustments in the brain are short-term, like breathing faster during exercise. The brain can also learn from prior experience to prepare for future situations. For example, intermittent exposure to low oxygen causes long-term changes in signals from the brain to muscles controlling breathing, which may help them prepare for future low oxygen situations. This is called long-term facilitation (LTF). This neuroplasticity may also help the brain to compensate or stabilize breathing during an illness or injury.</p><p>Illnesses shortly after birth can affect how the brain controls breathing and may contribute to respiratory diseases later in life. They may also have lasting effects on the ability to of the brain to learn and respond to stress, and may even contribute to psychiatric disorders or age-related cognitive decline.</p><p>Now, Hocker et al. show that inflammation shortly after birth has effects on breathing control that extend into adulthood. In the experiments, rats were injected four days after birth with either saline solution or a drug causing inflammation. When the rats grew into adults, their ability to make long-term breathing adjustments, or LTF, was assessed. In the rats exposed to early life inflammation two important pathways that enable LTF were eliminated. One pathway was restored when the rats received an anti-inflammatory treatment. Activating nerve cells reinstated the other pathway, suggesting these cells are not impaired.</p><p>The experiments suggest inflammation during early life impairs breathing control later on and may contribute to adult respiratory disease. Inflammation is common among infants in their first year, particularly among those born prematurely. This early-life inflammation may put them at risk of diseases associated with breathing control, like sleep apnoea, later in life. More studies are needed to understand the relationship between early life inflammation, respiratory control, and respiratory disease later in life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neonatal inflammation</kwd><kwd>respiratory motor plasticity</kwd><kwd>respiratory control</kwd><kwd>inflammatory gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL141249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huxtable</surname><given-names>Adrianne G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL111598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watters</surname><given-names>Jyoti J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single neonatal inflammatory event induces long-term impairments in two forms of adult respiratory motor plasticity, an important aspect of the control of breathing for compensation after injury or disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At birth, neonates transition from a sterile maternal environment into an environment filled with pathogens, microbes, and toxins and must simultaneously begin robust, rhythmic breathing. Respiratory problems represent a significant clinical problem for neonatologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin et al., 2012</xref>), especially in preterm infants where breathing is unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Poets and Southall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poets et al., 1994</xref>) and infections are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stoll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stoll et al., 2004</xref>). Further, inflammation appears to augment respiratory dysfunction in neonates, whereby inflammation depresses hypoxic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rourke et al., 2016</xref>) and induces recurrent apneas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hofstetter et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the prevalence of early life inflammation, little is known about the long-lasting consequences of neonatal inflammation on adult neurorespiratory control.</p><p>We are beginning to understand the potential for long-term consequences of early life inflammation in other physiological systems.

Yet, we know very little about the long-term effects of neonatal inflammation on adult neurorespiratory control.</p><p>Respiratory plasticity is an important feature of the neural control of breathing, providing adaptability and maintenance of breathing when the respiratory system is challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuller and Mitchell, 2017</xref>). Phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF) is a frequently studied adult model of respiratory motor plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mitchell and Johnson, 2003</xref>) and is elicited by at least two distinct cellular signaling pathways: the Q-pathway and the S-pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dale-Nagle et al., 2010</xref>). The Q-pathway is evoked by moderate acute intermittent hypoxia (mAIH; 3 Ã 5 min hypoxic episodes, PaO<sub>2</sub>35â45 mmHg) and is serotonin dependent, while the S-pathway is evoked by severe AIH (sAIH, PaO<sub>2</sub>25â35 mmHg) and is adenosine dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nichols et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Q-pathway-evoked plasticity is undermined by even low levels of acute, adult, systemic inflammation and restored by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, ketoprofen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vinit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huxtable et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hocker and Huxtable, 2018</xref>), while S-pathway-evoked adult plasticity is inflammation resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agosto-Marlin et al., 2017</xref>). Though we are beginning to understand more about the mechanisms of acute, adult inflammation on respiratory motor plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hocker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hocker and Huxtable, 2018</xref>), we do not know how inflammation in early postnatal life impacts respiratory motor plasticity in the adult. Furthermore, few studies have investigated sex-differences in pLTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dougherty et al., 2017</xref>) and we know even less about sex-differences in respiratory control in response to inflammation. Additionally, males are more sensitive acutely to neonatal inflammation leading to higher male mortality in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bouman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kentner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rathod et al., 2017</xref>), but our understanding of other sex-differences after neonatal inflammation are unknown. Given the profound effects of neonatal inflammation on other physiological systems, we tested the hypothesis that neonatal inflammation undermines Q-pathway, but not S-pathway, respiratory motor plasticity in adult male and female rats.</p><p>Our results indicate that one neonatal inflammatory challenge completely abolishes adult, AIH-induced Q-pathway and S-pathway respiratory motor plasticity. Despite no lasting increases in adult, inflammatory gene expression, Q-pathway impairment is inflammation-dependent and is restored by acute adult anti-inflammatory treatment. Conversely, S-pathway impairment is inflammation-independent, but can be evoked by intermittent adenosine receptor agonism, suggesting phrenic motor neurons are not impaired. Since astrocytes are a primary source of adenosine during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>), they are likely impaired by neonatal inflammation and contributing to impairment of respiratory plasticity. These studies are the first steps toward understanding the lasting effects of neonatal inflammation on adult respiratory plasticity and suggest neonatal inflammation induces lasting-changes, increasing susceptibility to adult ventilatory control disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neonatal inflammation acutely delays weight gain and increases male mortality</title><p>Male and female postnatal day 4 (P4) rats were injected with either LPS (Lipopolysaccharide; 1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline.

Here, we investigated the long-term consequences of neonatal systemic inflammation on adult respiratory motor plasticity, a key feature of the neural control of breathing providing adaptability to respiratory system challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mitchell and Johnson, 2003</xref>). We show for the first time that a single inflammatory challenge to neonates completely abolishes AIH-induced Q-pathway and S-pathway-evoked respiratory motor plasticity in adult males and females. Our results indicate a persistent change in adult inflammatory signaling contributes to this impairment since adult anti-inflammatory treatment restores Q-pathway-evoked, but not S-pathway-evoked, pLTF. Further, this is the first evidence of impairment of S-pathway-evoked motor plasticity, suggesting neonatal inflammation likely leads to a further vulnerable adult as this pathway was thought of as a âbackup pathwayâ after acute, adult inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agosto-Marlin et al., 2017</xref>). However, we demonstrate S-pathway plasticity can be revealed by intermittent, spinal adenosine receptor agonism, suggesting astrocyte dysfunction after neonatal inflammation since they are the likely source of adenosine during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>). These studies are the first steps toward understanding the lasting effects of neonatal inflammation on adult neurorespiratory control and suggest neonatal inflammation may increase susceptibility to adult ventilatory control disorders.</p><p>LPS-induced neonatal inflammation transiently upregulates cytokines in regions involved in respiratory control and plasticity (N. Morrison, S. Johnson, J. Watters, A. Huxtable, unpublished observations), consistent with inflammatory profiles in other CNS regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz and Bilbo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bilbo and Schwarz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jafri et al., 2013</xref>). Neonatal inflammation also increases male mortality, consistent with clinical male mortality after neonatal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Person et al., 2014</xref>) and is relevant to the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kinney and Thach, 2009</xref>). However, similar to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bilbo et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mouihate et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), we found no measurable adult changes in cytokines, or glial number or morphology despite a lasting inflammation-dependent impairment in Q-pathway-evoked pLTF. While we have previously demonstrated adult Q-pathway pLTF is sensitive to low levels of acute, systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huxtable et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huxtable et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huxtable et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huxtable et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vinit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hocker and Huxtable, 2018</xref>), this is the first study to demonstrate neonatal inflammation induces lasting changes in inflammatory signaling to undermine adult Q-pathway-evoked pLTF. Additionally, S-pathway-evoked pLTF is not restored by even the high dose of ketoprofen used here, but is revealed by intermittent adenosine 2A receptor agonism on phrenic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seven et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, these results indicate phrenic motor neurons are not impaired after neonatal inflammation and the loss of S-pathway-evoked plasticity is likely due to impaired adenosine signaling during hypoxia. Furthermore, a likely source of adenosine during hypoxia is astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting neonatal inflammation induces lasting astrocyte-specific changes in the adult spinal cord to impair adult S-pathway-evoked pLTF. Further understanding the mechanisms impairing distinct forms of respiratory motor plasticity is required to develop plasticity as a therapeutic tool, such as for spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, considering the cross-talk between Q- and S-pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dale-Nagle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fields and Mitchell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Perim et al., 2018</xref>), the response of the respiratory control system likely depends on the functional status of both Q- and S-pathways. Thus, future studies are needed to understand how inflammation modifies cross-talk between Q- and S-pathways and how respiratory motor plasticity can be exploited therapeutically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez-Rothi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The timing of neonatal inflammation is likely a significant factor in how neonatal inflammation impacts adult physiology. Low-levels of cytokines are important for neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bilbo and Schwarz, 2009</xref>), and perturbing the balance of neonatal cytokines during development leads to lasting aberrant effects on neural circuits and developing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reemst et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, while many components of the respiratory system begin developing <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prakash et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pagliardini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mantilla and Sieck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>), the respiratory control system undergoes significant postnatal maturation. In these studies, we induced systemic inflammation with LPS at P4, similar to other studies showing long-term consequences of neonatal inflammation in other physiological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shanks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Walker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bilbo, 2010</xref>), supporting the idea that important neural changes occur within the first week of life. Yet, it remains to be determined whether there is a precise critical period where neonatal inflammation impacts respiratory control circuits. However, our data on male mortality after neonatal LPS are consistent with other critical developmental windows, including a male-specific sensitive period to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rourke et al., 2016</xref>), disproportionate male mortality from neonatal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Person et al., 2014</xref>), the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kinney and Thach, 2009</xref>), and increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea in adults after neonatal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McNamara and Sullivan, 2000</xref>). Thus, these data have important implications for understanding the sex-specific impairment early in life and into adulthood. Additionally, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spencer et al., 2006</xref>) observed a short delay in weight gain after neonatal inflammation, which normalized by weaning, suggesting no lasting effects on growth. Future studies are needed to refine our understanding of the critical periods during development when early-life inflammation induces long-lasting physiological changes to improve our understanding of adult disease and better understand important developmental processes.</p><p>While other reports have shown sex differences in neonatal programming of adult neuro-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">LaPrairie and Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rana et al., 2012</xref>), we observed no sex-differences in the effects of neonatal inflammation on adult plasticity. Importantly, this is the first evidence of inflammation abolishing pLTF in females and the first to report sAIH-induced respiratory motor plasticity in females. Females exhibited greater acute hypoxic phrenic amplitude responses relative to males, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mortola and Saiki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavis et al., 2004</xref>), despite variability in reports of sex differences in hypoxic ventilatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behan and Kinkead, 2011</xref>). In contrast to our results following neonatal inflammation, neonatal stress alters adult hypoxic responses in a sex-dependent manner, whereby male responses are enhanced and female responses are blunted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rousseau et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the long-term effects on respiratory control may be dependent on the type of stressors in early life. Importantly, our experiments were performed in adult, ovariectomized females with exogenously restored estradiol levels to permit respiratory motor plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zabka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dougherty et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, as sex hormones are known to modulate respiratory control and hypoxic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behan and Kinkead, 2011</xref>), we cannot rule out a confounding role for exogenous estradiol supplementation after ovariectomy. Finally, after neonatal inflammation, we found no differences in adult hypoxic responses, suggesting no lasting change in carotid body responses due to neonatal inflammation. Accordingly, the deficit in adult respiratory motor plasticity after neonatal inflammation is likely a consequence of long-term changes in the spinal cord where pLTF occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker-Herman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Devinney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dale et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While adult anti-inflammatory treatment restored Q-pathway-evoked pLTF, we did not observe increases in inflammatory gene expression in adult medullary or cervical spinal cord homogenates. Thus, while inflammatory signaling contributes to the impairment of adult plasticity, the source of this signaling change remains unclear and will be the topic of future studies. Similarly, others demonstrated no changes in baseline CNS inflammatory markers after neonatal inflammation, but observed priming of glial responses to adult stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bilbo et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mouihate et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting lasting changes in glia have the potential to underlie impairments in adult respiratory plasticity. Contrary to other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">BoissÃ© et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kentner et al., 2010</xref>), we found spinal COX-2 gene expression was decreased in adulthood, suggesting a decrease in inflammatory signaling, which is unlikely to contribute to the lasting inflammation-dependent impairment in plasticity. Further, the acute inflammatory impairment of adult respiratory plasticity is COX-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huxtable et al., 2018a</xref>), emphasizing a role for other inflammatory molecules mediating the lasting impairment in respiratory motor plasticity. Unmeasured inflammatory genes or post-transcriptional changes in inflammatory proteins may be responsible for undermining adult pLTF after neonatal inflammation. Conversely, other perinatal stimuli involving inflammatory signaling, such as maternal care and diet, do have lasting programming effects on adult inflammatory cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bilbo and Schwarz, 2009</xref>), but are more complex stimuli than the acute neonatal inflammation in our study. We also observed no change in microglial or astrocyte density and no obvious qualitative changes in morphology in adult medullas or spinal cords after neonatal inflammation. Thus, there are no obvious signs of inflammation in regions contributing to pLTF despite the restoration of Q-pathway-evoked pLTF with ketoprofen. Furthermore, the abolition of S-pathway-evoked pLTF is likely due to lasting changes in adenosine signaling from astrocytes, suggesting an astrocyte-specific change underlies this impairment. Thus, future studies are needed to identify inflammatory mechanisms undermining the Q-pathway and further details of the inflammation-independent mechanism responsible for undermining S-pathway-evoked motor plasticity.</p><p>The adult respiratory control network is vulnerable to early life stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genest et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fournier et al., 2011</xref>), which may undermine the ability to compensate during adult ventilatory control disorders. Our study is the first to demonstrate lasting consequences of neonatal inflammation on adult respiratory control. These deficits in respiratory control are independent of later life events, in contrast to other studies in which the physiological effects of early life inflammation are not revealed until after an adult stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bilbo et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bilbo, 2010</xref>). We found a single episode of neonatal systemic inflammation induced lasting impairment of both Q- and S-pathway-evoked respiratory motor plasticity in adults. Our results suggest the adult impairment of Q-pathway plasticity is dependent on acute inflammatory signaling; however, we observed no lasting increase in adult inflammatory gene expression or the density of astrocytes and microglia. The pharmacological induction of S-pathway-evoked pLTF demonstrates phrenic motor neurons are capable of plasticity and suggest upstream impairment, such as the source of adenosine. While strong evidence supports astrocytes as the primary source of adenosine during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>), we cannot rule out other sources of adenosine. Identifying cell-type specific changes underlying lasting physiological impairments will be explored in future studies. Future studies will investigate the lasting effects of neonatal inflammation on isolated microglia and astrocytes to uncover potential mechanisms of adult impairments after neonatal inflammation.</p><p>Together, these results indicate two mechanistic pathways to spinal motor plasticity induced by AIH are undermined by neonatal inflammation in rats. Our experimental approach assessed phrenic nerve output in anesthetized rats and may not be generalizable to respiratory control in freely behaving animals or to other forms of motor plasticity. However, AIH induces long-term facilitation of ventilation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mateika and Komnenov, 2017</xref>) and strengthens corticospinal pathways to non-respiratory motor-neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christiansen et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting our results likely have relevance to mechanisms of human spinal motor plasticity after AIH. While AIH-induced respiratory motor plasticity does not necessarily alter normal homeostatic control of ventilation, the general facilitation of spinal motor output has significant therapeutic potential for treating patients with respiratory and non-respiratory motor limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trumbower et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trumbower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nichols et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>)</p><p>In conclusion, this basic science study has major implications for the understanding the neonatal origins of adult ventilatory control disorders. These studies are the first evidence that one neonatal inflammatory exposure induces long-term impairments in adult respiratory control with potential relevance to many respiratory disorders. These findings are particularly relevant since inflammation is common in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Person et al., 2014</xref>), especially those born prematurely who are at higher risk for adult disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luu et al., 2016</xref>). Improving our appreciation of how early life inflammation can influence adult respiratory control will have important consequences for understanding adult disease and susceptibility to respiratory disorders. Additionally, AIH-induced spinal motor plasticity is also a promising therapy to enhance motor recovery after spinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trumbower et al., 2012</xref>). However, not all patients respond to AIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trumbower et al., 2017</xref>) and our findings suggest neonatal inflammatory exposure could contribute to these therapeutic limitations and understanding the mechanisms undermining plasticity will increase the therapeutic potential of AIH-induced spinal motor plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">LPS (Lipopolysaccharides from e Coli (0111:B4))</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">L4130</td><td valign="top">dissolved in saline, 1 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Keto ((S) - (+) - Ketoprofen)</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">471909</td><td valign="top">dissolved in 50% ethanol in saline,12.5 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">CGS-21680</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">C141</td><td valign="top">dissolved in DMSO to50 mM for storage in aliquots.

Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, tracheotomized, ventilated (Rat Ventilator, VetEquip), and vagotomized bilaterally. A venous catheter was placed for drug delivery and fluid replacement, and a femoral arterial catheter was used to monitor blood pressure and for arterial blood sampling. Arterial blood samples were analyzed (PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, pH, base excess; Siemens RAPIDLAB 248) during baseline, during the first hypoxic response, and 15, 30 and 60 min post-AIH.

The work comes from a well-established laboratory with significant contributions to our understanding of phrenic nerve plasticity measured as long-term facilitation after several short exposures to intermittent hypoxia. They have outlined the 2 distinct cellular and molecular pathways that underlies this plasticity (S and Q pathway). They describe in this manuscript the effect of sex on the outcome variables.</p><p>Introduction: The Introduction nicely outlines the rationale for the experiments and points out that little is known about the effect of sex on expression of pLTF after neonatal exposure to inflammation. The topic is important since there are several adult onset diseases that are likely secondary to early neonatal exposure to inflammation such as Parkinsonism, and pLTF is thought to be a protective reflex to sustain ventilation during hypoxic exposure. The hypothesis is clearly stated that neonatal inflammation undermines the Q-pathway but not the S-pathway, respiratory motor plasticity in adult male and female rats.</p><p>The major findings are that LPS exposure in neonatal rats (1) increased mortality only in male pup, (2) abolished the phrenic nerve plasticity (pLTF) induced by moderate intermittent hypoxia involving the Q-pathway, and acute exposure to ketoprofen given to adults restored the pLTF, (3) similarly, the S-pathway mediating pLTF was affected in both male and female adult rats but ketoprofen did not restore the response, lastly (4) adult females had a greater acute phrenic amplitude response during moderate and severe hypoxia but this was unaffected by LPS exposure or Keto. Of note, markers of inflammation (cytokine gene expression markers of microglia activation) examined was not seen in the areas of the brainstem and cervical spinal cord). The authors conclude the effects observed in adult animals suggest neonatal inflammation affects peripheral inflammatory signaling or protein expression that mediates the responses.</p><p>Overall the findings are interesting and the paper well written but very long. I do have some concerns about the conclusion stated by the authors based on the experimental design and the data presented. The following questions should be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors use the term &quot;motor plasticity&quot; but the experiments only measured neural activity from the phrenic nerve. They also refer to &quot;ventilator responses&quot; the animals are anesthestized, paralyzed and vagotimzed, they don't have a &quot;ventilatory response&quot;. The authors should simply state what was measured the electrical responses of the phrenic neurogram.</p><p>2) Is it possible that these experiments could have been done in awake animals? Can you observe the long-term motor plasticity and true ventilatory responses? Experiments in awake animals would be more meaningful. How does the phrenic responses translate into the true response that we are interested in -Ventilation?</p><p>3) What were serum glucose levels during the experimental challenges?</p><p>4) Why did the male animals have greater mortality after LPS exposure?</p><p>5) Was a dose response of LPS done in preliminary experiments? If not, why was the current dose of LPS chosen?</p><p>6) Did LPS exposure ever elicit an inflammatory response within the brains of these animals during the neonatal period? This would have been of interest to even know that the amount given ever elicited a central response.</p><p>7) What &quot;peripheral&quot; systems do the authors believe the early LPS exposure is modifying.</p><p>8) Why did the authors choose ketoprofen vs other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or even steroids?</p><p>9) The authors also conclude that their data indicate that a persistent change in the adult inflammatory signaling contributes to the over findings since Ketoprofen restores the response. Does this imply that the S pathway is not the modified by inflammation? The authors never demonstrate that &quot;any inflammation&quot; (central or peripheral) exist in the animals What are the off target non-anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen? Is the difference between the effects of the ketoprofen on the Q and S pathway simply because a high enough dose wasn't used?</p><p>10) Tissues were examined after the acute experiment was performed. Were tissues from LPS and saline exposed animals examined prior to the acute hypoxic experiments? Is it possible that the acute exposures may have modified the gene and protein expression pattern?</p><p>11) The paper is quite long, and a lot of the findings show no difference between the groups; I think the figures could be reduced by 25%. There is also an excessive number of references.</p><p>12) Not sure that is necessary for the authors to reference so many papers from their laboratory. There are an excessive number of references.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study &quot;A single bout of neonatal inflammation impairs adult respiratory motor plasticity in male and female rats&quot; by Hocker et al., shows that a single application of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after birth produces a reduction of different forms of long-term facilitation (LTF), which can be reverted by ketoprofen, in some cases. The finding that early inflammation induces long-lasting effects on breathing plasticity agrees with a wide variety of findings showing that early inflammation induces long-lasting effects on a several brain circuits (Walker et al., 2003; Spencer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Kentner et al., 2010; Kirsten et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2015; Comim et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017; including the spinal cord; Walker et al., 2003; Li et al., 2010) and their plasticity (Walker et al., 2003; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Onufriev et al., 2017). Surprisingly, in contrast with other reports, the effects observed in this study did not correlate with changes in glia morphology (for contrast see: Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013; Lan et al., 2015) and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (for contrast see: Cai et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2013; Patil et al., 2016, Onufriev et al., 2017) or proinflammatory mediators (for contrast see: Spencer et al., 2006; Kentner et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013; Lunardelli et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017). I consider the findings to be relevant, but also partially similar to the already described changes in other circuits of the brain by the same experimental manipulation (Walker et al., 2003;Spencer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Kentner et al., 2010; Kirsten et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2015; Comim et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017). On the other hand, the mechanisms behind the findings of the present study are still foggy, since it is not clear what is the source of the inflammatory and the non-inflammatory signals involved in the described effects. Considering the contradictory evidence already available (Walker et al., 2003;Spencer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Kentner et al., 2010; Kirsten et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2015; Comim et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017), the clarification of the mechanisms involved in the modulation described in this work would contribute to the relevance of the study.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;One bout of neonatal inflammation impairs adult respiratory motor plasticity in male and female rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jan-Marino Ramirez as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1 and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Hocker et al., has important implications. Many babies are exposed to inflammatory events early during their development, and due to an improved healthcare, these babies mostly survive and recover. Yet, it is unclear whether this recovery is complete, and whether even in the absence of any acute inflammation there are long-term consequences on respiratory control. The present study addresses this important issue employing an established rodent model that uses respiratory plasticity in the phrenic nerve as a well-defined respiratory output.</p><p>This manuscript is a resubmission of a previously reviewed manuscript, and the authors performed additional experiments to address several of the reviewers' original comments. Their new experiments shed new light on the potential involvement of astrocytes (as it relates to the S-pathway in case of severe AIH). The authors also added new experimental data indicating distinct differences between the impairment of Q and S-pathways caused by neonatal inflammation. These are major revisions to the previous manuscript â which is particularly remarkable since such developmental studies consume considerable time.</p><p>The authors also added a discussion of the importance of acute intermittent hypoxia in the context of spinal cord injury and the therapeutic application for motor neuron disease. The authors emphasize the important implication in particular that the application of AIH could be undermined by early inflammatory experiences.</p><p>The authors also included a table from a separate study that describes in detail the inflammatory gene data that are associated with the LPS induced inflammation. However, it makes sense that these data are not included in the present study â because they are published elsewhere. However, these data were helpful for evaluating the findings of the present study, because their careful characterization confirms that there is impairment of respiratory activity even though the inflammatory gene responses have returned to baseline.</p><p>This leads to the important conclusion that the observed loss of plasticity is unlikely due to an ongoing inflammation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers concluded that no additional experiments will be required. However, some concerns remained unaddressed, and need to be carefully addressed in the revision.</p><p>1) The authors should include a limitation section that discusses the experimental approach: in particular whether their findings can be translated to a fully integrated/ intact model animal or human. Regardless of how the model might allow one to dissect out pathways that underlie pLTF, if the whole purpose of the reflex is to maintain ventilation to compensate for hypoxia, then it is still important to demonstrate that the findings are relevant to ventilation in intact, unanesthetized animals. Please address what the findings mean behaviorally, if they are transmitted to the muscles of respiration?</p><p>2) We suggest reducing the number of figures with negative findings, and instead include a table showing what is different between the groups, which pathway is implicated, and the gender effects. The table would allow the reader to get a better conceptual view of all the many variables that are being assessed in this study.</p><p>3) The Abstract is very short and not very informative. The age of the animal at the time of the exposure and the age of the animals when the pLTF was assessed is not included. Moreover, there are sex differences that also are not specified in the Abstract.</p><p>4) In their response, the authors have clearly indicated the novelty of their relevant findings, in contrast to the wealth of evidence regarding the long-term consequences of early-life inflammation. Which, by the way, was clear in the original submission. However, we think that it is still necessary to carefully deal with the fact that among those published effects there is a long-lasting change in astrocytes and microglia as well as in their inflammatory mediators. Since these changes were not observed in the submitted study, the authors should include a proper discussion of the source of these differences and they should discuss the alternative mechanisms that could potentially be involved. The authors have shown several aspects that are not involved in their novel findings, which we agree is very important. The authors have also included a set of experiments that indirectly indicate that the astrocytic function could be affected by early-life inflammation, but this needs to be carefully discussed. We agree with the authors that although indirect, these experiments hint that astrocytes could have been changed by early-life inflammation. What we would like to see in the revision is that the authors discuss future experiments or avenues that could more directly address their observations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45399.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration.

We also now include additional evidence demonstrating that phrenic motor neurons are not impaired after neonatal inflammation, suggesting impairment in glial cell (e.g. astrocyte) function. Given the developmental nature of this study, collection and analysis of new data represent significant changes in the manuscript from the original submission and significantly enhance the overall impact of the manuscript. Lastly, we modified the manuscript to emphasize the clinical relevance of these studies by discussing the use of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH)-induced plasticity therapeutically after spinal cord injury, and potential use for treatment of motor neuron disease. Our novel findings demonstrate that such therapeutic approaches would be undermined by experiences early in life.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers felt that additional experiments will be necessary to increase the significance of your findings. The reviewers had several specific recommendations and suggestions.</p><p>1) It would be important to demonstrate that there is indeed significant inflammation in areas relevant for LTF â e.g. phrenic nucleus â 48hours after LPS injection and 1 or two weeks later.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue, as we are also interested in the inflammatory state of CNS regions relevant to respiratory plasticity after LPS. The ability of LPS to induce inflammation at a variety of doses are well documented both in neonates and adults in many CNS regions (reviewed in Bilbo and Schwarz, 2012). Indeed, we have gone to considerable effort to characterize the effects of LPS-induced inflammation in respiratory control regions after neonatal LPS. In the context of this manuscript, the most salient point is that in adults, long after the inflammatory gene response has returned to baseline levels after neonatal LPS challenge, there are lasting impairments in respiratory activity. Figure 4 in the manuscript shows that there is no significant difference in inflammatory gene expression in adults challenged with either neonatal saline or LPS, despite the loss of respiratory motor plasticity in the LPS-challenged adults. Thus, while neonatal inflammation causes transient increases in the expression of inflammatory genes, the lasting effects of neonatal inflammation into adulthood either result from cell-type specific inflammatory signaling changes not captured in our analysis, or ongoing inflammation in other CNS regions impacting spinal motor plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers also recommended to add some experiments that show that LTF translates into an altered hypoxic ventilatory response in freely moving unanesthetized animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that changes in ventilatory responses in freely behaving animals are of interest, and those studies represent the next stage of experiments in this project. The present study is the first to characterize lasting impairments in the neural control of breathing after a single inflammatory insult during the neonatal period, and our current electrophysiologic approach has important strengths not afforded in freely behaving animals: (1) it enables measurement of changes in neural control <underline>independent</underline> of the mechanics of breathing, and (2) it allows us to better investigate mechanisms of respiratory motor plasticity using direct application of drugs onto the cervical spinal cord, where LTF occurs (see response to #3 above). While it is possible to measure respiratory motor plasticity in freely behaving animals (e.g. ventilatory LTF, see response to reviewer 2 #2), our interest is in the change in neural output caused by neonatal inflammation. Neuroplasticity cannot be studied in the context of whole animal breathing, and the powerful electrophysiologic model we have used here has allowed the identification of several cellular mechanisms underlying AIH-induced pLTF (reviewed in Turner et al., 2018). Further, studying spinal motor plasticity induced by acute intermittent hypoxia is of particular clinical relevance because intermittent hypoxia not only enhances respiratory motor output, but it also facilitates motor output throughout the spinal cord, and is used therapeutically to improve locomotor function in patients after spinal cord injury (Trumbower et al., 2012, 2017; Hayes et al., 2014). Thus, the impact of early life inflammation on motor neuron plasticity has clinical relevance for the utility of acute intermittent hypoxia as a therapeutic in regions <underline>independent</underline> of ventilation, underscoring the importance of studying plasticity in its own right. The restoration of spinal motor plasticity with acute anti-inflammatories suggests that anti-inflammatories may enhance the therapeutic benefit of acute intermittent hypoxia on motor output. We have revised the discussion accordingly, to include this important possibility (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another issue that was raised relates to the apparent lack of a glial involvement. It would be more convincing to the readers, if the authors would add a deeper glial characterization e.g. trough flow cytometry, an approach which you seem to be familiar with (Nikodemova et al., 2012; 2014; 2015; 2016), and/or an additional test to explore whether glial responsivity to inflammatory challenges has been altered (Li et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2013; Lunardelli et al., 2015). It is possible that the glia seem unchanged under &quot;resting&quot; conditions but become more prone (primed) towards activation, something you are also very familiar with (Huxtable et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is possible that glia appear morphologically normal in adults, but that they are âprimedâ to respond differently after a subsequent adult stimulus. It is however important to highlight that the deficits in respiratory control presented here are <underline>independent</underline> of later life inflammatory events â findings that contrast with other studies showing the physiological effects of early life inflammation are only revealed after a subsequent adult stimulus (Bilbo and Schwarz, 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Bilbo, 2010; Kirsten et al., 2010, 2011; Roughton et al., 2013). That respiratory plasticity is impaired in the absence of a subsequent challenge underscores the novelty of our study and emphasizes the profound sensitivity of the neonatal respiratory circuitry to a single bout of early-life inflammation.</p><p>Nonetheless, based on the reviewer comments, we have now added an additional set of experiments that advance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of, and glial involvement in, the impairment of S-pathway-evoked pLTF. The S-pathway is adenosine dependent (Nichols et al., 2012) and astrocytes are the primary source of adenosine during hypoxia (Takahashi et al., 2010; Angelova et al., 2015). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that astrocyte-phrenic motor neuron signaling is impaired in adults after neonatal inflammation. To test this idea, we utilized what is known about the mechanisms of S-pathway-evoked plasticity (Golder et al., 2008; Nichols et al., 2012), and episodically applied an adenosine receptor agonist. Our new data demonstrate that phrenic motor neurons are not generally impaired after neonatal inflammation as adenosine was able to elicit S-pathway-evoked pLTF. Rather, these new data suggest that the lasting impairment in S-pathway-evoked pLTF may be due to an alteration in adult spinal astrocytes, since the likely source of adenosine during severe intermittent hypoxia (sAIH) is astrocytes (Takahashi et al., 2010; Angelova et al., 2015). These results do not, however, rule out a role for altered microglia-astrocyte-neuron signaling, and the role of glia continue to be a topic of ongoing studies in our group. We are presently pursuing flow cytometry and RNAseq to better understand the status of astrocytes (and microglia) in adults following neonatal inflammation; these complex molecular analyses are beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a solid study by Hocker et al., investigating the consequences of neonatal LPS injection on respiratory plasticity.

We agree that the results are both intriguing and surprising (and also perhaps a bit frustrating!). However, as with any complex physiological process, it can be challenging at first to unravel all of the mechanisms underlying a phenomenon. As described above (response to #3 above), we have undertaken further studies to better understand the mechanisms underlying abolition of plasticity. Our results indicate adult impairment of the Q-pathway is a result of an inflammation-dependent process, and we are performing a number of molecular analyses to identify the molecule(s) key to this impairment. However, the inflammatory response is complex, and identifying the âculpritâ inflammatory molecule will require extensive molecular analyses. Such studies represent the next several years of our research plan, and are thus, beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>Impairment of the S-pathway, on the other hand, appears to be independent of inflammatory signaling, and our new data (Figure 7 in the manuscript) demonstrate phrenic motor neurons are not impaired after neonatal inflammation. We propose that S-pathway impairment is due to a lasting impairment in adenosine signaling, the source of which (astrocytes) is likely altered by neonatal inflammation. Intermittent application of adenosine induces S-pathway plasticity by activating adenosine 2A receptors on phrenic motor neurons (Seven et al., 2017), a pathway that appears normal after neonatal inflammation, suggesting that phrenic motor neurons themselves do not exhibit lasting detriments in motor output after neonatal inflammation. We have restructured the order of the results to clarify the mechanistic results in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes experiments designed to determine the effect of 1 time exposure to LPS during neonatal period in newborn rats on respiratory motor plasticity in adulthood.

The hypothesis is clearly stated that neonatal inflammation undermines the Q-pathway but not the S-pathway, respiratory motor plasticity in adult male and female rats.</p><p>The major findings are that LPS exposure in neonatal rats (1) increased mortality only in male pup, (2) abolished the phrenic nerve plasticity (pLTF) induced by moderate intermittent hypoxia involving the Q-pathway, and acute exposure to ketoprofen given to adults restored the pLTF, (3) similarly, the S-pathway mediating pLTF was affected in both male and female adult rats but ketoprofen did not restore the response, lastly (4) adult females had a greater acute phrenic amplitude response during moderate and severe hypoxia but this was unaffected by LPS exposure or Keto. Of note, markers of inflammation (cytokine gene expression markers of microglia activation) examined was not seen in the areas of the brainstem and cervical spinal cord). The authors conclude the effects observed in adult animals suggest neonatal inflammation affects peripheral inflammatory signaling or protein expression that mediates the responses.</p><p>Overall the findings are interesting and the paper well written but very long. I do have some concerns about the conclusion stated by the authors based on the experimental design and the data presented. The following questions should be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors use the term &quot;motor plasticity&quot; but the experiments only measured neural activity from the phrenic nerve. They also refer to &quot;ventilator responses&quot; the animals are anesthestized, paralyzed and vagotimzed, they don't have a &quot;ventilatory response&quot;. The authors should simply state what was measured the electrical responses of the phrenic neurogram.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment and correction. Yes, we do use âmotor plasticityâ to describe LTF, as is common practice in studies using this model (Tadjalli et al., 2010; Agosto-Marlin et al., 2017; Lui et al., 2018; Seven et al., 2018). The manuscript has now been revised and the reference to ventilatory responses has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is it possible that these experiments could have been done in awake animals? Can you observe the long-term motor plasticity and true ventilatory responses? Experiments in awake animals would be more meaningful. How does the phrenic responses translate into the true response that we are interested in -Ventilation?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that aspects of the experiments here could be conducted in awake, freely behaving animals. For example, ventilatory LTF (vLTF), a lasting increase in ventilation after intermittent hypoxia in awake animals, can be used to monitor neuroplastic changes in breathing. However, a number of important limitations hinder the utility of using vLTF as a model for understanding respiratory neuroplasticity; the magnitude of vLTF is small (Olson et al., 2001), sleep state rapidly alters vLTF (Nakamura et al., 2010), and vLTF is much more variable than phrenic LTF (Olson et al., 2001). Furthermore, pLTF is a more useful model for understanding mechanistic aspects of respiratory plasticity, as the mechanistic underpinnings of pLTF have been studied by us and others for more than 25 years (Turner et al., 2018). Thus, we chose the most commonly studied model of respiratory plasticity, pLTF, to further probe mechanisms undermining adult plasticity after neonatal inflammation (see also response to #2 above). As exemplified in our newly included data (Figure 7) using this model, we demonstrate there is likely an astrocytic, adenosine-dependent mechanism disrupted by neonatal inflammation, which is responsible for undermining adult plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What were serum glucose levels during the experimental challenges?</p></disp-quote><p>In recent experiments, we have measured blood glucose levels at the beginning and end of phrenic nerve recordings. Due to the use of the anesthetic urethane (Wang et al., 2000), blood glucose levels are elevated in all adults regardless of whether they received neonatal saline or LPS. Importantly, adult blood glucose levels do not differ between adults that received neonatal saline or LPS (p = 0.2739), and they do not change over the course of electrophysiology recordings.</p><p>P4 Saline = 225 +/- 38 mg/dL, n=6 (4 males, 2 females) P4 LPS = 251 +/- 27 mg/dL, n=4 (2 males, 2 females)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why did the male animals have greater mortality after LPS exposure?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer highlights an interesting aspect of our current study. The increase in male mortality is consistent with other reports of increased male vulnerability early in life. Interestingly, sex differences exist early in brain development to either establish or eliminate sex differences in brain function and behavior. Sex differences in microglial colonization exist at P4 in the hippocampus, parietal cortex, and amygdala with male rats having significantly more microglia than females (Bilbo and Schwarz, 2012; Schwarz et al., 2012). These sex differences have been proposed to explain different susceptibilities to certain developmental psychiatric disorders (Bilbo and Schwarz, 2012; Nelson and Guyer, 2012; Schwarz et al., 2012). Whether such differences also exist in respiratory-related regions are unknown but are currently under investigation in our laboratory. We chose not to speculate on the reason(s) for this increased mortality in males until we had more data to support such suggestions.</p><p>Although we failed to see any persistent differences in glial number or gross morphology in our current experiments, we and others, have hypothesized persistent differences in glial activities, and thus their behavior, might underlie increased male vulnerability (Nelson and Guyer, 2012; Reemst et al., 2016). Our understanding of neonatal astrocyte distribution and migration remains incomplete, but consensus is that astrogenesis continues postnatally. Both astrocytes and microglia have important roles in neuronal survival and programmed cell death. Synaptogenesis peaks postnatally and corresponds with astrogenesis. Further, glial dysfunction has been linked to numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including: autism spectrum disorder (Zhan et al., 2014; Squarzoni et al., 2014), schizophrenia (Ma et al., 2013; Zhan et al., 2014), Fragile-X syndrome (Jacobs et al., 2010; Higashimori et al., 2013), depression (Nishiyama et al., 2002), and obsessive compulsive disorder (Zhan et al., 2014). Glial dysfunction has also been linked to Rett syndrome (Maezawa et al., 2009), which manifests with respiratory deficits such as irregular breathing, hyperventilation and apneas (Katz et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2012; Ramirez et al., 2013). Thus, because we are only in the beginning stages of characterizing sex differences in neural development which may underlie increased male mortality, this remains an area of active investigation in our laboratory and othersâ. Should the reviewers feel this warrants additional discussion in the manuscript, we are happy to include it; but we have remained cognizant of increasing the length of the manuscript given that the reviewersâ felt it was already too long.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Was a dose response of LPS done in preliminary experiments? If not, why was the current dose of LPS chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose 1mg/kg LPS in our study based on our unpublished dose-response experiments. We found this to be the best dose where both neonatal mortality was minimal and inflammatory gene expression was transiently increased in both the neonatal medulla and cervical spinal cord, key respiratory control regions (see response 1 above for gene expression data). Our observations are also in line with inflammatory gene expression in other reports in neonates in both the medulla and spinal cord after 1 mg/kg LPS (Wang et al., 2006; Balan et al., 2011; Schwarz and Bilbo, 2011; Jafri et al., 2013), and are consistent with other experiments showing that higher LPS doses induce significant neonatal mortality (Blood-Siegfried et al., 2002; Rourke et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Did LPS exposure ever elicit an inflammatory response within the brains of these animals during the neonatal period? This would have been of interest to even know that the amount given ever elicited a central response.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, LPS did initiate CNS inflammation in the neonate, and specifically in the medulla and cervical spinal cord (see response #1 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What &quot;peripheral&quot; systems do the authors believe the early LPS exposure is modifying.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the lack of clarity on this point, and have revised the discussion accordingly. Since the anti-inflammatory ketoprofen restored Q-pathway-evoked plasticity even in the absence of detectable CNS inflammation in adults, our results suggest inflammatory signaling (either central and/or peripheral) contributes to plasticity deficits in adults after neonatal inflammation. We hypothesize that other inflammatory molecules not evaluated here, or inflammation in other important brain regions or peripheral tissues may be responsible for the lasting ketoprofen-sensitive inflammatory signaling undermining adult Q-pathway-evoked plasticity. RNA-Seq analyses are in progress to evaluate all inflammatory genes expressed.</p><p>âAdditionally, no obvious differences in astrocyte or microglial morphology in adult phrenic motor nuclei or the preBÃ¶tC were seen following neonatal LPS inflammation, suggesting other inflammatory mechanisms may be responsible for impairing adult pLTF.â Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Why did the authors choose ketoprofen vs other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or even steroids?</p></disp-quote><p>Ketoprofen has previously been used to restore respiratory motor plasticity after acute inflammatory stimuli in adult rats (Huxtable et al., 2013, Huxtable et al., 2015). Ketoprofen is a non-selective NSAID targeting both COX-1 and COX-2, as well as NF-ÎºB at the high doses used here (Cashman, 1996, Yin et al., 1998). Since acute inflammatory impairment of LTF in adults is COX-independent (Huxtable et al., 2018), we suggest that ketoprofen restores LTF either by inhibiting NF-ÎºB activation (and thus subsequent inflammatory gene activation) or by other COX-independent mechanisms. Glucocorticoids, on the other hand, are well-known to suppress BDNF expression, a molecule critical for Q-pathway-evoked pLTF. Thus, the use of steroidal anti-inflammatories would have precluded our ability to accurately interpret the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors also conclude that their data indicate that a persistent change in the adult inflammatory signaling contributes to the over findings since Ketoprofen restores the response. Does this imply that the S pathway is not the modified by inflammation? The authors never demonstrate that &quot;any inflammation&quot; (central or peripheral) exist in the animals What are the off target non-anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen? Is the difference between the effects of the ketoprofen on the Q and S pathway simply because a high enough dose wasn't used?</p></disp-quote><p>Please also see response to reviewer 2 #8 above. As discussed in our previous publications (Huxtable et al., 2015; Huxtable et al., 2018), ketoprofen is a potent and common anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent used in many species, including humans (Foster et al., 1988) and rats (Cabre et al., 1998). The dose of ketoprofen used here is nearly 8x the median effective dose in rats (CabrÃ© et al., 1998), so based on drug solubility and toxicity studies in other reports, higher doses are not feasible. The acute inflammation-independent nature of the S-pathway has been previously reported (Agosto-Marlin et al., 2017), so it follows that blocking acute inflammatory signaling in adults after neonatal inflammation would not restore LTF. We do not think the differential sensitivity of the Q and S pathways to inflammation are dependent on the ketoprofen dose, but rather, the lasting deficit in S-pathway plasticity is due to an astrocytic, adenosine-dependent mechanism (see response to reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Tissues were examined after the acute experiment was performed. Were tissues from LPS and saline exposed animals examined prior to the acute hypoxic experiments? Is it possible that the acute exposures may have modified the gene and protein expression pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>Tissues taken for gene expression analysis were taken from separate animals not used for neurophysiology experiments. However, tissues for immunohistochemistry experiments were taken at the end of the acute neurophysiology experiment because previous experiments by our group have shown no significant differences in inflammatory gene expression after AIH in CNS tissues (Smith et al., 2013). This practice is routine in our lab to reduce the total number of animals used. The methods now correctly reflect how tissues were used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The paper is quite long, and a lot of the findings show no difference between the groups; I think the figures could be reduced by 25%. There is also an excessive number of references.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a substantial amount of data in this manuscript. However, due to the complexity of groups (neonatal inflammation/saline, age, sex, and other treatments), we separated the figures based on the individual hypotheses being tested to reduce density in the figures and improve clarity. If the reviewer has suggestions regarding which figures could be combined or eliminated, we would be happy to re-evaluate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Not sure that is necessary for the authors to reference so many papers from their laboratory. There are an excessive number of references.</p></disp-quote><p>The references to our previous papers appear most in the Introduction and Materials and methods sections and were cited because they laid the foundation for the present study by establishing the acute effects of inflammation in adults. Additionally, much of the methodology used here has previously been used by our group, so to reduce reiterating previously published work, we instead direct readers to the previously published work. However, we have now removed redundant references in the Introduction and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The study &quot;A single bout of neonatal inflammation impairs adult respiratory motor plasticity in male and female rats&quot; by Hocker et al,. shows that a single application of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after birth produces a reduction of different forms of long-term facilitation (LTF), which can be reverted by ketoprofen, in some cases. The finding that early inflammation induces long-lasting effects on breathing plasticity agrees with a wide variety of findings showing that early inflammation induces long-lasting effects on a several brain circuits (Walker et al., 2003; Spencer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Kentner et al., 2010; Kirsten et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2015; Comim et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017; including the spinal cord; Walker et al., 2003; Li et al., 2010) and their plasticity (Walker et al., 2003; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Onufriev et al., 2017). Surprisingly, in contrast with other reports, the effects observed in this study did not correlate with changes in glia morphology (for contrast see: Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013; Lan et al., 2015) and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (for contrast see: Cai et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2013; Patil et al., 2016, Onufriev et al., 2017) or proinflammatory mediators (for contrast see: Spencer et al., 2006; Kentner et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2013; Lunardelli et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2015; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017). I consider the findings to be relevant, but also partially similar to the already described changes in other circuits of the brain by the same experimental manipulation (Walker et al., 2003;Spencer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Kentner et al., 2010; Kirsten et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2015; Comim et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017). On the other hand, the mechanisms behind the findings of the present study are still foggy, since it is not clear what is the source of the inflammatory and the non-inflammatory signals involved in the described effects. Considering the contradictory evidence already available (Walker et al., 2003;Spencer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Kentner et al., 2010; Kirsten et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Cai et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Rideau Batista Novais et al., 2014; Lan et al., 2015; Comim et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2016; Onufriev et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; RÃ©us et al., 2017), the clarification of the mechanisms involved in the modulation described in this work would contribute to the relevance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and the description of our work in the context of the neuroscience field. We agree that aspects of our results are similar to results in other CNS circuits, however, this is the first demonstration of such changes in a vital homeostatic circuit. Neural circuitry involved in respiratory control must adapt continuously to maintain homeostatic conditions, and plasticity is thought to play a key role. Failure of plasticity in this circuitry could have dire consequences, perhaps even explaining the increased mortality in males after neonatal LPS. While we are not making such broad speculations here, our results are novel and distinct in three ways:</p><p>1) Unlike much literature on early life events, we demonstrate profound lasting effects after just <underline>one</underline> neonatal stimulus. Other studies demonstrate alterations in adulthood after a second, adult stimulus (Bilbo and Schwarz, 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Bilbo, 2010; Kirsten et al., 2010, 2011; Roughton et al., 2013).</p><p>2) This is the first demonstration of abolition of S-pathway induced respiratory plasticity, which has been proposed to act as a âback-up pathwayâ to preserve plasticity in the face of inflammation. Thus, we hypothesize that early life inflammatory events represent the most significant perturbation of the respiratory plasticity. Further, we now provide additional mechanistic details about S-pathway abolishment by neonatal inflammation, and suggest astrocyte signaling is permanently impaired after neonatal inflammation (see response to #3).</p><p>3) While our data are consistent with increased male vulnerability early in life, we are the first to characterize female responses. Assessment of respiratory control in females and female respiratory motor plasticity fills a major gap in knowledge and directly addresses the NIH research priority for sex differences. The role of sex hormones in respiratory control remains in its infancy (Behan and Kinkead, 2011). Critical periods for sex hormone action exist during development; high testosterone in young males, and fluctuations of estrogen and progesterone in post-pubescent females are normal changes in hormones during development. Yet interactions between an environmental stimulus (like inflammation) and sex/hormonal differences during these critical periods are poorly understood. Neonatal maternal separation elicits a stress response with sexspecific effects and lasting consequences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, baseline breathing, and chemosensivity, with males showing greater susceptibility (Genest et al., 2004).</p><p>Yet despite the longstanding âBarker Hypothesisâ (developmental origins of adult disease) (Barker and Osmond, 1986; Barker, 2002) and other calls to explore the effects of neonatal events on respiratory control (Behan and Kinkead, 2011), our studies represent the first step to fill this gap in knowledge.</p><p>Determining how neonatal inflammation impairs the respiratory system will elucidate links between neonatal conditions and adult respiratory insufficiency, leading to better treatments to promote breathing at all age groups. Our study has implications for understanding these long-term deficiencies and will facilitate identification of location(s) within the complex respiratory neural circuitry this deficiency occurs. Previous studies (Rosen et al., 2003; Hibbs et al., 2008; Raynes-Greenow et al., 2012) were correlative, and provided important additions to the scientific premise for the present work; but this is the first to <underline>directly</underline> test the involvement of neonatal inflammation on respiratory circuitry and specific cell types in the CNS.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Hocker et al., has important implications. Many babies are exposed to inflammatory events early during their development, and due to an improved healthcare, these babies mostly survive and recover. Yet, it is unclear whether this recovery is complete, and whether even in the absence of any acute inflammation there are long-term consequences on respiratory control. The present study addresses this important issue employing an established rodent model that uses respiratory plasticity in the phrenic nerve as a well-defined respiratory output.</p><p>This manuscript is a resubmission of a previously reviewed manuscript, and the authors performed additional experiments to address several of the reviewers' original comments. Their new experiments shed new light on the potential involvement of astrocytes (as it relates to the S-pathway in case of severe AIH). The authors also added new experimental data indicating distinct differences between the impairment of Q and S-pathways caused by neonatal inflammation. These are major revisions to the previous manuscript â which is particularly remarkable since such developmental studies consume considerable time.</p><p>The authors also added a discussion of the importance of acute intermittent hypoxia in the context of spinal cord injury and the therapeutic application for motor neuron disease. The authors emphasize the important implication in particular that the application of AIH could be undermined by early inflammatory experiences.</p><p>The authors also included a table from a separate study that describes in detail the inflammatory gene data that are associated with the LPS induced inflammation. However, it makes sense that these data are not included in the present study â because they are published elsewhere. However, these data were helpful for evaluating the findings of the present study, because their careful characterization confirms that there is impairment of respiratory activity even though the inflammatory gene responses have returned to baseline.</p><p>This leads to the important conclusion that the observed loss of plasticity is unlikely due to an ongoing inflammation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers concluded that no additional experiments will be required. However, some concerns remained unaddressed, and need to be carefully addressed in the revision.</p><p>1) The authors should include a limitation section that discusses the experimental approach: in particular whether their findings can be translated to a fully integrated/ intact model animal or human. Regardless of how the model might allow one to dissect out pathways that underlie pLTF, if the whole purpose of the reflex is to maintain ventilation to compensate for hypoxia, then it is still important to demonstrate that the findings are relevant to ventilation in intact, unanesthetized animals. Please address what the findings mean behaviorally, if they are transmitted to the muscles of respiration?</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewers for their comments. We have now included a limitation section in the Discussion section addressing the potential impact to adult animals and humans. While we are still understanding the exact physiological role of respiratory plasticity, the ability for the respiratory system to adapt and learn is critical for maintaining homeostasis. Our results suggest at least two pathways associated with learning in the respiratory system are impaired following just one bout of early life inflammation. This suggests the respiratory system is likely more vulnerable in adulthood. We have added a more thorough discussion of the physiological implications and limitations of our findings:</p><p>âOur experimental approach assessed phrenic nerve output in anesthetized rats and may not be generalizable to respiratory control in freely behaving animals or to other forms of motor plasticity. In humans, AIH induces long-term facilitation of ventilation (Mateika and Komnenov, 2017) and strengthens corticospinal pathways to non-respiratory motor-neurons (Christiansen et al., 2018), suggesting our results likely have relevance to mechanisms of human spinal motor plasticity after AIH. While AIH-induced respiratory motor plasticity does not necessarily alter normal homeostatic control of ventilation, the general facilitation of spinal motor output has significant therapeutic potential for treating patients with respiratory and non-respiratory motor limitations (Trumbower et al., 2012, 2017; Nichols et al., 2013; Hayes et al., 2014).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We suggest reducing the number of figures with negative findings, and instead include a table showing what is different between the groups, which pathway is implicated, and the gender effects. The table would allow the reader to get a better conceptual view of all the many variables that are being assessed in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>To improve the clarity of our results, we have reorganized and consolidated figures. As we did not find sex differences in Q-pathway or S-pathway evoked motor plasticity, and the only sex difference in response to neonatal inflammation was the acute neonatal male mortality, we feel a table is not necessary. We have removed two figures and reorganized the Results section to further streamline the manuscript. Figure 9 and Figure 10 showing no changes in preBÃ¶tC and cervical spinal glial morphology have been combined into one figure (now Figure 8). The previous Figure 8, showing phrenic nerve responses to hypoxia, has been converted to a table (Table 1) and moved to the end of the Results section. Additionally, we have combined male and female inflammatory gene expression data since no sex differences in respiratory plasticity were evident and to reduce the number of figures showing negative data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Abstract is very short and not very informative. The age of the animal at the time of the exposure and the age of the animals when the pLTF was assessed is not included. Moreover, there are sex differences that also are not specified in the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewers for their comments. We have revised the Abstract to include additional information; however, we are confined by the <italic>eLife</italic> limit of 150 words.</p><p>No sex differences were found in any primary outcomes mentioned in the abstract. The sex-differences in neonatal mortality after acute LPS exposure is a relevant finding and may importantly relate to male-specific human mortality; however, the abstract length limitation does not allow adequate discussion of this finding. Our revised Abstract is below.</p><p>âNeonatal inflammation is common and has lasting consequences for adult health. We investigated the lasting effects of a single bout of neonatal inflammation on adult respiratory control in the form of respiratory motor plasticity induced by acute intermittent hypoxia, which likely compensates and stabilizes breathing during injury or disease and has significant therapeutic potential. Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation at postnatal day four induced lasting impairments in two distinct pathways to adult respiratory plasticity in male and female rats. Despite a lack of adult pro-inflammatory gene expression or alterations in glial morphology, one mechanistic pathway to plasticity was restored by acute, adult anti-inflammatory treatment, suggesting ongoing inflammatory signaling after neonatal inflammation. An alternative pathway to plasticity was not restored by anti-inflammatory treatment, but was evoked by exogenous adenosine receptor agonism, suggesting upstream impairment, likely astrocytic-dependent. Thus, the respiratory control network is vulnerable to early-life inflammation, limiting respiratory compensation to adult disease or injury.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In their response, the authors have clearly indicated the novelty of their relevant findings, in contrast to the wealth of evidence regarding the long-term consequences of early-life inflammation. Which, by the way, was clear in the original submission. However, we think that it is still necessary to carefully deal with the fact that among those published effects there is a long-lasting change in astrocytes and microglia as well as in their inflammatory mediators. Since these changes were not observed in the submitted study, the authors should include a proper discussion of the source of these differences and they should discuss the alternative mechanisms that could potentially be involved. The authors have shown several aspects that are not involved in their novel findings, which we agree is very important. The authors have also included a set of experiments that indirectly indicate that the astrocytic function could be affected by early-life inflammation, but this needs to be carefully discussed. We agree with the authors that although indirect, these experiments hint that astrocytes could have been changed by early-life inflammation. What we would like to see in the revision is that the authors discuss future experiments or avenues that could more directly address their observations.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewers for their comments and interest in our study. Similar to other findings, we found no changes in adult inflammatory gene expression after neonatal LPS-induced inflammation. However, a few reports (Boisse et al., 2005; Kentner et al., 2010) have identified region and sex specific changes in adult CNS inflammation, which have been added to the Discussion section. Other perinatal stimuli with associated inflammatory signaling, such as maternal care and maternal diet, do have lasting programming effects, but are more complex stimuli than the neonatal inflammation in this study. Neonatal inflammation alone does prime glial responses to adult stimuli (Burke et al., 2016), but does not alter baseline inflammatory gene expression, consistent with the findings presented here. We have added additional detail on this to the Discussion section. Further, we also now include mention of our ongoing studies examining cell-specific changes to adult microglia and astrocytes, which we hypothesize will ultimately identify how neonatal inflammation impairs adult, respiratory plasticity (Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
